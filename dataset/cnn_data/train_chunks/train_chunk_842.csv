"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A team of 'Titanicologists' have solved what is considered to be one of the last great mysteries - or hoaxes - of the doomed luxury liner, over a century after it sank. A woman who claimed to be the presumed-dead two-year-old daughter of a wealthy family that died on Titanic in 1912 has been exposed as a fraud following extensive DNA tests. Helen Kramer first came forward in 1940 claiming to be Loraine Allison, a toddler traveling with her parents Hudson and Bess and seven-month-old brother Trevor on the ship. Hudson Allison was a Canadian entrepreneur and the family traveled with an extensive entourage of servants. Solved: Helen Kramer first came forward in 1940 claiming to be the presumed-dead daughter of Hudson and Bess Allison, Lorraine Allison, who was two-years-old when she is believed to have died on Titanic. Now over 70 years later, the claims have been debunked through DNA tests . When the ship struck the iceberg, Trevor, who was not with his family at the time, was taken onto a lifeboat by a maid, Alice Cleaver, with both going on to survive. Both mother and father and Loraine are believed to have died looking for Trevor and skipping their opportunities at being rescued. Trevor then died in 1929 of ptomaine poisoning. Kramer mounted a long campaign to be accepted by the surviving members of the wealthy Allison family in the face of strong opposition, The Telegraph reported. The bitter dispute was expected to have ended in 1992 when Kramer died. But it was revived on the centenary of the sinking in 2012 when Kramer’s granddaughter, Debrina Woods, from Florida, restated the claim on a series of forums dedicated to the Titanic. She set up a website highlighting her claim and said she planned to write a book about the story. She claimed she had found a suitcase belonging to her grandmother which was full of documents substantiating the family case. She also tried to contact the Allison family and arrange a visit, prompting the intervention of their lawyers to ask her to cease. Iceberg, right ahead: The Titanic struck this iceberg on April 14, 1912 and sank. Helen Kramer claimed to have survived the sinking and be a member of a wealthy family on board that died . A restraining order was taken out to stop Ms Woods scattering her grandmother’s ashes over the Allison family plot in Chesterville, Ontario, with extra security measures put in place after she paid a visit to the area. If her claim was established, Woods would have been eligible to inherit much of the Allison family wealth. The debate led to the founding of the Loraine Allison Identification Project by Tracy Oost, a forensic scientist at Laurentian University in Canada and a Titanic researcher. Oost and some other 'Titanicologists' - as they have come to be known - asked both sides to take part in a screening of their Mitochondrial DNA, which passes through the maternal line. Sally Kirkelie, the great niece of Loraine’s mother, agreed to take part. Woods declined, but her half sister, Deanne Jennings, who shared the same mother and same link to Helen Kramer, agreed. The tests revealed no genetic link between Kramer or Woods and the Allison family, exposing the decades-long mystery as nothing but a great hoax. The results are proof of what the Allison family have long suspected to be true. 'The Allison's never accepted Mrs Kramer’s claim, but the stress it caused was real,' said David Allison, grandson of Hudson's brother Percy Allison. 'It forced my ancestors to relive painful memories described to me as immeasurable sorrow and unending grief. 'I would like to thank Deanne Jennings and Sally Kirkelie for offering their DNA to stop this harassment. This was a courageous, selfless act, and I will remain forever indebted for their act of kindness.' Copy of the front page of the New York Times dated April 16, 1912 . Nancy Bergman, a sister of David’s, said: 'These DNA results have uncovered a colossal fraud that has haunted my family for years. It was all about the money …. Debrina wants to write a book and no doubt there are others out there who want to profit from our story. It is our story. Leave us in peace.' Prof Oost said: 'It is good to have a resolution here, but we mustn’t forget that this is all about one of the more tragic of tales to come from the Titanic. The only mystery that remains now is who was Helen Kramer.' Kramer first appeared on a radio show called 'We, the People', claiming to have been saved on Titanic at the last minute by her 'father' Hudson Allison, who she said put her in a lifeboat with a man called 'Mr Hyde'. She said she was raised in England believing Mr Hyde was her father. She said Mr Hyde told her truth after she requested her birth certificate and shortly before his death, at which point they had moved to the US. Kramer said Mr Hyde also disclosed his real identity: Thomas Andrews, who had been Titanic’s designer and builder and who was thought to have died in the sinking. Further investigation suggests Kramer was actually raised in Michigan as Evangline Irene Lee Hyde. However Woods, 61, a retired chef, is standing by her claims. She declined to comment on the DNA results, but said she had her own DNA evidence and the support of other members of the Allison family. The results, she said, will be revealed in a book she is currently writing. The project echoes the exposure of a similar bogus claim, made by Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. After her death, DNA research proved there was no genetic link between the woman and the family.","Woman called Helen Kramer first came forward in 1940 claiming to be Lorraine Allison, a two-year-old who died on the Titanic in 1912 along with her wealthy parents, Hudson and Bess .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Susie Wolff smiled and gave a thumbs-up as she began her symbolic journey at Silverstone. But, after just one timed lap, the first woman to participate in a grand prix weekend for 22 years ground to a halt. An engine problem forced her Williams out of the first practice session — an anti-climax after all the hoopla surrounding the merits of her involvement. All over: Wolff was forced to retire from the first practice session after an engine failure in her Williams . Out: Williams' Susie Wolff was massively disappointed with the way she retired in the opening practice . History: The 31-year-old became the first female driver to step into an F1 cockpit during a grand prix weekend . Wolff, 31, was not scheduled to drive in the second session so that was the end of her British Grand Prix. She is, however, due to drive in practice at Hockenheim, Germany in a fortnight. ‘It is a massive disappointment,’ she said. ‘On the plus side, we had such a good build-up to this weekend. Obviously, I had put so much hard work in to get ready for today and I knew exactly what I had to do on every lap. Sad end: Marshals remove the car of Scottish driver Wolff after an oil-pressure problem . Go again: Wolff will be handed another chance at the wheel of the WIlliams in practice for the German GP . Dramatic: Williams teammate Felipe Massa crashed out in a rather more spectacular way during practice . Getting carried away: Massa's car is removed from the track but Williams managed to repair it quickly . ‘It felt good — even the out lap —but that is racing. I have known from over the years that there can be massive ups and massive downs. ‘It is very, very disappointing, but I have still got Hockenheim and I have to go out and show what I can do because I did not get the chance to do that today.’ Her misfortune was less dramatic than that of Williams’ other driver, Felipe Massa. He lost control at Stowe and crashed at 130mph, leaving his machine a mangled mess. Both cars were repaired in time for the second session.","British driver made history as first F1 woman in 22 years .

"By . Katy Winter . Britain is well known for being a nation of animal lovers and now a new concept from the east is set to enable the cat-lovers amongst us to take their obsession to a new level. The first ever ‘cat café’ is set to open in London later this year if enough funding can be raised on the crowd funding site indiegogo.com. A cat café is essentially a normal café; serving sandwiches, cakes teas and coffees, the only difference being it is filled with cats, which roam the café freely for you to pet and play with. Scroll down for video . Puuurfect: A customer relaxes in a Cat cafe in Chongqing, China, but Londoners may soon be able to do the same if Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium opens . Feline fine: Lauren Pears explains that 'cat welfare is really important to us and we want to choose cats that will be happy in the environment that has lots of people in it' Paws for thought: Customers at cat cafes can interact with the cats, petting and stroking them, as they eat and drink . Already hugely popular in Taiwan, China and Japan, there are about 100 cat cafés in Tokyo already. The brains behind bringing this feline phenomenon to the UK is Lauren Pears. Lauren points out: ‘If something exists you can probably get it in London, but there’s one thing that lots of people living in London can’t have – a kitty. ‘We thought long and hard about who would really benefit from having a cat café in London. 'I see commuters walking on their way to and from the station stopping to pet the neighbourhood cats, and since I am unable to own a cat myself due to my current flat and long hours I understand the desire to have a cat around.' Cat cafes have been a massive hit in the east with hundreds now open in China, Japan and Taiwan . Feline Friends: Both cat and customer feel pampered and loved in a cat cafe . The café is aimed at the vast number of office workers who have landlords that don’t allow pets, small living quarters and long working hours and who may pine for a cat companion but are unable to own one. While it would also undoubtedly be a hit with tourists, novelty seekers and parents with small children. Furry nice: As a nation of cat lovers, a cat cafe would allow those who can't own a pet to have contact and play with felines whenever they liked . Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium would have an opulent Victorian decor to help both customers and kitties relax in the height of luxury. Their website explains the concept behind the café: ‘It's not just about being able to play with the cats. It's about the whole experience: a small indulgence, a place to forget about your day and unwind. It's about coming in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book, and a cat.’ But what about the furry stars at the centre of the cat café - the cats themselves? Lauren says: ‘Cat welfare is really important to us. In particular, we want to make sure we can house cats who don't have a home to go to. King of the cafe: The cats would be specially chosen to ensure they enjoy human company, and the cafe would provide a home to cats who don't have one . ‘We're also working with the Mayhew Animal Home to choose cats that will be happy in the environment that has lots of people in it, and we're working with them to define a really solid care plan to make sure they're cared for.’ Indiegogo.com is an international crowd funding site which uses social media to raise money for various innovative ideas. So far the campaign has raise £3,291 out of the £108,000 needed to get the café off the ground. They have just 44 days left to raise the remaining funds or they won’t receive any of the money contributed.","Cat cafes are hugely popular in Asia - there are 100 in Tokyo alone .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has argued against paying the benefits witheld under the back-to-work scheme . The taxpayer faces paying £130million in benefits to people who refused to work for free. A government back-to-work scheme withdrew benefits from people if they did not take up placements in shops and offices to improve their employability. After legal flaws were discovered in the scheme, the government passed retrospective laws shore it up. But the emergency laws have been torn up by the High Court because it could breach their human rights. The legislation was drawn up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith after the government was taken to court by a woman who refused to take a role in Poundland. The taxpayer now faces a £130million bill for benefits denied to thousands of claimants for refusing to work, after a judge today ruled the retrospective laws were ‘incompatible’ with the European Convention on Human Rights. The legal battle was sparked by University graduate Cait Reilly, 24, from Birmingham, who challenged having to work for free at a local Poundland discount store. Last year the government lost in a Supreme Court bid to overturn an earlier ruling that regulations underpinning the schemes were invalid. New laws were then passed to overcome flaws identified by three appeal judges in the Poundland case and to block any attempt to claw back lost benefits. Mrs Justice Lang, sitting at the High Court in London, ruled the retrospective legislation interfered with the 'right to a fair trial' under Article 6 (1) of the convention. Welfare minister Lord Freud's warned repaying benefits withheld unlawfully would be 'an undeserved windfall' for claimants – a claim rejected by the judge. Human rights lawyers said the judgement was a 'damning assessment' and, if upheld on appeal, could lead to some £130 million having to be paid out to thousands of jobseeker's allowance claimants denied benefits under the schemes. Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers (PIL), said: 'This case is another massive blow to this Government's flawed and tawdry attempts to make poor people on benefits work for companies, who already make massive profits, for free. 'Last year the Supreme Court told Iain Duncan Smith and the coalition Government that the scheme was unlawful. 'In this case the High Court has now told the Government that the attempt to introduce retrospective legislation, after the DWP had lost in the Court of Appeal, is unlawful and a breach of the Human Rights Act and is a further disgraceful example of how far this Government is prepared to go to flout our constitution and the rule of law. 'I call on the DWP to ensure that the £130 million of benefits unlawfully withheld from the poorest section of our society is now repaid.' The legal battle was triggered by a scheme where jobseekers were told to work for free in  Poundland store to gain work experience . Cait Reilly, 24, from Birmingham,  challenged having to work for free at a local Poundland discount store . A DWP spokesman said the Government would appeal. He said: 'We're pleased the court recognised that if claimants do not play by the rules and meet their conditions to do all they can to look for work and get a job, we can stop their benefits. That is only right. 'However, we disagree with the judgment on the legislation and are disappointed. It was discussed, voted on and passed by Parliament. 'While this applies to only a minority of past cases and does not affect the day to day business of our Jobcentres, we think this is an important point and will appeal.' The new legislation found incompatible with human rights laws is the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013. But it remains in force and benefits will not be repaid pending an appeal. The DWP spokesman said: 'The 2013 Act remains in force. There is no change to the operation of our schemes from the outcome of the High Court today. 'We will continue to help people back in to work and we will not be repaying any sanctions pending our appeal.' In her ruling, Mrs Justice Lang said jobseekers Ms Reilly and Daniel Hewstone were both in receipt of jobseekers allowance - 'a subsistence level benefit payable to persons actively seeking employment'. At the time of their claiming, it was £56.80 a week for those aged 16-24 and £71.70 for those aged 25 and over. Under the Jobseekers Allowance (Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme) Regulations 2011 claimants were required to take part in a variety of unpaid 'work for your benefit' schemes. The retrospective creation of criminal offences and imposition of heavier penalties was prohibited under both international and domestic law, said the judge. But human rights laws recognised that retrospective legislation 'outside the criminal sphere' might be justified in the public interest.","High Court rules emergency laws breach the right to a fiar trial .

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Aap . Former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett offered to help Gina Rinehart 'in any way' just months before she asked him to convince her daughter - his former girlfriend - to end their legal stoush. In an email sent by Australia's richest person on November 25, Mrs Rinehart said how great it had been to see Hackett, who dated Bianca Rinehart, again at a university ceremony. In a reply obtained by The Daily Telegraph, just 20 minutes later, Hackett said how it had been 'wonderful' to see Mrs Rinehart again. Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett offered to help Gina Rinehart 'in any way' just months before she asked him to persuade her daughter to end their multi-billion dollar legal fight . The former swimmer added that he always admired the mining magnate's 'work ethic and resilience' and he had often thought of her and Bianca over the years. 'Please let me know if I can ever assist or help in anyway,' he wrote. Gina Rinehart is Australia's richest person, but has been embroiled in a long running feud with some of her children over the trust . But as the Rinehart family feud escalated, Mrs Rinehart reached out to Hackett just six months later when she asked him to talk to his former flame Bianca about withdrawing her trustee nomination. Earlier in the week the Supreme Court heard how Hackett had forwarded the email to Bianca . As part of the hearing into who should beome trustee of the $5 billion trust, the email was evidence tendered to court. The hearing will determine who controls the 23.4 per cent share of Hancock Prospecting. On Wednesday, the court heard one-time politician Jeff Kennett declined a position as a trustee of the $5 billion Hancock trust. Mr Kennett was asked in an October 17, 2013 email sent to Equity Trustees directors whether he was 'known favourably to the (Rinehart) family matriarch'. 'We didn't know what the nature of the association was,' Equity Trustees national manager Stephen Hardy told the NSW Supreme Court. 'Mr Kennett got a call from Gina or someone asking him to do it.' Mr Kennett declined the offer but emailed that Equity Trustees should apply. 'This would be a wonderful commission if we were able to secure it,' he wrote. In contrast, his fellow Equity Trustees director Robin Burns was keen. He proposed to 'be the meat in the family sandwich [and] I jealously ask that the role be kept for me,' the court heard in tendered documents. Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett was asked to be the trustee of the $5 billion Hancock trust but turned down the role, a Sydney court was told on Wednesday . Lawyer Gary Reardon, whose firm was nominated as trustees by Ginia Rinehart, who has taken her mother's side against her three siblings, gave evidence on Wednesday. Christopher Withers, lawyer for Bianca Rinehart and her brother John Hancock, accused Mr Reardon of not knowing anything about the trust, despite asking for more than $1 million in fees. Mr Reardon also wanted to charge $300 per hour for work outside normal duties. He disagreed the fees were excessive. The court heard he only asked whether the trust's assets were inert and how often the beneficiaries would meet before nominating a $275,000 establishment fee and an $825,000 annual management charge. 'They were the two matters that helped fill in some gaps,' Mr Reardon said. The court heard the trust paid about $2.1 million annually to the beneficiaries and while he had not managed other trusts worth its $5 billion value, Mr Reardon said he would act 'as a prudent and diligent trustee' if given the job.

"By . Marc Nicol . and Nick Constable . Scotland Yard is investigating claims made by a former soldier in connection with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Days before confirming they had identified new ‘persons of interest’, officers from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command contacted the Army seeking information about Peter Verran. While Mr Verran has not been accused of any wrongdoing, the timing is significant. Questions: Madeline McCann before her disappearance in 2007 and former Guardsman Petter Verran . Sources close to the McCanns say the family also want to speak to Mr Verran about his whereabouts at the time Madeleine was snatched from the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007. Ex-Guardsman Mr Verran first came to the attention of police in 2009 when he emerged to dispute the alibi of British child abuser Raymond Hewlett, 64. Mr Verran first came to the attention of police in 2009 when he emerged to dispute the alibi of British child abuser Raymond Hewlett . Hewlett was living in the Algarve just an hour’s drive from where the youngster disappeared. However, in publicly pointing the . finger at Hewlett, who denied abducting Madeleine, Mr Verran apparently . neglected to mention the disappearance of his own camper van within . months of Madeleine’s disappearance, or the fact he had been in . Portugal. Those details, disclosed in documents . held by the Royal British Legion, show he sought emergency funds from . the organisation after claiming his van and all his possessions had been . stolen. The documents also reveal he travelled through Portugal. When Mr Verran came forward, he was . interviewed by Leicestershire Police, and by private investigators . working for the McCanns, as an informant. Mr Verran told of a conversation he had with Hewlett in September 2007 after they met at a Moroccan campsite. Hewlett admitted to owning a white . Transit-style van around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance – the van . was similar to one seen parked near the Ocean Club. Hewlett, who died in 2010, said in a newspaper interview that a blue Dodge truck was his only vehicle at the time. A . source close to the McCanns said Mr Verran made no mention of his . camper van being stolen, or the time he spent in Portugal, to private . detectives working for the family. It is not known what the former . soldier told police. Waste Scrubland in Tavira, Portugal, where suspect Raymond Hewlett stayed at in 2007, at the same time Madeline McCann was abducted in Playa da Luz, 1 hours drive away . ‘We’d . like Mr Verran to explain these omissions from his interviews with us, . and say when he was in Portugal,’ said the source. ‘It is potentially . interesting that this information has now emerged and we will be . discussing this development with police.’ Earlier this month, Scotland Yard . detectives approached the Army seeking to establish the whereabouts of . 50-year-old Mr Verran’s military records. How she could look: This impression of how Madeline McCann might appear now was released last year . A source close to the probe said: ‘There is almost certainly an innocent explanation behind the theft of Mr Verran’s van and his journeys through Portugal and Morocco. 'But he challenged Hewlett’s version of events without seemingly admitting he, too, was in Portugal, or that his only method of transport vanished.’ The Met would not confirm officers had sought Mr Verran’s Army records. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment.","While former guardsman Peter Verran has not been accused of any wrongdoing, the timing is significant .

"By . Simon  Parry . Fears were growing last night that a passenger jet which vanished from the sky with 239  people on board was the target of a terrorist attack. The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200 was brought down by a ‘sudden, catastrophic event’ with no time for a Mayday call, a senior aviation source in Kuala Lumpur told The Mail on Sunday. Two of the passengers appeared to be travelling on  stolen passports. Panic: Relatives of passengers on board the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200 which was brought down by a 'sudden, catastrophic event' with no time for a Mayday call . There were suspicions that yesterday’s incident marked a new escalation in the terror campaign by separatist Muslim Uighurs, who want their region of Xinjiang in western China to have greater autonomy from the Chinese government. The majority of passengers on the flight from Malaysia to China were Chinese, with 13 other nationalities represented. The plane vanished from radar screens off the coast of southern Vietnam early yesterday, sparking a huge air and sea search. Two large oil slicks were reportedly seen in the South China Sea late yesterday near the spot where flight MH370 is believed to have plunged into the water two hours into its journey from the Malaysian capital. The search was due to resume at first light today. Speaking in Kuala Lumpur, a senior civil aviation source told The Mail on Sunday it was ‘incomprehensible’ that the plane, which has an outstanding safety record, would have disappeared without warning. ‘Even if both engines failed, there would have been time for a Mayday call,’ the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ‘There was obviously a sudden, catastrophic event that brought this plane out of the sky. There could have been an explosion and we can’t rule out sabotage or an act of terrorism. ‘That the pilots were unable to send a distress signal lends  credence to this theory. ‘If it were an engine failure, bad weather or air turbulence, the pilots would have had time to put out an emergency call. That didn’t happen. ‘That’s why the possibility of an explosive or hijacker on MH370 cannot be discounted.’ The majority of passengers on the flight from Malaysia to China were Chinese, with 13 other nationalities represented . A second civil aviation source confirmed the belief that terrorism or sabotage was thought to be behind the disaster and said members of the plane’s maintenance crew were having their backgrounds examined. International experts added further weight to the terrorism theory. In the UK, David Learmount, operations and safety  editor at aviation website Flightglobal, said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the pilots did not make a distress call. They would have had ‘plenty of time’ to report any technical problems, Mr Learmount said, adding: ‘Something happened and the pilots did not tell anyone. Why?’ Boeing 777s are regarded as among the world’s safest aircraft with only one fatal passenger accident – a crash-landing which killed three people in San Francisco last year – in nearly 20 years of service. Fears that a terror attack caused the disaster were heightened when a list of passengers released by Beijing police reportedly had two names pixellated out, leading to online speculation they might have been ethnic Uighurs. Later, it emerged that two passengers were travelling on stolen passports belonging to nationals from Austria and Italy. Asked whether terrorism was suspected, Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said authorities had ‘no information, but we are looking at all possibilities’. Uighurs have been behind increasingly brazen attacks on China including a car bomb atrocity in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square last October that killed five people and injured dozens more. A mass stabbing at a  railway station in the southern Chinese town of Kunming on March 1 that left 28 people dead and 113 injured is also believed to have been linked to unrest  in Xinjiang.","The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200 was brought down by a 'sudden, catastrophic event' with no time for a Mayday call, Mail on Sunday told .

"By . Peter Campbell . Apple faced fury last night after it was revealed that it paid just £11.4million in British corporation tax last year – despite sales of a record £10.5billion. The US technology giant rakes in billions selling its high-end gadgets but funnels its sales through Ireland to minimise its UK tax bill. Yesterday MPs said the practice, which is also used by Google, was ‘less than honest’ and called on the company to pay more. The US technology giant rakes in billions selling its high-end gadgets but funnels its sales through Ireland to minimise its UK tax bill . Last year, Apple was hauled in front of the US Senate to account for its American tax affairs. It has even been criticised by its own shareholders for hoarding £87billion in offshore accounts – again to avoid tax. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘It is completely outrageous. Everybody knows that they manipulate their financial accounts so that they don’t pay tax on the profits they make here. ‘It’s disappointing that the UK Government isn’t as assertive as governments elsewhere over what are obviously less than honest ways of accounting for the money they make.’ Apple’s 2013 corporation tax payment of £11.4million is even lower than what it paid two years ago, show accounts published yesterday at Companies House. In 2011, it paid £13.6million. Apple UK Limited, its sales and marketing arm, last year recorded sales of £100million and profits of £41.5million. Staff in Apple’s sales arm also enjoyed an 11 per cent pay rise last year, documents show. The average salary per employee rose from £110,000 in 2012 to £122,000 last year. Its retail division Apple Retail UK . Ltd, which runs its 37 high street stores, posted £900million in revenue . but only a profit of £18million. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: 'It is completely outrageous. Everybody knows they manipulate their financial accounts so they don't pay tax on the profits they make here' But the true figure for its UK sales – . and therefore its profits – is more than ten times higher than either . figure. Although Apple never discloses the exact amount, analysts say 10 per cent of its global sales are in Britain – which would add up to an astonishing £10.5billion. John O’Connell, director of TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Our tax code is over 17,000 pages long, so it’s small wonder that those who can afford expensive advice will always be able to cut their bills. 'If politicians are serious about closing these loopholes they should stop grandstanding and simplify taxes.’ A spokesman for Apple said last night it is ‘extremely proud’ of its ‘many contributions to the British economy’ and ‘as always, we pay every pound of tax we owe’.","Apple paid £11.4m in British corporation tax last year despite sales of £10b .

"By . Daniel Bates . Updated: . 08:13 EST, 17 February 2012 . Gordon Ramsay has suffered his own Kitchen Nightmare after being ditched by his flagship restaurant in Canada after just six months. The celebrity chef has been accused of being ‘too busy’ to meet his obligations to the Laurier Gordon Ramsay in Montreal. He reportedly ‘just didn’t get’ their vision and has not been seen at the restaurant since August. Gordon Ramsay is suing his former flagship restaurant in Canada for £1.7million . Danny Lavy, the owner of the 75-year-old rotisserie, has revealed that he is counter-suing Ramsay in a U.S. court over a separate matter. After his meteoric rise to fame, it's been a difficult few years for TV chef Gordon Ramsey. He reportedly paid his father-in-law £2million to end a long-running . row over his business.The pair went their separate way . after Ramsay accused Chris Hutcheson of taking money out of parent company . Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH). He was even seen in an awkward QVC pitch, as he tried to sell the 'Nonstick Hard Anodized Dishwasher Safe 10-piece Cookware Set'. Ramsay's fiscal situation hasn't been as healthy as it once was in the last few years, after he paid off a a tax debt in 2009 relating to his Plane Food restaurant at Heathrow’s Terminal 5. The father-of-four recently closed two eateries in Australia, waving goodbye to Maze and Maze Grill in Melbourne’s Crown Metropol Hotel. Further troubles include a £1.1million court battle in New Zealand after pulling out of a number of charity engagements, citing personal reasons . Even wife Tana tried to help pocket some cash after agreeing to star on the fifth series of British Dancing On Ice, but soap star Hayley Tamaddon triumphed as the winner. In 2008, Sarah Symonds claimed she had an affair with Ramsay after after they met in a London nightclub, and he told her that her his marriage was in trouble. In an ironic echo of his TV series, . the Laurier owners also claimed he Ramsay was clueless about food their . diners wanted and tried to axe popular dishes. Danny . Lavy, the owner of the 75-year-old rotisserie, said that he has ended . the contract and is in the process of taking down the words ‘Gordon . Ramsay’ from the sign outside the building.

"By . Julian Robinson . A teacher stole more than £22,000 from his own wife just months after marrying her - in order to fund his gambling addiction. Timothy Jones, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, has been jailed after plundering the bank account of his new bride Jo, 41, by using two of her credit cards behind her back. She only found out about the fraud when she gave him a hug and felt a large roll of banknotes in his back pocket, a court heard. Timothy Jones, left, stole more than £22,000 from his new bride Jo Jones, right by using two of her credit cards behind her back . With her suspicions aroused, she then tried to check her bank account while out shopping in December last year and found a balance of just £91. Her 48-year-old husband had also changed all her online passwords in order to pocket her hard-earned cash, Staffordshire Crown Court was told. Heartbroken Mrs Jones, a primary school teacher, then confronted her husband who came clean about his addiction to gambling at the bookies on gaming machines. Now he is waking up behind bars after admitting three charges of making false representations. Sentencing him to eight months in prison Recorder Professor Martin Wasik said: 'It gives me no pleasure sending a man like you to jail but it is the breach of trust which makes this so serious. 'When you first met her you already had problems. 'You were unable to address that problem and the issue continued throughout the time you were in the relationship.' Prosecuting Neil Ahuja said the total defrauded from Mrs Jones was £22,251. This included £7,692 from her bank account, £6,543 on one credit card and more than £8,000 on another. The couple’s relationship started in 2009 after they met at a theatrical group, but they did not marry until the summer last year. Mrs Jones was the breadwinner for the family while her husband studied on a college teaching course and looked after the household, the court was told. Timothy Jones was jailed for eight months at Stafforshire Crown Court, pictured, where it was revealed that the 48-year-old had used his wife's cash to fund his gambling addiction . But Jones was caught out last December when his wife was hugging him and noticed banknotes in his pocket after he had come back from the shops. She then tried to access her bank account online and her password was not recognised. Whilst they were Christmas shopping in Tamworth, Staffordshire days later, she manually checked her account and found just £91 in it. The defendant then ‘drip fed’ confessions to his wife about his gambling problems and she tried to persuade him to hand himself in. Mrs Jones eventually contacted police after her husband threatened to kill himself and he was arrested at their £200,000 home. When questioned, he told officers he had a gambling problem with gaming machines and betting shops which was out of control. Defending Paul Lamb said the couple were no longer together following the revelations about his addiction. He added: 'He has shown a great deal of regret and remorse for the distress and difficulties he has inflicted on his now estranged wife and step children.' Jones’ career as a teacher is also now in ruins following the conviction. He had obtained a degree and a teaching qualification and was employed as a supply teacher when he was arrested.","Timothy Jones used two of wife Jo's credit cards to plunder her account .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Four in 10 doctors warned about their fitness to practice are from abroad, it has emerged. The General Medical Council has issued ‘undertakings’ – the final sanction short of striking them off – to 476 doctors. But amid a crackdown on doctors unable to speak English properly, it can revealed that 43 per cent of those sanctioned are from overseas. Doctors who fail to show they have ‘improved’ can then be referred to the Medical Pactitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) - which can strike them off . The GMC has released a list of the 476 doctors in the UK currently ‘on undertakings’ after concerns were raised about their conduct. It means they have allowed the doctor to continue to treat patients, but under strict supervision and a raft of restrictions. Undertakings are seen as a ‘final chance’ rather than strike doctors off the Medical Register. A Freedom of Information request reveals that there are 476 doctors in the UK still working ‘on undertakings’ - with 43 per cent having been trained abroad. In total 135 (28 per cent) of the doctors are from countries outside Europe, 66 (14 per cent) from EU countries, six from non-EU European counties (one per cent) and 269 (57 per cent) from the UK. That means 207 of the doctors currently working under supervision are from abroad - a total of 43 per cent. A Freedom of Information request reveals that there are 476 doctors in the UK still working ‘on undertakings’ - with 43 per cent having been trained abroad . GMC rules state: ‘Where a doctor’s registration is subject to conditions or undertakings which restrict their practice they will still be entitled to hold a licence but must continue to adhere to any conditions or undertakings imposed on their registration. ‘If they do not, their licence and registration will be at risk.’ According to the GMC website, doctors who fail to show they have ‘improved’ can then be referred to the Medical Pactitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) - which can strike them off. It states: “Doctors with undertakings as a result of deficient performance are likely to be required to undergo a performance assessment before they are discharged from any undertakings. “If the doctor does not agree to the undertakings, or if the doctor subsequently fails to comply with the undertakings, the case will be referred to the MPTS for a fitness to practise panel hearing.” New rules which came into force this summer will allow h . ealth regulators in charge of the UK's 1.4million health workers to bar professionals simply because their command of the English language is considered so poor as to 'impair their fitness to practise'. The Law Commission's new draft Bill covers nine bodies ranging from the General Medical Council (GMC) to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The British Army drew up secret plans to train a 100,000-strong rebel army to defeat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The ‘shock and awe’ strategy, drawn up by General Sir David Richards, would have seen the Syrian force march on Damascus with jets from the UK and the West providing cover. But the plan was shelved two years ago after David Cameron and senior ministers deemed it too risky. Under the extraordinary plan, members of the Free Syrian Army would have spent a year training in Jordan and Turkey before marching on Damascus . The extraordinary plot, revealed by BBC Newsnight, was considered on both sides of the Atlantic before it was dropped. It would have seen 100,000 Syrians vetted and spend a year training in military combat at bases in Turkey and Jordan. They would then have flooded Damascus in an audacious attempt to bring down the Assad regime. The details of significant British involvement in the civil war are all the more surprising because last summer Mr Cameron lost a key vote in the Commons on even considering military action. Lord Richards, who was made a peer after standing down as chief of the defence staff, thought the ambitious plan was needed to counter the might of forces loyal to Assad. It reached the National Security Council in London and was also put to senior figures in Washington, the BBC reported. General Sir David Richards, now Lord Richards, pushed the idea that the only way to end the bloody civil war in Syria was to allow President Bashar al-Assad, or take decisive action to topple him . At the time it came to nothing, but just last week US President Barack Obama announced a £300million plan to train and equip ‘moderate’ opposition forces in Syria. Mr Cameron was left battered and bruised after MPs refused to support his plan for military intervention against the use of chemical weapons. Parliament was recalled for an emergency session in August last year, with Downing Street anticipating cross-party support for intervention. But in an extraordinary assault on Mr Cameron's authority, 39 coalition MPs joined Labour in voting against a watered-down Government motion supporting the only ‘principle’ of military action. There were shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result was announced to a shocked House of Commons. Monzer Akbik, spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, an opposition alliance, told the BBC: 'The international community did not intervene to prevent those crimes and at the same time did not actively support the moderate elements on the ground. 'A huge opportunity was missed and that opportunity could have saved tens of thousands of lives actually and could have saved also a huge humanitarian catastrophe.'","General Sir David Richards developed audacious strategy two years ago .

"By . Hugo Duncan . The British and American economies are storming ahead while the rest of Europe suffers, according to the latest figures. A sharp fall in US unemployment figures yesterday sent shares on Wall Street to a record high while the London stock market also made gains in a boost to pension savings for millions of households in Britain. The share price rally came as France was branded ‘the sick man of Europe’ amid signs it is holding back the recovery on the continent under the leadership of Socialist President Francois Hollande. A chart on a screen at a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shows the closing number for the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow Jones industrial average topped 17,000 for the first time . Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial research group Markit, said there are signs that ‘the euro area’s recovery is already fading’. He added: ‘The UK economy is firing on all cylinders. ‘The UK and the US are showing similarly strong rates of growth while the eurozone is lagging. ‘France is the problem. France remains the weakest link in the region’s recovery story. It is certainly the sick man of Europe, and Europe is the sick man of the global picture.’ Markit’s index of activity in the UK economy – where 50 is the cut-off between growth and decline – dipped from 59.1 in May to a still robust 58.4 in June. That was far stronger than the 52.8 seen in the eurozone where Germany scored 54 and France just 48.1 – the steepest fall for four months. Mr Williamson said the index of activity ‘makes grim reading’ for the eurozone. France was branded 'the sick man of Europe' under President Francois Hollande (pictured) He added: ‘Growth in the region’s main engine, Germany, is fading, while France has entered another downturn.’ But he said there are ‘grounds for optimism’ with the economies of Spain and Italy both showing signs of life. US government figures showed unemployment in the world’s biggest economy fell to 6.1 per cent in June – its lowest level since the collapse of investment giant Lehman Brothers in September 2008 sparked the financial crisis. The report showed 288,000 jobs were created in the US last month as the economy bounced back from a dismal start to the year when freezing weather disrupted business. Unemployment of 6.1 per cent in the US compares with 6.6 per cent in the UK and 11.6 per cent in the eurozone. But Markit predicted that the jobless rate in Britain could fall below 6 per cent by the end of the year as companies are taking on new employees in record numbers. It also estimated that the economy grew by 0.8 per cent between April and June – meaning output has finally surpassed its pre-recession peak. And Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, hailed ‘the impressive pace of growth in the UK economy’, adding that output could have risen by as much as 1.1 per cent in the second quarter of the year.","Sharp fall in US unemployment figures sent shares soaring .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain’s debts are increasing by almost £4,000 every second, campaigners will warn today as the spotlight falls on a catalogue of public sector waste. The Taxpayers Alliance warns public money has been ‘spent with impunity’ by councils, hospitals and Whitehall departments splashing out on celebrities, Christmas trees and costumes. The group is launching a War on Waste roadshow touring the country to highlight the scale of the challenge of balancing the nation’s books. Medway Council spent £4,000 hiring actor Brian Blessed to record an audio guide to play on its buses while Sandwell Council spent £4,000 hiring TV presenter Keith Chegwin for a St George’s Day event . Leicester City Council spent £6,000 hiring minor celebrities, including ex-BBC weatherman Des Coleman, X factor finalists MK1 (pictured) and Apprentice reject Melody Hossaini . The government insists major progress has been made in reining in spending, including saving £14.3billion compared to the final year of the last Labour government. The TPA warns that even in an age of austerity, £120billion-a-year is being wasted – which could be used to fund a £4,500 tax cut for every family. It includes £22billion on overpaying public sector pay and pensions, £20.6billion lost to fraud, £1.6billion in higher sickness rates in the public sector and £1.4billion on ‘overgenerous’ annual leave. But its Bumper Book of Waste also reveals details of the bizarre and extravagant spending of public bodies who often argue that cuts mean they are struggling to make ends meet, .

TaxPayers' Alliance Chief Executive Jonathan Isaby will say: ‘Far too much taxpayers' money is wasted, keeping taxes high and taking precious resources away from essential services. It's time for a war on waste right across the public sector. ‘It would be nothing short of immoral to saddle the next generation with our trillion-pound debt mountain. We need to strip out wasteful and unnecessary spending and start living within our means again. ‘For too long taxpayers' money has been spent with impunity, with little accountability and not enough transparency. The War on Waste hopes to change that and remind those we trust with our money that we're watching how it is spent very carefully indeed.’ The roadshow will tour the country over the next few days, including stops at the constituency offices of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. A spokesman for Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said: 'As part of our long-term plan to rebalance the economy we are reforming Whitehall, tackling waste and making things more business-like. 'Last year we saved taxpayers £14.3billion, compared to Labour's last year in office, but there's so much more to do. 'Under Labour departments paid different prices for common goods such as paper and printer cartridges. We are making sure there's real central oversight over spending and have slashed what we pay on consultants, property and advertising.'","Campaigners claim £120billion is wasted every year by the public sector .

"By . Richard Spillett . A picturesque village immortalised in the paintings of John Constable is at the centre of a middle-class crime mystery following the introduction of controversial parking charges. Dedham - which lies on the Essex and Suffolk border - had all the coin slots in its parking meters filled will glue in an apparent angry reaction to the local council's bid to bring in charges. The village - which featured in a number of Constable's most famous paintings and has been declared an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty - has long been free to park in. The village's attractive main street is lined with Georgian-fronted houses, old inns and a large art centre . The River Stour, which flows through the village, is hugely popular with tourists during the Easter and summer breaks . But many feel tourist numbers will plummet due to new parking charges introduced by the local council . But . council bosses recently voted to end the free scheme in favour of an . unpopular policy of charging people on the busiest roads. The . changes, introduced last month, led to an outpouring of opposition from . local traders, who fear charges of up to £4 for parking will lead to a . significant fall in visitor numbers. It . now appears that someone has taken action into their own hands after, . following the Easter weekend, all the payment slots on the new parking . meters were mysteriously filled with foaming glue, making them . impossible to use. Dedham's . traders have denied they are responsible, suggesting instead that irate . tourists who have enjoyed years of free parking may have committed the . crime. One resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'It is not exactly the Poll Tax riots but people are angry about the introduction of the parking charges. Visitors have enjoyed free parking in the area for years, making it a popular getaway destination at weekends . Parking meters have been filled by glue in vandalism locals say is a reaction to new £4-a-day charges . Traders fear the number of visitors to the area will fall next year after visitors to the area learn of the charges this summer . 'Tourists . do flock to Dedham and the money they bring is worth millions every year . so I think that is why there is so much concern. 'It is fair to say it was a very middle class piece of vandalism but people are not used to committing crime here.' Ian . Wicks, development manager for the Essex Federation of Small . Businesses, said: 'The people who have done this have done a right job . on the meters by the looks of it. 'Clearly we would not condone this sort of behaviour. However, it does represent a feeling around the charges being introduced.' Jenny Pearmain, landlady of the village's Marlborough Head Inn, said that since the charges were introduced on April 1, customers were now more likely to question how long their food would take to arrive. Historic St Mary's church in Dedham is among a number of locations in the area captured by painter John . Constable . The village, on the Essex-Suffolk border, has been a magnet for tourists for years, as day-trippers flock to its picturesque surroundings . Constable's sketch of Dedham Vale, in which the village church can be seen in the distance . However, she does not believe it is an angry trader who is responsible for parking meter vandalism. She . said: 'Dedham businesses do not behave like that. I am sure it is an . irate tourist who has been coming to Dedham for years and has now found . they have to pay.' Mrs . Pearmain fears the impact of the changes will only be truly felt next . year as tourists may be put off returning once they are aware that free . parking has ended. The . new regime gives one hour of free parking before charges of £1 for up . to two hours and £2 for up to four hours kick in, with parking for the . entire day now costing £4. Profits are being shared between Colchester Borough Council and Dedham Parish Council, with the cash raised earmarked for improvements to the village's car parks. The nearby countryside is frequently voted on the best lowland landscapes and is famous for its water meadows . It inspired some of Constable's most famous works. Pictured is a view of the Stour, dated 1822 . The vandalised machines have since been fixed and are operational again, but Essex Police are investigating and have called for witnesses to contact them. Martin Hunt, Colchester borough councillor for street services, said: 'This is clearly not an attempt at theft. 'It is a wanton and repeated act of vandalism, intended to stop the council from carrying out a legitimate policy. 'This policy has been agreed by the parish authority and will produce both better car park and local community facilities. 'I fully support Essex Police in their aim to to catch and prosecute someone who clearly believes he, or she, is above the law.","Village at heart of John Constable country hit with £4-a-day parking charges .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A British man has been arrested on a suspected murder charge over the stabbing death of a love rival in the Austrian town that was the home of Josef Fritzl, the engineer who kept his daughter locked in a cellar for 24 years. Roman Topf, 39, was discovered with two stab wounds, in a courtyard of a house in Böhlerwerk, a suburb of Amstetten, where Fritzl lived. He is thought to have bled to death after his carotid artery was severed. Austrian police said that they had arrested 36-year-old Raphael Andrew Diemoz from Bradford, West Yorkshire. They also revealed that they had recovered two blood stained knives from the scene. Alleged murderer: Raphael Diemoz from West Yorkshire is in custody in Austria following the stabbing death of his love rival Roman Topf . Scene of death: This is the bloodied bench where Roman Topf was found dead in the early hours if Wednesday having bled to death after being stabbed in the neck . Diemoz alleged that Mr Topf had threatened him with the knives but he had managed to disarm him before stabbing him twice in the neck. According to police, the stabbing occurred after a heavy drinking session. The two men who had been celebrating the birthday of a third man were seeking the favours of a 30-year-old waitress. She invited Diemoz, Mr Topf and the other man back to her flat at 2am to continue drinking. Victim: Roman Topf (left) was stabbed to death in the early hours of Wednesday allegedly by Briton Raphael Diemoz in the Austrian town of Amstetten, which gained notoriety in 1988 when it was discovered that engineer Josef Fritzl (right) had kept his daughter locked in a cellar for 24 years . She quickly tired of their attentions and told all three to leave. It was not long after that Mr Topf was killed. His bloodied remains were discovered by another tenant around 4am on a bench in the courtyard below the waitress’s home. Diemoz remains in custody in St Poelten prison.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Mike Ashley, the billionaire owner of Newcastle United, has reportedly rekindled his romance with his ex-wife. Mr Ashley, 49,  divorced Linda Ashley, 46, in 2003 at a cost of £50million, but the business tycoon is said to be dating his ex-wife again. Friends are said to have told  The Sun that the pair have been seen enjoying a string of outings, and also spotted them together at Mr Ashley's lavish £25million Hertfordshire mansion. The couple were pictured leaving an Indian restaurant together in 2011 suggesting a reconciliation has been on the cards for sometime. Mike Ashley was seen leaving an Indian restaurant with Linda in this photograph taken in 2011 suggesting a re-kindling of their romance has been on the cards for sometime . Proposing again? Friends of Mr Ashley, the billionaire Newcastle United owner, have suggested that a rekindled romance with his ex-wife Linda is going so well that he may propose again . Mr Ashley has a son and two daughters with Ms Ashley, who also has a son with another partner. Sources close to the billionaire, who owns a majority stake in retailer Sports Direct, added that Mr Ashley is even considering making another marriage proposal. Back on the scene? Ex-wife Linda Ashley who Ashley divorced quietly 11 years ago . Some said he is so pleased with how the relationship is going that he has lost weight. There has been previous speculation about the two rekindling their love before, after they were spotted out on the town in 2011. They were seen in September 2011 enjoying a meal together at an Indian restaurant in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, after arriving in a chauffeur-driven black Bentley. At the time a friend told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mike never wanted to lose Linda in the first place. He adores her and always has. They've found their spark again. 'He's happy, she’s happy, and to the amazement of people who know them, Mike and Linda are now getting back ­together.' The relationship then failed to materialise. Ms and Mr Ashley met while the former was working at the Lilywhites sports outlet in London, part of the tycoon's business empire. Swedish Ms Ashley married her ex-husband in a ceremony in Gothenburg in 1989, divorcing him 14 years later. Despite his huge wealth today, Mr Ashley grew up in a small bungalow in Buckinghamshire, where his parents still live. But after a grammar school education, his business acumen led to him accumulating a huge empire worth billions. He bought Newcastle United for £134million in 2007. The reclusive billionaire - ranked 23 in the Sunday Times Rich List - rarely speaks publicly. According to the newspaper, his worth rocketed £1.45billion in the past year, making him worth an estimated £3.75billion. The figure is likely to have increased further still in recent weeks after the share value of Sports Direct rocketed by around 40p. He also secured enough support from within the company to grant himself a hefty £200million bonus. MailOnline has contacted a spokesman for Mr Ashley for comment.","Billionaire Mr Ashley 'seen by friends on dates with ex wife Linda Ashley'

"By . Hugo Duncan . Canadian Bank of England Governor Mark Carney speaks with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, during last year's event . For the Bank of England’s annual summer party, Governor Mark Carney was convinced the event needed to be a little bit more inclusive. But for many staff the Canadian’s decision to tamper with tradition just wasn’t, well, cricket. The Bank’s first foreign chief has lined up a rounders match to replace cricket because he believes the age-old summer game to be too exclusive. Other activities at the event in Roehampton, South West London, tomorrow include five-a-side football, tennis, a three-legged race, an egg-and-spoon race, tug-of-war and welly throwing. Mr Carney stopped short of introducing ice-hockey, the sport he played when he was at Harvard in the 1980s and Oxford in the 1990s. The decision to ditch cricket is likely to raise eyebrows among staff past and present including former governor and keen cricketer Lord King, who took part in the match up to his retirement last summer. David Buik, a veteran City commentator who has played at the Bank’s ground, said the decision to scrap cricket was outrageous. He said: ‘It is sacrilege. It is one of the most wonderful grounds you could ever wish to play on and for the game to be denied because of exclusivity is awful. Cricket is one of our national games.’ The event usually pits 11 members of staff against a governor’s team. Former England captain Andrew Strauss played in last year’s match, as did Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander. Mr Carney attended last year’s event, a day before taking over on an £874,000-a-year pay package. Lord King, who is also a tennis fan and a regular at Wimbledon, is president of the Chance to Shine charity which aims to boost participation in sport. The decision to ditch cricket is likely to raise eyebrows among staff past and present including former governor and keen cricketer Lord King, who took part in the match up to his retirement last summer (above) But Mr Carney is understood to have regarded a match involving 22 men as too exclusive and wanted to include more women. He is a keen sportsman and was an ice hockey goalkeeper in his youth. He is a fan of Premier League side Everton, and will no doubt be keeping an eye on Centre Court today where fellow Canadian Eugenie Bouchard is bidding to win Wimbledon. The Bank denied Mr Carney ‘banned’ cricket and insisted that staff were asked what events they would like to take place. A spokesman said: ‘The arrangements for the day were in the hands of staff. They chose a number of sports such as rounders, football and tug-of-war among others.’","Mark Carney has ditched cricket match because he feels it is too exclusive .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . British Gas is to pay £1million in compensation after being caught exaggerating savings customers could make if they switched. Energy watchdog Ofgem found that for two years staff mis-sold deals in Sainsbury’s stores and at Westfield shopping centre, Shepherds Bush. In some cases customers were told that they would save money by switching, but ended up paying more than if they had stayed with their existing supplier. British Gas insisted it had acted to tackle the problems as soon as they came to light . Ofgem’s Sarah Harrison said: ‘Ofgem expects all suppliers to put this poor behaviour behind them and really start acting in a way that will help consumers trust energy suppliers. Where they don’t, Ofgem will act.’ Sales staff did not compare tariffs on a like-for-like basis, . Instead they compared monthly direct debit with quarterly payment methods to produce inaccurate savings estimates. And in some cases, customers were told that they would save money by switching, but they paid more with Sainsbury’s Energy or British Gas than they would have paid if they had remained with their current supplier. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘One of the reasons consumer trust in the energy industry is so low has been because of the repeated mis-selling scandals. This kind of poor practice is completely unacceptable. ‘We want to see all energy companies raising their game now, rather than waiting for the outcome of the competition inquiry. At the very least that means big improvements to basic practices and customer service.’ The firm was also criticised for failing to make clear it was the supplier of Sainsbury's Energy . British Gas said it discovered the mistakes through its own internal checks and added that it informed Ofgem of what had happened before taking steps to compensate customers. Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential, said: “We are very sorry and have ensured no customer will be out of pocket as a result. “We pride ourselves on our high standards and it is extremely disappointing when even a relatively small number of customers don’t receive the service they expect from us.” He said all customers due a compensation payment have already received it as a credit on their account. Since 2010, Ofgem has imposed £100 million in fines and redress on energy companies for various rule breaches, including around £40 million for misselling. In May, E.ON said it would pay £12 million to vulnerable customers due to poor sales practices, which lasted between June 2010 and December 2013. Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most gardeners are happy with a few tubs and baskets but for Edward Hayes that was far too easy. So he built this 26ft-high flower tower, containing more than 2,000 plants including geraniums, pansies and fuchsias, in the drive of his home in Newport, South Wales. The 71-year-old had planned to make his hanging gardens even bigger. ‘It was supposed to be 40ft high but the wife wouldn’t let me go any higher,’ Mr Hayes admitted. Flower power: Edward Hayes, 71, waters the 2,000 plants in his tower. It took him three months and he has already replanted it once after initially filling it with daffodils and tulips . It may be just as well, as the tower, which has a spiral ladder inside, takes him three hours to water. He made it from recycled office desks, building six steel sections which he welded together and tethered to a wall. Mr Hayes, who is semi-retired, explained: ‘My main job is buying and selling office furniture. I had all this steel left over and thought, “I’ve got to make use of it”.’ It took him three months and he has already replanted it once after initially filling it with daffodils and tulips. ‘The neighbours adore it. A lot of people stop and take pictures of it and ask me questions,’ he said. ‘I’ve already got another one designed in my mind for next year.’ Bright blooms: The tower is filled with geraniums, pansies (pictured) and fuchsias.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron was today accused of ‘wilful negligence’ for taking Andy Coulson into Number 10 as his chief spin doctor despite repeated warnings about his links to phone-hacking. Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Cameron would go down in history as the first Prime Minister ‘who brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street’. During furious exchanges in the Commons, Mr Cameron insisted the Leveson inquiry had made no criticism of his conduct and dismissed Labour’s ‘cooked up conspiracy’ of a deal between the Tory party and Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Scroll down for videos . David Cameron repeated his apology for hiring Andy Coulson as his spin doctor, but Ed Miliband accused him of ignoring repeated warnings against taking him into Downing Street . Coulson worked as director of communications for the Tory party and later the government from 2007 to 2011 . After resigning from the newspaper in 2007, Coulson became director of communications for the Tory party before taking on the same role in Downing Street when the coalition was formed in 2010. Coulson was yesterday found guilty of plotting to hack phones while he was editor of the tabloid newspaper. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron repeated his apology for hiring Coulson, for which he took ‘full responsibility’. ‘I did so on the basis of assurances that I received but also the select committee received. ‘But I always said that if those assurances turned out to be wrong I would apologise fully and frankly to this House of Commons and I do so again today from this despatch box. I am sorry. This was the wrong decision.’ He said Coulson’s conviction showed that ‘no-one is above the law in our country’. But Mr Miliband stepped up his attacks on Mr Cameron, claiming he ignored warnings from newspaper reports and even Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, not to allow Mr Coulson to work in the government. Mr Miliband accused Mr Cameron of being ‘weak’ for ‘failing to stand up for doing the right thing’. But Mr Cameron shot back: ‘I’ll tell you what is weak, attacking Murdoch, and then standing up with a copy of the Sun newspaper, only to apologise a few hours later.’ Mr Miliband was ridiculed last week after posing for a publicity photo holding a promotional copy of The Sun, but later faced criticism from Liverpool MPs and activists angered by the newspaper’s coverage of the Hillsborough disaster. Commons Speaker John Bercow had to intervene several times amid loud heckling from both sides in the Commons. Mr Miliband accused the Mr Cameron of being 'weak' and claimed the charge against the Prime Minister 'is not one of ignorance it is wilful negligence' Mr Cameron repeatedly turned to the report of the Leveson inquiry into media ethics to show that he had been cleared of behaving improperly . The Prime Minister claimed Labour was refusing to accept the findings of the Leveson inquiry because they believed a 'cooked-up conspiracy between the Conservatives and News International' Veteran Tory minister Ken Clarke today claimed David Cameron had been 'unwise' to speak out over the Andy Coulson verdict while the phone-hacking trial was still going on. The remarks, which will infuriate the Prime Minister, came after he was rebuked by a top judge. The PM apologised on Tuesday for employing Coulson, saying it had been the 'wrong decision'. But Mr Justice Saunders said his intervention was 'unsatisfactory' and set a bad example to the media. Today Mr Clarke said: 'It was unwise and they should have taken some legal advice first, but I doubt whether it ever crossed David’s mind. 'It would only have crossed mine because I have a historic background as a lawyer and there obviously wasn’t a lawyer sitting around when they decided. 'When they were being pressed, of course, by the public and the press to give comments on the news that had come out.' But the Prime Minister's Official Spokesman today rejected Mr Clarke's claim and confirmed the PM had sought legal advice before commenting. The spokesman said: 'Yes he did seek the Attorney General's advice.' Mr Miliband: ‘Today we know that for four years, the Prime Minister’s handpicked closest advisor was a criminal and brought disgrace to Downing Street. ‘We now also know that the Prime Minister wilfully ignore multiple warnings about him.’ He said that in July 2009 the Guardian published evidence of ‘phone hacking on an industrial scale while Andy Coulson was editor of the News of the World’. In May 2010, the Deputy Prime Minister ‘warned him in person about his deep concerns about Andy Coulson’, Mr Miliband said. In September 2010 the New York Times published a front page investigation ‘detailing Andy Coulson’s extensive knowledge of phone-hacking, including one former editor who said “I’ve been to dozens if not hundreds of meetings with Andy, where the subject came up”.’ He also claimed former Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell raised concerns about the deicion to bring Mr Coulson into Downing Street . Mr Miliband said the failure to heed the warnings raised doubts about Mr Cameron’s character and judgement. ‘When it came to Andy Coulson he just didn’t want to know the evidence,’ he added. But Mr Cameron said all of the issues raised about been examined in detail by the Leveson inquiry ordered in the wake of the hacking scandal, and did not criticise him. ‘Every single one of these issues was dealt with by the Leveson inquiry. The terms of reference of the Leveson Inquiry were agreed by [Miliband] and they included the extent to which there was failure to act on previous warnings about media misconduct. ‘That is what Leveson looked into, he looked into all of these questions about the warnings I was given and the response I gave, and he made no criticism of my conduct. ‘Now I know that he was disappointed by the Leveson Inquiry, but he called for it, it took place and he should heed what it said.’ Commons Speaker John Bercow had to intervene several times amid loud heckling from both sides . Mr Miliband also raised questions about the level of security vetting carried out on Mr Coulson when he joined the government. ‘Amidst all of those warnings the very least he should have done is insisted immediately on coming to office that Andy Coulson should have the highest level of security vetting, as his six predecessors over the previous 14 years have had. Why didn’t he insist on it? ‘We know the rule of this Prime Minister is the buck doesn’t stop here, and he blames the civil service.’ Mr Miliband went on: ‘There is now a very important question which the whole country will want an answer to about whether Sir Gus O’Donnell or senior civil servants raised concerns with him or his office about Andy Coulson. ‘The truth about this is the charge against the Prime Minister is not one of ignorance it is wilful negligence. ‘At the heart of this scandal are thousands of innocent victims of phone hacking he didn’t stand up for. ‘The Prime Minister will always be remembered as being the first ever occupant of his office who brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street.’ Mr Cameron, pictured leaving Downing Street this morning, faced repeated questions about judgement . But Mr Cameron said the Leveson inquiry ‘looked directly at this issue’ and found that ‘the level of security was not the decision of either Mr Cameron or Mr Coulson, it was the decision of the civil service’. He claimed Labour was ‘desperate’ not to talk about the state of the economy or unemployment, but Mr Miliband ‘can’t re-run an inquiry that has already taken place’. ‘What [Mr Miliband] is trying to do is go through all of the old questions, that were answered by the Leveson Inquiry, he didn’t like the answer because he wanted to try and prove some cooked-up conspiracy between the Conservatives and News International. ‘He cannot manage to do it because the Leveson inquiry can’t find it. ‘He brought up the issue of the warning form the Guardian; I totally disproved him using the evidence. He brought up the idea of direct vetting; I have totally disproved him by using the evidence. ‘He cannot bare the fact that an eight month inquiry that he hoped was going to pin the blame on me found that I had behaved correctly throughout.’","Prime Minister challenged in the Commons by Labour leader Ed Miliband .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 'landlord from hell' who is serving a four-year prison sentence after terrorizing tenants who refused to move out has defended his actions in a jailhouse interview. For more than three years Kip Macy and his wife Nicole stalked their tenants in the San Francisco apartment block, threatened them with a semi-automatic . weapon, shut off power, changed the locks without telling them, and tried to have the . windows boarded up while one tenant was still at home. The . couple even tried to saw through a supporting beam in one of the Market . district flats to make it unfit to live in, but were stopped when the tenant, who was in, managed . to bend the blade. In June, the couple were convicted of burglary, stalking and attempted grand theft - but Macy has now stood by his actions, saying he was pushed to terrorize his tenants after the law failed to help. Jailed: Kip Macy, left, and his wife Nicole, right, were jailed for four years in June for terrorizing tenants to make them move out. Kip has said some of the charges - like burglary - were overreactions . The campaign of terror began soon after . the couple bought an apartment block for $995,000 in 2005 and tried to . evict the five tenants already living in it. 'There wasn't actually any legal way of . doing it right, since we had done everything right legally, and it . hadn't worked,' Macy, 39, told ABC's 20/20. 'That's when we started making bad . decisions.' He said that one tenant, Scott Morrow, was particularly problematic as he refused to leave. 'We harassed him a bit because [we] . no longer had anything to lose,' Macy said. 'He had parts of his floor cut out from underneath, also illegal - but whatever.' Cruel: Among the terror they inflicted, they cut a hole in the floor of one tenant's apartment . Destruction: They also tried to saw through a supporting beam so it would be deemed unfit to live in . Violent: When they tried to saw a hole in one tenant's apartment, he was in and bent the blade . The couple were also found guilty of burglary after moving belongings from the tenants' apartments, including property of his building manager, Ricardo Cartagena. 'I regret, you know, having moved the . Mexicans' stuff into the hallway,' Macy told ABC, but added: 'I don't see how that . was burglary, or theft, since I neither stole their stuff.' But Macy blamed his wife for the idea, saying she wanted to buy the apartment block before forcing out the tenants so they could sell the individual apartments for a profit. Within a year, the Macys were involved in litigation with Morrow, one of the tenants. Mrs . Macy set up a fake email account in Mr Morrow's name and sent a . message to his lawyer saying his services were no longer needed. She then sent an email threatening to dismember the lawyer's children, in an effort to make Mr Morrow look unstable. Exasperated: Building manager, Ricardo Cartagena, had belongings taken from his apartment and said the landlords had threatened to kill him with a gun. The terror continued for three years . Scene: The couple had bought the apartment block, pictured, in 2005 with a plan to kick out the tenants and sell the individual apartments. But it was not so straightforward to get them to leave . The couple also changed the locks on the . apartment leased to Erik Hernandez and Jason Lopez. The Macys then went into the apartment, dismantled furniture and stole $2,000, a Gucci watch and a phone, court documents said. Mrs Macy also broke into the apartment and poured ammonia on the tenants' clothes and furniture. The couple . also threatened the building manager with a semi-automatic weapon and . ordered the windows to one of the apartments to be boarded up while the . tenant was still inside. When the Macys were arrested in 2008 . they posted bail and left the country. They were tracked down in Italy . last year and brought back to the U.S. where bail was set at $2 million . each.

The father of missing university chef Claudia Lawrence spoke at the annual charity running race, as the search for clues surrounding his daughter's disappearance continues. Peter Lawrence said the Miles for Missing People event, held on Clapham Common in London, offered a chance to unite with those suffering with the uncertainty of a missing loved one, and helped to raise crucial charity funds. Scroll down for video . Rachel Elias, Peter Lawrence, Gerry and Kate McCann all supported yesterday's Missing People Charity Run on Clapham Common in London .

Kate and Gerry McCann looked relaxed as they took part on the 10km run to support the families of people who have disappeared . The event, by charity Missing People and . now in its fifth year, was also supported by Kate and Gerry McCann - . parents of missing British girl Madeleine - and Rachel Elias, sister of . former Manic Street Preachers guitarist and lyricist Richey Edwards. An emotional Mr Lawrence, who sounded the air horn to start the 10km and 3km races, said: 'A lot of people are here with a poster of their missing loved one, and it's right to display it, show what the charity is for. Madeleine McCann vanished from her family's Portuguese holiday villa in September 2007 . 'I think it's always a poignant event coming here because you see all these people with missing shirts on them with posters and you just think this really needs to be out there. We all need to be together, we are all a big family. 'It (Missing People) is an absolute lifeline. Both for people who are missing, but most importantly the families of the thousands of people who are missing. Most people you talk to of course don't know what it's like to have a family member missing. 'I regularly meet other people with missing members of their family, and it's just being able to be together in the knowledge we all talk the same language. 'Even if Claudia is found I will still be here for the sake of other people and the sake of the charity.' Mrs Elias, from south Wales, said the charity also offered vital support for the family, having battled for nearly two decades not knowing what happened to her brother. She said: 'My brother Richard has been missing for 20 years next year, so it is an especially poignant time for us. 'We're in exactly the same position now as we were 19 years ago, and we still have absolutely no information as to his fate. That is such a difficult thing, living with that constant uncertainty. 'We keep going through the support of the charity.' And she said she was unable to listen to the music of her brother, who vanished when the Manics were beginning to attract international airplay in February 1995. She said: 'I don't listen to the Manics records, I do find that too difficult.' The McCanns had special t-shirts with a photograph of their missing daughter Madeleine on the back . Anybody running the race with children could use a special 1km course . Around 500 people took part in yesterday's races, with starters including the McCanns. Children could complete a 1km course. Jo Youle, Missing People chief executive, said: 'We're all here in solidarity with other families facing unimaginable heartache when someone goes missing. 'But also today is a day of hope. It is so important to keep the search alive and know that one day their lovely, special person could be back with them. 'We have some families today who were here last year, and that's hard to think that they've had to face another year without knowing. 'But I think there is some comfort in families being here together in solidarity.' The event is part of May's 'forget me not' month campaign. It has just launched a Child Rescue Alert service, encouraging people to sign up to missing children notices from police.

Broadcaster Tenfield claims Suarez bumped into Chiellini with his 'face', and says it was only after English journalists brought up the issue of a bite that FIFA decided to investigate. In an article posted on their website, the station advises Englishmen criticising Suarez to remember that Geoff Hurst's extra-time goal in the 1966 final against West Germany did not cross the line.

A Uruguayan TV station has defended Luis Suarez saying that Englishmen criticising the striker should remember that Geoff Hurt's goal in the 1966 World Cup didn't cross the line . Suarez is facing a ban of up to two years after apparently biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini (pictured) The article goes on to say that the footage of Suarez biting Chiellini's shoulder is not conclusive, claiming that he stumbles before making contact, which may indicate he tripped. They say the fact that Suarez came away holding his teeth means that contact was not intentional, adding that Suarez thought his mouth was about to start bleeding. Suarez has also defended himself today, . saying: 'These are things that happen on the pitch, we were both in the . area, he thrust his shoulder into me. 'These things happen on the pitch, . and we don't have to give them so much (importance).' However FIFA disagree and have today charged Suarez over the biting incident with Chiellini, which could see him banned from football for up to two years if found guilty. The Uruguayan forward is accused of sinking his jaws into the shoulder of the Italian defender in Brazil, just 14 months after he was given a  doing the same thing in Britain. Fifa’s . disciplinary committee said this morning that it had opened proceedings . against Liverpool player Suárez, and has asked his team to present . evidence by 5pm local time (9pm BST) today. In Uruguay, the press have not mentioned the alleged bite incident, instead focusing on the team's win which took them through to the last 16 knockout stage.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Nigel Mansell believes that the world championship fight between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will go down to the last race of the season, a scenario that will put Formula One’s most controversial rule in the spotlight. The final round of the championship will carry double points for the first time, meaning either man would need to be 51 ahead going to Abu Dhabi to be assured of taking the title. With Rosberg now leading by 29 points, Mansell said: ‘So Hamilton is a few points behind but there’s so many more races to go. I don’t see it as a problem.

I think it will come down to what reliability each one of them has. ‘Destiny will determine it. It will come down to the last race. In fact, it can be an advantage to come from behind because if Lewis starts to perform a little bit better than Nico, the pressure will transfer from Lewis to Nico.’ Hamilton has won four races to Rosberg’s three so far, but mechanical problems, whether brought about by ill luck or by pushing too hard, means he trails by more points than the score of a race win, 25. On top: Rosberg has not outraced Hamilton many times this season but has been more reliable . Tension: Hamilton knows it could all come down to the last race of the season when the points count double . Mansell knows what it is like to lose the title despite winning more races than the champion. It was a fate he suffered in his final two F1 seasons, including to his Williams team-mate Nelson Piquet. ‘I’ve been there and done that,’ he said. ‘I know how that feels. ‘I don’t think all the mechanical problems in the end will be with Lewis.

"By . Martin Ziegler, Press Association . The son of the second most powerful man in world football has become embroiled in a World Cup ticket scandal. Humberto Grondona, son of Argentina’s senior FIFA vice-president Julio Grondona, has admitted to selling on tickets to a friend contrary to FIFA’s regulations. The tickets are among those seized by Brazilian police as part of investigations into ticket touting which has seen 11 people arrested. Scandal: FIFA cracking down on the re-sale of World Cup tickets, so the admission is an embarrassment . Pictures of one of the tickets seized with Humberto Grondona’s name on it has been circulated. The disclosure that Grondona’s son has been involved is a huge embarrassment to FIFA - he has a post as a technical adviser to the world governing body. His father has been a FIFA executive committee member since 1988 and is also chairman of FIFA’s powerful finance committee. Grondona junior told Argentinian TV station TYC he spent more than 9,000 US dollars (£5,244) on 24 category one tickets for group games and knock-out matches including a semi-final and final and had sold some on to a friend. He said: 'I bought all of them for more than 9,000 dollars, I have a friend that is someone very well known in Argentina who wanted to come and I sold to him some of these tickets. Admission: Julio Grondona (centre) has confessed to reselling some of his £5,000 worth of World Cup tickets . 'He on his part gave the tickets to another friend, what they then did with the tickets I have no idea.' Asked for the identity of the person he sold the tickets to, Grondona junior added: 'I cannot tell you. 'But do you think I would dirty my hands for 220 dollars (£128)? The truth is that I have no idea where these tickets went to.' FIFA emailed all employees and everyone on the World Cup delegation list before the tournament warning them not to sell on tickets, which have an electronic chip which makes them traceable back to the person who purchased the. Delia Fischer, FIFA’s head of media, would not comment on the investigation but said if anyone was found to have breached regulations they would face disciplinary action. She told a news conference in Rio: 'We cannot comment on ongoing investigations but anyone who has violated the regulations will be sanctioned. 'I cannot go into specific cases but we need to see the source of the original tickets and how the tickets ended up somewhere. Second in command: Julio Grondona (right) with FIFA president Sepp Blatter (left) during the World Cup . 'Even where you have specific names you cannot always jump to conclusions.' Fischer confirmed that anyone found having breached the regulations can have their tickets for any future games removed. She added: 'If someone is violating something then tickets can be cancelled accordingly but we need to see who is involved, which tickets they are and then we can take necessary action.' Grondona junior is not the FIFA official at the heart of the multi-million pound ticket scandal uncovered by Operation Jules Rimet, however, according to police. His ticket was seized by Sao Paulo police from touts in that city. Senior: Julio Grondona, pictured with Diego Maradona, is Sepp Blatter's second in comand . Fabio Barucke, the police investigator in charge of the Rio investigation, said a FIFA official who was a source of the tickets had access to FIFA offices and stadiums and match tickets. Some tickets have been re-sold for eight times their face value. Barucke said the ticketing ring aimed to make up to £60million by illegally re-selling tickets and that the group had operated at previous World Cups. The suspected ringleader has been named as Mohamadou Lamine Fofana, an Algerian man who was previously staying at the Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio, where all the FIFA top executives are staying. Barucke believes Fofana was the middleman and that the ticket source was 'someone higher up' the chain.","Julio Grondona is senior FIFA vice-president .

"By . Sarah Dean . The devastated 19-year-old sibling of murdered mother of four Tia Maria Landers has paid tribute to her caring big sister who bought her up when their father got sick with cancer. And the teenager has described how she will ‘step up’ and look after Tia’s four children now their mother has been so cruelly killed, just like Tia used to look after her. Jamie Landers, who was away at university in Queensland, when she found out that her 28-year-old sister had been brutally murdered, described Tia as a ‘bubbly’ and ‘adoring’ mother who was ‘always helping other people’. Police say Tia suffered a violent death, but have not revealed exactly what killed her. She had been missing for a month when her body was found in a shallow grave in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane, on Thursday. ‘I am devastated… I helped her raise her kids, she was the best mum, they adored her, she was always spoiling them and making them princess dresses,’ Jamie told MailOnline. Devastated: Tia Landers (left) was 'the best mum' her sister Jamie (right) has said. The siblings are seen here with their mother (centre) and Tia's two daughters in their 'princess dresses' Jamie, who is studying for a law degree and hopes to join the police academy, said she always looked up to the big sister who brought her up throughout high-school. ‘We used to pretend we were the Spice Girls, I pretended I was Baby Spice and she was Scary Spice because of her curly hair. 'She used to have friends to stay and we would play mums and dads. She was always caring about everyone else, she always bringing people home and taking care of them,’ she explained. Tia would not only look after her own four young children but also ensured Jamie was ready for school. ‘She made my lunches and made sure I got dressed for school. She helped me grow up and she let me be there for her children, she taught me how to do so many things it’s hard to list them all. ‘She’s going to be missed. I lived with her when my dad first got ill with cancer.’ Tragic: The mother of four had been missing for a month before her body was found by police in bushland in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane . Jamie described her sister as a popular and outgoing young women and said when she was murdered it wasn’t just Tia’s life that was taken but ‘a piece of all her family’. ‘She has so many friends, everyone knows her for being bubbly, out there, and having fun and living in a dream world. ‘So many people are missing her at the moment,’ she said. Jamie also wants to set the record straight after Tia was described as a ‘gangster’s girlfriend’ in the press. Of criminal Wade Bartz, who Tia was romantically linked to, Jamie said: ‘They are not in a relationship.’ She explained that Wade is definitely not the father of any of Tia’s four children and that the pair only met ‘two years ago’. ‘She didn’t even know him when her last daughter was born,’ Jamie explained. After her body was found, Ms Landers' sister wrote on Facebook: 'Rest in peace my beautiful sister' The student explained how Tia’s two boys and two girls, aged 4, 5, 8 and 10, are ‘not doing well’ since their mother went missing on June 16. Jamie now feels it is her responsibility to ‘take them on and look after them’. ‘I’m the youngest sibling and the only one without children, so I will step up,’ she said. ‘I study and work, but I won’t be looking after them just now because my parents are still able to. But my father is very ill with cancer so when they are unable to I will step up and take over.’ Talking about putting her own dreams aside, Jamie added: ‘You've got to do what you’ve got to do.’ Jamie hadn’t seen her sister recently before her death, as she was away at university, but she received a message on her phone asking her to call her a few days before she disappeared. ‘I didn't get to speak to her and then I saw her missing person report in the papers and online. At first I thought “this is a joke, this is a bad prank, she is probably just at a friend’s place”. Confused: 'I just don't understand it's like a sad movie. Things like this don't happen in real life,' Jamie said of her sister Tia (pictured) ‘I never imagined this would happen. I just don’t understand it’s like a sad movie. Things like this don’t happen in real life,’ she said. Jamie became really worried about her sister when her mother phoned her in tears and said the police were conducting searches in the bush. ‘She knows what my sister is like so to hear her in tears that’s when I thought “oh no don’t let this be”.’ Brisbane couple John Edward Harris, 42, and Linda Eileen Appleton, 40, who police say were known to Ms Landers, have been charged with torturing and murdering her and will spend at least the next six months behind bars after they were remanded in custody during a court mention on Friday. Jamie is desperate for answers after police alleged the couple tortured her sister at their home north of Brisbane before killing her. ‘I don’t know how this happened and how it led up to this. She would help other people before she'd help herself. Popular: 'She has so many friends, everyone knows her for being bubbly, out there, and having fun and living in a dream world,' Jamie said of her big sister Tia . ‘She'd ask for money just to give to friends she was always helping other people,’ Jamie said. Speaking out on behalf of the Landers family, who have flown in from all parts of Queensland to be together, Jamie also addressed rumours in the press that her sister was schizophrenic. ‘She had health issues but it wasn’t to do with that,’ she said. She explained: ‘Everyone makes mistakes. I think she should be judged by who she actually was.’ Jamie is now busy making funeral arrangements for Tia with her mother. ‘I’m helping my mum organise the funeral because we feel we know Tia best. ‘There will be nothing fake that she's not. She was bubbly, out there, she’d always do crazy make-up, all colourful. We don't want it to be a sad day, there will be no black,’ she said. Keen to explain the type of person her sister really was, Jamie added: ‘She is a human being she's not a gangster’s girlfriend. She is a mother of four, a sister, a friend, a daughter… she deserves to be treated nicely.'

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . On one frosty, winter evening at Upton Park in January, Alvaro Negredo scored two more goals, bringing up his tally to 23 in his first 33 games for the club. It was the Manchester City’s striker ninth goal in six games, his confidence overflowing as ‘La Fiera de Vallecas’ – The Beast of Vallecas, the nickname referring to the working class district that Negredo grew up in in Madrid – savaged defences in a barnstorming introduction to English football. Yet since then: nada. The beast was tamed, his form shuddering to a startling halt, as the bearded Spaniard failed to score again until the end of the season. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alvaro Negredo's spectacular scissor kick in training . Unsettled: Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo wants to return to Spain . Celebration: But picking up the title could be Negredo's last action in a City shirt if he moves away . Appearances: 32 (11 as sub) Goals: 9 . Assists: 3 . Shots per match: 1.69 . Longest run without a goal: 11 games . Sixteen games and no goals as Negredo traded in his unique blend of brawn and finesse for a brittle and clumsy fragility, losing his place to Edin Dzeko for the Capital One Cup final victory over Sunderland and the crucial title deciders as the clocked ticked down on the Premier League season. Negredo started just seven of those final sixteen appearances, and completed 90 minutes only once in the 5-0 win over Fulham, almost out of pity as manager Manuel Pellegrini attempted to draw his striker out of the rot. It was a peculiar narrative and few were able to diagnose the cause of Negredo’s malaise in light of a quite remarkable start to the season. One theory concerns the knock to the shoulder that Negredo suffered in the 3-0 victory over West Ham, leaving Upton Park with his right arm in a sling. But Manuel Pellegrini consistently insisted that it was only a brief irritation and it does seem a stretch to hypothesise that this injury has significantly contributed to Negredo’s downturn in form. Another suggestion from Spain is that amid the adrenalin of his opening months in Manchester, Negredo played beyond all expectations, entering the form of his life and providing a misguided perception of his true credentials. One source close to his former club Sevilla predicted in December that Negredo’s limitations as a footballer always dictated that a slump would follow the spurt. It seems a harsh appraisal but it has proved startlingly accurate. Second string: Negredo often found himself as second choice for City behind Edin Dzeko late in the season . VIDEO Negredo's first goal for City . Certainly, concerns did emerge at City in the final weeks of the season, as Pellegrini appeared to lose faith in his £20million signing. In each of the club’s final three Premier League games, every one must-win as City accelerated their pursuit of the Premier League title, Negredo was only introduced after the 85th minute, after the victories had already been sealed. Negredo had by that point become an apology for the muscular presence that had just weeks earlier terrorised Premier League defences, scoring goals and striking up a potent partnership with Sergio Aguero. Suddenly, it all looked woefully like labour to him, as if he were a pianist whose timing had deserted hm. He became hesitant in front of goal, jittering, pontificating and losing that defining ability to remain detached when faced by a goalkeeper. Exclusion from Spain’s final pool of 23 for the World Cup in Brazil soon followed and it is understood that Negredo believes that this struggles in Manchester were responsible, although he also recognises that Pellegrini had little choice but to turn to Dzeko when the heat was on in the final weeks. It has, rather predictably, led to speculation that the player might be homesick and yearning for the comforts of his native Spain. This, however, does not fit in with the sound bites Negredo had been presenting just a few months earlier. Nickname: City's number nine hasn't been living up to his 'beast' moniker recently . In an interview with a Sunday newspaper, Negredo could not have been more effusive over his transition from rural Andalucia to the plush greenery of the Cheshire outskirts. ‘I have liked it here right from the first day,’ Negredo said. ‘When you go out in the streets people say hello to you, wish you good morning, it’s a really great feeling. 'People paint England a bit black but you know it is not too bad at all. It is one of the best decisions I have made on a personal level and a football level.’ Football, however, is a fickle profession and a few substitute appearances, a goal drought and international disharmony can do much to change a striker’s feelings these days. Nonetheless, such a response would be out-of-sync with a player that emerged as one of the most popular both in the dressing-room and on the terraces at the Etihad Stadium last season. For all the mutual admiration, though, the noises from the Spanish Press appear increasingly convinced that the player would welcome a return to the Iberian peninsula. Number one: Negredo was the main man for City but became a back up figure late in the season . Down and out: It was a difficult second half to the season for the out-of-sorts striker . City, for their part, insist that they expect the striker to be at the club next season and well-placed source assured Sportsmail on Thursday that the club are not attempting to alter that situation or encourage interest this summer. Clearly, Pellegrini feels that to cull the striker after twelve months, particularly when his star shone so brightly in the opening part of the campaign, would be a premature and unnecessary response. What is evident, however, is that Atletico Madrid require a striker to replace Diego Costa and that they may be prepared to test City’s resolve with a bid exceeding £20m in the coming weeks. There is also a growing belief in Spain that Negredo would like a return to his hometown with the Spanish champions. If Atletico were to follow up the interest with an offer that approached £30m, then City may be forced to seriously reconsider their stance over the 28-year-old’s future, particularly if the player states a desire to leave. City remain relaxed about the situation, as the City players return for pre-season in the middle of July, this may be one issues that fills rather more pages of newsprint in the weeks to come.

"By . Simon Jones . West Ham are closing on a deal for Diego Poyet, son of Sunderland boss Gus. The 19-year-old midfielder has attracted interest from Chelsea, Manchester City and Sunderland.

That came, incredibly, despite the youngster only breaking into the team in January. Charlton had been in discussions with Poyet's representatives over an extension to his deal, which expired on July 1, but he made his feelings clear by telling the club he would not report to pre-season training. Poyet, born in Spain to Uruguayan parents and raised in England, finds himself in a rare predicament.

"By . Aap . A man nicknamed 'Insane Shane' shoved magazines down his pants to protect his genitals before his friend shot him in a Jackass-style prank that went wrong. Michael Dominic Ciantar apologised on Friday at Adelaide Magistrates Court after he pleaded guilty to discharging a firearm to injure, annoy or frighten at a Brahma Lodge party last week. The 20-year-old man fired off an air rifle at Shane Lewis on February 27. Michael Dominic Ciantar, 20, has pleaded guilty to discharging a firearm to injure, annoy or frighten . Ciantar was arrested after Mr Lewis, 41, arrived at Lyell McEwin hospital with a gunshot wound to his arm. 'I will never do anything that stupid again,' the Brahma Lodge said. 'I have always been a very respectful person with my firearms, as it has always been one of my passions. 'I know I have stuffed up.' Initially police were told Lewis had been injured in a drive-by shooting as witnesses and the victim would not co-operate. But prosecutor Lisa Lakatos said the incident was captured on video by an onlooker on Ciantar's mobile phone. He apologised for his actions at Adelaide Magistrates Court On Friday . The Brahma Lodge man discharged a firearm in a Jackass-style stunt that went wrong and ended with friend Shane Lewis being shot in the arm . Ciantar's lawyer, Stephen Ey, said Mr Lewis had bragged about pranks on the TV show Jackass - including putting yabbies on nipples and using guns to shoot at one another. The lawyer said he had done an internet search on Jackass pranks and discovered 'all sorts of bizarre behaviour'. Mr Lewis had suggested Ciantar go home and get his slug gun, which his client did. 'Lewis wanted the defendant to shoot him in the arm,' Mr Ey said. 'The defendant suggested it would be better if it was in the bottom, but ultimately it was agreed he would shoot him in the arm.' He will re-appear in court for sentencing on August 5 - he is facing an eight-year jail sentence . Mr Lewis put magazines down his pants to protect his genitalia. Prosecutors previously said Ciantar then asked Mr Lewis's teenage son, 'Do you want to see your dad being shot?' Mr Ey said the incident was filmed because they did not contemplate any harm would be done, but wanted to prove the shooting took place. After being shot, Mr Lewis did some push-ups but after blood was noticed on his arm about 20 minutes later, Ciantar convinced him to go to hospital. Ciantar will be sentenced on August 5. Adelaide Now reported the 20-year-old was allowed to continue on bail and faced an eight-year jail sentence.","Michael Dominic Ciantar pleaded guilty to shooting Shane Lewis in the arm .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in hot water after he said Australia was unsettled before British colonisation. Mr Abbott made the comments during an address he made at the Melbourne Institute, saying Australia was unimaginable without foreign investment. 'I guess our country owes its existence to a form of foreign investment by the British government in the then unsettled or, um, scarcely settled, Great South Land,' he said on Friday. Tony Abbott has landed himself in hot water after he said Australia was 'unsettled' before the British arrived . But Australia's first female Aboriginal federal parliamentarian Senator Nova Peris said the comments hindered efforts to have her people recognised in the constitution. The comments were hurtful, dismissive of indigenous Australians and incorrect, she said. In a statement to the ABC, Ms Peris said: 'British settlement was not a foreign investment. It was invasion.' 'The comments from the Prime Minister have not just offended Aboriginal Australians but many people around the country.' Northern Territory Senator Nova Peris said the comments made by Mr Abbott on Friday were offensive . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has also hit out at the prime minister for his comments. He said Mr Abbott's remark was offensive, especially from a prime minister who claimed to be dedicated to indigenous affairs. Mr Abbott's key indigenous adviser, Warren Mundine, labelled the comments silly and bizarre.","The comments were made while he was at the Melbourne Institute .

"By . Sarah Dean . A New Zealand builder has died after accidentally shooting himself in the chest with a nail gun after climbing down a ladder. The new father, 31, pulled the nail out of his body but later died from his injuries. Robert Barr was working on a rural property in Waipukurau, a town on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, on Thursday morning when the tragic accident happened. Tragic: Young father Robert Barr died suddenly on Thursday after he accidentally shot himself in the chest with a nail gun . 'He came down off a ladder, slipped and the nail gun hit him on the shoulder,' his friend Tony Lepelaars told the New Zealand Herald. 'He realised what he had done, walked outside and was sitting on a trailer and managed to pull the nail out.' Mr Barr reportedly walked to the helicopter that would take him to hospital and was in 'good spirits' before he died. His boss at local building company Schaw Building Ltd, Marcus Schaw, told Hawke's Bay Today that Mr Barr - a keen rugby player - was 'as tough as buggery and very popular with his teammates and at work'. 'We are pretty heartbroken and everyone is pretty cut up,' he said. He described the incident as a 'freak accident'.

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . John Bercow was last night accused of turning Westminster into a ‘Big Brother-style’ TV show after allowing cameramen into the Commons chamber for the first time. Until now, coverage of debates has been recorded by remote-controlled cameras set above the famous green benches. But at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, two cameramen will film close-up shots of MPs from the floor of the House itself after the Speaker approved the plans. Demeaning: John Bercow has been accused of turning Westminster into a 'Big Brother-style' TV show after allowing cameramen into the Commons chamber . Tory MP Brian Binley has warned the ‘eye-level’ cameras, to be placed either side of the Speaker’s Chair, will ‘demean’ the Commons. He said: ‘I understand the balance between the media and Parliament is a fine and delicate one. However, this is cheapening the Commons with some sort of political Big Brother-style show.’ But Labour MP Thomas Docherty, a key backer of the plan, said that it was nonsense to suggest the Speaker’s move would hurt Parliament’s reputation. ‘If this makes some Tory MPs better behaved for once, that’s a good thing in itself,’ he said. ‘It’s important for democracy to help the public see what goes on in Parliament.’ New start: Remote controlled television cameras have been allowed into the Commons for 25 years. From Wednesday there will also be cameramen . Television cameras were first allowed into the Commons 25 years ago only after strict rules had been brought in for filming to allay MPs’ fears that they would be shown in a less than flattering light in embarrassing shots. The filming this week is being carried out for a four-part BBC series on life at Westminster called Inside The Commons, to be broadcast next year and presented by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said he had given ‘special permission’ after documentary-makers claimed the ‘fixed filming’ arrangements were insufficient.","Remote-controlled cameras have been in Commons chamber for 25 years .

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . James . Dasaolu has spoken of his disappointment at missing out on the . Commonwealth Games and expressed his desire to represent Great Britain . at the European Championships — even if it is only in the 4x100metres . relay. The . 26-year-old, the second quickest Briton of all-time with a 100m . personal best of 9.91sec, was not even considered to pull on an English . vest in Glasgow because he had not raced outdoors before the selectors . met on June 2. Dasaolu . missed three weeks of training after suffering a hamstring injury in . February and so elected to miss last weekend’s Sainsbury’s British . Championships and open his season in a ‘B’ race in Lausanne, Switzerland . last Thursday instead. Reaction: Dasaolu looks back after winning his 100m 'B' race in 10.03secs in Lausanne . His winning time of 10.03sec was the second fastest by a British man this year but Dasaolu must still convince British selectors to pick him over Chijindu ‘CJ’ Ujah for next month’s European Championships in Zurich. European junior champion Ujah, 20, has clocked 9.96sec in 2014 and competes in his first Diamond League meeting in Paris on Saturday. Dasaolu said: ‘I was eligible (for the Commonwealth Games). Even if I didn’t warrant to go in the 100m at the time I still would have liked to have been part of the relay team but I was overlooked. ‘I don’t know why, you’ll just have to ask the selection committee, but I would have liked to have been part of a home Commonwealth Games. ‘I don’t know about the Europeans. That’s down to the selectors so I just have to wait and see for another week or so. ‘I wasn’t surprised by CJ’s time. We always saw he had potential but he is always one of these athletes that ran a little bit hurt, so it shows what he can do when he is fit and healthy. He ran sub-10, which is good to see. Power: The British sprinter in action during the 4x100m relay at the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games . ‘I’m happy to represent my country in any . form so a vest is a vest and a medal is a medal so yes, I’d be more . than happy (to go to Zurich if only selected in the relay).’ Dasaolu . faced some criticism for skipping last weekend’s trials, which saw . Dwain Chambers win his eighth 100m British title and gain European . selection in 10.12secs, but he insisted his cautious approach will bring . more long-term gain. The sprinter’s career has been marred by injury . but the disappointment so clearly etched on his face on Thursday showed . the shape Dasaolu feels he is now in. He will compete again next . Friday (July 11) at the Sainsbury’s British Grand Prix in Glasgow . against a much more competitive field, hoping to register a time to . really give the selectors something to think about when they meet the . Monday after. Dasaolu said: ‘10.03sec is my quickest opener to a season so I can’t really complain too much.‘I . really wanted to compete at the British Champs. If they had been this . week, I would have competed, but I didn’t want to take the risk. ‘My . goals are the World Championships and the 2016 Olympics in Rio so I . don’t want to risk any injury that would jeopardise the rest of my . career. ‘We just didn’t want to take any risks. I could have been . racing three or four weeks ago but there was a possibility that I could . have torn a hamstring so I decided to take the maximum time to recover . and be fit and healthy. ‘I did miss it, though. Racing is the whole point and I’m glad to be back.’ Winner: Dasaolu triumphs in the final of the 60m at Birmingham's NIA Arena in February .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's a sprawling Victorian-style family home that remains one of the most distinguished properties in Florida. But, like the original gingerbread finish that has lined the porch since its construction in 1893, some aspects of this Punta Gorda house will never change - such as the previous inhabitants who refuse to leave. According to documents filed by former owners over time, the history associated of this home is very much alive. However, forgetting the ghost who supposedly stalks the hallways is nicknamed 'Scary Mary', the current tenants are an all-American family with seven children, so it can't be too petrifying. Scroll down for video . Spooky house now for sale: This Punta Gorda, Florida, home has been listed for sale for $1.59 million. It is said to be haunted by a 14-year-old girl known as 'Scary Mary' The home was built in 1893 but has been extensively renovated, with many original features maintained . Buyer beware: Current owners Natalie and Vandy Wynn, who have seven children, share stories of their ghost encounters . The 'widows walk' that sits atop the home is one of its most distinguished features - and a point of spiritual activity . In fact, with this poltergeist said to be the spirit of a 14-year-old girl, mother Natalie Wynn says she treats her with the same approach she does her own brood. 'She's a kid,' Wynn said of the ghost to The Herald Tribune. 'I have yelled at her like I would any other kid in the house.' 'Scary Mary' was the daughter of James Sandlin, one of Punta Gorda's most successful early businessmen who built the house. However Sandlin's family was beset by tragedy. An infant died three days after birth. Their son, Felix, 11, died in 1902. Sandlin himself died — possibly of tuberculosis — in 1903, leaving behind a 34-year-old widow and three children. But perhaps the most notable calamity occurred in 1909, when Sandlin's 14-year-old daughter, Mary Leah, was ironing on the porch with a gasoline-heated flat iron — a common appliance until World War I. This is the iron that lead to the death of Mary Leah Sandlin - AKA 'Scary Mary' - which is kept on display at the home by current owners Natalie and Vandy Wynn . Somehow, the gasoline spilled and Mary's clothes ignited. Screaming, she ran ablaze down the street, with neighbors trying to put out the flames. She died not long after from her injuries. And today, some 105 years after the accident, the presence of 'Scary Mary' continues to be felt. 'Mostly what we have heard are footsteps up and down the stairs and across the hallway upstairs where her bedroom was,' said father Vandy Wynn, an anesthesiologist at the local hospital. 'A closet door, we went to push the door shut and the door came back open. They pushed against it and it was kind of a tug and war with the door to the closet which normally doesn't do that.' The current owners say they have never really been frightened of the ghosts they believe inhabit their home, but it has surprised them on many occasions . Shaking chandeliers is a very common characteristic of the house's ghost activity, according to the owners . So well-noted is its history, the Victorian-style home features on the cover a book called FloridaLand Ghost . Vandy and Natalie Wynn show prospective buyers through their home . With no way of escaping or avoiding the spookiness associated with their home (it's featured on the cover of a book called FloridaLand Ghost) the Wynn's are trading on it as they attempt to sell up and move. The house and all of it's mysteries has been listed for sale for $1.59 million. Extensively renovated but with original features still intact, the home did not originally have an indoor bathroom or even kitchen. Now it has five bathrooms and an expansive kitchen with granite finishes. 'Some pieces are original, some were added later and some are new,' Mrs Wynn said.

"An intrepid pilot almost became hypothermic during an 8,000-mile solo flight in a 1940s biplane. The severe European winter weather proved a challenge for Tracey Curtis-Taylor during her eight-week adventure from Cape Town to Goodwood. The 51-year-old finally realised her dream of recreating the pioneering 1928 flight of Lady Mary Heath who made history by becoming the first person to fly alone across Africa. Ms Curtis-Taylor set off from Cape Town in the Spirit of Artemis, a classic 1940s open cockpit Boeing Stearman biplane, and ended her journey by landing in appalling conditions in Goodwood, West Sussex, on New Year's Eve. Daredevil: s Curtis-Taylor set off from Cape Town in the Spirit of Artemis, a classic 1940s open cockpit Boeing Stearman biplane . She said: 'I came in, in the atrocious weather with gusts of over 30 knots. Thank goodness it's on the coast because I couldn't see Goodwood until I was over it. 'Weather is always the biggest issue. Getting back across Europe in an open cockpit plane battling strong headwinds and crosswinds, I lose 30% of my ground speed. You are very vulnerable.' Ms Curtis-Taylor, who has been flying for more than 30 years and was 16 years old the first time she flew a plane, passed through some of the most troubled and beautiful parts of the world. The Spirit of Artemis has a top speed of 95mph and a maximum altitude of 10,000ft, although Ms Curtis-Taylor flew at low levels, including as low as 15ft over Lake Natron, Kenya, allowing her to enjoy Africa's wildlife and dramatic terrain. Adventurous: Ms Curtis-Taylor has been flying for more than 30 years and flew a plane when she was 16 . She said one of her worst journeys was over Egypt where she was asked to fly at 10,000ft and she became worried she would not make her destination as she was almost going backwards. She said: 'It was getting colder, the plane was getting slower and I was almost running out of fuel, but they would not let me descend. 'I was really anxious and I became almost hypothermic. In the end I didn't do what they told me because it was too dangerous. Tracey Curtis-Taylor with her 1942 Boeing Stearman biplane at Goodwood Airfield near Chichester . The 40-leg trip also saw Ms Curtis-Taylor fly through Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and the Republic of Sudan . 'When I flew over the Mediterranean I got told to ascend to 16,000ft which was impossible because the plane is not made to fly that high and I would have needed oxygen above 10,000ft. I was treated like a commercial airliner.' The 40-leg trip also saw Ms Curtis-Taylor fly through Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and the Republic of Sudan. In Egypt, she was delayed by a storm with winds of more than 70mph that delivered snow to Cairo.Ms Curtis-Taylor had hoped to finish the journey before Christmas but the strong winds across Europe meant that she was stuck in Croatia over the festive period waiting for a window of opportunity. The Spirit of Artemis has a top speed of 95mph and a maximum altitude of 10,000ft . Beauty: Tracey Curtis-Taylor's 1942 Boeing Stearman biplane at Goodwood Airfield near Chichester . She said she was very happy and relieved to get the Spirit of Artemis back to the UK in one piece. She said: 'Having lived the project so intensively, I never quite imagined the finale. I feel completely punch drunk from the experience and desperately short of sleep.' Her journey is being made into a feature documentary and the editing is expected to be finished by the spring.","Tracey Curtis-Taylor set off from Cape Town in the Spirit of Artemis .

"Immigration has become a key political issue ahead of the General Election . By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Sajid Javid: Mr Javid criticised those who had failed to assimilate into British society . Immigrants who come to live in Britain need to learn to speak English and to 'respect our way of life', Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants and the first Asian Secretary of State, said that people were entitled to expect that immigrants made a contribution to society. 'People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. 'People also say, when immigrants do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English.' His intervention comes at a time when the Conservatives are under intense pressure from the UK Independence Party over the issue of immigration ahead of Thursday's European elections. Mr Javid criticised those who had failed to assimilate into British society, despite living in the country for many years. 'I know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can't speak English,' he said. 'I think it's perfectly reasonable for British people to say, look, if you're going to settle in Britain and make it your home, you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture.' Voters will head to the polls in the UK on Thursday to elect the MEP's for the European parliament. Elections are also being held in 161 English council areas.

"By . James Chapman . and Andy Dolan . Using confidential patient information from a controversial new NHS database for commercial purposes is to be barred in law. In an attempt to rescue the scheme, which has stalled amid widespread concern about potential threats to privacy, Jeremy Hunt will next week unveil a series of concessions. Crucially, the Health Secretary will promise legislation to prevent personal information being shared for any ‘purely commercial’ purpose, for example with insurance firms. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will next week unveil a series of concessions to the Care.data scheme. He will promise legislation to prevent personal information being used for 'purely commercial' purposes, for example with insurance firms . A requirement that a patient’s opt-out must be respected will also be written into statute. Critics will welcome the concessions – but many insist the Government should go further and give patients the right to opt in, rather than requiring them to make the effort to opt out. The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted growing concerns among GPs and patients over the Care.data project, which was due to begin next month. Unless patients choose to opt out, confidential information about their illnesses, test results and medication will automatically be uploaded from their GP file to a central database. Data to be extracted from GP systems includes family history, vaccinations, referrals for treatment, diagnoses and information about prescriptions. Officials behind the £50million scheme say it will improve healthcare and promote medical advances, with  researchers using the information to spot trends and identify poor care. But critics have raised concerns that the data could be misused – for instance, by firms providing health care insurance and life cover or trying to target particular products. Now, in a significant move, government sources said new legislation would be introduced to prevent the Health and Social Care Information Centre from sharing personal information where there is not a ‘clear health or care benefit for people’. Anyone wishing to use the data will have to demonstrate an ‘ethical basis’ on which to do so before any application can be considered. This, the source said, puts ‘beyond doubt’ that identifiable or potentially identifiable patient data could be released to firms. Such a use of the information is expected to become an offence under data protection law. There will also be legislation to beef up the powers of an expert committee that advises Mr Hunt on releasing identifiable or potentially identifiable patient data. Dr Gordon Gancz, of King Edward Street surgery, Oxford, said: 'Jeremy Hunt is still missing the point though. The scheme still puts the onus on the public to opt out if they do not wish to be a part of this' A source close to the Health Secretary said: ‘The principles around this programme, which will bring real benefits to patients, are fundamentally right, and we completely support them. ‘But, alongside a new campaign from NHS England to explain the programme to the public and GPs, we also need to ensure that robust legislation is in place to address their concerns.’ Mr Hunt is understood to accept that certain critics, including some GPs, will still be unhappy, but argues an opt-in system would be pointless due to an expected lack of take-up. But one doctor, whose practice was threatened with closure for vowing to opt his patients out of the scheme, called on Mr Hunt to introduce an opt-in system. Dr Gordon Gancz, of King Edward Street surgery, Oxford, said: ‘At least by putting it on a statutory basis the Government will reassure many of those who have doubts. ‘Jeremy Hunt is still missing the point though. The scheme still puts the onus on the public to opt out if they do not wish to be a part of this, rather than reversing it and saying, “If you are happy with these conditions, please opt in”.’","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt set to promise legislation to prevent information being shared for 'purely commercial' purpose .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two of the victims of Texas high school teacher Brandon Ashley McDaniel have taken to the stand in the sexual assault case against the 38-year-old, sharing similar stories of the way McDaniel groomed them both into having sexual relations with him. McDaniel, a married man, is facing an 80-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to having sexual relations with five female students - one as as young as 14 - at Sam Houston High School in Arlington. A court has heard how McDaniel, who . resigned as chairman of the school's English department following his . arrest in February, used text messages to start up relationships with . the girls beginning in 2001. Brandon Ashley McDaniel, 38, had been accused of having sexual relationships with five students at Sam Houston High School in Arlington and could receive a maximum of 20 years in prison on each count . He has pleaded guilty to four charges and could receive a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count. One . of the victims, who is now 20 and attends Texas A&M University, . testified that she was 17 when McDaniel sent her texts that gradually . grew more sexual over time. He asked is she were a virgin and one message asked if she touched herself, the Star Telegram reported. 'One day in October, he kissed me,' she said. 'A full-blown, on the mouth kiss.' McDaniel also allegedly asked her if he was a bad person for wanting to kiss her. The court heard how, two days after the kissing incident, they started meeting after school in his maroon Dodge Durango. The girl would take his keys and go to the car, ducking down in the passenger seat and waiting for him to come. They would have oral sex in the car, she testified. McDaniel allegedly told her he had never cheated on his wife before. The next woman to testify Monday — now a 20-year-old University of Texas student — told the jury that McDaniel had said the same thing to her about never cheating on his wife. Scene: Brandon Ashley McDaniel was the chairman of the English department at Sam Houston High School in Arlington. He had sex with at least one student on the premises, according to the victims testimony, and met others in the parking lot . The woman called McDaniel 'a laid-back teacher' who did not dress professionally. The two exchanged cellphone numbers after McDaniel asked her to do the lighting for a school dance project. She claimed she soon got a message from him saying: 'Tell me your darkest fantasy.' One day while they were in the computer lab, McDaniel started kissing her. They played truth-or-dare in text messages and had oral sex in a classroom, she said. 'He said he had never cheated on his wife,' the woman said. Court affidavits filed upon McDaniel's arrest stated all sexual acts were consensual. One of the arrest affidavits, according to Star Telegram, alleged McDaniel's started a relationship with a 14-year-old. When she turned 15 she once spent the night at McDaniel's house when his wife was away, and he was also with the teen in her bed. When her mother suddenly came home, McDaniel's jumped out the window, the affidavit said. The case against Brandon Ashley McDaniel is being heard here, at Tarrant County Courthouse in Fort Worth, Texas . Both women who testified Monday said they initially did not want to take the stand. Both said their parents were not aware that they were testifying. One woman who testified had told police about having sex with McDaniel but then completely recanted and signed a statement for his defense attorneys saying she did not wish to prosecute. 'I thought all parties involved had equal responsibility and it was unfair for just him to be at fault,' she said. Alana Minton, a Tarrant County prosecutor working on the case, asked the woman if she wanted to be on the witness stand Monday. 'I had put this all behind me,' she said. 'This is just bringing it all back up.' McDaniel has asked the jury to recommend his punishment. He will be sentenced at a later date. The status of McDaniel's marriage remains unclear.","Brandon Ashley McDaniel, 38, allegedly had improper relations with five students during the course of his career at Sam Houston High School in Arlington, Texas .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The mummified remains found in a Tucson, Arizona manhole last month likely sat there for more than a year before being discovered, an autopsy has revealed. Investigators found an identification card belonging to a 51-year-old man on the body, but have yet to release a name pending DNA results. Tucson Electric Power crews discovered the body the morning of May 19, following a power outage. Death underground: Mummified remains were found in this Tucson, Arizona manhole last month, following a power outage. An autopsy report released this week revealed the body likely sat there for more than a year before it was found . Still a mystery: The report said the man likely died of electrocution. The remains were found with an identification card belonging to a 51-year-old man, but a name has not been released pending DNA results . It is believed the man died of electrocution since he was found holding a pair of bolt cutters in a high-voltage utility volt, near cut copper wires. The electricity it what caused the man's remains to become mummified. 'The amount of electricity that went through his body essentially cooked his body, and removed all of the moisture out of it,' Lt David Theel told KVOA. The damage done to the remains is what made it difficult to identify the man, who is thought to have died underground one to to years ago. The manhole was last officially opened in 2009. Last month, investigators were looking into identifying the man by re-hydrating his hands for fingerprinting, or dental records. The manhole is located at the intersection of Tanque Verde Rd and Tanque Verde Loop near a junior high school.

"By . Sean Poulter . A British engineering firm based on a remote Somerset farm are to help Facebook launch a network of solar-powered drones that will bring the internet to the remotest places on the planet. The US web giant has bought Ascenta, a tiny engineering company run by chief engineer Andrew Cox, for an estimated £12.5million. Mr Cox has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun. Unmaned: Experts will be working on new drones intended to fly 60,000ft above the earth for months at a time while beaming signals to the Third World (file picture) Its experts will now be working on drones intended to fly 60,000ft above the earth for months at a time to beam broadband signals to the Third World. Details of the plan were revealed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in a post on his personal page on the site and form part of a project called Internet.org set up to extend the reach of the internet. ‘In our effort to connect the whole world with Internet.org, we’ve been working on ways to beam internet to people from the sky,’ he wrote. ‘Today, we’re sharing some details of the work Facebook’s Connectivity Lab is doing to build drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone.’ New venture: The plans were announced by Mark Zuckerberg on his personal Facebook page today . The Connectivity Lab includes experts from Nasa working on what the company called ‘new aerospace and communications technologies’. Significantly, Facebook also announced that it had bought Ascenta, which was founded by five Britons who previously worked at major technology firms such as Boeing and Honeywell. Facebook did not provide any details of the British experts behind Ascenta, while the Somerset-based firm refused requests for interviews and referred questions to its new US owner. Facebook aims to use a mix of solar-powered aircraft and low-orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard-to-reach locations. The drones, flying at 60,000ft, will be capable of staying in the air for months at a time. They are relatively cheap will be best for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals. The drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on Earth. Low-orbit and geosynchronous satellites, which have orbits that match the Earth’s rotation and are effectively stationary, will cover more remote areas in Africa and Asia. The internet access would be transmitted in the form of free-space optical communication, or FSO, which transmits data using infrared laser beams. It was previously known as High Altitude Engineering and has only two directors, Mr Cox, 51, and his wife Helen. Mr Cox has had a long career in the aerospace industry. He was a key member of the team at British defence technology company Qinetiq that created the Zephyr drone that holds the record for an unmanned flight, which lasted two weeks. The team also includes experts who worked on the Breitling Orbiter, a balloon that was designed to circumnavigate the world. Yael Maguire, a director of engineering at Facebook, said Ascenta would join its team working on ‘connectivity aircraft’. ‘We’re looking at a new type of plane architecture that flies at roughly 20,000m, because that’s a point where winds are at their lowest, it’s above commercial airliners, it’s even above the weather, and actually it can stay in the air for months at a time,’ he said. ‘These planes are solar-powered and they sit there and circle around, and have the ability to broadcast internet down.’ Facebook helped found Internet.org last year with other major technology companies such as Samsung and Nokia. It offered no details on how far advanced the drone project was, or any timeframe for completion.","US web giants have bought Somerset-based engineering company Ascenta .

"By . Alex Greig . A New Jersey Walmart customer has become the owner of a number of fish she purchased after discovering a dozen dirty fish tanks filled with dead and dying fish at her local store. Donna Lohmeyer was with her young grandson when the pair went to look at the live fish at the Flanders Walmart outlet. Instead of happily swimming pet fish, Lohmeyer and her grandson came upon a nightmarish scene. Cruel: Fish were left to die in tanks without filtration or light in freezing temperatures . 'Most [of the fish] were dead, and rotting in the tanks... Many were still swimming — starving, freezing, choking on foul water full of ammonia and algae,' Lohmeyer told Mendham-Chester Patch. She says there was no power or filtration in any of the tanks, but they were still full of fish. Other customers in the live pets section of the store told Lohmeyer that the power had been off for more than a week.The water temperature in the tanks was 64 degrees, she said. Neglect: Other customers said the power had been off for more than a week and the tanks were full of dead fish . The disgusted customer asked to see the store's manager and was told he was unavailable. She then asked to see the pet department manager, who was 'on break.' After waiting more than an hour, Lohmeyer purchased the remaining 'least sick' fish to rescue them from the putrid tanks. Mendham-Chester Patch contacted Walmart's head office in Arkansas and was told the store had stopped selling live fish 'months ago.' Training: Walmart says it will retrain workers in the Flanders store in how to correctly care for live fish . Patch responded with pictures taken by Lohmeyer's daughter Dina of the tanks in their local Walmart. Walmart representative Kayla Whiting finally responded after receiving the pictures, saying, 'This is unacceptable.' 'There are protocols in place that were not followed, and associates [in the pet department] will be retrained immediately,' she told Patch. No Walmart staff members have been punished for the incident.","Donna Lohmeyer went to look at the live fish in the pet department of her New Jersey Walmart with her grandson .

An outgoing advertising executive known to his colleagues for his quick wit and hilarious one-liners hanged himself after taking drink and drugs to cope with a secret anxiety condition, an inquest has heard. To colleagues and friends Ian Wilkinson, 28, from Didsbury, Manchester, was well liked and appeared confident. But unbeknown to his employers the bachelor was struggling at home with severe depressive symptoms which dated back to his teenage years. An inquest heard that he would snort cocaine and go on drinking binges to deal with his severe anxiety problems. Manchester Coroner's Court heard that he also ran into debt with payday loan companies in an attempt to fund his habit. His parents - a doctor and a headmaster - paid £4,000 to bail him out. He was found hanged at the family home in Didsbury, Manchester, just hours after texting his GP mother Janet to say: 'You won’t have to worry about me much longer. I will be out of your hair soon.' The hearing in Manchester was told that the Mr Wilkinson had been a talented writer who colleagues said had a  'wicked sense of humour.' But . the hearing he had been confiding to his mother about his . reliance on alcohol to aid his anxiety and was referred to a private . mental health hospital for treatment. PC . Stephen McGonigle who investigated his death told the hearing: 'Ian . presented a confident persona but wanted to have a steady girlfriend. His relationships didn’t last long. 'His . salary led to binge drinking. He was prescribed anti-depressants but . admitted to his mother he was taking cocaine while on them. 'He . worked throughout but the drinking continued. He could go days or weeks . without alcohol but would then binge for several days. 'In . February 2013 he confided that he was in debt to a payday loan company . for £4,000 having borrowed £1,200. His parents paid it. 'He . was using cocaine to overcome his anxiety. His social life since . leaving university was not great and he would drink on his own.' But Manchester Coroner's Court heard that the bachelor was struggling at home with severe depressive symptoms which dated back to his teenage years . After graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University with a Masters degree in International Public Relations, he got a series of administration jobs before accepting a post as PR & Social Media Executive at Access Advertising in 2012. On his LinkedIn page he said: 'Really enjoying my new job, the people and the ""can do"" attitude that we have in the office. 'It’s nice to go to work in the morning and enjoy it, I never really thought I’d say that. Can’t wait to learn more and hopefully I can use my thirst for more knowledge to help the company to continue the great PR work we do.' Mr Wilkinson went to Malaysia to visit his father Donald Wilkinson who is currently headmaster of the independent Bearwood College in Wokingham, Surrey but who at the time was working as an acting headteacher at a school in Asia. During the visit he seemed happy and back to his normal self but on his return he fell back into depression where he would drink and take cocaine alone. The court was told that tragedy struck in June last year after his mother went to work, . PC McGonigle added: 'She phoned him while at work but he didn’t reply. She then rang his work and was told he hadn’t arrived. At 1pm he text to say he was ok. She asked why he wasn’t at work but he said he was. 'She considered going home at lunch but decided against it as she was working at the surgery. 'Having finished at 8pm she went home. Upon arrival she found herself in trepidation as to what she may find and thought he would be in a coma or hanging. The hearing in Manchester was told that the Mr Wilkinson had been a talented writer who colleagues said had a 'wicked sense of humour' 'Once Janet had found him inside she called the police and told them she was a GP and she knew he was dead.' Mr Wilkinson was found dressed in his work clothes at the time of his death, after he had promised to go into the office. Toxicology tests showed he was the equivalent of four-and-a-half times the legal drink driving limit when he died. Recording an open conclusion, Manchester assistant coroner Fiona Borrill said the alcohol coupled with no suicide note led her to believe it was not clear whether Ian intended to kill himself at the time. She told the family: 'Can I offer my sincere sympathies in this terrible situation you have found yourselves in.' In a statement Ian’s family said: 'Ian was a lovely, kind, genuinely nice man and had friends from all .

'Ian didn’t judge people on their background or their academic abilities and we have had such heart warming letters from all those whose paths he crossed. His kind words or deeds had really touched them and he never sought praise for these. 'Ian had a phenomenal general knowledge and this all came to him so effortlessly, but he was always happy to help others who did not find work so easy. Most of all, Ian had such a quick wit and would make us laugh with his impressions and one-liners. He has been the life and soul of so many parties. 'Sadly, Ian developed severe anxiety and depressive symptoms in his teenage years and these overwhelming feelings of fear and low mood, blighted his life thereafter.' A tribute from Ian’s employers and colleagues at Access Advertising said: 'Ian was the life and soul of the office, a well-loved colleague with a wicked sense of humour. 'He was a talented writer and an even better story teller. Sadly, Ian was troubled by anxiety and depressive symptoms and recently lost his battle with mental health problems.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The Trojan Horse plot to take over Birmingham schools is driven by the same 'warped' Islamic extremism as Nigerian terror group Boko Harem, Tony Blair claimed this morning. Mr Blair said the alleged plot by Muslim hardliners in Birmingham was part of a wider global problem of 'extremism based on a warped and abusive view of a religion'. Six Birmingham schools were placed in special measures after the education watchdog Ofsted unearthed damning evidence that school children were being left at risk of being radicalised. Tony Blair this morning likened the alleged Trojan Horse Islamic plot to take over Birmingham schools to the Nigerian terror network Boko Harem . Mr Blair said the scandal showed Britain had a problem with extremism - like Nigeria had with Boko Harem, the terror network which sparked global outrage after kidnapping hundreds of school girls. He said the issue was part of a wider narrative of religious extremism that had to be met head on . The former PM said: 'I have a very clear view of this. There is a fundamental problem that we face that may have originated in this region but has now spread across the world. 'And that problem is extremism based on a warped and abusive view of a religion. 'It is a problem here in the region, it's a problem in countries like Pakistan, it's a problem in the far East. 'We can see from Nigeria and Boko Haram it's a problem in African countries and it's a problem in our own society as we can see from the issue of the Birmingham schools. 'What we need to do is not a question of simply reasserting British values. We have to assert the strong values of religious respect and tolerance for difference. 'In other words, to say that the only way the only way a modern economy and a modern society can work is if people of different faiths learn to live with each other, respect each other and treat each other equally and fairly. 'And any politics that is based on a view that ""this is my religion, or this is my view of my religion and if you don't agree then you're my enemy"", that is the ideology that we have to attack and root out.' David Cameron reacted to the revelations that Muslim hardliners had tried to take over a number of Birmingham schools by announcing a drive to 'teach British values' to all children . Dave Hughes, Vice Chairman of Park View School - one of the academies put in special measures - attacked the Ofsted findings . The controversial intervention came after David Cameron called for UK Muslims to be more British in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal. Mr Cameron said extremism and division was flourishing because of a 'worrying' failure to push British values. He said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the Magna Carta. The Prime Minister's intervention came after teachers were told by the Education Secretary Michael Gove that they must in future 'actively promote British values'. Home Secretary Theresa May and the Education Secretary Michael Gove fell out over the Government's response to Islamic extremists . Mr Cameron said these values would include 'a belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law'. Writing in the Mail on Sunday he said these values were 'as British as the Union Flag, as football, as fish and chips. He added that it was 'not an option' for anyone living in this country not to live by them. He also suggested that any move away from the 'Western model' of democracy and free enterprise would threaten Britain's economic success. Mr Cameron said: 'In recent years we have been in danger of sending out a worrying message: that if you don't want to believe in democracy, that's fine; that if equality isn't your bag, don't worry about it; that if you're completely intolerant of others, we will still tolerate you. 'This has not just led to division, it has also allowed extremism - of both the violent and non-violent kind - to flourish,"" he said in the article. 'We need to be far more muscular in promoting British values and the institutions that uphold them. 'A genuinely liberal country believes in certain values, actively promotes them and says to its citizens: this is what defines us as a society.' Mr Cameron said it was 'a matter of pride and patriotism' to promote British values and history and urged people to stop being 'squeamish' about doing so. 'As President Obama put it when he addressed MPs and peers in Parliament, ""What began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the world"".' Celebrations are planned next year to mark 800 years since King John signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede which established for the first time that the king was subject to the law. Mr Cameron said they will now include lessons for all pupils. Mr Gove believed Mrs May was not doing enough to take on fanatics . 'The remaining copies of that charter may have faded, but its principles shine as brightly as ever, and they paved the way for the democracy, the equality, the respect and the laws that make Britain, Britain. 'So I want to use this upcoming 800th anniversary as an opportunity for every child to learn about the Magna Carta, for towns to commemorate it, for events to celebrate it.' Mr Gove pledged 'decisive action' after schools inspector Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham's schools. Inspections conducted following claims of a takeover plot by hardline Muslims found that a 'culture of fear and intimidation' has developed in some schools. A poll by Opinium for the Observer showed that 58 per cent of voters believe faith schools should not receive taxpayer funding, or be closed altogether. It found three quarters are concerned there is a serious risk pupils could be encouraged to adopt extremist views in predominantly Muslim schools. Most, 56 per cent, also thought all faith schools should not be allowed to teach only their own religion. None of those which faced inspections over the 'Trojan Horse' allegations were faith schools but shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said he would like cross-party talks on the issue. 'Events in Birmingham have raised questions about faith, multiculturalism and state education and in the aftermath this is the moment to think about discussing, on a cross-party basis, how we manage potential tensions, particularly in urban districts,' he told the newspaper. He called for strong powers for Ofsted to inspect teaching of religion and backed the idea that schools should teach about other faiths.","Former PM says plot to take over Birmingham schools part of global problem .

"By . Emma Thomas . Heather Mills has dramatically quit the UK disabled skiing team after allegedly 'lunging' at an official who told her she couldn't wear a specially-adapted boot. Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife reportedly screamed 'you bitch, you bitch' at Sylvana Mestre who is technical head at the International Paralympic Committee after she was told the boot she was wearing for a competition in Pitztal, Austria, wasn't approved by the organisation.

This morning, the BBC reports the International Paralympic Committee may take disciplinary action against Heather Mills. They say she 'verbally abused' and 'physically harassed' the official. The mother-of-one was preparing herself for the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games after she was offered a trial on the ski team's development squad in 2010. She was about to qualify for a place in next year's Paralympic Games but says she was told she would be disqualified. She was told she must wear a cover . over her boot and prosthetic leg to comply with international rules. In a statement, she said she was withdrawing and said the boot she would have to wear would add weight and was painful. Despite . Mills’ World Cup skiing success, she struggled through her . qualification for the Paralympics – with problems including being . ‘ejected’ from her prosthetic leg when practising slalom. In the . summer, she had a new leg and boot design created by London Prosthetics . Centre to help reduce the problem.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Internet connections between Syria and the outside world were cut off for at least 20 hours, according to data from Google and other global Internet companies. Google's Transparency Report showed traffic to Google services pages from the country, embroiled in a civil war that has lasted more than two years, suddenly stopping shortly before 7pm on Tuesday. Other firms such as Akamai also revealed a total block on traffic. Scroll down for video . Traffic monitoring company Akamai also recorded the moment when Syrian internet was cut off on Tuesday. This chart shows the traffic dipping slightly just before 7pm and dropping completely. The traffic was not restored for at least four hours, and is not fully back online now . Syria was without internet access for three days in November last year. While the government attributed the loss of the internet and cellphone service to 'terrorists', experts said the progressive shutdown of connectivity could only have been orchestrated by a central authority. During the November blackout the Syrian people also lost telephone services. It is still unclear if phone service was cut off across the country in the latest shutdown. There was also a smaller blackout in January, but it only affected certain parts of the country and may have been caused by damage to cables due to fighting. Google and Akamai's traffic reports continued to show no activity there about 20 hours after the drop-off. Full service has now been restored. This is the second time the country . has experienced a web blackout in the past six months, with no-one . claiming responsibility at this time. 'We've seen this twice before,' said Christine Chen, Google's senior manager for free expression. 'This happened in Syria last November and in Egypt during the Arab Spring.' It . is virtually impossible to definitely determine the cause of such . disruptions unless a party claims responsibility, experts said. In the past, Syria's government and the rebels fighting to topple it have traded blame. Google's data showed traffic disruptions limited to Syria and spanning the entire country. Shutting an entire nation from the Internet is possible because IP addresses, individual connections established by each device, are geographically specific and the government has control over the country's Internet service providers. The vast majority of websites within Syria were rendered unreachable as well, other experts said, as the county appeared to shut itself off. As during Arab Spring disruptions, Google said its Speak2Tweet service, which broadcasts voice messages, was up and running in Syria for people with access to a phone. 'Effectively, the shutdown disconnects Syria from Internet communication with the rest of the world. It's unclear whether Internet communication within Syria is still available,' wrote Dan Hubbard, chief technology officer at infrastructure services firm OpenDNS.' Internet traffic in Syria took a sudden dip at around 7pm on Tuesday and Google's Transparency Report found that web access had been cut off across the country. Services were out for at least four hours and its unclear how much of the service has been restored. Syria experienced a three-day blackout last November. 'Although we can't yet comment on what caused this outage, past incidents were linked to both government-ordered shutdowns and damage to the infrastructure, which included fiber cuts and power outages.' Hubbard wrote on an OpenDNS blog that a similar internet blackout in Syria occurred in November and lasted three days. About 80 internet pathways normally are listed by Syrian providers, but only three were being advertised to machines searching for connections late on Tuesday. Jim Cowie, chief technology officer at Renesys, a U.S. company that tracks global Internet traffic, said the outage looked similar to the one seen last November. 'The outage took place very quickly, was seen throughout the world, and (with a few small technical exceptions) covers the entire Syrian internet,' Cowie said in an email to Reuters. 'We don't see any effects in neighboring countries, and we don't see anything to suggest that the outage was caused by damage to one or another of the several cables that connect Syria with the outside world,' he added. Neither Syria's ambassador to the United States nor the country's envoy to the United Nations could be reached for immediate comment. No comment was immediately available from the Pentagon. The Center for Democracy & Technology in December condemned the previous network shutdown in Syria, calling it an 'indefensible violation of human rights' and a 'dangerous and desperate interruption of the free flow of information.""

"By . Aap . The mobile phone of Gerard Baden-Clay was connected in the early hours of the morning he reported his wife missing, but the murder-accused told police he was in bed sleeping, a court has heard. Crown prosecutors have closed their case against Baden-Clay on the tenth day of his trial in Brisbane. Passages from his wife's Allison Baden-Clay's diary were also read out during the day. Prosecutor Todd Fuller also read out a number of admissions that have been accepted as facts. One was that Baden-Clay's phone was connected up to a charger at 1.48am on April 20, 2012, and was removed at 6.18am. The former real estate agent reported his wife missing from their Brookfield home in Brisbane's west at 7.15am that day. A Brisbane court was some photographs of Allison Baden-Clay's diary, which contained lists of questions seemingly about her husband's affair . Baden-Clay told police during recorded interviews that were played to the jury that he went to bed about 10pm (AEST) the previous night, leaving his wife watching TV. He told police he was a heavy sleeper and didn't hear whether his wife came to bed, but when he woke up she wasn't in the house. Ten days later her body was found on a creek bed in Anstead, 13km away. Mr Fuller went on to say it was also a fact that Mrs Baden-Clay contacted a life insurance broker on April 17, 2012, about her and her husband's life insurance policies. She wanted to reduce the sum insured and the premiums. On May 1, 2012, Baden-Clay contacted a life insurance company to determine how a claim could be made on his wife's policy, Mr Fuller said. The diary included questions like 'How paid for hotels?' and 'Did she ever say - I feel bad because you're married?' 'Find whole thing dirty... still get sick in stomach,' Allison wrote in the diary, which police found underneath her bedside table . The prosecutor also said it was a fact that no payments were made towards a credit card in the couple's name between January 24, 2012, and May 13, 2012. Two days before she was reported missing Allison Baden-Clay wrote in her diary that she felt 'dirty' and 'sick' about her husband's affair. Jurors in Gerard Baden-Clay's murder trial have been shown photographs of pages of his wife's diary, which was recovered by police from under her bedside table. The entry included a dot-point list over two pages of questions from Ms Baden-Clay, which seem to concern her husband's affair with colleague Toni McHugh. Many of the questions were crossed out. 'Drive together - seats down - lie there afterwards - how many times - do afterwards,' part of the handwritten entry read. 'How paid for hotels? Did she ever say I feel bad because you're married? 'How many people in office knew that you knew? How did that feel?' The diary continued: 'Really hurt - had so many opportunities to tell me - let me believe that it was all my fault and therefore I was at your mercy. 'Forced me to bow to you. Think that's where you wanted me.' Further apparent questions for Baden-Clay were do you regret the whole thing or just being caught' and 'were you prepared to live with the guilt if I hadn't found out'. The last words were: 'Find whole thing dirty - maybe I'm prudent (sic)? - still get sick in stomach.' The court also heard that Allison's DNA was found in the boot of the couple's car. The sample came from a blood stain in the boot of the car . The entry also included a hand-drawn floor plan of an apartment which the court has previously heard was Ms McHugh's, scribbles that looked like children's drawings and entries dating back to 2010, including 'My Gratitude List' and 'Daily Disciplines'. Baden-Clay has pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife who went missing from their west Brisbane home in Brookfield on April 20, 2012. Her body was discovered ten days later on a creek bed in Anstead, 13km away. The court also heard today that Allison Baden-Clay's DNA was found in a car she owned with her husband. A forensic scientist has told the Gerard Baden-Clay trial she tested a swab taken from a blood stain police found in the couple's Holden Captiva. 'The complete DNA profile obtained from the sample matched the reference DNA profile of Allison Baden-Clay,' Queensland Health forensic scientist Amanda Reeves told the Supreme Court. She said the probability of the DNA belonging to someone else not related to the mother-of-three was one-in-5600 billion. The DNA didn't match Mrs Baden-Clay's children, parents or brother, she said. The court has heard police found the blood stain and a hair on an inside rear panel of the car on April 22, 2014, two days after Baden-Clay reported his wife missing. Toni McHugh, Gerard Baden-Clay's former mistress, gave evidence to the court last week . The stain was located above the rear wheel arch next to a row of seats that could be folded down to make the boot larger. Ms Reeves said tests on swabs taken from Mrs Baden-Clay's fingernails showed possible DNA from a second contributor but the levels were too low for interpretation. Other forensic experts have previously told the court that injuries on Gerard Baden-Clay's face, noticed the day he reported his wife missing, looked like fingernail scratches. Ms Reeves also said a swab taken from a towel in the bathroom of the couple's house matched Gerard Baden-Clay's DNA profile. The court has previously heard a towel in the bathroom showed a positive reaction to blood. Other areas of the house tested showed DNA levels too low for interpretation, Ms Reeves said. Sergeant Brett Schnitzerling said he was photographing the car's interior on April 22, 2012 when he noticed the blood stain and pointed it out to a forensic police officer. 'When I first viewed it, I would have thought it was a drink stain or something,' he said. The court heard police conducted a chemical test for blood which returned a positive result. A hair was also found at the base of the stain. Gerard Baden-Clay has pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife Allison two years ago .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Outrage: Parents have blasted the 'sexualised' pole dancing classes for children at LaKiTa Dance Academy . A pole dancing class for girls as young as six has sparked outrage as parents fear their daughters are being sexualised. Mothers have called to ban the weekend club - promoted as a type of 'gymnastics'. But coach Lauren Kenealy has rejected criticism, claiming 'it's got nothing to do with being sexual'. LaKiTa Dance Academy in Warrington, Cheshire, boasts champion pole dancers under the age of 13. The website features a video of the school's six-year-old champion pole dancing to Pound The Alarm by Nicki Minaj - a sexually explicit song. Sharing pictures of numerous other girls, the website encourages others to join 'to build core strength'. Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard blasted the activity as 'shocking'. She told MailOnline: 'Since when did pole dancing become an acceptable school sport? 'While the Pole Dancing Academies claim it’s nothing more than healthy exercise, why then do they need to dress up seven-year-olds in skimpy outfits and a full face of make-up, or let four-year-olds in reception class parade around a pole? 'If it’s exercise you’re after, just let kids run races on the school playground or sports field in normal shorts and a T-shirt. 'Pole dancing is a skill and for an adult it can be a brilliant and fun way to keep fit. But it’s simply not something we should be encouraging infant and junior kids to do. 'Young children don’t understand the sexual overtones of the moves and copying them could leave them very vulnerable to exploitation. 'UK schoolgirls are already facing unprecedented pressures at a very young age. They need time to still be children, not be force to be overly body-conscious.

Lauren Kenealy, 26, who runs the . classes, told The Sun: 'It is just like gymnastics but using a different . piece of apparatus. It's got nothing to do with being sexual.' Explicit: The website has video of a six-year-old dancing to Nicki Minaj's sexually explicit song Pound The Alarm . She added: 'To say it's sexualisation of children — that's totally not true. The kids just want to be monkeys.' Last week, there was uproar after a Kent-based pole dancing club showcased primary school dancers in gold hotpants at a school fete near Swanley, north Kent. To the outrage of one father, who wished to remain anonymous, the scantily-clad children contorted themselves around the pole in the centre of the courtyard to songs from Frozen and The Lion King. 'Young children don't understand the sexual overtones of the moves, copying them could leave them very vulnerable to exploitation' - Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums . He said: 'A lot of people were upset about it. They were performing a routine to music in inappropriate clothing and they had children doing it and I just thought, ""this is so wrong"". 'One of the ladies that was performing it was wearing a crop top with one of the shoulder sleeves missing - it was quite revealing. 'The shorts they had on showed more than they should and a lot of people were leaving as a result of it.' He added: 'I don't think it would have been as bad if they had been more appropriately dressed. 'If it was a leotard, fair enough, but for what they were wearing, and having their faces made up, it just wasn't right. I felt like I was entering something quite unsavoury.' Headteacher Sarah Warshow said they had invited Revolutions Pole Academy, based in nearby Hextable, to perform at the school fete. The youngest performer was just four and there was also a solo show from a 12-year-old who performed to Holding Out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler.","LaKiTa Dance Academy, Cheshire, has had champions as young as six .

"By . Andy Dolan . 'Disappointed': Jeremy Bowen, the BBC's Middle East editor, spoke of his anger at the blunder . BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen has revealed that his sick father was wrongly denied food and water at an NHS hospital. Mr Bowen, the corporation’s Middle East editor, spoke of his anger at the blunder on Twitter yesterday. He told his 85,000 followers that his father Gareth, who has dementia and is bedridden, was classed as ‘nil by mouth’ after an apparent staff error. The pensioner went in to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, with suspected pneumonia on Thursday night. Mr Bowen, 54, wrote: ‘Univ Hospital Wales didn’t give my 84 yr old father food & water when there with chest infection. In error was “nil by mouth”.’ He later added: ‘My father now back at his care home in Cardiff after my brother and sister realised what was happening.’ Last night he explained that his father had been complaining of thirst, but his brother Matthew, 50, noticed his bottle of Ribena had not been opened. He discovered Mr Bowen senior had been mistakenly classed ‘nil by mouth’. Mr Bowen said: ‘My father had no food or liquid for more than 24 hours. Tweet: Mr Bowen told his 85,000 Twitter followers that his father Gareth was classed as 'nil by mouth' ‘The hospital have accepted that there was an error made at ward level. It is just disappointing that a man of 84 didn’t receive better care than this.’ He said that his father had worked with Labour MP Ann Clwyd at BBC Wales in the 1960s. In December 2012, Miss Clwyd told how she found her dying husband, Owen Roberts, lying ‘like a battery hen’ against the bars of his bed at the hospital. She said nurses treated him with ‘resentment, indifference and even contempt’. Admission: The pensioner went in to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff (pictured), with suspected pneumonia on Thursday night . Mr Bowen, of South London, returned from the Middle East last week. He said he will travel to Cardiff today in the wake of the ‘concerning’ blunder. 'The hospital have accepted that there was an error made at ward level. It is just disappointing that a man of 84 didn’t receive better care than this' Jeremy Bowen . His other brother, Nicholas, 52, a QC, said: ‘My father has vascular dementia and has been very poorly. We have had a series of extremely unfortunate interactions with the Welsh NHS. ‘He’s now getting exceptionally good care as a result of decisions being made by the social services. My father had been transferred to the hospital and my brother, Matthew, discovered he had been without food or water all day. ‘Apparently the staff had been calling my father by the wrong name too. Previous case: Mr Bowen said that his father had worked with Labour MP Ann Clwyd (left) at BBC Wales in the 1960s. In December 2012, Miss Clwyd told how she found her dying husband, Owen Roberts (together, right), lying 'like a battery hen' against the bars of his bed at the same hospital . ‘As a result of having no food or water my father’s cognitive state had deteriorated enormously. Matthew raised merry hell and within two-and-a-half hours my father was back at the care home. ‘It begs the question what may have happened if he hadn’t visited?’ Mr Bowen senior, a former South Wales Echo reporter, was one of the first on the scene of the Aberfan disaster in October 1966, in which a colliery tip collapsed on to a village primary school, killing 144 people, most of them children. A spokesman for the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: ‘We are very sorry to hear of the concerns outlined in Mr Bowen’s tweet and an investigation into the very serious issue he raises is already underway. We are, therefore, not in a position to comment further.’","BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reveals fury at mistake on Twitter .

"By . Julie Cook . To look at Karen Browning taking her children to the park, you would think she was the picture of a healthy young mother. But the truth is that every step she takes causes her agony through her pelvis, bottom and legs.'It's hard to explain to people just how much pain I am in,' says Karen, 26. She has had a fractured pelvis for more than three years. But this didn't happen because of a car accident - it occurred during childbirth. Karen Browning from Ballybeen, Northern Ireland with her sons Saul, 3, and Cohen, 2 . Karen's problems started when she was five months pregnant with her first child Saul, now three. She began getting a stabbing pain in her pelvic area and reported it to her midwife. 'She told me all first-time mums-to-be got twinges and that it was normal,' says  Karen, a full-time mother from Dundonald, Northern Ireland. But as her pregnancy progressed, the pain worsened and was sometimes so bad she couldn't get out of bed. Six months into her pregnancy, she went to her GP who explained that, as the body prepared for labour, the ligaments loosened so the pelvis could 'open up' for birth - this could lead to a condition called pelvic arthropathy, or pelvic girdle pain, a common problem affecting one in five pregnant women. She was told the pain would vanish after childbirth. Painkillers were not an option because of the potential harm to her unborn child. 'My mum had to ask for a wheelchair for hospital appointments as I was in too much pain to walk. My partner had to lift me on and off the bed. It was hell,' she says. After the birth of her first child Karen saw her GP four times, only to be told her pain levels were 'normal' By the time Karen went into labour, the pain was acute. 'I explained I had severe pelvic pain and would have trouble pushing. I couldn't even climb on to the delivery bed. But the midwives made me feel as if I was a silly girl,' she says. Despite her pleas, Karen was told to push. 'I had gas and air, but the agony was unbearable. Every time I bore down, I felt as if my pelvis would snap.' After an hour of pushing, a doctor recommended a forceps delivery. After two attempts, Saul was born. But he had breathing problems and was taken to the special care baby unit. After two days, he was allowed home - but Karen, still in severe pain, was in hospital for a week. Just holding Saul was agony. Over the next three months she saw her GP four times, only to be told her pain levels were 'normal after childbirth' and she didn't need treatment. Karen was referred to a physiotherapist, who taught her pelvic floor exercises and gave her a belt  to support her back, but nothing helped. Then when Saul was eight months old, Karen discovered she was pregnant again. 'Instead of feeling elated, I was terrified - not of labour pains, but because of my pelvis,' she says. 'This time the pain was even worse.' After Karen gave birth to her second son, Kohen, she regularly went to her GP. 'I knew there was something very wrong and that my pelvis was damaged in some way, but no one would listen. I lost count of how many times I asked for help,' she says. Finally, when Kohen was six weeks old, she changed doctors and was sent for an X-ray. This revealed she had a fractured pelvis - and that the fracture was two-and-a-half years old - the same age as her first-born Saul. The doctors could tell how old the fracture was from the way the bones had set. 'I was stunned. I'd been walking around on a fractured pelvis for more than two years. I was furious. Why had it taken so long for someone to believe me?' Karen believes her pelvis was becoming more damaged during pregnancy and that the rough delivery caused the final fracture. She has since seen a specialist surgeon who has said that if she had been referred to him immediately after birth, he could have helped her by putting pins in her pelvis, but now there is nothing that can be done. Her pelvis has set in the way it was when the fracture took place, leaving her in constant pain.'I go to the chronic pain clinic for painkillers, which I take every day and some days I have to use crutches,' she says. She's also suffered a prolapsed womb as a result of lack of pelvic support, and is on antidepressants. 'I've been told I will be in pain for life, that nothing can be done. I can't walk some days. I can't play with my children. Some days I can't even get them dressed. 'I believe that if I'd been listened to at the start this could have been avoided.' A woman knows her own body and can tell when it is not 'one of those things', says Joe Aquilina, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at St Bartholomew's and the Royal London Hospital. And while fractures such as that Karen suffered are rare - as well as pain there would usually be warning signs such as needing crutches - if a woman does experience severe pelvic pain, she should be assessed and considered for a caesarean delivery. 'Sometimes, because a woman is pregnant, things get fobbed off and not given the right importance,' says Mr Aquilina. 'The trouble is we don't do  X-rays in pregnancy because of dangers to the foetus, so often the real cause can be missed.' Karen takes painkillers every day and some days she has to use crutches. She's also suffered a prolapsed womb . When Kate Beddard, then six months pregnant, suddenly experienced searing pain in her hips while running for a train, she assumed, like many women do, that it was 'normal' in pregnancy. Kate, then 26, was working as a nurse - 'I knew ligaments softened in preparation for childbirth, so I thought I'd just pulled a ligament,' she says. But within three weeks she could barely walk. Her GP put her on bed rest. The pain worsened and a week later she was admitted to hospital; she needed a walking frame just to go to the bathroom. Doctors kept telling Kate all would be well once the baby  was born. 'They kept trying to discharge me, but I kept refusing. I was a trained nurse and knew something was very wrong. The pain in my hips was agony,' she says. She remained in hospital and five days before her due date, she was induced. She was given an epidural, but after the delivery - which was rushed, leaving her baby, Hannah, with a broken collarbone - it wore off and the pain hit Kate like a brick wall. 'It was much, much worse than before the birth,' she says. 'But the doctors told me to ""concentrate more on my baby and less on myself"". The general feeling was that I was an over-anxious first- time mum and that pain was par for the course after childbirth.' Fractures such as that Karen suffered are rare but if a woman does experience severe pelvic pain, she should be assessed . A day after the birth, a consultant sent Kate for an X-ray, which revealed a fractured hip. At first she was told it might be bone cancer. Numb with shock, Kate began writing a will and talking to her family about her funeral wishes. Eight days later a consultant told her she didn't have cancer. Six weeks after Hannah's birth, Kate was diagnosed with pregnancy-associated osteoporosis. This condition, when the bones weaken, is rare and usually occurs only in a first pregnancy. It is thought some women may need extra vitamin D and calcium. Kate was kept in hospital for three months, had pins placed in her hips and was told the fracture would knit together. But this did not happen and it was the start of a long and arduous ordeal, leaving her with arthritis and one leg much shorter than the other because her femur had become misshapen through walking on it. 'I was told I had the bones of an 84-year-old,' she says. At last, in 2012 - 24 years after her fracture - Kate, now 51, had a hip replacement and can now stand for longer. Like Karen, Kate believes doctors are too eager to fob off pregnant and post-natal women when they complain of serious ligament or bone pain. She believes that if she had been listened to during her pregnancy, though her fracture might still have happened, she would not have had to endure so much trauma and distress. 'I've met so many women who had fractured their hips or spine, but were not listened to because the professionals believed pain was normal during and after birth.' nos.org.uk.","Every step Karen Browning, 26, from Northern Ireland, takes causes agony .

"By . Sheron Boyle . Life was looking up for 18-year-old Wayne Jowett as he saw in the New Year with his friends. The handsome teen had been in remission with leukaemia for six months and had just two bouts of chemotherapy left to go. He was looking forward to playing rugby and hockey again, had passed his driving test and was proving popular with girls. The apprentice mechanic also had plans to work in New Zealand. But all that came to a stop just four days later when a doctor wrongly ordered that the powerful chemotherapy drug, vincristine, should be injected into Wayne's spine instead of a vein. This mistake by Dr Feda Mulhem cost Wayne his life. It slowly destroyed his spinal cord and nerves, killing him a month later. A doctor wrongly ordered that the powerful chemotherapy drug, vincristine, should be injected into 18-year-old Wayne's spine instead of a vein - costing Wayne his life . His father and mother could only watch helplessly. At one point, Wayne was in such pain he begged for mercy. 'In the final minutes before he lost consciousness, Wayne looked up at me as I held him in my arms,' says his mother Stella. 'He cried: “Mum, what have they done to me? Am I dying?” ' Wayne died a few days before his 19th birthday. Nearly 13 years later, Stella, 53, weeps as she recalls his final days. Dr Mulhem pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for eight months. Between 1975 and 2001, 14 patients died after the same fatal chemotherapy error. In 2001, an official inquiry made 50 recommendations to prevent similar tragedies. Led by Professor Brian Toft, emeritus professor of patient safety at Coventry University, the inquiry called for separate storage areas for spinal and intravenous drugs, and different times for dispensing them. All but one of the recommendations have been put in place. But alarmingly, a similar tragedy could still easily happen again, warns Professor Toft. It's down to the health service dragging its feet over changing its reliance on a simple plastic device, known as a Luer connector. Luer connectors attach syringes, catheters and needles into drips in a patient's vein, spine, muscle or skin . This small tube-like connector is the standard means of attaching syringes, catheters and needles into drips in a patient's vein, spine, muscle or under their skin. The universal, fit-all connectors have been used in hospitals since they were designed in 1896. They are part of 700,000 spinal and epidural procedures each year, as well as countless intravenous drips. Thanks to the implementation of 49 of Professor Toft's recommendations, there have been no more fatal chemotherapy errors  in Britain since Wayne's death. However, there have been deaths due to other drugs being administered via the wrong route, says Professor Toft. In 2004, Mayra Carbrera, a 30-year-old theatre nurse, suffered a fatal heart attack an hour after giving birth to her son Zachary at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, where she worked. Instead of a saline solution to help her blood pressure, the powerful anaesthetic bupivacaine was administered via an intravenous drip (this drug should not be given in this way). The hospital was fined £100,000. To prevent these wrong route  errors, in 2009 the health watchdog the National Patient Safety  Agency advised the NHS to switch to safer non-Luer connectors (NLCs). Developed and invented in Britain, these cost the same as the old devices, but their special lock design means medicines intended to be injected into a vein can't be put into the spine and vice versa. 'It is the equivalent to stopping you putting diesel in a petrol car - except we are talking about human life,' says Professor Toft, who is chairman of the NHS England reference group for safer neuraxial (spinal) devices. The NHS set a target date of April 2012 for all hospitals to get the new connectors, yet figures show just 70 trusts in England are using them - 90 still do not. Not a single trust in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland uses them. 'We are the world leader in this new equipment, but the trusts say they are waiting until the Geneva-based International Standards Organisation publishes its seal of approval for a non-Luer connector, but that could take years,' says Professor Toft. 'Yet the safer connector could be used in every hospital today. The delay in bringing in a simple life-saving solution is frustrating.' In just one year in England and Wales, there were 19 reports of  wrong route errors. Professor Toft warns: 'The NHS could be sued for clinical negligence if a patient dies and a trust has not used an NLC. Wayne Jowett Senior with Stella Brackenbury, mother of Wayne Jowett who died on January 4 . 'There is a need for action before  another Wayne Jowett tragedy happens.' Behind Professor Toft's 11-year campaign to improve safety in this area is a pledge he made to Wayne's father, also called Wayne, and Stella. 'They are a lovely family and what their son went through was heart-rending. I promised them I would do my utmost to ensure another person would not die like him.' Wayne first became ill in the summer of 1999, coming home early from a night out because he was feeling shattered. 'He slept most of the weekend and on Monday, when he couldn't lift his head off the pillow, we called the GP,' says Stella, who lives in Keyworth, Notts. 'He took one look at him, did a blood test and said: “Get him to the hospital now.” ' His father recalls the day they found out Wayne had leukaemia. 'I told him he had cancer, but it was treatable. He cried, but when he asked “Am I going to get through this, Dad?”, I said: “Of course you are” and gave him a cuddle,' says Wayne senior, 54. 'Somehow we coped with each stage of treatment. He never complained - he was a lovely lad.' For Wayne's penultimate chemo-therapy session, he was due to be given two anti-cancer drugs:  cytosine, to be injected into the spine that day, January 4, 2001; and vincristine, injected into a vein the next day. But after just two days working at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, registrar Dr Mulhem didn't read the warnings on the syringe of vincristine that stated it was for intravenous (into the vein) use only. Nor did he look at Wayne's medical records. Instead, he ordered a junior doctor to put both drugs into Wayne's spine. The junior asked him twice if this was correct, a nurse also challenged him and even Wayne quizzed him about it as he'd had these treatments before. Despite this, Dr Mulhem ordered the junior doctor to go ahead. Only after this had been done did he read the drugs chart. Staff in the intensive care unit tried desperately to flush out the drug, injecting fluids into the top of Wayne's spine and placing a drain at the bottom, but it didn't work. 'The vincristine sent his whole body into agonising cramps and he was screaming in pain,' says his father. 'About six staff were holding him down in bed as he was trying to get out of it, begging us to help him. 'I pleaded with them to give him something, but they said they couldn't as they would not be able to assess how bad the situation was. I held him firmly while trying to reassure him he would be OK.' Wayne's parents were then called into the intensive care consultant's office, where he told them bluntly that their son was going to die. 'He told us a pinprick of the drug is enough to paralyse you - Wayne had the full quota. It clings to the muscles and can't be flushed out. He said Wayne had no chance,' says his father. Wayne Jowett (left) aged 16 with his brother Simon aged 14 . Within the next few days, their son lost all feeling in his legs and was paralysed from the waist down. As Wayne was 18, the medics said he had to be told he was dying. His father was against this, but Stella decided she owed it to her son to be honest. 'We believe he would have got over the cancer and I felt he had a right to know what the hospital had done to him,' she says. As he lapsed into a coma, she told him: 'I am so sorry, but they have poisoned you.' Wayne's final words were: 'Get the b******s for me, Mum.' After he lost consciousness, his parents maintained a 24-hour vigil, reassuring him, playing his favourite Oasis tracks and telling him how much they loved him. Eventually, they agreed that his life-support machine should be turned off. Wayne died on February 2 as his parents clasped his hands. 'I would not want anyone, parent or child, to go through what we experienced,' says his father. Last month, Professor Toft met MP Stephen Dorrell, chairman of the Health Select Committee, and wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and other leading health chiefs, informing them there was an unacceptable delay in getting all trusts to use non-Luer connectors. 'Mr Dorrell told me the Chief Inspector for Hospitals, Sir Mike Richards, will insist hospitals introduce them as each is inspected.' Indeed, yesterday the Mail learned that hospitals are being given a third warning that they should be using NLCs, with a timetable of three months. After years of delay, Professor Toft believes that now there will be a massive improvement in the take-up rate. If not, enforcement notices can be issued. 'I welcome the Daily Mail's endeavours to bring this situation to the public's attention. It has shone a light on an area that badly needs it,' he says. 'And I feel more hopeful that I can keep my promise to Wayne's parents.'","Luer connector is the standard means of attaching syringes into drips .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Former parliamentary Speaker Peter Slipper should seek help if he needs it, but severe depression will not excuse him from standing trial on allegations of defrauding taxpayers, a magistrate says. The ACT Magistrate's Court on Wednesday heard evidence that Slipper's life has spiralled into one of despair as a result of criminal allegations, with feelings of isolation and social withdrawal. In 2013 he twice attempted suicide, the court was told. Lawyers for the 64-year old argued that because of his state of mind legal proceedings against him should be dismissed under the Mental Health Act. Former parliamentary Speaker Peter Slipper will stand trial despite his lawyers arguing because of his state of mind legal proceedings against him should be dismissed under the Mental Health Act . While Chief Magistrate Lorraine Walker found Slipper suffers from a 'major depressive disorder', she added that for the sake of public interest the case must go ahead. 'I'm satisfied that it is more appropriate that the matter go to trial,' she said. Slipper denies allegations that on three occasions in 2010, before he became Speaker, he misused Commonwealth CabCharge vouchers valued at more than $900 while visiting wineries nearby Canberra. If convicted, Slipper faces up to a year in prison and fines that could total $10,000. Despite involving a 'small' amount of commonwealth money, Ms Walker said the allegations against Slipper carried a high level of public interest. 'The defendant held one of the most significant positions of trust in the country,' she said. Slipper is a former Queensland Nationals and Liberal MP, and served in parliament for two decades. But he now finds himself unemployed having unsuccessfully stood as an independent for his seat of Fisher at the 2013 federal election. Mr Slipper attempted suicide twice last year the ACT Magistrate's Court was told on Wednesday . Psychiatrist Christopher Martin gave evidence that Slipper has suffered relationship and financial problems, battled alcoholism and made repeat visits to mental health facilities. Prosecutor Lionel Robberds dismissed claims that mental health issues prevented Slipper answering the charges. He argued that Slipper has remained capable of instructing his legal team and even issued a press release the day after one of his reported suicide attempts. Citing former British prime minister Winston Churchill, Ms Walker said there are many examples of high-functioning individuals who have concurrently struggled with mental illness. After making her ruling, the magistrate spoke directly to Slipper, urging him to seek help if he experiences feelings of desperation. 'The court is very concerned about the way you've been feeling,' Ms Walker said. She added that he is not a 'pariah' of the court and that the case against him is still to be proved. Slipper, who has previously failed in a bid to secure a stay in proceedings citing parliamentary privilege, left court without speaking to media. A seven-day trial for Slipper is set down for July.

Women who get breast implants do have improved sex lives - but not for the reason they might think, a psychologist has claimed. Instead of having increased body confidence, it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom, says Tomi-Ann Roberts, a professor of psychology at Colorado College. 'When . we have exerted a great effort, spent a great deal of money and effort . and time on something, we tend to justify that effort,' she said. 'Our good feeling is increased because of the effort, not the thing . itself.' Women who get breast implants do have improved sex lives - but not for the reason they might think, a psychologist has claimed. Instead of having increased body confidence, it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom . Professor Roberts was speaking following a study by Brazilian researchers which found that women experienced a significant boost to their arousal and sexual satisfaction following the procedure. The study involved 45 women who planned to undergo breast implant surgery. Researcher Dr. Paulo Guimaraes and . colleagues asked the women to fill out a questionnaire before the . surgery that assessed their sexual desire, arousal and sexual . satisfaction. Patients were then asked to retake the questionnaire at . two, four and 18 months after surgery. Nine women with stretch marks following . their plastic surgery did not report any improvement. Stretch marks can . occur if the implant is significantly larger than the original breast . was, according to the ASPS. But the 36 women who did . not develop stretch marks after surgery said they had experienced . improved levels of arousal and were more satisfied with their sex lives. They reported this improvement at both four and 18 months following . surgery. Commenting on the findings, Professor Roberts said: 'Here are 45 women who spent a . great deal of time and money and effort augmenting their breasts because . the media has clearly convinced them their breasts are inadequate.so . we shouldn't be surprised they are pleased with the breast . augmentation.' But other experts argue post-surgery confidence in the bedroom is because a woman now feels that her outward body now fits her inward persona . Professor Roberts, who is also a member of the American Psychological . Association's task force on the sexualisation of girls, added she wasn't surprised that women felt more attractive in the bedroom after surgery. 'Feminine heterosexuality is very . much about our sense of whether or not we are pleasing our partner, and . here we have 45 women who have spent a great deal of money to that . purpose. 'f these breasts are now pleasing to their male partners, then . they are likely to feel more sexually attractive. 'There . are a lot of other things breasts are a part of. This is an indication . that in our Victoria's Secret culture, breasts are for men. They are for . men's pleasure,' she said. But Dr David . Reath, chair of the public education committee of the American Society . of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), disagrees. 'When I see patients and follow up, a lot . of them will say ""My husband and I or my boyfriend and I are having a . lot of fun"". ' Why not? It's an important part of life,' he said. 'I . think that the female breast is a very important part of a woman's . body, in terms of how a woman feels about herself in public, how her . clothes fit and how she feels about herself sexually. 'It's very common for a woman post-surgery to say she feels more confident, that her outward body now fits her inward persona.' '[The study] found that in the areas of both sexual satisfaction and sexual arousal, there were significantly increased feelings,' said These aspects of the sexual experience were increased for these women.' The findings are to be presented this . week at the ASPS annual meeting in San Diego.","Rather than increased body confidence, it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom, says professor .

"By . David Kent . Former world heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko was caught up in violent protests in Ukraine on Sunday. The opposition leader attempted to stop the dissenters fighting with police but came under attack himself during the riots in Ukraine's capital city. Klitschko, who was hosed down with a fire extinguisher, said: '[President] Yanukovich and his henchmen want to steal our country. Getting stuck in: Vitali Klitschko is sprayed with a fire extinguisher as he tries to stop the clashes . Caught up: Klitschko attempted to calm the protesters but ended up being attacked himself . Heavyweight politician: Klitschko tries to cleared the debris from himself after he was hosed down . Smoked out: Klitschko is obscured after being attacked with the fire extinguisher in Kiev . Going the distance: Klitschko beat British fighter Dereck Chisora (right) on points in February 2012 . 'Ukraine is united as never before in its struggle against those in power today, in its determination not to allow a dictatorship.' Klitschko, who is leader of pro-European party UDAR, recently vacated his WBC title to focus on his campaign ahead of the presidential elections next year. The belt will be contested by Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne. A group of radical activists began attacking riot police with sticks, . trying to push their way toward the Ukrainian parliament building, which . has been cordoned off by rows of police and buses. The protesters, many wearing hard hats and gas masks, used stun grenades and fire extinguishers and threw flares as they attacked police in riot gear. Numerous explosions were heard and plumes of smoke rose above the crowd. Activists chanted 'Shame!' and 'Revolution.' Some were injured and medics were seen treating them . Taking a break: Klitschko vacated his world heavyweight title to concentrate on politics . Having a word: Klitschko speaks with riot police during the protest in Kiev's main square . Knockout: Klitschko lands a huge right hand on WBC heavyweight title challenger Shannon Biggs in 2010 . The clashes occurred shortly after a large peaceful rally on Kiev's main square, part of the anti-government protests rocking Ukraine since President Viktor Yanukovich's decision to freeze ties with the European Union and embrace Russia instead. Since then, Moscow has promised a $15billion dollar (Â£9bn) bailout loan to aid Ukraine's struggling economy. Scores of opposition leaders and journalists have been attacked, harassed and prosecuted since the protests started on November 21. Last week, Mr Yanukovich caused uproar at home and abroad when he approved a number of laws that limit Ukrainians' rights to protest, civic activism and free speech. The US called that legislation 'undemocratic'. Dominant: Vitali Klitschko (left) and his brother Wladimir (right) display their complete set of heavyweight titles at a press conference in July 2011 . True champion: Klitschko has his arm raised in victory after beating Chisora at the Olympic Hall in Munich, Germany . The laws prohibit demonstrators from wearing masks or hard hats at rallies, prompting many to don theatrical masks and kitchen pots at Sunday's rally. Several opposition leaders addressed the crowds from a giant stage, wearing bright construction workers' hats. Other provisions of the controversial legislation restrict the activity of non-governmental groups funded by the West and seek to equate critical reporting with defamation. Opposition leaders denounced Mr Yanukovich's legislation as unconstitutional and called for formation of parallel governing structures in the country. 'The power in Ukraine belongs to the people,' said Arseniy Yatseniuk, one of the several protest leaders. Mr Yanukovich's government has ignored previous demands of the opposition.","Vitali Klitschko blasted as he tries to calm dissenters .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander claims 3.3million jobs are linked to Britain's membership of the European Union . Three million British jobs will be put in peril if the UK quits the European Union, an official Treasury study suggests. As David Cameron hints he could back an exit if Brussels rebuffs his calls for reform, Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander will use a speech today to highlight the ‘risk that isolationists would have us take’. He will tell an audience in Washington that government experts have calculated that 3.3 million jobs are ‘connected’ to Britain’s EU membership, and the rise of UKIP does not mean Britain is ‘on the brink of exiting the EU’. Europe remains the biggest source of tension between the Tories and Lib Dems in the coalition. Mr Alexander will defy the Conservatives to release new analysis on the number of jobs linked to the EU. It is understood he asked civil servants in the Treasury to calculate the link between EU membership and employment two months ago, but was warned by George Osborne’s aides against making it public. Senior Tories are thought to be concerned the data contradicts claims from Eurosceptics in the party that Britain could thrive and prosper if it goes it alone. Mr Cameron has promised that if he wins the next election, he will seek to claw back powers form Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Britain has grown increasingly isolated in recent days, as Mr Cameron emerged as the lone voice in opposition to Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker becoming President of the European Commission. The Prime Minister will push the issue to a vote at a summit in Brussels on Friday, despite almost all other 27 EU leaders being in agreement that Mr Juncker should get the job. With relations souring, Downing Street has hinted that Mr Cameron the Prime Minister campaigning to leave the EU if he does not get the reforms he wants from Brussels in the coming years. But Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will dismiss the idea that the Britain is inching closer to withdrawing from the EU. ‘When the focus is on jobs, and growth, and wider risks we take with our prosperity through isolation then the argument can and will be won. Indeed, the latest Treasury analysis shows that 3.3 million British jobs are connected to Britain's place in Europe. ‘That is the measure of the risk that isolationists would have us take. ‘British people want the jobs and opportunities that come with staying in the EU. ‘They want Britain to continue leading in Europe and they want Britain to remain a leading voice on the world stage.’ Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured this week with President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, wants to stage an in-out referendum on Europe before the end of 2017 . Mr Alexander will argue that polls show support for remaining in Europe has risen in recent months, with an eight point lead for those who want to remain in. ‘Despite seemingly increasing euro-scepticism in the UK, we are not on the brink of exiting the EU,’ Mr Alexander will say. ‘Doing so would be a disaster for Britain, putting our hard-fought economic recovery at risk. ‘And I don’t believe the British public would vote to pull out of the EU in the event a referendum is called.’ Mr Alexander will use the speech in the US capital to urge Americans to ‘to stay engaged, speak out and help keep Britain in the EU’. Three weeks ago US President Barack Obama warned it is ‘hard for me to imagine that project (EU) going well in the absence of Britain’. He added: ‘I think it is also hard for me to image it would be advantageous for Great Britain to be excluded from political decisions that have an enormous impact on its economic and political life.’ Mr Alexander will point to President Obama’s remarks, adding: ‘We want to remain in …because Britain stands tall in the world – and dare I say in Washington – when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin.’ Britain's influence in Europe has been damaged by David Cameron's posturing over who will get the top jobs in Brussels, Vince Cable claimed today. The Business Secretary claimed Mr Cameron's robust opposition to Jean-Claude Juncker becoming president of the European Commission 'has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe'. Mr Cameron has vowed to fight 'until the end' the appointment of a man seen by the UK as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform. Business Secretary Vince Cable claimed David Cameron's aggressive stance against Jean-Claude Juncker has 'not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe' Half of voters think David Cameron will be seen as 'strong' for opposing Jean-Claude Juncker's appointment, even if he loses. A Populus poll for the Financial Times found just 22 people of people think the Prime Minister will be seen as weak if, as expected, Mr Juncker is named the new President of the European Commission. Just 13 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is wrong to try and block the appointment. The public remains split on Britain's membership of the EU. The survey found 37 per cent would vote to stay in the EU, while 36 per cent would vote to leave in a referendum. Labour and the Lib Dems have publicly supported the Tories in insisting Mr Juncker is the wrong man for the job. But on the eve of a summit where Mr Cameron is expected to find himself isolated on the appointment by fellow EU leaders, Mr Cable also criticised his approach. 'It hasn't been good for David Cameron,' Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'I think he is right in principle that the appointment of the commission president shouldn't be foisted on heads of government. 'I think he was right to take the position he did but the way it's been done, unfortunately, has not helped Britain punch its weight in Europe.' Mr Juncker said he was confident of securing the post by the end of this week, 'if common sense prevails'. In an apparent dig at the Prime Minister's campaign against him, the former Luxembourg premier said he was being forced to wait for a decision because common sense was 'very unequally distributed'. Mr Cameron believes that the selection of a candidate chosen by the largest party grouping in the European Parliament would breach the principle that candidates for top jobs are nominated by national leaders and not by MEPs. Having apparently failed to recruit enough fellow leaders to form a blocking minority at this week's European Council summit, speculation is mounting that he might be prepared to deploy an arcane EU procedure nicknamed the 'L-bomb' to stop Juncker's candidacy. The 'Luxembourg compromise' - created in 1965 to assuage the anger of Charles de Gaulle at France being outvoted by smaller countries - allows an EU member to delay a decision which affects an important national interest until a unanimously acceptable solution can be found.","Chief Secretary to the Treasury releases official government analysis .

"By . Chris Brooke . This is the moment a 65-year-old grandfather is pounced on by police, bent over double and his arms twisted behind his back at a peaceful demonstration by the elderly and disabled. Tony Nuttall’s arrest at a protest against travel pass cuts was described as disgusting by campaigners last night as police chiefs revealed they were investigating the incident. The former Health Service manager was among dozens of campaigners – some in wheelchairs or using walking sticks – who had gathered at Sheffield railway station to demand the return of free travel on public transport, which was axed in March. Scroll down for video . Surrounded: An elderly man was arrested by five police officers at Sheffield railway station yesterday . As police moved in, a man collapsed . with breathing problems and a blind woman was ‘pushed over a . wheelchair’. Both were taken to hospital. Two people using sticks were . reportedly knocked over and a man was ‘almost knocked out of his . wheelchair.' A journalist . from the local paper was allegedly threatened with arrest under the . Terrorism Act and made to delete footage because he did not have . permission to film at the station. British Transport Police were videoed as they ‘jumped’ Mr Nuttall. One woman, shocked by their heavy-handedness, shouted: ‘What are you doing? He’s an old man, leave him alone.’ Fellow protester George Arthur, 64, a grandfather and former primary teacher, was also arrested. Mr Arthur, who allegedly travelled on a train without buying a ticket as part of the protest, was charged with fare evasion and both men were charged with obstructing a police officer. Members of Sheffield Disabled People Against The Cuts and Barnsley Retirees Action Group were demonstrating after South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive axed free rail travel for elderly and disabled passengers in the region and restricted free bus and tram passes to save more than £600,000 a year. 'Leave him alone': Bystanders lambasted police officers for treating the old man roughly . Scuffle: Protesters had earlier arrived in Sheffield by train from a nearby station to demonstrate against service cuts . In a partial U-turn, free travel for the disabled was restored last month and pensioners were given half-price rail fares at certain times. But the campaign has continued with ‘freedom rides’ in which protesters travel without paying their fare. Accompanied by police, up to 60 travelled from Barnsley station to Sheffield on Monday, with some refusing to buy a ticket. Arrested: Tony Nuttall, 65, today said his back and arms were hurt during the arrest . When they got off the train police formed a cordon blocking their exit from the platform. Mr Arthur said: ‘We had a rally on the platform, sang and chanted.’ He said officers took action as he addressed the group using a megaphone. ‘Two officers grabbed me and said I was arrested,’ he added. ‘I was dragged down the platform with other protesters trying to get me free.’ Commenting on the police, he said: ‘There is widespread disgust at their behaviour.’ Mr Nuttall said he was ‘jumped from behind’ by police when he ‘tried to link arms’ with Mr Arthur as he was being arrested. He added: ‘It was extremely uncomfortable and absolutely not necessary. I was not hitting out or anything, there was no need for that action. ‘This all happened very close to the edge of the platform. It was all very dangerous.’ The police said: ‘A number of incidents have been brought to our attention. We are in the process of fully investigating these.’ Mr Arthur and Mr Nuttall, both of Barnsley, will appear before Sheffield magistrates on July 7.","Footage shows five officers manhandling a man in his sixties on platform .

"By . Andy Dolan . A mother who was told she could not breastfeed her newborn in a hospital waiting room yesterday condemned the ‘disgusting’ way the NHS had treated her. Gemma Murphy was reduced to tears after nurses put her in a private room so she could feed six-week-old Niamh without offending other patients. She was asked to move even though none of the other six women in the waiting room at the time had complained. Not allowed: Gemma Murphy was left in tears after being barred from feeding six-week-old Niamh while she waited for a blood test with her husband at the Hospital of St Cross  in Rugby, Warwickshire . Mrs . Murphy, 37, had gone to the Hospital of St Cross in  Rugby, . Warwickshire, for tests to see whether she still had the gestational . diabetes she developed in pregnancy. She . was particularly shocked because she had gone to the trouble of calling . the hospital before her appointment to make sure she would be able to . breastfeed her daughter after it wrote to say it offered no childcare . facilities and that the procedure would require two blood tests with a . two-hour wait in between. Mrs . Murphy, head of marketing and development at children’s charity The . Smallpiece Trust, said: ‘Breastfeeding can be difficult enough already. You need all the support you can get. ‘The . NHS encourages breastfeeding, particularly in a baby’s early weeks. I . certainly didn’t expect to be told in a hospital that I couldn’t . breastfeed.’ Last straw: Mrs Murphy said she was left tearful by the hospital's attitude, on what was six-week-old baby Niamh's first major outing . Investigation: A spokesman for University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire Trust said it was aware of Mrs Murphy's complaint . The row comes . after 1,000 women staged a series of nationwide protests on Saturday in . support of Emily Slough, 27, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, who was . branded a ‘tramp’ on Facebook alongside a picture of her breastfeeding . in public. Mrs Murphy, from . Rugby, said she was confronted by a nurse who spotted Niamh in her pram . moments after arriving at the hospital with husband Paul, 43. She added: ‘The nurse said I shouldn’t have brought Niamh and that I might offend other patients by breastfeeding. ‘She . suggested I should have considered expressing milk into a bottle for . Paul to feed her. But if you introduce a bottle too soon the baby can . get used to it and stop feeding from the breast. It was only thanks to . another nurse overhearing the conversation that I was offered a private . room to breastfeed in. Otherwise I would have been turned away.’ Other case: Emily Slough, mother of eight-month-old daughter Matilda, was labelled a 'tramp' for breastfeeding in public, before hitting back by organising a mass breastfeeding protest . Backing: More than 1,000 mothers took to the streets in towns and cities around Britain at the weekend and breastfed in public to show their support for the young mother . Mrs Murphy said she quickly fed Niamh before her husband stepped in to look after their daughter while she was tested. Yesterday . the hospital claimed there was a health and safety risk to mothers at . the appointments. It said patients attending the tests were at risk of . fainting, so they should not bring babies with them. It added that the . procedure also required the women to sit still between the tests. However, . Mr Murphy, a director of an environmental consultancy, said: ‘We . understand how this could be an issue if a mother attended on her own . with the child, as there would be nobody to look after the baby if she . fainted. ‘But I was with Gemma and Niamh on this occasion and was able to step in.’ Campaigners criticised the hospital yesterday. Breastfeeding . counsellor Emma Pickett, of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, . said: ‘It’s against civil law for a business or organisation to ask a . breastfeeding mother to move from a particular space. The only time such . a stance could be justified is if the baby’s life could be put in . danger, such as if the mother needed to have an X-ray and wanted to take . her baby in.’ Janet Fyle, . professional policy adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, branded . the hospital’s actions ‘disgraceful’, adding: ‘Women should be able to . breastfeed anywhere they choose.’ National Childbirth Trust policy adviser Rosemary Dodds said it was ‘inexcusable that the NHS has mistreated this woman’. Mrs . Murphy has complained to University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire . NHS, and is due to meet David Eltringham, its chief operating officer. Yesterday he said the trust supported breastfeeding and was investigating her claims. Gestational . diabetes affects women during pregnancy, when there are high levels of . glucose in the blood. Women over 35 are thought to carry a higher risk . of developing it. The condition usually clears up after birth.","Gemma Murphy, 37, was barred from feeding six-week-old Niamh .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Each year, the standard of staff at Wimbledon really does reach new heights. Take this 7ft groundsman for example - who has been a real hit with celebrities and players. Giant Lydon Sutcliffe, 26, is constantly accosted for photos by celebrities due to his larger than average frame. Mr Sutcliffe, who spends six months of the year preparing the courts for the competition, has met over 30 stars since starting at Wimbledon in 2009. Wimbledon groundsman Lydon Sutcliffe, pictured here with Maria Sharapova in 2012, is constantly accosted by celebrities wanting to have a picture with him because he is over 7ft tall . The groundsman, pictured with Rafael Nadal, left, and Holly Willoughby, right, has posed with scores of famous faces since he started working at Wimbledon in 2009 . The groundsman says they all ask him the same thing - 'What's the weather like up there?' He added: 'Celebrities just spot me in the crowd and come over and ask for a picture with ""the tallest man in Wimbledon"". 'They also say ""can I just ask..."" and before they have finished speaking, I reply ""7ft 1in."" They say ""how did you know what I was going to ask?"" 'It amazes me because everyone asks the same things. I often get the usual 'gosh, you're tall aren't you?' and then there's the classics like 'did your mother put you in a grow bag?' 'I've heard them all countless times but I still find it funny. 'A lot of people ask me if I play tennis when they see how tall I am. I tell them ""no, I play miniature golf"" and they seem to find that quite funny. 'Over the years I've met so many famous people and it's always so easy to chat to them because right away we have a topic of conversation - my height.' Mr Sutcliffe, pictured with Cliff Richard, left, and news presenter Trevor McDonald, right, says most of the celebrities ask him the same question - 'What's the weather like up there?' The groundsman says celebrities, such as Richard Branson, pictured, often spot him from afar before approaching him and asking for a photograph with 'the tallest man in Wimbledon' The groundsman says most people remark 'Gosh, you're tall aren't you' when they first meet him. Here, Mr Sutcliffe poses with former tennis player Andrew Castle and television star Jonathan Ross . Those who have teamed up with Lydon include: Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Nick Clegg and comedian Michael McIntrye. He's also been photographed with TV presenters Holly Willoughby and Helen Skelton, boxers David Haye and Amir Khan and tennis greats Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Pat Cash and John McEnroe. Mr Sutcliffe, from Lancaster, added: 'I love meeting all different kinds of people and it's great to talk to any celebrity but my favourites are athletes. 'I absolutely love sport and I have so much respect for people who play professionally. 'No matter what sport it is, I know I'm so lucky to be able to stand and chat with them, especially because most of them actually approach me. Mr Sutcliffe, pictured with Andy Murray, says he rarely gets starstruck when posing with the stars as they have a topic of conversation to break the ice - his height . The groundsman, who spends six months a year tending to the courts, pictured with athlete Linford Christie, left, and actor and comedian Noel Fielding . Mr Sutcliffe, pictured with tennis stars Tim Henman and Andrew Aggassi . 'I'm quite friendly with a few of the tennis players now. Roger Federer always asks to have a photo with me and John Isner, who played the longest professional tennis match in 2010, always chats to me, as we are both into wrestling. 'Last time, he left me his size 14 trainers, which fit me perfectly.' Mr Sutcliffe, who is officially classed as a giant, said that the nicest out of all the famous people he's met is ex-England footballer Peter Beardsley. 'I saw him standing on his own so I just went over and said hello,' Lydon said. 'He was the nicest guy I've ever met. He was just so down to earth and we stood chatting for a bit. His opening line was ""bloody hell, you're a big lad."" 'Some people find it a bit overwhelming talking to famous people but the way I see it is they're only human. The 26-year-old poses with television presenter Kirsty Gallagher, left, and tennis star Leyton Hewit . The man, who is officially classified as a giant, with golfer Rory McIIroy and boxer David Haye . 'They've always been so friendly to me, maybe with the exception of John McEnroe, who I thought was really rude.' The smallest person Lydon has had his picture taken with is pint-sized TV presenter Georgie Tompson, who is just 5ft 2in tall. 'She was so lovely but I remember feeling like she barely reached my knee,' Mr Sutcliffe said. 'She was so small and I'm so huge we must have looked like a right pair.' Getting daily comments about his height is part and parcel of life for Mr Sutcliffe, who was 6ft 3ins by the age of 12 and had size 14 feet by the time he was 14-years-old. He is so used to stares and questions that he would find it strange if he went out and didn't get attention from other people.

Mr Sutcliffe with television star Patrick Kielty and comedian Leigh Francis aka Keith Lemon . 'For me it's just normal, everyday . life,' said 20-stone Lydon. 'I've always had strangers chatting to me . about my height so I don't see it as any different when it's famous . people. 'I suppose it is a . bit strange because if you saw a really fat person you wouldn't stare . and ask them to pose for a picture but I see the funny side. 'I'm . proud of being tall and I just get on with it. I wouldn't get to meet . all the people I do if I was normal height so there's definitely a . positive side of being a giant.' At college, Mr Suttcliffe studied sports turf management, and as part of his course, he had to go on placements. It was through this that he got a placement at Wimbledon and since then, he has worked at  Wimbledon for the last few years, looking after the tennis courts and making sure the grounds are in top condition. He also spent two weeks working at the Olympics. Singers Tony Hadley and Dave HemingwayTennis players Maria Sharapova, . Tim Henman, Andre Agassi, Andrew Castle and Lleyton Hewitt, Roger .

"By . John Mcgarry . Ronny Deila's first taste of European football ought to serve as a blow to the solar plexus of anyone who doubts his capacity to make the quantum leap from tiny Stromgodset to Celtic Park. The autumn of 2011 paired the Norwegian minnows with no less a side than Atletico Madrid in the third qualifying round of the Europa League. For those observers unaware of the near miracle he was overseeing in the small city of Drammen, the tie had the whiff of a turkey shoot about it. A squad boasting the likes of Ramadel Falcao and Diego Forlan would surely get the job done with something to spare. So went the theory anyway. VIDEO Scroll down for Celtic manager Deila's first training session with the squad . Up for the cup: Celtic boss Ronny Deila is looking forward to facing KR Reykjavik in the Champions League second qualifying round . The Spaniards got there in the end. A 2-1 win the first step, it transpired, on a road that would see them lift the trophy the following spring. Stromgodset succumbed in the end by the same score on home soil a week later but both they and their young manager had more than made their mark. So much for the Vincente Calderon eating them up and spitting them out. Deila’s men played on the front foot from the off in Spain, leaving the Primera Liga giants wondering exactly what had his them. For their young manager, it was a night when an appetite for such jousts became insatiable. ‘That was my biggest moment in football ever,’ Deila recalled on Monday. ‘We played a fantastic game. I have played in Cup Finals, but for me that international stage against a good team when we played well gave me a very good feeling. ‘It was 59 per cent to 41 per cent (possession for Atletico). It was possible because we did it. We played well and had a big chance to make it 2-2. At home we had them under pressure – but the difference is how effective you are. All smiles: Deila and his assistant manager John Collins (right) are preparing for their first season at Celtic . ‘They had Diego Forlan in their side and although he didn’t want to play after the South American Championships, they needed him because they did not want to miss out. ‘You see the skills they have when taking chances – that’s the difference between teams at that level. ‘I hope that I will get many feelings like that at Celtic – that’s why I came here. ‘I looked at the Barcelona game and, although Celtic didn’t win, the atmosphere was unbelievable. That’s why you are in football. ‘You want to win trophies, but the moments at matches when you experience good things with fans and players is also special.’ Deila’s raison d’etre is currently to give himself and his new club as much chance of tasting such occasions this season as is humanly possible. Commendably, the Norwegian didn’t try to paint KR Reykjavic as something they weren’t yesterday.Celtic’s inaugural opponents in this year’s quest for the group stage will be more than competent. Deila would expect nothing less from a side sitting fourth in their league after nine matches. The reigning Icelandic champions will be match fit, too, and given their country’s progression to the World Cup play-offs last year, unlikely to be gripped by an inferiority complex, either. So close: Deila came close to knocking Spanish side Atletico Madrid out of the Europa League while at Stromgodset . Nonetheless, while not a gentle trip to the Welsh valleys, it’s hardly a tie to have the Scottish champions hiding under the bed. ‘That’s true – Celtic is expected to win,’ Deila added. ‘Icelandic football has improved a lot in the last few years. It is unbelievable what Iceland has achieved in football – and handball, as well. ‘That’s the two sports they are good at. Almost everyone gets involved at an early age. ‘I think in many ways Icelandic football is ahead of many other countries. ‘But I think their league is much lower quality than the national team because so many players go abroad. The most successful club in Icelandic football. They won the last of their 13 titles last year. They’ve been managed by former Iceland international Runar Kristinsson since 2010. WHERE DO THEY PLAY? The KR-vollur. With a capacity of 2,781, it’s not one of Europe’s more intimidating arenas. It also boasts a grass park, which is one less thing for Celtic to worry about. WHAT CAN CELTIC EXPECT? An uncompromising and athletic outfit. Given that Icelandic football adheres to a summer season, they’ll also be match fit. After nine games, they sit fourth in the table — three points off the pace. ANYONE WE WOULD KNOW? Kjartan Finnbogason was on Celtic’s books between 2005 and 2008, although he didn’t play a game. Former Middlesbrough man Gary Martin plays up front for them. WHAT’S THEIR RECENT EUROPEAN HISTORY? This will be their sixth successive campaign. Last year, in the Europa League they saw off Northern Ireland’s Glentoran 3-0, before losing 6-2 on aggregate to Standard Liege. A DECENT DRAW THEN? Could be better, could be worse. The dream trip to Wales or Northern Ireland to face TNS or Cliftonville didn’t materialise. but neither did the horrific prospect of facing Malmo. ‘They are hard-working players with a good team spirit. They will be well organised, too. But we are Celtic. We should be a better team than them over two matches. Now it’s all about doing everything right in pre-season to get the squad as best physically and mentally prepared for these games. ‘We will try to do everything right in Austria to build up the physical shape of the players as quickly as possible and in the best way, without getting injuries. Then we will be very focused on this game.’ Celtic fly to Austria for a two-week training camp this Sunday but, if his schedule allows, Deila intends to watch the Icelandic side in action. While familiarising himself with the KR players is top of his agenda, their coach Runar Kristinsson needs no introduction from his time playing in Norway. ‘I played against him many times, he was a very good player,’ Deila added. ‘I don’t remember much about the games against him but he was a good player. He was a central midfielder and went on to Belgium afterwards. I know he was a big star with Lillestrom.’ Deila has spent the past week growing accustomed to his new surroundings but the relative peace he’s enjoyed will this morning be shattered by the return of the bulk of his squad for pre-season training. He intends it to be a convivial and informative affair. ‘It’s important to get settled and tell players how things are going to be,’ he said. ‘That’s what we will do first and then we can start working. ‘Then the exercises will not be high intensity because we have been away a long time. We will get to know each other and take it from there. ‘I don’t think we will change much – but some things will be different. Maybe we will meet up a little bit earlier so we can plan things before training. Settling in: Deila has been getting used to his new surroundings in Glasgow since being named Celtic boss . ‘We will talk about what the training will consist of so we all have an idea of what we will focus on on the pitch. ‘Everything is about training. You train as you play. If you have good preparations then the players will develop. The staff will work hard to make it as short and simple as possible so players can use energy on the pitch. ‘The players have to feel that I can trust them and they must also have fun. If they do that then things will happen – I know it.’","Celtic will play Icelandic side KR Reykjavic in the Champions League second qualifying round .

Google . later engineered a prototype that weighed 8lb (3.6kg), and the current version is now . lighter than the average pair of sunglasses at 1.6oz (50g).

A touchpad on the side of the Glass lets users control it by swiping through a timeline-like interface display on the screen. For instance, sliding backward shows current events, such the football score, and sliding forward shows past events, such as messages and photos. Its camera takes photos and records at 720p HD video. A touchpad on the side of the Glass allows users to control it by swiping through a timeline-like interface display on the screen. For instance, sliding backward shows current events, such the football score, and sliding forward shows past events, such as messages and photos . The Explorer programme aims to 'let people from all walks of life play an active role in shaping Glass ahead of a wider consumer launch'. Ivy Ross, Head of Glass said: ‘Technology is at its best when it fits seamlessly into our lives and lets us get on with whatever we’re doing. 'Our goal for Glass is exactly that - to make it easier to bring people the technology they rely on without drawing them out of the moment.’ Glass is still a prototype and will continue to be developed before it is made available to more consumers. Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the programme started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!' Upon the release of the second-generation Glass in December, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer programme - about 6,000 people - were able to 'invite' three of their friends to join the scheme. Google are rumored to be working on facial recognition, a zoom-in camera and live internet streaming for a new edition. Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system, which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. It is unclear whether the prescription offers available in the U.S will be launched in the UK. The idea of a computer and recording device on one's head has made some non-Glass users uncomfortable, and it has pushed the conversation about etiquette and social norms in a connected world. Establishments including bars and cinemas have kicked out Explorers, who critics call 'Glassholes'. In February, Google released an etiquette guide explaining how users can avoid being labeled a 'Glasshole' when strutting around with the headwear. Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames . Several major companies have already been testing Glass, with airline Virgin Atlantic using the device with their upper class passengers; deploying the device to manage flight details and organise transfers. While the launch of the device in the UK is likely to excite those within the industry, Stuart Miles - the founder of technology website Pocket-lint - believes the average consumer still requires some convincing that Glass is the future of tech. 'It’s good news for UK customers keen to play with the Glass without having to jump through the numerous hoops to import it from America. Whether it will be enough to convince Brits to embrace the wearable tech, however, is yet to be seen,' he said. As part of the process of making Glass more appealing to consumers, new frames by fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg have now also been made available. For those who are interested in trying out Glass, Google has set up a Basecamp in London - running on the 27 and 28 June - where customers can go to be fitted and ask questions about Glass before buying it.","Scheme is available to UK residents aged over 18, with a valid credit card .

"By . Emma Innes . A young mother says she has no regrets after doctors told her to have a baby aged 19 - or lose her chance of parenthood. Amy McStein, from Liverpool, gave up her university education and job prospects to fulfil her dream of becoming a mother. She took the drastic decision after doctors told her a gynaecological condition she was suffering from was getting worse - and it was only a matter of time before she would need her womb removed. Amy McStein (pictured with baby Ava Grace), 22, was diagnosed with severe endometriosis when she was just 19 and was told she would need a hysterectomy as soon as possible . Ms McStein, now 22, was suffering from endometriosis - a painful condition in which small pieces of the womb lining are found elsewhere in the body. Her condition was diagnosed after she suffered years of agony, resulting in her suddenly collapsing . during a family meal in the summer of 2010. ‘Despite . going back and forth to the doctors, I was told time and time again . that it was just normal period pain. I felt totally helpless,’ she said. ‘Then one day, I was out for dinner . with my family when I felt a sudden, sharp pain in my stomach. It took . my breath away and before I knew it, I woke up on the floor. I had . fainted. ‘I spent all night in accident and emergency and doctors finally dismissed it as trapped wind. Doctors warned Amy that if she wanted to be a mother she should start trying immediately so she dropped out of university to try for a child with her partner, Jack . Ava will be two in December and Amy is now preparing for her hysterectomy which is expected to take place within the next year . ‘A few weeks later, in July 2010, I collapsed again and doctors found a five centimetre diameter cyst on my right ovary.’ Ms McStein was transferred to Liverpool . Women’s Hospital where she had a minor operation to drain the cyst. Waking after the procedure, she was told the news. She said: ‘I had severe endometriosis, and had to be started on a drug to induce menopause straight away. ‘The bombshell utterly floored me. I . was just 19 years old. They gave me injections and told me I needed to . have a hysterectomy as soon as possible. Medics . explained that if she wanted children, she had to get pregnant . immediately, or she might never get another chance to be a mother. ‘My . doctor turned to me and said: “I would never usually say this to a . 19-year-old, but if you want to have a family, you need to start trying . straight away”. Amy was diagnosed with endometriosis after having surgery to remove an ovarian cyst. The condition caused so much pain that she would faint . Before Amy (pictured with her partner, Jack) conceived Ava, she had three miscarriages . ‘I was stunned. I was still just a teenager and I faced losing my womb. I thought I had my whole life ahead of me. Ms McStein, . who was studying forensic science at Liverpool John Moores University, . was then faced with the heart breaking choice - a baby or her education. ‘I . was suddenly forced to rethink my future. I’d always assumed I’d be a . mother one day but I was told I needed to make a choice and there was no . time to lose. ‘I sat . down with my partner Jack, who I’d been going out with for two years, . and explained what the doctors had said. I told him that if he ever . wanted to have a child with me, it was now or never.’ Ava was born at 35 weeks weighing just 4lbs 10oz. During the labour Amy haemorrhaged twice . During the pregnancy, Amy spent 13 weeks in hospital and suffered two major bleeds - she was twice told that Ava would not survive . ‘I realised I did want a family one day, and I knew I loved Jack. I could see myself spending my life with him. Jack agreed to start trying, and I cried out in relief.’ The teenager gave up university and then faced a traumatic eight months as her race for a baby began. She suffered three miscarriages, two of which happened at eight weeks, and one at 17 weeks. She recalled: ‘I was starting to lose hope. I didn’t have time to grieve for my unborn babies. I spent weeks in hospital. ‘I was really ill and always in pain but, finally, in April 2011, I got pregnant for a fourth time. Ms McStein said: 'She was a little fighter. She will be two in December and never cries. Everyone says that she is paying us back for all the pain we went through to bring her into the world' Ms McStein said: 'Conceiving Ava was one of the hardest things I've ever done but she brightens my world, and I honestly can't imagine life without her' ‘This time, I spent 13 weeks of my 35-week pregnancy in hospital. I was determined to give my unborn little girl the best possible chance at life. ‘I had two major bleeds and twice I was told I’d lost her. The doctors warned me I wouldn’t make it to 30 weeks. ‘The . labour, in December that year, was also traumatic. My uterus just . couldn’t stretch because of all the scar tissue. I haemorrhaged twice.’ Their daughter, Ava Grace, was born with the umbilical cord wrapped round her neck and weighed just 4lbs 10oz. Ms McStein says she always knew she wanted to be a mother which is why she decided to give up on her education to try for a baby (image shows a scan of Ava) Amy and Jack got married in April this year with Ava as a flower girl . ‘Medical complications aside, she was perfect,’ said Ms McStein. ‘She was a little fighter. She will be two in December and never cries. Everyone says that she is paying us back for all the pain we went through to bring her into the world. ‘Conceiving Ava was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done but she brightens my world, and I honestly can’t imagine life without her.’ The couple got married in April 2013, with Ava as a flower girl. Ms McStein, who has become a full-time mother, is currently preparing for her hysterectomy which will be carried out in the next 12 months, and spends her free time raising awareness for endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common condition in which small pieces of the womb lining are found outside the womb - they can be found in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder or bowel. The condition affects about two million women in the UK and most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40. It is a chronic condition that causes painful and heavy periods. It can also lead to a lack of energy and fertility problems as well as pain during sex and bleeding between periods. Endometriosis symptoms can often be managed with painkillers or hormone treatments but surgery is sometimes required. Pregnancy can reduce the symptoms but they often return once the menstrual cycle returns to normal. One of the main complications of endometriosis is infertility. In severe cases, a hysterectomy can be required to treat the condition. However,the condition can return even after the operation. To have the best chance of curing the condition, the ovaries need to be removed as well.","Amy McStein, 22, was diagnosed with severe endometriosis after surgery to remove an ovarian cyst - it was so bad that the pain caused her to faint .

"By . Sarah Dean . Fashion designer Jodhi Meares may be in hiding after her drunken car crash on Saturday night but her sportswear business certainly hasn't slowed down. The 43-year-old's clothes label, The Upside, began a 50 per cent sale on the day of the crash that saw Jodhi smash into three parked cars while driving her bronze Range Rover in Bondi, eastern Sydney. The firesale on her range of hardcore exercise garments - inspired by Jodhi's own love of working out - was promoted heavily on Twitter on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Discounted: Fashion designer Jodhi Meares has stayed hidden inside her Sydney home since her car crash on Saturday night but a sale has begun on her clothes line . Sale time: Jodhi's fashion label The Upside is offering huge discounts this week . Four tweets were sent out consecutively explaining there is a sale on, with prices slashed on leggings, shorts, tops, hoodies and more. Meanwhile, a post on the brand's Instagram page on Tuesday night urged: 'Don't forget to sign up for your chance to win one of these kits from The Upside'. Jodhi has stayed holed up inside her converted Edwardian mansion, in eastern Sydney, since the smash but has been kept company by her rockstar fiancee Jon Stevens. Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel is the face of Jodhi Meares' activewear label The Upside . The Noiseworks lead singer, who proposed to the former Mrs Packer in 2013, has been seen nipping out to buy groceries for the former swimwear model as she avoids attention inside her luxury $2 million pad. The huge collision at 9.30pm on Saturday left the beautiful brunette trapped in her car until onlookers and police came to her rescue. Jodhi's current situation sees her facing potential jail time over the smash. Police arrived at Jodhi's home on Wednesday. They spent about 20 minutes at the luxury address in Sydney's east . Two female police officers visited her but there was still no sign of Jodhi . Police said a roadside breath test returned a reading of 0.181, which is three times over the limit . On Wednesday afternoon, two female police officers turned up at Jodhi's home. They spent about 20 minutes inside the property talking to the model. They previously visited her home at about 5.20pm on Monday. Rose Bay police arrived to make 'further enquiries' regarding Saturday night's crash. The police buzzed Ms Meares' apartment twice before being allowed into the building after one police officer said: 'I have got some paperwork to drop off.'

She will face Waverley Local Court on August 5. The maximum penalty for high-range drink driving is a $3,300 fine and an 18-month jail sentence. An aide for Jon Stevens, Ms Meare's fiance, told Channel Nine on Monday: 'She made a mistake, she made an error of judgment. There's no more comment.' Style Runner marketing director Kelly Barriball, who manages The Upside brand amongst other fashion clients would not be drawn when asked whether she believed recent events may impact on Jodhi's brand's image or sales. She said: 'We don't have anything to say on this matter at this stage.' Crash: The huge collision at 9.30pm on Saturday left the beautiful brunette trapped in her bronze Range Rover in eastern Sydney . Jodhi's reinvention of herself after her modelling career saw her first create her swimwear label Tigerlily in 2001, during her marriage to billionaire James Packer. The range of skimpy swimmers were a success but by 2007 she was ready to move on, selling the label to surfwear giant Billabong for an amount reported to be between $3 and $5 million, staying on as a consultant before eventually cutting ties.

American-born, Paris-based writer Diane Pernet was photographed by the Associated Press wearing an ensemble that included the endangered species’ pelt. In a tweet dispatched from the French capital today the news agency wrote: ‘Fashion icon Diane Pernet wears a real, vintage gorilla coat at Paris fashion week.’ Controversial skin: Fashion editor Diane Pernet has worn a gorilla fur coat for many years, which she received as a gift from a vegetarian friend (wearing it here in a photograph by Street Style Seconds) While laws regarding the use of . gorilla pelts vary across the world (it is banned in the UK, but not in . the U.S.) animal rights campaign group PETA was appalled by the . garment.

The . gorilla coat is a staple of Ms Pernet’s all-black wardrobe. Recent . posts to her Instagram account reveal how she has worn it to multiple . fashion events this winter season. Ms Pernet signature style is to veil . her hair and wear sweeping, dark clothes in the style of a Victorian-era . mourning ensemble. Historically speaking, gorilla and monkey fur coats first became fashionable in the 1930s through the work of surrealist designer Elsa Schiaparelli. According . to Los Angeles's FIDM Museum: ‘In [1930s] advertisements and fashion . coverage, sleek and shiny monkey fur was often described as modern, . daring and sophisticated.’ Gorillas are remarkably close to humans in their genetic makeup, and share 98per cent of our DNA. Three . of the world’s four gorilla species are currently categorized as . ‘critically endangered’, and the remaining species, the ‘Western Lowland . Gorilla’ has been labelled as ‘endangered’. This Africa-dwelling species accounts for 100,000 of the world's approximate 104,020 gorilla population. Gorilla fur has been barred from the market in multiple countries, the strictest of which is the UK. Fluxing fashion: Gorilla and monkey fur was popularized in the 1930s through the work of designer Elsa Schiaparelli, but it has since become outlawed in many countries .

"By . Hilary Freeman . Gut feeling: Brain disease can be caused by an unhealthy stomach . Anxiety or anticipation can often lead to a feeling  of ‘butterflies in the stomach’ – which usually dissipates along with the source of the consternation. But scientists have discovered that the nerve pathways between the gut and the brain that cause this phenomenon may also be linked to degenerative illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as some mental health problems. Dr Anton Emmanuel, consultant neuro-gastroenterologist at University College London and the National Hospital for Neurology, explained: ‘The gut and brain share the same nerve chemistry and have a dialogue. 'That’s why when you feel stress and other strong emotions, such as fear, it leads to gastrointestinal symptoms, like rushing to the loo.’ A new study suggests that  brain disease can be caused by  an unhealthy gut because these signals also travel in the opposite direction. The study, which was published in the journal Movement Disorders, found that sufferers of Parkinson’s disease had a higher prevalence of a condition called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or SIBO. In SIBO, normally harmless bacteria proliferate in large numbers in the small intestine. Symptoms include excess gas, abdominal bloating, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Nobody is sure how many people have it,  as it often goes undiagnosed or  is confused with irritable bowel syndrome, but estimates are of  up to 300,000 British sufferers. And the researchers suggest that the bacteria may produce chemicals that affect the nerves in the gut, which pass on the damage to the brain – and result in Parkinson’s and MS. Dr Emmanuel said: ‘We now think that neurological diseases such as MS and Parkinson’s are linked to the gut being more  leaky, permitting pathogens into the bloodstream and causing  an antibody response. Either  the pathogens, directly, or the immune response, indirectly, may damage nerve tissue.’ The damaged nerves then transmit these detrimental signals to the brain. Rumbly tummy: The 'butterflies in the stomach' feeling could be linked to Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis . In Parkinson’s, a small part of the brain becomes progressively damaged over many years, something that affects mainly older people. MS is the most common neurological disease in young adults and occurs when the immune system attacks the nervous system. The two diseases affect about 100,000 and 127,00 people in the UK respectively. Both have wide-ranging symptoms, affecting movement as well as causing tiredness, pain and depression. There are drugs that can ease symptoms, but no cure or even treatments that significantly slow down progression of the diseases. Scientists hope that this discovery will pave the way for new treatments for both these disabling conditions. They are now mapping the ‘bacterial genome’, which will identify the bacteria in an individual’s gut – something they hope will ultimately allow doctors to prescribe tailored treatments for leakiness of the gut, improving neurological symptoms in turn. Until then, the doctors’ body United European Gastroenterology urges people to maintain a healthy diet, including foods that boost good bacteria and encourage efficient digestion. This may have an especially positive effect on mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. They recommend eating plenty of fibre and probiotics such as live yogurt, as well as limiting sugar, processed foods, animal fat and the use of antibiotics, antacids and anti-inflammatories, as these cause imbalances in the gut.","Study suggests that brain disease can be caused by an unhealthy gut .

It is understood that officers from . the Metropolitan Police’s extradition unit delivered a note to the . embassy yesterday morning saying Mr Assange has to present himself to . Belgravia police station at 11.30am today. But in a statement read out on his behalf, Mr Assange said he had been advised that he should decline to comply with the police request, adding: 'This should not be considered any sign of disrespect. Under both international and domestic UK law asylum assessments take priority over extradition claims.' Called upon: Julian Assange, left, was ordered to appear at a police station today. Pictured, an officer patrols on outside London's Ecuadorian embassy, where he is hidden, over the weekend . Police said they had formally 'served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing'. It added: 'He remains in breach of his bail conditions, failing to surrender would be a further breach of conditions and he is liable to arrest.' The statement, in line with UK police policy, did not name him but local media quoted sources identifying him as Mr Assange. The BBC yesterday reported the extradition unit delivered a note to both Mr Assange and the Ecuador embassy. The embassy declined to comment. Mr Assange has called for diplomatic . guarantees he will not be pursued by the US for publishing secret . documents if he goes to Sweden to face allegations of sex assault. The Australian, 40, said he is . prepared to go to Sweden to face questioning over the claims, but fears . Stockholm will turn him over to the U.S. where he could face espionage . and conspiracy charges over revelations by WikiLeaks. Safe haven: Members of an Ecuadorian NGO hold up placards reading 'Free Assange' outside the Foreign Affairs Ministry during a demonstration in support of the Australian's asylum request . Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he suddenly arrived seeking a last-ditch bid for political asylum last Tuesday, he said: 'Ultimately it may be a matter of what guarantees the United Kingdom, the United States and Sweden are willing to provide'. Mr Assange believes Washington will pursue him after WikiLeaks published a cache of sensitive documents, including about the Afghan and Iraq wars, and thousands of diplomatic cables which have embarrassed governments worldwide. He said: 'For example, if the US were to guarantee (it would) drop the grand jury investigation and any further investigation of WikiLeaks publishing activity, that would be an important guarantee... diplomatic commitments do have some weight.' Mr Assange has been holed up in the Ecuador embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden following the failure of a bid to re-open an appeal against his removal from the country. Mr Assange is friendly with the South American country's socialist leader Rafael Correa and embassies are regarded as 'safe havens' which British police cannot enter. Veteran journalist John Pilger last week said the Ecuadorians were being very hospitable and had provided Mr Assange with a 'fairly big room with a computer' although he would not confirm whether he had been given a bed for his stay. Protest: Supporters of Julian Assange demonstrate outside the Ecuadorian Embassy last week, where the Wikileaks founder has sought political asylum since suddenly arriving last Tuesday . Ecuador says he is under its . protection while it considers the asylum application. He faces arrest . for breaching the terms of his bail if he leaves the Knightsbridge . building. On Monday, a letter signed by high . profile campaigner Michael Moore and film director Oliver Stone calling . for Julian Assange to be granted asylum was handed into the embassy. Robert . Naiman, director of Just Foreign Policy - an American organisation . dedicated to reforming U.S foreign policy - gave the Ecuadorian Consul . Fidel Narvaez on the steps of the Hans St embassy just after 4.30pm. Mr . Naiman said those who had signed the letter, including radical academic . Noam Chomsky and actor Danny Glover, were concerned about Mr Assange’s . fate if his application is rejected. 'Our . concern is that if Julian is sent to Sweden that the government of . Sweden maybe send him to the United States where he may be prosecuted . under the Espionage Act' Mr Naiman said. 'Many . people in the United States are very concerned about this, are very . concerned about Julian and the US campaign and hopefully president . Correa can give him a positive decision in this case'. Discussion: The Ecuador ambassador Ana Alban, left, has now gone back to Ecuador to discuss Mr . Assange's claim for political asylum. He has criticised Australian PM Julia Gillard, right, over the handling of his case . Accepting the documents, Mr Narvaez said 'Mr Assange is under the protection of the Ecuadorian state, as you know. '(The letter) will be sent to president Correa...we will make sure he get’s it.' Over the weekend, the Ecuadorian . Ambassador left London to return to her home country for talks on the . bid. Anna Alban is to meet President Correa in the capital Quito, where . she will . personally brief him on the situation. Speaking after visiting Assange today, Mr Naiman said Mr Assange was in 'good spirits' despite living in 'modest' surroundings. 'My . sense is that Julian is used to simple living,' said Mr Naiman. 'I'd . say he is living now as I did when I was an undergraduate in college - . in what looked to me like a study that's been converted into a makeshift . bedroom that's still functioning as a study and workspace.' Asked whether Assange was sleeping on an inflatable mattress, Mr Naiman said: 'I won't deny that it's an inflatable bed.' WikiLeaks . spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, who also visited Mr Assange today, said . 'little had changed' regarding the asylum application. Mr . Hrafnsson said: 'The Ecuadorian government has requested material both . from Julian and from authorities in Sweden, the UK and US before they . make a formal decision.' Mr . Hrafnsson said reports that the Swedish Government had ruled out . guaranteeing Mr Assange won't be extradited to the United States were of . 'grave concern'. Assange's bid to avoid extradition has left his celebrity backers, including socialist Jemima Khan, facing an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache . 'I . don't have understanding whether this is the official position of the . Swedish government, but it's of grave concern,' he added. However, . he said Mr Assange was in 'good spirits' and keeping busy, adding: . 'He's working, doing what we are supposed to be doing, Wikileaks.' Meanwhile, Mr Assange, who wants to . start a new life in the South American country, has again criticised . Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard over Canberra's handling of his . case. The . former computer hacker said his situation was 'a serious political . matter... (that) the Australian government should treat with the . seriousness it requires'. He said: 'I have been attacked by the . U.S., from the vice president down, as a high-tech terrorist, and by . the Swedish prime minister and foreign minister -- surely that requires . some direct response from the Gillard government.' Mr Assange . has said he chose Ecuador's embassy instead of his home country's . because he felt Canberra had done nothing to protect him, a charge the . government has denied. Canberra has said it has limited capacity to help him because he is not in Australia and has not broken any Australian laws. Australia has also dismissed the idea . that Washington is keen to get Mr Assange, with Foreign Minister Bob . Carr saying Sunday there was 'no hint' of a plan to extradite him to the . U.S. Last week, Ecuador's . President said the South American nation would have to consider 'whether . Assange's life is at stake', as it makes it decision on asylum. President Correa told BBC Mundo the country 'defends the right to live'. President Correa also said: 'We are analysing Julian Assange's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way. We can't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete.' Mr Assange requested political asylum under the UN Human Rights Declaration, ironic given Ecuador's poor record on human rights and free speech. He is set to be extradited to . Sweden, where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually . molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a . visit to give a lecture. Mr Assange says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated. Meanwhile, his bid to avoid . extradition has left his celebrity backers, including socialist Jemima . Khan, facing an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache after they . stumped up the cash to keep him out of jail. Asked on Twitter whether she was 'on the hook' for his breach of bail, she replied: 'Yes. I had expected him to face the allegations. I am as surprised as anyone by this.' Bianca Jagger, film-makers Michael Moore and Ken Loach, and journalists John Pilger and Tariq Ali were among those who offered to support Mr Assange's bail while he fought a legal battle to avoid being sent to Sweden. Those who did stand surety for Mr Assange – freed on bail in December 2010 after spending nine days in Wandsworth jail when held under a European arrest warrant issued by the Swedes – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the embassy, just yards from Harrods.

"By . Sarah Dean . Changed man: Dr Paul Wood was released from prison in 2006 after serving almost 11 years for murder . A former drug addict and convicted killer has told how he turned his life around during his 11 years in prison - and now has a doctorate in psychology. New Zealander Dr Paul Wood, 37, earned two degrees and began his PhD while behind bars - but says he should not be a rare success story. At the age of 18, two days after his mother passed away from cancer, Paul killed his drug dealer with a softball bat inside his home in Auckland. It was New Year’s Eve 1995, Paul was hooked on morphine and the 42-year-old man had just made an ‘aggressive’ sexual advance towards him. Paul has spoken out about his time in prison in the same week that campaign group JustSpeak release their report into the New Zealand prison system. Paul said he initially began taking drugs as a teenager after getting involved with a bad group of friends and his addiction spiralled out of control when his mother became ill. ‘As she got sicker and sicker, I got heavier into it. I came from a family of boys, we were all pretty tough. Mum was the emotional support. She was the only person I had in my life in that sense,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I didn't cope very well, I made some really bad decisions that got me into a bad situation.’ ‘Two days after my mother died I caught up with a drug dealer, he made a sexual advance and I made a violent reaction,’ Paul said. Paul was arrested at the scene after neighbours heard the fighting inside his home and called the police. This is something he is grateful for as it forced him to own up. ‘I thought this was the end of my life. I thought “this can't be real”,’ he said. When he was handed a minimum 10-year sentence, Paul said it sounded like ‘forever’. He remembers feeling ‘the greatest despair imaginable’. Scroll down for video . Before prison: Paul as a child (far left) at a school camp with friends, where they were building a fort . He was still hooked on morphine and was going through withdrawal when he was jailed. ‘I felt that I had been the victim. I recognised that my response had caused the death of someone else but I also felt that I was the victim,’ he said. As he arrived at prison in 1996 he received a terrifying greeting. ‘People kicked their doors and shouted “hang yourself or I'm going to come and get you tomorrow”… I remember thinking “what have I got myself into”.’ Paul admitted he got into a lot of fights at school but was ‘always polite to teachers’. ‘I had a bad habit of gravitating towards the bad people,’ he said. Unfortunately that habit wasn’t broken when he arrived in prison. 'For the first couple of years, I did drugs and got in fights and thought “oh well they say I’m a really bad person so that's the kind of person I will be”. ‘By the time I was 20 I was moved to maximum security because I was non-compliant, I continued to do drugs - anything I could get my hands on, mostly smoking weed every day.’ After prison: Paul (on the right) in 2007 shortly after his release from prison. 'My brother Chris (left) wanted to take me to do something awesome, so took me snowboarding, and it was awesome,' Paul said. Then one day on his maximum security block at Auckland Prison Paremoremo, Paul met his first mentor – a convicted safe cracker - who allowed him to imagine a different path in life. ‘They got me into education and learning things. I realised how knowing things can enrich your life. He got me into reading books and it was there I got my idea for studying psychology.’ Paul saw lots of people in prison with mental health issues and wanted to understand the mind. 'Education led me out of danger,’ he said. He was surprised when he passed his first two psychology degree papers – especially after dropping out of high school. ‘It made me think I was capable of more… but to do that I had to stop smoking weed and drugs because I was spending all time in solitary confinement.’ Thanks to the support of his father, who visited him every weekend for almost 11-years, and Massey University whose lecturers travelled two hours out of their way to visit Paul in prison, Paul went on to complete his masters and was halfway through his PhD by the time he left jail. Huge achievement: Dr Paul Wood receiving his doctorate from Massey University Chancellor Dr Russell Ballard in 2012 . Moving forward: 'I'd like to see a prison that tries to help people figure out who they would most like to be,' Paul explained . 'I think they saw that I was generally interested in trying to be a better person and be who I really was,’ he explained. 'My father visited me every weekend. He would bring me my books, send out assignments. ‘In the early years he would come and visit me and I would have black eyes. It must have been so bad for him, I can only imagine now how powerless he must have felt. He just hoped that I was going to survive prison,’ Paul said. Paul admits he had drug relapses while in prison but was completely clean for the last five years of his sentence. ‘I've seen plenty of people who couldn’t get off that revolving door. But I think all of us have potential to change,’ he said. 'I felt so free years before I actually got out of prison.’ Teaching: Paul now coaches others on changing their lives and has even gone back and spoken to prisoners in his former jails . He believes prisoners should be given an informed choice of their options and should really become accountable for their offending. He says when prisoners are punished they adopt a victim mentally and this prevents them from addressing the problem as they are busy trying to protect themselves instead. 'I'd like to see a prison that tries to help people figure out who they would most like to be,’ he said. Paul is not against prisons and believes they are ‘absolutely necessary for the worst offenders’ and people with ‘pathological issues’. But he thinks the majority of criminals are people who may bad decisions. 'I get asked about this stuff because I'm considered an exception - but shouldn't I be the rule? Aren’t I what prisons are supposed to create?’ Paul has received a negative backlash against his views but thinks that whatever stand you take personally, talking about prisoner rehabilitation is an 'important conversation for society’ to have. ‘You have to be honest. If you want to punish people harshly you can, but don’t do so under the guise that it will help reduce re-offending,’ he said. Since being released from prison in 2006, Paul collected his PhD in 2012 and has set up his own coaching and consulting company. He is in love, after meeting a ‘very smart, no nonsense woman’. She Googled him after their first date two years ago. ‘She was honest and said I know a lot about you but you don’t know much about me,’ he said. ‘She believes in people’s capacity to change and grow.’ The couple have their first child on the way, which Paul describes as the 'most amazing' thing that’s happened to him.","Auckland man Paul Wood murdered a drug dealer on New Year's Eve, 1995 .

"By . Andy Dolan . His receipt bears the slogan ‘Saving You Money Every Day’. But a quick trip to his local supermarket for a few breakfast basics turned out to be the most expensive of John Brown’s life. The warehouse worker was charged £450 for a loaf of bread after he rushed a handful of goods through a self-service till – and neglected to check the receipt. When John Brown, 37, made a quick visit to Asda for some groceries, he was charged £450 for a loaf of bread . Ironically, Mr Brown had purchased the loaf only because he saw it was reduced! He visited the Asda store on March 15 . to buy eggs, but picked up his favourite wheatgrain loaf when he noticed . it was on offer. He also bought jam and another cut-price loaf which he . planned to freeze. The . groceries should have come to £3.88, but Mr Brown was so keen to get . home for breakfast he did not notice the exorbitant total on the till or . the debit card machine. It . was only when he printed a mini-statement at a cash machine later that . day that he noticed his most recent transaction was for £453.19 at the . store in Jack Hayward Way, Wolverhampton. When the 37-year-old . checked his Asda receipt, he discovered the £1.25 Roberts Bakery Malted . Wheatgrain loaf – supposedly reduced to 69p – had cost him £450. Yesterday . Mr Brown, who lives a short walk from the shop, admitted he should have . checked the amount before typing in his debit card PIN. Mr Brown says he only noticed the error when we went to withdraw money to buy a new car days later . ‘I . regularly use the self-service tills as they are generally quicker than . queuing for a manned till,’ he said. ‘I just like to get in and get out . of these supermarkets. I got a terrible shock when I realised what had . happened – I hadn’t even looked at the total when I paid as I’d only . bought a couple of items and knew what the bill should roughly come to. ‘It’s . made me think twice about using a self-service machine again. I think . the safest course of action will be to use cash in future.’ The . error scuppered Mr Brown’s attempt to purchase a car as it left him . unable to put down a deposit. He complained to the supermarket and has . now received a refund and a £15 gift card. An . Asda spokesman said the error was an ‘isolated incident’ relating to an . error on the coding of the reduced price sticker attached to the loaf.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . From tracking our steps each day, to monitoring our sleep at night, wearable technology has provided new ways to improve our health. But instead of monitoring our fitness, what if similar technology could monitor our finances? That’s what a group of Seattle-based designers wanted to find out with their latest project, dubbed Token. This animation shows how the concept Token wristband could help a wearer monitor and control their finances . The group came up with a concept wristband that lets the wearer know when their spending has got out of hand. It also allows the wearer to transfer funds to friends and family using a simple ‘fist bump’ action. Mock-ups of the design suggest the Token wristband would work as a type of FitBit for finance, by offering a complete analysis of the wearer’s spending habits. Seattle-based designers, Artefact,  have come up with a concept wristband that lets the wearer know when their spending has exceeded their budget . Pictured are concept models of the device which would monitor the wearer's finances and spending habits . The Token device allows the wearer to transfer funds to friends and family using a simple 'fist bump' action . The Artefact studio envisions the device could replace plastic credit cards, which can be easily lost or stolen, Bloomberg Businessweek reports. Unlike a credit card, the touchscreen device features a security mechanism based on the wearer’s thumbprint, and a PIN or password making it useless if stolen. ‘Token is contextually aware of a merchant’s Wi-Fi and can receive product information and transmit payment details with the touch of a finger,’ the company explained on its website. It can also send special offers direct to the customer, as well as show them some of the negative outcomes of their shopping choices.

Barclays has developed a wristband that will allow wearers to pay for a morning coffee as well as their daily commute.Wearers swipe the bands, which can be worn 24 hours a day, over a terminal at a shop or pay point on the bus or station platform to make a purchase.The bPay are rubberised and waterproof bands, which contain a computer chip and micro-aerial to communicate with terminals, have the security benefit that they are less likely to be lost or stolen than a wallet or purse.The bPay bands have been trialled to the public at events such as the British Summer Time Music Festival and London Pride, where they can be used to gain entry and buy food and drink.However, they are now moving into the mainstream so that they can be used at any one of around 300,000 till terminals in the UK – many in coffee shops and newsagents - that already work with contactless debit cards. The designers even envision Token using data from the wearer’s shopping list to guide them through supermarket aisles. ‘All the moving parts are there,’ Artefact Design Director Craig Erickson told Bloomberg Businessweek, ‘but no one’s assembled them yet in this fashion.’ He added there are no plans to turn the concept into reality, as it would require an infrastructure for transferring money from banks directly to vendors. Instead, he said the concept is a way for people to rethink the focus of wearables and how it could help monitor different areas of our lives. ‘Just because [wearables] are on our bodies and can really help us understand ourselves, we should not limit their applications to health, wellness and the Quantified Self,’ the company said. ‘Wearables could provide us with new, easier and better ways to interact with our environment, the products and services we are using and the people we are connected to. ‘The unique security mechanism that we incorporated in Token opens a range of possibilities for exciting new experiences across industries and services.’ There are currently no plans to turn the concept into reality, as it would require an infrastructure for transferring money from banks directly to vendors .

"By . Kate Lyons . The Apple hackers targeting Australian users over the last few days have spread their operation abroad with the first accounts of attacks in the U.S. Reports started surfacing on Tuesday of a hacker calling himself 'Oleg Pliss' locking Australian Apple users out of their devices and then demanding a ransom of between US$50 and US$100 for the device to be unlocked. The cyber-attack seems to have spread across the ocean, with U.S. users reporting on Apple support threads they have also received ransom notifications from 'Oleg Pliss'. iJacked: Apple users in Austrlia began reporting their phones had been locked and held to ransom early on Tuesday morning . The Sydney Morning Herald reporting that one user wrote on an Apple support thread: 'I'm in the US. Never been to Australia. Hacked last night.' It's unclear how the hackers gained access to the devices, while some users are pointing to a breach of their iCloud accounts, Apple insists iCloud was not compromised. It has also been suggested that the breach was the result of a password scam, resulting from people using the same password for multiple accounts. Melbourne iPad owner 'veritylikestea' posted to an Apple support forum that her iPad 'suddenly locked itself' on Tuesday morning. 'There was a message on the screen ... saying that my device(s) had been hacked by Oleg Pliss,' she told Australian Associated Press. Staying tight-lipped: Apple are keeping quiet on the security breach, despite mounting concern and anger on their own online support forum and technology website Whirlpool . The message demanded she pay US$100 (AU$108.20) through PayPal for her device to be unlocked. Apple released a statement about the incident. 'Apple takes security very seriously and iCloud was not compromised during this incident. Impacted users should change their Apple ID password as soon as possible and avoid using the same user name and password for multiple services,' it read. On Tuesday the Australian Government's Stay Smart Online initiative offered a statement saying that 'available information is limited' but they urged people to change their Apple ID password as soon as possible, even if they have not been targeted as a precaution. They also instructed people not to pay the ransom. The NSW Police also issued a 'scam alert' and urged Apple users to change their passwords.

Spokesman . Rupert Adams said: ‘We saw a real gamble on William and Kate choosing . George and we could be forced to pay out for a second time if the . Tindalls choose Poppy.’ Other . favourites for the youngest royal’s name are Charlotte at 4/1, Victoria . at 6/1 and Anne at 7/1. Elizabeth, Catherine and Isobella are . level-pegging at 10/1. William . Hill is also offering bets at 50/1 that Zara’s daughter will be an . Olympian and at 33/1 that she plays international rugby like her father. Princess Anne (seen at her estate on Friday where her new granddaughter is believed to be) broke with tradition and gave her daughter Zara a name not readily associated with the British Royal Family . Zara gave birth to a 7lbs 12oz baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on Friday, with her husband Mike Tindall present at the birth. There has been wide-spread speculation as to what Zara will call her daughter - especially as her own mother, the Princess Royal, broke with tradition when naming her. But Poppy has become a firm favourite after Adele Horton, 30, said her brother Tom spoke to Zara at a rugby match in November. Miss . Horton, a support worker from Gloucester, said: 'My brother was down at . the rugby and he quite often sees Zara because she is sometimes down in . the stands. 'He saw her . at the Japan game on November 12 and told her that his girlfriend was . due the same time and that they were thinking about the name Teddy, so . she better not steal it. 'She was having a joke back and saying that they were thinking of Poppy - so maybe that will be the name.' Zara and Mike could pick a moniker for their baby that harks back to monarchs of the past . But Zara and Mike could equally pick a moniker for their baby that harks back to monarchs of the past. Among other favourites with bookmakers are Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria and Anne. Queen . Charlotte, who was born in 1744, was married to George III. Charlotte . was actually her second name - her first being Sophie. A keen botanist, she founded Kew Gardens, had 15 children - 13 of whom survived - and was a patron of the arts. Some historians have argued that she was of African descent. Her . daughter, born in 1766, was also called Charlotte and later known as the . Princess Royal. George IV also named his only child Charlotte, but she died in childbirth at the age of 21, leading to a mass outpouring of grief across the nation. Elizabeth is a highly respected name amongst the monarchy. Anne, seen, with Zara on her Christening day, has a close relationship with her daughter, who has praised her parenting skills and hopes to follow in her footsteps . The Queen is held in great respect by her family. Zara's great-grandmother the Queen Mother was also Elizabeth. Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch who ruled from 1558 until 1603. Victoria . would pay tribute to the longest reigning British monarch so far. Victoria ruled for more than 63 years, acceding to the throne in 1837. Britain had evolved into a constitutional monarchy. She became the figurehead of a vast empire and her reign spanned the rest of the century. She married Prince Albert and had nine children, but mourned his early death for the rest of her life. Anne could refer to either Zara's mother, the Princess Royal, or Queen Anne, who was the last of the Stuart monarchs. She became Queen aged 37 in 1702 and reigned until her death in 1714. Married to Prince George of Denmark she gave birth to more than a dozen children but none survived her. Anne suffered from poor health and her weight ballooned towards the end of her life.","Odds of baby girl being name Poppy have been slashed from 33/1 to just 8/1 .

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman . Goodbye: Jill Abramson was the paper's first female editor and has been in her position since 2011 . New York Times staffers received a shocker Wednesday when it was announced that editor Jill Abramson would be leaving the paper after just two and a half years in the position. Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr announced Abramson's replacement by managing editor Dean Baquet at a paper-wide meeting, but would not given an explanation for Abramson's dismissal or answer any questions. A Times spokesman told AdAge that Abramson was being replaced to 'improve some aspects of management in the newsroom'. Abramson, 60, became the paper's first female editor its 160-year history when she was promoted from managing editor in June 2011. She was absent at Wednesday's meeting and did not pretend that she voluntarily resigned in a prepared statement. 'I've loved my run at The Times,' Abramson said in a statement provided by the company. 'I got to work with the best journalists in the world doing so much stand-up journalism.' New Yorker reporter Ken Auletta, who profiled Abramson in 2011, wrote today that a pay gap may have been what led to the female editor's firing. A source told the magazine that Abramson discovered a few weeks ago that her salary and pension benefits were 'considerably less' than her male predecessor, Bill Keller. 'She confronted the top brass,' a close associate said, which may have factored into her dismissal. Abramson will be replaced by current managing editor Dean Baquet, 57, who will be the paper's first African-American editor. Scroll down for video . Moving up: Abramson (center) is being replaced by managing editor Dean Baquet (left). Both have been in their positions since 2011 (pictured at their promotion announcement above). Pictured with former executive editor Bill Keller, who allegedly made 'considerably' more than Abramson during his time at the Times . 'It is an honor to be asked to lead the only newsroom in the country that is actually better than it was a generation ago, one that approaches the world with wonder and ambition every day,' Baquet said in a statement. Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr made the announcement at an afternoon paper-wide meeting. Abramson was not present . While some Times reporters said they were 'surprised' by the management change, trouble has been brewing at the top of the paper for some time and was chronicled in a Politico story last year. The story starts off with an anecdote about Abramson calling Baquet into her office and blaming him for stories not being 'buzzy' enough. Baquet storms out, punches a wall, and skips the paper's daily 4pm meeting. Politico interviewed several staffers at the paper who described Abramson as an unpopular leader, calling her 'stubborn, condescending, and difficult to work with'. 'Every editor has a story about how she’s blown up in a meeting,' one reporter told politico. 'Jill can be impossible,' another staffer added. 'I think there’s a really easy caricature that some people have bought into, of the bitchy woman character and the guy who is sort of calmer,' Baquet said himself of Abramson in the article, adding that he thinks it 'a little bit of an unfair caricature'. Abramson refused to talk to Politico for the article. Abramson joined the newspaper in 1997 after working for nearly a decade at The Wall Street Journal. She was the Times' Washington editor and bureau chief before being named managing editor in 2003. Baquet succeeded her as managing editor after she was named to the top editing spot. Unpopular: Staffers at the Times had described Abramson as 'stubborn, condescending, and difficult to work with' in a Politico article published last year. Abramson was so dedicated to the Times . that she even got the Paper's signature 'T' tattooed on her body. She . told Out magazine that she has three other tattoos as well. 'I . think eventually, when I finish doing them, [the tattoos] will tell the . story of me, of where I lived, and what things have been important to . me,' Abramson said. Baquet . originally joined the Times in 1990 as a reporter and held positions . including deputy metropolitan editor and national editor. He left the . paper for the Los Angeles Times in 2000, where he served as managing . editor and then editor. Baquet rejoined the Times in 2007 and was . Washington bureau chief before becoming the managing editor for news in . September 2011. Prior to his . first stint at the Times, Baquet worked at The Chicago Tribune and The . Times Picayune in New Orleans. While at the Tribune in 1988, he and two . other journalists won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting, . for looking into corruption in the Chicago City Council. He was a . finalist in the same category in 1994. The . move comes amid a continued shift in the Times' focus, and that of the . newspaper industry overall, toward digital products and away from . traditional print papers as print circulation and advertising revenue . declines. In its most recent . quarter, the Times Co. saw overall advertising revenue rise for the . first time in three years, jumping 3 per cent to $158.7 million. The . company's print and digital advertising rose compared with the same . period a year ago. The . company also added digital subscribers and increased home-delivery . prices. At the same time, the company posted a small profit that fell . slightly short of Wall Street analysts' expectations. New York Times Co. shares fell 71 cents, or 4.5 per cent, to end the afternoon at $15.06.","Abramson, 60, is being replaced by managing editor Dean Baquet, 57, who will become the paper's first African-American editor .

"A 19-year-old Egyptian university student called Aisha Mustafa has invented a futuristic propulsion system for spacecraft. The invention 'leapfrogs' Nasa research, and uses a hi-tech quantum effect to drive satellites through space, rather than ordinary rocket engines. Mustafa's invention generates energy using the Casimir-Polder force, an obscure quantum effect using two surfaces and objects in a vacuum. Mustafa's invention generates energy using the Casimir-Polder force, an obscure quantum effect using two surfaces and objects in a vacuum . Mustafa says she hopes to test her invention on future space missions . The force is described as an 'invisible rubber band' between bulky objects and atoms that arises from the ever-present random fluctuation of microscopic electric fields in empty space. The fluctuations get stronger near a surface, and an isolated neutral atom nearby feels the force as a 'pull'. Mustafa's drive isn't exactly Warp Factor Ten material, but it provides enough energy for satellites to maneouvre gracefully through space. Instead of using nuclear reactors or jets, Mustafa's satellites could generate drive using the panels. Nasa had researched a similar idea using the Casimir-Polder force - with the idea of generating it around a 'sail' floating in space.

"By . James Chapman . and Andy Dolan . Reality TV star White Dee will be stripped of her benefits if she is found to be earning significant sums by cashing in on her notoriety, David Cameron implied yesterday. The Prime Minister stepped in after the star of Channel 4’s Benefits Street insisted she would continue taking state handouts until he or his Government stopped her. White Dee, whose real name is Deidre Kelly, has repeatedly insisted she is too ill to work as she suffers from depression. Scroll down to see video . Deirdre Kelly, or 'White Dee', has been seen cashing in on public appearances since her launch to fame . The mother of two gets £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance – formerly known as incapacity benefit – child tax credit and child benefit, plus £500 a month in housing benefit. But controversy erupted at the weekend when it emerged Miss Kelly had been cashing in on her growing celebrity status, making a string of public appearances. She was pictured partying during a promotional appearance in Magaluf, Majorca, and is said to have signed a deal to appear on the next Celebrity Big Brother. Asked about her claims, Mr Cameron told the Daily Mail that it was not acceptable for someone to remain ‘parked on benefits’. David Cameron said it was unacceptable for anyone to remain 'parked' on benefits . ‘If people start earning money, we can take away their benefits money,’ he said. ‘If someone’s benefits aren’t appropriate they should be taken away.’ The Department for Work and Pensions said it could not comment on individual cases, but a Government source said it was ‘safe to assume’ Miss Kelly’s claims were now being examined. People on Employment and Support Allowance can be allowed to take on small amounts of work, but employment involving significant earnings normally requires approval from a doctor who believes it will aid their recovery. Miss Kelly, who was the star of Benefits Street, which showed the lives of families on James Turner Street in Birmingham, insists she is declaring all her earnings to the authorities. ‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said. ‘Yes, I am taking casual work. I won’t tell you how much I am earning but it’s not half as much as people think.’ Her last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000. Following the popularity of the Channel 4 show, Miss Kelly has had several TV offers. She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham. Her agent Barry Tomes dismissed suggestions the single mother should be stripped of her benefits. Claiming he was trying to manage Miss Kelly’s ‘gradual’ return to work, he added: ‘I’m trying to get Dee fit for work. Once she does that, she will be able to earn good money and pay taxes on that.’ White Dee was the star of Benefits Street, which showed the lives of families on James Turner Street in Birmingham . White Dee has agreed to appear at another Carnage Magaluf night in June after she was pictured downing shots in the party resort last month .","Deirdre Kelly receives £214 a week because she is 'too depressed to work'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Four in ten Americans have been revealed to get less than the recommended amount of nightly sleep, according to a new Gallup poll. Doctors suggest adults get between seven and nine hours sleep per night, and the national average is 6.8 hours. The poll was conducted this year and the last study came out in 2004, and while there have been some marked changes, the net results have stayed the same. Breaking it down by hours: The number of people getting eight hours of sleep has increased but the rates of those getting seven and nine have decreased . The majority- 59 per cent- of respondents get seven hours of sleep or more per night, and 40 per cent got six or less both this year and nearly a decade ago in 2004. The rates have also held for those getting five hours or less (14 per cent) and six hours (26 per cent). Changes came in the longer sleepers, as fewer reported getting seven hours as the rate dropped from 28 per cent to 25 per cent, while the number getting nine hours or more increased from 25 per cent to 29 per cent. While there do not appear to be massive differences over the course of the past ten years, the changes appear far more sizable when compared to the first iteration of the survey which was taken in 1942. In their minds: Even though they are not getting as much as recommended, the majority of people believe that it is enough for them . Back then, the average nightly sleep clocked in at 7.9 hours, meaning that the nation's work force got more than an hour extra compared to this year's findings. Today's masochists and workaholics appear to come out feeling stronger than the experts but just barely as more people feel like they get as much sleep as they need while slightly fewer wish that they got some more shut eye. Those disregarding the experts were in the majority, as 56 per cent thought they got enough sleep and only 43 per cent complained about wanting more. Economic implications: With 40 per cent of Americans getting less than the recommended number of hours of sleep every night, that means that fewer are fully rested at work . The study also breaks up the respondents by age which helps shed some light on the reported answers. The biggest age group that gets more than seven hours of sleep per night are those 65 and up, 67 per cent of whom fell in that category and the remaining 33 per cent were six or less. From there, the disparity between six and seven hours decreases incrementally according to age, with 62 per cent of 50-64 year olds getting seven hours, 56 per cent of 30-49 year olds, and 54 per cent of 18-29 year olds.","40 per cent of Americans get six or less hours of sleep per night while 59 per cent get seven or more .

"By . Ralph Ellis . Follow @@ralphellis56 . Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football. This week includes Arsenal's Jack Wilshere making good his promise to play more attacking football, Wes Brown doing his best Ryan Shawcross impression and Tony Pulis making a case in defence of Palace. 1) Jack Wilshere said his New Year’s resolution was to prove he’s an attacking midfield man – and he’s true to his word. He followed up a goal and an assist at Villa by setting up one of Santi Cazorla’ s double against Fulham and made three more chances. Some 76 of the massive total of 106 passes he played in the game were in the opposition’s half of the field. Wil power: Jack Wilshere has kept true to his New Year's resoultion of playing more attacking football . Pulis makes case for the defence . 2) Converted defender Joel Ward and . skipper Mile Jedinak have become the rocks on which Crystal Palace’s . attempt at survival are founded. Since Tony Pulis paired them up in front of his back four, the Eagles have conceded just four goals in six games. The . security blanket they put in front of the defence meant that of Stoke’s . 17 attempts on goal, only three of them were from inside the penalty . area. In fact since Pulis took charge at Selhurst Park only Arsenal have kept more clean sheets. Eyes wide shut: Mile Jedanak (left) and Joel Ward (right) have conceded only four goals in six games . 3) Swansea out passed Tottenham with 642 . passes against 499, and had more of the ball in both halves (55.3% and . 57.2%), but still got battered 3-1. Sadly . that is a recurring theme for Michael Laudrup’s side who are great to . watch but find themselves flirting with relegation just three points out . of the drop zone. The . Swans have had more possession and made more passes than their . opposition in every one of the 14 games they have failed to win this . season. 9/10s of the law? Swansea players dejected after losing to Tottenham - they have had more possession in all 14 games they have lost . Brown does his best Shawcross impression . 4) Wes Brown is in danger of becoming . the new Ryan Shawcross of a few years back – whole hearted rather than . nasty but still too reckless for the good of himself and whoever he’s . against. The . Sunderland defender was sent off at Stoke for a challenge on Charlie . Adam (although that was rescinded on appeal), and then again against . Norwich for a reckless tackle on Ricky Van Wolfswinkel. That . means his tackle that put Southampton’s Dejan Lovren on a stretcher was . the third serious incident he’s been involved in, in just 14 games . since himself returning from a bad injury. Liability: Dejan Lovren (right) scores before being stretchered off the field after a tackle by Wes Brown . 5) Aston Villa became the first Premier . League side to wrack up more than 50 bookings this season with four . cautions in the game at Liverpool. Manager . Paul Lambert insists it is a result of over enthusiasm from young . players rather than any deliberate plan to go out kicking people. Ryan . Bertrand got his loan spell started by collecting one of them, meaning . Villa have had 52 yellows in all – five more than Stoke.  Manchester . United are third with 44 – of which Wayne Rooney has contributed seven. It was all yellow: New signing Ryan Bertrand contributed to Villa being the first side to tally 50 cautions . 6) Nottingham Forest’s Henri Lansbury . tucked away two penalties in the 4-1 win over Blackburn – but wouldn’t . have made manager Billy Davies quite so happy by picking up a booking . for a bad foul in the second half. It . was his tenth of the season in just 26 games – making him along with . Carl Dickinson of Port Vale the first to reach the mark that earns a two . game suspension. The . 23-year-old Lansbury, who started out at Arsenal being tipped for great . things, will miss Forest’s FA Cup Fourth round tie at home to Preston . plus a Championship match at Watford. Take caution: Henri Lansbury (R) scored two penalties for Nottingham Forest against Blackburn... but also picked up his 10th booking this season . 7) Mick McCarthy might be the next Championship manager looking over his shoulder as Ipswich slide into hard times. The . 1-0 defeat at an Ian Holloway inspired Millwall was their fourth loss . in a row, the worst sequence since just before Paul Jewell was sacked in . October 2012. McCarthy’s . side, a point off the play-offs on Boxing Day after a 3-0 success at . Doncaster, have suddenly found themselves down to tenth. Sack race? Mick McCarthy's Ipswich lost their fourth consecutive game after defeat against Millwall . 8) Kasper Schmeichel was in brilliant . form for Leicester as their 1-0 win at Leeds put them five points clear . at the top of the Championship. That’s . all the more reason to wonder why the owners at the King Power stadium . haven’t done anything about securing the 27-year-old son of the great . Peter on a new contract. His . current deal runs out in the summer, and Arsenal, Newcastle and Hull . are among current Premier League clubs who fancy signing him on a free . transfer. Fumble? Leicester have not offered Kasper Schmeichel a new deal despite his heroics this season . 9) Jose Mourinho finally got a striker . scoring goals yesterday, and the Chelsea manager must have been all the . more glad about Samuel Eto’os hat-trick after Romelu Lukaku’s on-loan . exploits all season. As if his performances for Everton hadn’t been embarrassment enough, he has another front man getting goals for another club. England . Under 21 star Patrick Bamford had already got 18 in 37 games for MK . Dons – then he marked his first start for Derby by scoring the winner . against Brighton. Loan star: With 18 goals in 37 games, Patrick Bamford (C) is another Chelsea loanee doing well away from Stamford Bridge . 10) Things might be tough for Sam . Allardyce at West Ham, but just down the A12 his old number two Phil . Brown is having a better time of it. Brown . can look forward seeing Hull City arrive at Roots Hall in the FA Cup . next week in confident mood after a 3-0 win over Chesterfield, which . took his Southend team to just one defeat in their last 15 games. The . man who first got City into the Premier League – and kept them there . for a season – has moved the Shrimpers within a point of the automatic . promotion places in League Two.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 16-year-old girl is alive but in critical condition after she and her young boyfriend were hit by a train as they walked to a high school dance together at a school in northern California. Sadly, Mickayla Friend's 16-year-old boyfriend, Mateus Moore - who her family describes as her 'first love' - didn't survive. And according to witnesses, Friend may have been killed as well had Moore not pushed her out of the way at the very last second, keeping her from getting pinned underneath the train. It remains unclear why the teens didn't hear the train's horn when it sounded as it was bearing down on them as they walked down the tracks. It's also unclear what they were doing on the tracks at all - according to witnesses, the couple was walking to grab a bite to eat before heading into the dance, but authorities aren't sure why they chose to walk on the tracks rather than take the road. Young love: This photo of Mateus Moore and Mickayla friend was taken just minutes before the young couple was hit by a train . Both victims initially were named by Fox40.com, however no official identification has been made by law enforcement officials in Marysville -- about 70 miles north of Sacramento - where the incident took place. 'It's her first boyfriend, and her first love,' Friend's sister, Alithya Friend, told KCRA.com. 'And she just got it taken away from her in an instant.' Alithya confirmed to the station that her sister was the teen injured by the train, and says Mickayla currently is in critical condition at Sutter Roseville Medical Center just outside of Sacramento after she was hit by the train about 7 p.m. Friday. Alithya also says she snapped a photo of the happy couple just minutes before they left for the dance. First love: Family members called Moore Friend's 'first love' who was 'taken away in an instant' 'You can't imagine getting the worst call . in your life, knowing that you just dropped your sister off to go to a . dance that was supposed to be a special, amazing night for her and her . boyfriend of a year,' Alithya said. 'And then you get a . call that says he's deceased and she's in critical condition.' Sean Stark witnessed the incident and credits Moore with saving his girlfriend's life. 'The engineer was on the horn,' Stark told KCRA. 'Then finally, they both looked . back at the same time.' Then, Stark says, Moore made a split-second decision that may have saved his girlfriend's life. 'They would have both been underneath that train if he didn't push her out of the way at the last second,' said Stark. The incident occurred just steps from a game on a packed Little League field. Moore died at the scene and Friend was airlifted to hospital with traumatic injuries, a fire department spokesperson said. Horrifying: Emergency personnel work at the scene of a train accident where two pedestrians where one teen was killed and nother critically injured after being hit by a train . The accident happened around 7.00 p.m., and in front of dozens of horrified onlookers scrambling to shield their children from the traumatizing scene, according to the Appeal-Democrat. Parents attending the game raced towards the tracks fearing one of their own had been hit, Marysville Little League Secretary Diane Washburn told the paper. 'It wasn't one of our kids, just get back,' she recalled telling the swelling crowd, adding that her next priority was keeping children from seeing what had happened. 'Once they see that, that can't be unseen.' People who were at the game told the Marysville Appeal-Democrat they heard a long blowing of the train's horn, much longer than usual. Critical: A medivac helicopter arrives at the scene to whisk the critically injured female to a nearby hospital . Every parent's worst nightmare: Police on the scene of the terible accident . 'He honked from so far back there,' a concession stand volunteer told the paper. Another said the engineer honked 'a bunch and a bunch and a bunch.' Investigators were combing the scene for evidence well after dark, according to the paper. The small town of about 12,000 was rocked by the incident. 'Marysville is a small but busy city,' said the fire department spokesperson. 'Everybody knows everybody so it was pretty traumatic.' Union Pacific Railroad is investigating the incident with the help of the Marysville Police Department.

"By . Sam Webb . Joe Andrews, 19, died in a crash after he briefly fell asleep at the wheel. His grieving family and girlfriend are now committed to making people aware of the potential hazard of 'microsleep' An exhausted teenager died in a crash after he 'microslept' at the wheel. Experts said Joe Andrews, 19, dozed off for just a few seconds when his Vauxhall Corsa collided with a HGV on the A590 at Linda in Cumbria. An inquest established that the cause of the accident last year was caused by Joe having a microsleep - a sleep lasting just one to 30 seconds where the eyes can stay open, usually caused by sleep deprivation. Joe’s grieving family and girlfriend are now committed to making people aware of the hazard of microsleep so other families do not have to go through their anguish. Joe, of New Leys, in Barrow, Cumbria, had been out fishing and digging for bait in the early hours. He picked up and his girlfriend Allanah Salton, and they went for a drive and to watch the sunrise together. The accident happened as they were heading back to Barrow at around 5am. Joe had been driving well under the speed limit at 40mph, as had the HGV driver. The North West Air Ambulance transported Joe from Furness General Hospital to the Royal Preston Hospital, where he later died. Mother Julie, Andrews, 49, said: 'We are having really good weather this summer and it was good weather when Joseph had his accident. 'Microsleep caused Joseph’s accident. He hadn’t been drinking or taking drugs, he wasn’t speeding, he wasn’t smoking, he wasn’t on his phone, he just had that microsleep and unfortunately his injuries were too bad for him to be saved. 'We want to raise awareness about microsleep, particularly among young people who are finishing college or university for the summer. They stay up all night on social media, gaming, talking to friends and trying to fit so much in. 'We want to explain from the parents’ point of view and warn about the hazard we don’t see, you don’t think of tiredness. Loss: Grant Andrews (father), Allanah Salton (girlfriend) and Julie Andrews (mother) paid tribute to the popular teenager . 'I never wanted to be a ""what if"" mother but I am. You think if only the car had been five minutes earlier or later Joseph would have rolled into the verge and he would have phoned and said I’ve damaged my car, and it would not have damaged him like it did. 'We’ve lost our only child, we have lost our life. It rips your world apart. 'It was that one little second that changed our lives forever. All our hopes and dreams have gone with him.' Father Gavin Andrews, 50, said: 'The kids have just had all the pressure lifted off them at the end of their exams. You see them on Facebook up at goodness knows what time and a lot of them are mobile with mopeds and cars. 'As parents you drum into your kids about drink and drugs but you don’t think of this microsleep, sleep deprivation. We want them to be aware of this danger. 'It’s happened to all of us. How many times have you nodded off in front of the TV? You can rewind a TV programme, we can’t rewind what happened to Joseph.' The teenager's Vauxhall Corsa collided with a HGV on the A590 at Linda in Cumbria . He added: 'You can’t decide when it happens, your brain shuts down and your eyes can be open. 'This message is for kids who still have the summer in front of them. We don’t want other parents to feel like we do, or girlfriends and boyfriends to feel like Allanah does. One second can change your life.' Allanah, 17, who was injured in the accident, said: 'Everyone thinks it won’t happen to you. Just think about everyone involved. 'Some people still think Joe had been speeding but he hadn’t. He was sensible and a good driver.' Joe, who studied joinery and carpentry at nearby Furness College, was popular with his friends. Popular: Joe was described as a joker and 'would make people feel good about themselves' Allanah added: 'He was unique, everyone knew him, he was a joker. Joe just had a special thing about him. He would speak to anyone and he would make people feel good about themselves. 'We loved being in the car, that car gave us our adventures, and it has given me memories.' Mrs Andrews said: 'Joe lit the place up. He was a good-hearted kid, who had respect for people young and old. He was unique. Everyone enjoyed his company.' The family said Joe was always helping others, such as following a friend’s car in the snow when they were nervous about driving. They said his friends looked out for one another, always having a designated driver to call upon after a night out. Coroner for South Cumbria, Mr Ian Smith, said: 'It was a momentary matter and sadly Joseph paid the ultimate price for it.' Mr Smith recorded a verdict of death in a road traffic collision. Microsleeps are brief, unintended episodes of loss of attention associated with events such as blank stare, head snapping, and prolonged eye closure which may occur when a person is fatigued but trying to stay awake to perform a monotonous task like driving a car or watching a computer screen. These are potentially among the most dangerous consequences of insomnia. Microsleep episodes last from a few seconds to two minutes, and often the person is not aware that a microsleep has occurred. In fact, microsleeps often occur when a person's eyes are open. While in a microsleep, a person fails to respond to outside information. A person will not see a red signal light or notice that the road has taken a curve, which is why this phenomenon is of particular interest to people who study drowsy driving. During a microsleep, a pilot might not be aware of flashing alarm lights in the cockpit. Microsleeps are most likely to occur at certain times of the day, such as pre-dawn hours and mid-afternoon hours when the body is programmed to sleep. It is estimated that drowsy driving is a factor in 10 to 30 per cent of all crashes. Source: Sleepdex .","Joe Andrews, 19, went for drive with girlfriend to watch sunrise .

"The widow of a man suspected of snatching Madeleine McCann said she is sure he was not responsible for her disappearance - and insisted he would have been at home watching TV at the time. Heroin addict Euclides Monteiro, who died in a freak tractor accident in 2009, worked at the Ocean Club Resort in Praia da Luz, Portugal, which Maddie disappeared from. However, he was sacked a year before she vanished and it is feared that he may have abducted the British girl to get revenge on his former employers. The development comes after reports that police are closing in on three 'prime suspects' known to have been associates of Monteiro. Prime suspect: Convicted criminal Euclides Monteiro, 40, (left) who died in a freak tractor accident in 2009, is suspected of being involved in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. His widow Luisa Rodrigues (right) said she is sure that he was not responsible - and she would have turned him in if she had any suspicions . Disappearance: Madeleine was nearly four years old when she vanished from Praia da Luz . His widow Luisa Rodrigues said she was questioned by Portuguese police but she insists that he would not have committed such a serious crime. Monteiro's mobile phone was near the Ocean Club Resort at the time the young girl disappeared, it has been revealed. The 40-year-old convicted criminal, who served time behind bars, had previously been caught stealing from the resort Madeleine disappeared from. However, family members have hit out, and accused the police of 'scapegoating a dead man'. Ms Rodrigues, 40, told David Collins at the Daily Mirror she met police officers in a cafe near her home in Lagos. 'They said they suspected him because he used to work at the Ocean Club complex where the McCanns were staying and because they had tracked the signal from his mobile phone to the area where Madeleine disappeared the night she vanished,' she said. 'I was speechless. I kept repeating Euclides was innocent but they said it was not for me to say.' She lives a 15-minute drive away from the scene of the young girl's disappearance on May 3, 2007. Ms Rodrigues said the police officers asked about her relationship with Monteiro, where he had worked and about his problems with drink and drugs. She later provided detectives with her husband's work contracts and bank statements from their joint account. Ms Rodrigues said that she could not remember the night of Madeleine's disappearance - but insisted she would have turned him in if she thought he was responsible. She added: 'It's a long time ago, but I'm sure he would have been at home watching TV. That's what he always did after work.' Monteiro, who fathered Ms Rodrigues 11-year-old son, once served a five-year prison sentence for burglary. However, his wife said that although he was 'no angel' he would not have been behind the suspected kidnapping. Questioned: Luisa Rodrigues said she could not remember the night of Madeleine's disappearance - but was sure he would have been at home watching television at the time . Missing: Madeleine McCann who vanished from her holiday resort in Praia da Luz in 2007 while her parents were having dinner . Scene: Madeleine went missing from the Ocean Club (pictured) as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant . The former drug addict, from Cape Verde in West Africa, was first named as a suspect last November. The development comes after reports that police are closing in on three 'prime suspects' believed to have been involved in the toddler's disappearance. Analysis of mobile phone data suggested a burglary gang was operating very near to where she vanished in Portugal in May 2007.

"By . Freya Noble . and Aap . Michael Cinatar, 20, pleaded guilty to a firearm offence after he shot a rifle at a friend in a dare gone wrong . A man who injured his friend after asking the victim's teenage son 'Do you want to see your dad being shot?' has pleaded guilty to a firearm offence. Michael Ciantar, 20, pleaded guilty in the Adelaide magistrates court on Wednesday to discharging a firearm to injure, annoy or frighten. Ciantar was arrested after a 41-year-old man arrived at hospital with a gunshot wound to his arm. The incident occurred in the north Adelaide suburb of Brahma Lodge on February 27. Prosecutors withdrew a more serious charge of aggravated causing serious harm to another. Police previously said the man had stood against a wall and allowed himself to be shot with an air rifle. The victim initially reported he had been injured in a drive-by shooting but later admitted it was the result of a dare. Before he fired the rifle, Ciantar had asked the victim's teenage son whether he wanted to see his father shot. He will face a sentence hearing on July 4.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It may be the NFL's loudest stadium, but when Derrick Coleman lines up to play in the NFC Championship game at CenturyLink Field on Sunday, he will only feel a distant rumble. That is because the Seahawks running back is the first legally deaf player in the NFL - and he has overcome bullies, doubts and being overlooked in the draft to get there. The 23-year-old from Los Angeles said people putting him down because of his disability has only made him more determined to reach his goal. 'When people say, ""Oh you can't do this"", it's more motivation for me,' he told ABC News. '[I say] ""Okay, watch me"".' Determined: The Seahawks' Derrick Coleman, 23, is the first legally deaf player ever to play for the NFL . Coleman lost his hearing when he was just three years old, due to a genetic and incurable hearing impairment. In a commercial he recently filmed for Duracell batteries, he explained that he had grown up with people telling him he would be unable to achieve his dream of playing football. 'They told me it couldn't be done, that I . was a lost cause,' he says in the commercial, which became an internet sensation after its release. 'I was picked on and picked last. Coaches didn't . know how to talk to me. They gave up on me, told me I should just quit... But I've been deaf since I . was three so I didn't listen.' Tough years: Coleman lost his hearing when he was three, due to a genetic hearing impairment, and went on to suffer bullying, he said. People told him he would not be able to make it as a football player . Winner: But he was a star football player at high school, pictured, and went on to play for UCLA . Coleman continued to play football through high school before playing for UCLA. He was not picked in the draft when he graduated - but has since proven to the NFL that he is a star player. After signing up as a Free Agent with the Minnesota Vikings in May 2012, he was taken on by the Seattle Seahawks in December 2012 and made the 2013 season cut. He has learned to be creative on the field in the face of his struggles. When his hearing aids didn't fit properly inside of his helmet, his mother used a pair of her pantyhose so they would stay put, and to cut down on the feedback, ABC reported. And he taught himself how to lip read so that he can understand last-minute plays from quarterback Russell Wilson, who turns around to mouth the words in his direction. Moving: He recently appeared in a powerful commercial for Duracell that detailed his fight to the top . 'I can rely on reading lips,' he said. 'That's the . advantage that most people don't have. They don'’t know how to read lips — . like when the hearing goes out what do you do? They kind of freak out.' He scored his first NFL touchdown on December 2, 2013 - to a roar from the crowd. 'I can hear [the fans],' he said. 'I can definitely hear them. It don't hurt my ears as much as everyone else's but I know it's loud.' He appeared in 12 games this season, mostly as a blocker and special teamer, and he will appear on the field on Sunday when the Seahawks battle the San Francisco 49ers. 'He does his job impeccably well in all areas and everything that we ask of him,' Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. Impressive: Coleman will play with the Seahawks against the 49ers Sunday in the NFC championship game . Tactics: Quarterback Russell Wilson (#3) leans towards Coleman so he can read his lips during a game . Strong: He said that he reads teammates' lips to understand plays while on the field . 'He’s a terrific effort guy. He’s . been a fantastic part of the team and it’s been a really cool story. Not . because he has issues, because he’s made this team and he’s made a spot . for himself and he’s claimed it. The fact that he has a hearing issue . is really not even something that we deal with.' Coleman added the one thing he happily will not listen to is people judging him for being deaf. 'That's who I am,' he said. 'It made me who I am today.' See below for video .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . When you search Google or use Amazon, you might assume the results you see are the same as those viewed by your friends, family and other internet users. But you’d be wrong. Websites and social networks track your location and search history and make assumptions about your age, race, gender and political views to create a profile of who they think you are. They then show adverts they believe to be the most relevant, in order to maximise clicks, and personalise which results you see by filtering out what they think is irrelevant. This is sold to the public as positive - making each . web session relevant and interesting - yet is leading researchers to . fear the so-called ‘filter bubble’ could widen divides between the North . and South, rich and poor, and young and old. Websites track users to create a personal profile of who they think they are. Princeton University has created bots with fake ages and genders, virtually based in various locations, to map the extent at which this personalisation effects how people move around the web. An example map is pictured . For example, in terms of wealth, if users are . only ever shown particular products and job advertisements  based on how much they earn or where the live, these users will . never be given the opportunities to increase how their wealth, or how much they spend on items. To assess the extent to which personalisation is having an effect on our society, Princeton University has created bots, each with their own fake profiles. These bots have different fake ages and genders, each of them earn a different level of money, are virtually based in various locations around the world and have different interests. By using these bots to scan and search the web, the researchers hope to create a picture of not only what each of them sees, but also what sites they are missing out on. The filter bubble is when a website . guesses what information a particular user wants to see. It uses . information it knows, from a person’s search history and location, and . attempts to guess what it doesn’t. It makes assumptions about a person’s . wealth, based on where they live and work, for example, or looks at . their credit score. It guesses a person’s age by comparing what they’ve . searched for with what people of the same age are searching for. Some algorithms can also scan personal . social network profiles, for example, to fill in the knowledge gaps. Political . views and opinions can then be garnered from various sources. This tracking is all done using cookies installed on websites and browsers. For example, if two different people . search for the word ‘apple’ they could get different results. If their age and search history suggests they like tech and gadgets, a . search for ‘apple’ will show results for Apple iPhones, iPads and . Apple-related news stories (pictured left). If the person searching regularly checks in at the . gym, or is a keen baker, or does grocery shopping online, the algorithm . might decide they are instead looking for the fruit (pictured right). This means they push Apple . products down the list and in some cases the irrelevant results aren’t shown at all. When it comes to wealth, if users are . only ever shown particular products, job adverts and so on, they will . never increase how much money they earn or how much they spend on items; widening the . rich and poor divide. In terms of politics, if a user has . previously searched for details about a particular political party or . policy, or live in a Labour stronghold as an example, when they search . for news they may be shown more left-leaning publications or links. This means alternative policies are . hidden, meaning their beliefs are constantly reaffirmed and they only . deal with like-minded sites and people. Researchers fear this can . prevent change as well as widen the gaps between political groups and . lead to a state of isolation. According to lead researcher, Arvind Narayanan: ‘Our goal is a web privacy census which will be a comprehensive map of which entities are collecting what information, what they are inferring from it, and who they are sharing it with. It is an important step in our ultimate goal of figuring out how users are treated based on that information.’ Personalisation also has its benefits. Shopping sites such as Amazon, for example, can scan a user's search and . purchase history to offer suggestions. This can help find similar, . cheaper items or items that are more suited to their needs at a glance, . without having to perform additional searches. It's also possible to disable personalised adverts and results. Google's search engine lets you switch off personalisation, for example. While all web users can enable the Do Not . Track features built into the major browsers. Researchers from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona and Yahoo Labs felt the issue was so potentially damaging, they have also created a way to ‘burst the filter bubble.’ Personalisation does have its benefits. Shopping sites such as Amazon, for example, can scan a user's search and purchase history to offer suggestions. This can help find similar, cheaper items or items that are more suited to their needs at a glance, without having to perform additional searches . They believe that just because people have opposing views on certain topics, doesn't mean they won't share interests in others. To this end, they created a recommendation engine that makes filter bubble-style assumptions to create a profile, but then widens the results to show opposing views that a user may also be interested in. Google lets users switch off personalisation. Users can also enable the Do Not Track features built into all of the major browsers including Firefox, pictured . 'We nudge users to read content from people who may have opposite views, or high view gaps, in those issues, while still being relevant according to their preferences,” Graells-Garrido told MIT Technology Review. The team scanned thousands of tweets to establish a wordcloud.They looked at people who tweeted about a certain topic and then looked at what other interests they had tweeted about previously. Graells-Carrido was then able to create a list of interests for each topic along the lines of ‘if you like that, you’ve love this.’ When a user searched for a particular topic, the recommendation engine would not only show similar links, it would also show interests that may overlap, but may not share the same view. Their results discovered that people can be more open to ideas that are different from their own and people who are opinionated, appreciate the opinions of others more.","Sites such as Google, Amazon and Facebook personalise what users see .

"By . Darren Boyle . A care home worker was jailed and two of his colleagues received non-custodial sentences after they admitted ill-treating a 79-year-old dementia sufferer. Bristol Crown Court was shown video showing a distressed Gladys Wright being pushed, shoved and pulled on a number of occasions, while subjecting her to a tirade of verbal abuse. Daniel Baynes, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a 'nasty aggressive bitch' and telling each other to 'f*** her', throughout the recordings. Scroll down for video . Mrs Wright is clearly distressed as a member of staff pins the frail 79-year-old pensioner to her bed . A staff member tries to open Mrs Wright's eyes with his fingers in an early morning wake-up call . Bristol Crown Court was shown video showing a distressed Gladys Wright being pushed, shoved and pulled on a number of occasions . On one . occasion Baynes, 24, attempts to force Mrs Wright’s eyes open, while on . another pushes the clearly distressed pensioner onto the bed, while . attempting to change her, before applying his weight on her legs to hold . her down. Salnikow, . 25, while changing Mrs Wright for bed, is shown to hold the nape of her . neck before forcing her backwards into her chair by grabbing her chin. Incredibly the appalling treatment only came to light after Mrs Wright’s son, James, placed a hidden camera in the room. A video grab of footage from a secret camera that was put in Gladys Wright's room . Mrs Wright's son set up a video in her mother's room and caught staff abusing the 79-year-old . He . set the device up to reassure himself the treatment his mother was . receiving in the specialist Granary Care Home, in Wraxall, North . Somerset, was unlike the horror stories he had read about. He was so disturbed by what he saw he immediately took the footage to police. The . men, who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence . came to light, pleaded guilty to the abuse, which took place in October . and December 2012. Baynes, . of Bath, was handed four months behind bars after admitting three . counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity, and . another of theft after he was caught stealing Mrs Wright’s food. Salnikow, . of Southmead, Bristol, who practised yoga while in the dock, was given . two months in prison, suspended for two years after admitting three . counts of ill-treatment. Gladys Wright, pictured at her home in Bristol around 1990, was subjected to ill-treatment  in the weeks after  she moved into the Granary care home in north Somerset to due to her worsening dementia . Daniel Baynes, was today  jailed for four months by Bristol Crown Court after admitting three ill-treating Mrs Wright and stealing her food, left. Baynes, right, earlier told Police that  he was 'absolutely disgusted' by himself . Gidaszewski, of Nailsea, north Somerset, was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work for admitting one count of the same. Sentencing . them at Bristol Crown Court, Judge Michael Longman said: 'You were . employed as carers. This was in breach of a most basic duty of care and . humanity which you had all undertaken to perform. 'Nothing . about her behaviour or the environment in which you worked excuses your . behaviour against a very vulnerable patient in your care.' Despite the sentences however Mr Wright believes nothing will change until 24 hour CCTV is placed in all homes. Speaking afterwards he said: 'I wish I recorded nothing but good behaviour. That would have been the best outcome. 'I had no reason to believe there would be problems, because she wouldn’t have gone there in the first place. 'I . believe we’ll be seeing many more instances of the abuse of vulnerable . individuals and know this will not improve until we see the . implementation of CCTV in these homes.' The court . heard Mrs Wright was first admitted to the home in September 2012 after . her family were no longer able to provide her with the care she needed . for her severe advanced dementia. The Granary Care Home, a specialist dementia centre, is owned and run by Shaw Healthcare, and has room for up to 60 sufferers. Kerry . Barker, prosecuting, said: 'After about three weeks Mrs Wright’s son . placed a covert camera in her room at the care home in order to assure . himself that his mother was receiving appropriate care. 'The covert footage shows that on particular occasions they ill-treated Mrs Wright. James Wright installed the secret camera in his mother's room at the Granary care home in Wraxall, North Somerset. When he discovered the abuse he handed 57 DVDs to police who launched a criminal investigation . Janusz Salnikow, left received a two-month prison sentence suspended for two years while Tomaz Gidaszewski right was sentenced to 180 hours unpaid work after they admitted ill-treating the pensioner . Watching the footage was a difficult and upsetting experience for Mr Wright. 'Watching his mother being ill-treated by people who were supposed to be caring for her remains a distressing memory.' Mr Wright was so appalled by what he saw he immediately confronted the home, who told him it was against Mrs Wright’s 'dignity' to put the cameras in her room. He then handed the 57 DVDs to police, in January 2013, which lead to the arrest of the three men. Mr Barker added: 'The police investigation revealed that care workers in the home had been recruited without any previous experience. Janusz Slanikow had been recruited by the company in his native Poland. 'Wages were low and there were often staff shortages.' A Care Quality Commission inspection, carried out during the criminal investigation, also found there were concerns about the quality of care and support given at the Granary home. Gladys Wright, pictured with her partner Ken Jones left was admitted to the Granary in September 2012 after her dementia worsened . In interview Baynes said his behaviour 'was not acceptable and embarrassing to watch', before adding he was 'absolutely disgusted' with himself. Martin Bloor, defending him said: 'He is under no illusions how serious these matters are and he wishes to express his apologies to the victim and her family.' Salnikow told officers on occasions there would be only three carers and a nurse to 30 residents and said he was 'not proud' of what he had been shown. Virginia Cornwall said he had acted out of 'frustration'. Stephen Mooney, for Gidaszewski, said his client was 'mortified by what he had done'. Jeremy Nixey, chief executive officer of Shaw Healthcare, said: 'We operate a zero-tolerance policy towards any unkind or disrespectful behaviour to anyone in our care and that is why, when we were first advised by a relative of incidents of poor care towards their family member, we immediately referred the matter to the Police and North Somerset Council. 'All three individuals involved in this case have not worked at The Granary since we were made aware of the incidents. 'We understand that this must have been a difficult time for the family, which we are extremely sorry for. 'We hope that today will bring some closure for them and we are pleased that these individuals have been brought to justice today. 'As the judge pointed out, the actions of these three individuals were not typical of care at The Granary. 'Since these incidents came to our attention, a new area and home manager have been appointed to oversee the implementation of an action plan looking at every aspect of the service provided at The Granary.'","Gladys Wright was a resident at the Granary care home in Somerset .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A businessman has been told to re-label his healthy ice cream because it does not contain enough fat. Trading standards inspectors told Tim Coffey that he cannot describe his product as ice cream because its fat content is only 4.8 per cent. Food labelling regulations state that the food must have a fat content of five per cent or higher to . qualify as ice cream. Rename: Trading standards inspectors told Tim Coffey, 40, that he cannot describe his product as ice cream because its fat content is only 4.8 per cent . Mr Coffey, 40, makes his products with local milk and cream, selling the dessert at his Real Italian Ice Cream Co stores in Bath, Somerset. The traditional Italian gelato-style technique he employs results in a higher milk to cream ratio than British processes. The businessman, who runs two shops in Bath with wife Francessca Addabbo, 41, said he was shocked by the ruling after a trading standards inspection last week. He said: 'It was just a normal visit making sure all weights and measures were correct and everything is fine. Healthy: Tim Coffey, with his wife Francesca Addabbo, uses a traditional Italian gelato-style technique that results in a higher milk to cream ratio than British processes . 'Then we had an email two days later saying the ice cream should no longer be referred to as ice cream and we need to rename it on all our price lists. 'This is basically all because it is healthy. It looks like ice cream, it tastes like ice cream, it is ice cream but we can't call it ice cream because of 0.2 per cent fat difference. Mr Coffey said that ice cream-makers should be encouraged to reduce the fat content of their product. He said: 'Ice cream is a product that is popular with children, you want to make the fat content lower not higher.' The couple, who have been making ice cream since 2005, are now considering whether to rename their ice cream as gelato or change the recipe to increase its fat content. A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset Council confirmed Mr Coffey had been asked to relabel his product. He said: 'Mr Coffey was advised that gelato made in the traditional manner does not have the required fat content to meet the compositional standard for ice cream. 'The council, in its drive to promote healthier lifestyles, is supportive of local businesses such as the Real Italian Ice Cream Company, offering Italian-style gelatos which contain less fat than traditional ice cream.' He said Mr Coffey had not been told to change the name of the shop or company, but to describe the product on price boards as 'gelato'. Gelato has a greater proportion of whole milk to cream so naturally has a lower fat percentage than British ice creams. It is also churned at a slower speed, which makes it denser as less air is whipped into the mixture. Ice cream is frozen but gelato is typically served at a slightly warmer temperature.","Tim Coffey, 40, told to re-label product as 'gelato' due to low fat content .

"By . Emma Innes . A 57-year-old Italian woman who visited her doctor complaining of facial pain was found to have a dental implant in her left sinus. Two years earlier, she'd had the dental implant – a 2cm long metal screw which is used to hold a false tooth in place - inserted into her upper jaw. But a CT scan revealed it had migrated to her sinuses. A 57-year-old woman who visited her doctor with recurrent inflammation of the sinuses and facial pain was found to have a dental implant in her left sinus (pictured) At the time, there were no complications but when the woman’s sinus problems were investigated, the implant was found to be missing from her jaw. Doctors also discovered that her gum had healed over and there was no sign of the implant. It was eventually tracked down in her sinus – a cavity beside the eye - and removed during surgery. Following the surgery, the 57-year-old patient found that her symptoms improved rapidly. She attended a check-up eight months later and still had no symptoms. Further tests also showed that her sinus had returned to normal and no lasting damage had been done. Surgeons used a camera to track down the screw in her sinus (pictured) and then removed it. Once it has been removed, her symptoms rapidly disappeared . It is thought the problem may have occurred as a result of the implant being improperly positioned in her jaw. Study researcher Alberto Schreiber, of the University of Brescia in Italy, told LiveScience that he believes the implant was probably in the woman's sinus for at least a year, and perhaps even since the surgery two years earlier. He added that other cases of dental implants ending up in the sinus have been reported. The 2cm metal implant (pictured) was implanted into the woman's upper jaw two years before it was found in her sinus. These implants are usually used to stabilise a bridge or false tooth . Luke Cascarini, a consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at The London Clinic, told MailOnline: ‘When the implant is inserted, if it doesn’t fully integrate, it can migrate either to the surface or to a sinus as it is treated as a foreign body. ‘If it doesn’t fully integrate then the body sees it as a foreign object and dispels it. Usually it would dispel it into the mouth.’ He went on to explain that the implant would only have been able to migrate if it was not attached to a bridge or false tooth and that this is rare. The case was reported in The New England Journal of Medicine.","The woman, 57, went to a doctor in Italy with pain and sinus inflammation .

"By . Shari Miller . A drastic change in weather caused by a slow down in the Gulf Stream - as predicted in the box office hit, The Day After Tomorrow - could be more science fact than fiction, according to a new report. While temperatures were recently set plunging across the US thanks to a polar vortex, the UK could be headed for warmer, drier weather in time for the summer, say scientists from Reading University. They claim there has been a definite 10 to 15 per cent slowdown in the Gulf Stream, which brings a constant flow of warm water and mild weather to northern Europe - and the change could result in 'big impacts' on the weather system for years to come. Here comes the sun: Britain's short heatwaves could be a thing of the past, with predictions the UK will experience warmer, drier summers . This exact scenario appears in the 2004 sci-fi blockbuster starring Jake Gyllenhall and Dennis Quaid, in which a shutdown of the North Atlantic currents plays havoc with the weather and sends temperatures plunging to a chilly minus 150C. Previous scientific reports have also suggested a slowdown in the Gulf Stream would result in chillier temperatures around Europe and rising temperatures elsewhere. But the latest findings from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science suggest Britain will actually experience drier summers, with a possibility of drought in Europe and Africa as temperatures rise. There may also be fewer Atlantic hurricanes, as the strength of the Gulf Stream declines. Lead author Dr Jon Robson, told The Sun on Sunday: 'In Britain we could see a return to drier summers, although it could also lead to more droughts in parts of Europe and Africa. 'However, there's quite a bit of uncertainty about how fast changes might happen.' The prediction of drier summers is in direct contrast to Britain's current wet winter, which has caused widespread flooding for thousands across England and Wales. Science-fact: The extreme weather conditions predicted in blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow, could be at least partly true, according to the new report . Slow down: The Gulf Stream pictured in red, is declining in strength, according to a new report . There is however no need to pack away umbrellas just yet. Research director Professor Rowan Sutton added the report is not a prediction for this summer or any other year, but is instead suggestive of a 'trend towards drier summers across the UK.'

"By . Harriet Cooke . A drawing by Italian artist Raphael has fetched a record £29 million at auction - more than twice the original estimate. The black chalk piece, called Head Of A Young Apostle, became the most expensive work on paper after it sold for almost three times its estimated price at auction, auction house Sotheby’s said. It had been part of a collection at the Duke of Devonshire’s Chatsworth House stately home in Derbyshire since the 1700s. Scroll down for video . Record-breaking: The Raphael drawing, called Head of a Young Apostle, which sold for a record £29.7 million at auction. Renowned: Head Of A Young Apostle was a preparatory work for one of Raphael's best known pieces, Transfiguration . Originally believed to be worth £10 to £15 million, the artwork sold for £29.7 million after an intense battle between four bidders lasting 17 minutes. After the winning bid came in over the telephone, Sotheby’s London auction room erupted in a round of applause. Gregory Rubinstein, worldwide head of Old Master drawings at Sotheby’s, said: 'If you are lucky, at some point in your career a work like this comes along. 'A number of the world’s greatest collectors stepped up tonight in recognition of the genius of Raphael and the extraordinary beauty of this drawing with its exceptional provenance.' The work, known as an auxiliary cartoon and dated to around 1519 to 1520, was a preparation drawing for a figure in Raphael’s Transfiguration. The final price of £29.7 million includes Sotheby’s commission, known as buyer’s premium. Prestigious: The drawing had been part of a collection at the Duke of . Devonshire's Chatsworth House . When Raphael died, his body was laid out in state in his studio with the Transfiguration hanging at his head. It is now in the Vatican Museum. According to Sotheby's, Head of a . Young Apostle is one of just three Raphael drawings of this calibre to . have have appeared at auction in the last 50 years – each of which set . an all-time record for an 'Old Master Drawing' when they were sold. Cristiana Romalli, senior director in . the Department of Old Master Drawings at Sotheby’s, said: 'This very . moving study is a paramount example of Raphael’s draughtsmanship - and . shows exactly why he is revered as very possibly the greatest master of . drawing who has ever lived. T . 'The sheer beauty of this work is . utterly breath-taking - and the way in which it allows us to join . Raphael as he created his last great masterpiece is hugely exciting.' The auction sold off work by the 'Old Masters' -  European painters of skill who worked before about 1800 - and British paintings. Other sales included Jan Havicksz. Steen’s The Prayer Before the Meal, from the collection at Sudeley Castle, which sold for a £5,641,250, and four extremely rare 14th-century paintings by the Florentine artist Niccolò di Pietro Gerini, depicting Scenes from the Passion of Christ, which sold for £1,105,250. Alex Bell, co-chairman of Sotheby's . Old Master Paintings Worldwide, said yesterday: 'Tonight’s sale was a great way to . end what has been a fantastic year for Sotheby’s - from the . record-breaking sale of The Scream, to tonight’s landmark sale of the . exceptional Raphael drawing from the Devonshire Collection. 'While that of course was the . undoubted highlight of the evening, the rest of the sale also . demonstrated depth and strength in this market which has benefitted in . recent years from . an influx of buyers from new geographic areas, and collectors who have previously been active in other fields.' Raphael is widely regarded as the world's supreme painter, and for most of the last 450 years has also been the world's most expensive. In 1494, Raphael took over his dead father's painting workshop in Urbino, Italy, with rapid success. As a teen, he was commissioned to paint for the Church of San Nicola in the neighboring town of Castello. In 1500, he became apprentice to master painter Pietro Vannunci, otherwise known as Perugino, in the Umbria region of central Italy. The apprenticeship lasted four years and Raphael developed his own unique style, producing works such as The Three Graces, The Knight’s Dream and the Marriage of the Virgin. He then left his apprenticeship with Perugino and moved to Florence, where he was influenced by the works of the Italian painters Fra Bartolommeo, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Masaccio. In 1508, he moved to Rome and began painting in the Vatican under Pope Julius II’s patronage - commencing the most prolific and well-known era in his career.

In it, he recalls meeting the future Titanic star and 'king of the world.' Gene Salomon, pictured, has been a New York cabbie since 1977 . Salomon told the Post that in 1996, DiCaprio hopped into his cab, asking 'Don't you know who I am?' When Salomon said he didn't, he says DiCaprio rattled off a string of films he starred in -- and the two hit it off as he drove the young star to a nightclub. Salomon has fond memories of the star, and says he asked 'Who was the biggest celebrity tipper you ever had in your cab?' Salomon allegedly told him John McEnroe gave him double the meter price -- and was shocked to see DiCaprio one-up him. 'Well,' DiCaprio reportedly said. 'I'm gonna give you triple the meter!' Salomon told the paper he's had 114 celebrity clients over the years -- including Lauren Bacall, Sean Penn, Dennis Hopper. He was even lucky enough to have two cab rides with Paul Simon. Salomon reportedly told the singer 'I want you to buy the Yankees.' 'Me? You want me to buy the Yankees?' Simon said, the paper reports. 'I don't have that kind of money. You should talk to McCartney.' Salomon says he's encountered 114 big-name clients during his 36 years on the job, including Leonardo DiCaprio . Salomon also recalls many other stories -- including couples attempting to have sex in the back of his cab. 'With me, I do find it offensive, but my level of resentment seems to depend on the way the passenger goes about it [...] I do get annoyed if they’re pretending I’m not even there,' he told the Post. Salomon says one couple leaving the Bowery Hotel attempted to have sex in his cab -- only to be spotted by a female police officer. Though the couple initially ignored her warnings, they eventually stopped when she yelled, 'Hey, you, lady in the taxi -- get off that guy right now!' Salomon told the Post. Salomon also told the paper he's even had a run-in with the mob during the height of the Pizza Connection trial -- when two men speaking Italian and English hopped into his car, asking to be driven to the airport. He says the two men were very eager to hear the radio, describing the trial. 'It was then I realized where I had picked them up — Foley Square, the very place where all the courthouses were located,' Salomon told the Post. 'And they had gotten into my cab at 4 p.m., the time of day when a trial would be recessing. And they had told me that they make this trip to Chicago every Friday. They were going back home for the weekend until the trial picked up again the following Monday!' 'I knew at this moment as well as I could ever know that these guys sitting five feet behind me were card-carrying members of the mob,' he continued. Salomon said that though the men only gave him a 10 percent tip, he wasn't going to fight it. 'What could I say besides, “Have a good flight""?' Salomon also says he's seen many couples have sex in the backseat of his car...to the dismay of law enforcement .","Gene Salomon says DiCaprio tipped him three times the meter price in 1996 on the way to a nightclub .

A source previously told this week's People magazine: 'They're taking a break.' Neither of them are making moves towards a divorce or legal separation at this stage, the publication claims. 'Separated': This week's People magazine claims they are taking a break from one another . The couple, who married in 2000, haven't been seen publicly together since 22 April, when they cuddled up on the red carpet at the 40th Annual Chaplin Award Gala at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City. They are said to have decided to spend some time alone after Michael returned from this year's Cannes Film Festival in France. Rumours then started to swirl over a possible split when Michael seen playing a game of golf on his own in Italy last week. Cutting a lonely figure, it was a different picture entirely from just last year when the actor smiled alongside his Welsh-born wife at the annual Michael Douglas & Friends Celebrity Golf Tournament, which took place between 25 and 27 May. It was recently reported by Star . Magazine that Catherine was set to begin a '$300m divorce battle' against Michael, to end their marriage. While . a representative for Michael, 68, and Catherine, 43, denied that they . have separated, the married couple have been spending time apart . recently.

'Michael's doing a movie on the East Coast with Diane Keaton, so he's working,' Catherine told ET Online recently, adding: 'My children are actually at sleep-away camp, so I'm missing them desperately.' Meanwhile, a source close to the couple have told British magazine Grazia that divorce would be 'the final straw'. They said: 'It would be too damaging for the children and a strain on both of them emotionally and health wise.' Keen hobby: Michael and Catherine taking part in the Ninth Annual Michael Douglas and Friends Celebrity Golf Event at the Trump National Golf Club in 2007 . In February it was claimed by The Enquirer that the pair were to separate in a 'hush hush' divorce, however the pair denied the claims. The . Enquirer alleged that the marriage 'buckled under the pressure of . dealing with Michael's cancer battle, his son Cameron's incarceration on . drugs charges and Catherine's struggle with bipolar II disorder.' A source has now added to People: 'The stress has taken a toll on their marriage.' A representative has been contacted by the MailOnline to ask about the new reports of a separation. On Friday, Michael is expected to attend the Deauville Film Festival in France; poignantly, it is where he first met Catherine in 1998 and famously introduced himself by saying: 'I want to father your children.' Michael, the son of screen veteran Krik Douglas, was attracted to Catherine after seeing her in the 1998 film The Mask Of Zoro. Solo appearance: Catherine, seen here minus Michael at the Los Angeles premiere of her film Red 2 in July . They were to marry two years later in a lavish ceremony at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which was attended by the likes of Jack Nicholson and Martha Stewart. Catherine was first treated for bioplar II disorder in 2011. Earlier this year in April she underwent another stint in rehab in her continued effort to manage the illness. Michael, meanwhile, revealed he was suffering from stage IV throat cancer in August 2010 - he underwent treatment and in January the following year publicly declared the tumour had gone. At the time, he attributed the illness to stress, his previous alcohol abuse and years of heavy smoking. But in June this year he made comments saying the HPV virus - which is contracted through oral sex - could have been the cause of his cancer. Family portrait: Cather and Michael in February 2011 at Buckingham Palace in London with their two children Dylan and Carys . Douglas backtracked on his remarks, but Catherine was humiliated because he didn't clarify he was exposed to the virus before meeting her, according to People magazine. Michael recently spoke about his divorce to first wife Diandra, a 23-year marriage he admits he should have ended earlier. He said: 'I know I’m going to get into trouble here. I have nothing against her and in fact I’m very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier. 'It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counselor to resolve problems, it’s in his interest to keep the marriage going. Because if I end the marriage he’s got no business.' Diandra won a reported $45 million in the divorce settlement, and in 2011, she unsuccessfully tried to sue Michael for half of his earnings from the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.

"By . Ashley Collman . The father of a South Carolina woman who went missing last month, wrote an emotional confessional about the experience of her sudden loss - sharing the last image she sent him the night before she disappeared. Heather Elvis, 20, was last seen after being dropped off from a first date at her condo in Horry County in the early morning of December 18. The next night, a police officer showed up at father Elvis family home, informing Heather's father Terry that her car had been found abandoned at a nearby boat landing. The last photo: Heather Elvis, 20, sent this picture of herself learning to drive a stick-shift while on a first-date to her father Terry the night before she disappeared last month . Tireless: Father Terry Elvis prints missing person posters for his daughter . The last time Mr Elvis had heard from his cosmetology-student daughter was the night of December 17, when she texted him a picture of her driving during her date. Mr Elvis explained in an essay on xoJane that he has a manual transmission truck he had been saving to give to one of his daughters, but that neither of them had ever learned how to drive a stick shift. At the end of her date, the man she was meeting offered to teach her how to drive his manual truck  in a mall parking lot and she excitingly sent the picture of her driving to her father to share the accomplishment. The search continues: There is a $25,000 reward for Heather's return. A candlelight vigil will be held for her on Thursday . 'It is the last communication I have had with my daughter, the last picture I have of her on my phone,' Mr Elvis said. 'I didn't talk to Heather about it, but she had a good time,' Mr Elvis added about the date. 'I didn't think much of it.' Heather's disappearance remains a mystery, but Mr Elvis believes 'someone who she knew and trusted may have betrayed her'. Mr Elvis never met the man who took his daughter out on a first date, but he has since been ruled out as a suspect after being questioned by police and passing a lie-detector test. His favorite picture: Mr Elvis said this was his favorite picture of Heather, holding the family dog in their kitchen . Heartbroken: The family put Christmas on hold following Heather's mid-December disappearance, but remain optimistic they will find her . He said Heather's car was parked in the condo's driveway when he dropped her off around 2 or 2:30 am on the morning of December 18. Since then, Mr Elvis has worked tirelessly in the police investigation and search for his daughter. According to the Find Heather Elvis Facebook page, there is a $25,000 reward for Heather's return, $10,000 of which is coming from Mr Elvis and his family. Earlier in January, police thought they had made a break in the case when they found a set of skeletal remains while searching for Heather - but the bones ended up belonging to a male and had been in the earth for at least 20 years. Mystery: Police have since ruled out Heather's date as a suspect after he passed a lie-detector test. He says he saw Heather's car parked in her driveway when he dropped her off around 2 or 2:30 on December 18 . A prayer vigil will be held for Heather this Thursday as Horry County locals continue to volunteer their time to search for Heather. In his essay, Mr Elvis writes that Heather's disappearance has taught him not to take his loved ones for granted since you never know when you might lose them. 'Hold your loved ones close, tell them how much you love them every day. Never let them doubt how much love you have for them so that if you are ever in the position I am in, you will be able to look in the mirror with less regret,' Mr Elvis advised. Still, Heather's father remains optimistic that he will eventually find Heather. 'It has been 30 days of hell. But I am praying for a miracle. And I refuse to give up hope,' he wrote. 'We will find my daughter. Will will find Heather Elvis.'","Police are still looking for 20-year-old Heather Elvis who went missing following a first date on December 18 .

"Manchester City have no intention of selling striker Alvaro Negredo. Sportsmail understands the Spaniard is not for sale despite increasing speculation linking him with Atletico Madrid. The club has not received a bid from or had any contact with the Spanish champions over a potential £20million move, as has been reported. Wanted man: Manchester City intend to keep striker Alvaro Negredo at the Etihad next season . Inconsistent: Negredo scored 23 goals last season but he did not net after January . Such overtures would not be welcomed and, in any case, City now have a higher valuation of the 28-year-old than the reported figure, which equals the amount they paid Sevilla for him last summer. Negredo made an immediate impact at the Etihad Stadium last season and he finished the campaign with 23 goals in all competitions. The last of those strikes, however, came in January as the player lost form in the second half of the season after suffering a shoulder injury. That slump cost him a place in the Spain squad for the World Cup in Brazil. Now it has been claimed that he is unsettled and is being lined up as a potential replacement at Atletico for Diego Costa, who is expected to join Chelsea. Negredo does hail from the Spanish capital and began his career with Real Madrid. But City want to retain his services among a striking quartet that also includes Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. Interest: Atletico Madrid are believed to want to sign Negredo but City value him at more than £20m . Keen: City manager Manuel Pellegrini is keen on keeping the Spain striker at the Etihad next season .","City do not want to sell the 28-year-old striker despite interest .

"By . Ryan Gorman . It has been revealed that ESPN seriously considered banning use of the controversial Redskins nickname from reporting. ESPN ombudsman Robert Lipsyte wrote in a column published Friday that the network considered no longer using the nickname of the Washington NFL Franchise. The consideration came as calls mount for team owner Dan Snyder to rename the team – redskin is a derogatory term used to degrade Native Americans. Their biggest fan: Washington Redskins unofficial mascot 'Chief Zee' was inducted to the NFL Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of an exhibit on each team's biggest fan . The internal debate was revealed in a column focusing on Miami Herald baseball writer Dan Le Batard giving his Baseball Hall of Fame vote to Deadspin. Le Batard also hosts a radio show on ESPN Radio and is a frequent on-air guest for the network. The disclosure came when Mr Lipsyte said it is against ESPN policy for its reporters to be ‘in the position of making news as well as covering it’ when discussing his reservations against baseball writers voting on hall of fame inductees. ‘That is against ESPN policy (and recently was one of the in-house arguments against banning use of the nickname of the NFL Washington franchise),’ he divulged. ESPN considered no longer referring to the team by its official nickname as dozens of media outlets and reporters across the country have decided to refer to the franchise as a myriad of things other than Redskins. A recent Pew study showed that at least 76 publications, networks and journalists have publicly opposed the offensive team name. Offensive to some : Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III is shown during the 2013 season wearing a helmet with a red-skinned Native American on the helmet . The term has long-been a thorn in the side of Native Americans around the country, but it once again became an issue last year after Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray told a group of reporters in January that he would change the name. The movement gathered momentum in the following few months as various Native American groups argued to the government the trademark should be revoked and almost a dozen members of Congress publicly lobbied Mr Snyder to change the name. ‘We’ll never change the name of the team,’ the defiant owner told USA Today in May, ‘it’s that simple.’ A wave of media organizations and columnists including multiple D.C. outlets, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Oregonian (since 1992), Sports Illustrated’s Peter King, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and others have all vowed to no longer use the name. Racist: Native Americans are incensed by the team's use of a name and logo they say is offensive . The Washington Post publicly blasted Mr Snyder for not changing the name, and President Barack Obama also said he would change the name if it were his call. Several prominent broadcasters including NBC’s Bob Costas and Chris Collinsworth as well as ESPN’s Keith Olbermann and Tony Kornheiser have called for the name to be changed. Mr Costas notably made his plea during halftime of a national televised game between the Washington football franchise and the Dallas Cowboys. It’s worth noting that 66 per cent of D.C. area residents feel the team should keep its name, according to Pew.","ESPN considered banning the team's name from reporting but decided against the idea .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . One Texas health clinic is accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. At Rapid med Urgent Care Center at Highland Village in North Texas, patients can pay using Bitcon's digital dollars in addition to cash or credit cards. CBS reports that a Bitcoin is a virtual value someone can't hold but that someone can spend and even has its own form of ATMs. Rapid Med Urgent Care Center is at the forefront of businesses accepting the virtual form of payment . More and more businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of currency . The clinic is the first medical center in Denton County to accept a digital Bitcoin as a form of payment. 'Bitcoin is a new money.  Banks are taken away from the formula.  It allows direct transactions between the end user and the person providing the service,' said the clinic's physician's assistant Anton Appelgvitst. Bitcoin demand is on the rise and according to the digital dollar's website, Bitcoin is 'the simplest way to exchange money at a very low cost.' 'It’s easier than a credit card.  It’s cheaper,' explains website developer Austin Heerwaggen.  'You don’t have to worry about the government.  It’s international.' The only challenge for companies accepting Bitcoins is that many people aren't using it as a payment yet. The clinic said that even though they accept the service, no one has used it at their clinic yet. However, companies like the clinic believe that people will start using it soon. Bitcoin has their very own form of ATMs that allows users to withdraw bit coins in the form of dollars or to deposit cash to buy more Bitcoins . A clinic in San Francisco called My Doctor Medical Group also accepts Bitcoin, reports Coindesk.com. Coindesk reports that many medical patients choose Bitcoin because they chose to keep their health visits a secret and want to ensure patient to doctor confidentiality. The website explains that using Bitcoin is safer than using a credit card and makes people less susceptible to identity theft. 'With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost just like with physical money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to protect your privacy,' says the site. Bitcoin is not 100 per cent anonymous and can be linked to a person's identity when they convert Bitcoin to currency. However, for keeping health information between a patient and a doctor, Bitcoin is a useful tool. Even though many people haven't stared using Bitcoin, businesses have started accepting it with the belief that people will use Bitcoin .","Bitcoin is a semi-anonymous digital dollar .

"By . Corey Charlton . Five soldiers and police have been killed in the Somali capital and a dozen others were wounded by mortar and gun attacks by Islamist militants. The Al Qaeda-linked militants responsible for the carnage have threatened to step up attacks during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Al Shabaab fighters said they detonated a car bomb that killed two soldiers guarding the Somali parliament, a few hundred metres from the presidential compound. 'This is our second attack against the parliament building and we shall continue it,' said Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's spokesman for military operations. The remains of the car were left burning immediately following the attack outside the Mogadishu parliament . Two people were killed in the group's second attack on the building and it warned the attacks would continue . Al Qaeda-linked militants in Somalia claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest in a surge during Ramadan . Security officers survey the wreckage of the brutal attack which was only one in a series of killings across the city . Police said soldiers guarding the parliament building had prevented it reaching its target. 'The suicide car bomb was targeting the parliament entrance but it was fired on from all sides as it approached the main gate,' said Nur Ahmed, a colonel in the police service. Police said two soldiers were killed and four wounded. The al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabaab militants killed a lawmaker and his bodyguard in an attack on Thursday, accusing them of collaborating with Christians - a reference to the backing Mogadishu gets from Western powers and the African Union.

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week’s column, Martin talks about Yohan Cabaye, FA Cup tickets and why Nicola Cortese is not a Saint... CABAYE'S DIFFERENT GRAVY . On Saturday I was at West Ham where watched a player called Yohan Cabaye. This man is simply a brilliant football player; finding space, drifting away from defenders and like an NFL quarterback he's always looking for an incisive match-winning pass or shot. I remember Glenn Hoddle saying it's easy to destroy a painting, and anybody can do that, but to be an artist and create beautiful things takes you to another level. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Pardew discuss keeping hold of Yohan Cabaye . Proper player: Martin Allen was very impressed with Yohan Cabaye performance against West Ham . Now Cheick Tiote in central midfield for Newcastle does a great job blocking and spoiling. But Cabaye is an artist. In the first 20 minutes he scored a beauty and then made two exquisite passes to open up the West Ham defence. The passes were perfectly weighted and through the eye of a needle. Breaking up play: Newcastle's Cheick Tiote did a good job at breaking up play . This man most definitely has the ability to play at the very top of the Premier League and I'm sure Newcastle United, all their players, supporters and staff and, most importantly, Alan Pardew will do everything they can to keep him at the club because with him they will win games. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE LEGS . You must have legs in your team if you want to win anything these days. We hear people say his legs have gone. We hear people say he's got no legs.When I watched Newcastle play on Saturday they were full of athletes who are quick and, most importantly, full of legs. Speed kills: Yoan Gouffran and Newcastle are able to attack with pace . They have pace, and power, they are fast, they are strong, and they are quick.When teams have players that cannot and do not have pace they struggle to get behind the opposition where it hurts and everything is played in front, with plenty of foreplay but very rare full penetration. Attacking with pace: Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid are known for their speedy play . I've been out to watch Real Madrid and Barcelona and, similar to Newcastle on Saturday, they can keep possession, they can move the ball around but at the key moments the players have the speed to go through get past and get in behind defences. Without legs, you cannot win games. NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL... Not even Kidderminster getting held to ransom by Sunderland over the distribution of FA Cup tickets. It brings back good memories to read the story that Kidderminster Harriers have got to pay Premier League Sunderland up front for any extra tickets they want for their FA Cup fourth-round tie at the weekend. Kidderminster have to be very cautious that they will sell out all the tickets that they buy from Sunderland and even though they just sold their main forward, Joe Lolley, to Huddersfield, for a handy sum they don't want to be caught short. Cup heroes: The Kidderminster players celebrate after knocking out League One Peterborough in the third round replay . When I was at Brentford a few years ago we drew Southampton for the fifth-round FA Cup tie and they made us pay for 5,000 tickets when it was obvious Brentford could take probably 8,000 or 10,000 for the relatively short trip down the M3 to The Saints. The club dug in and wouldn't gamble for ticket sales and several thousand Brentford fans missed out on what was a tremendous 2-2 draw, played out at St Mary's. My two cousins rang a couple of days before the game requesting a couple of tickets but they had all sold out. I knew a Southampton supporter who had two spare and promptly organised my two cousins, who were in their 30s, to get their tickets. Earning a replay: Sam Sodje heads home an equaliser for Brentford in the 2005 cup tie with Southampton . After being 2-0 down we drew 2-2 and I rang my cousins from the team bus after the game. Both their phones were switched off. I finally got a call at 9.30pm and they informed me they had been thrown out of the ground and kept in Southampton Police Station for having tickets in the wrong area. Safe to say they had a memorable afternoon . THIS IS THE MAGIC OF THE FA CUP . That reminds me of the real magic of the FA Cup, the real stories that go on. Five days before that special game at St Mary's I had a letter passed to me in my office at Brentford's training ground that had been sent to the football club. It was a request for one of my players to go to a police station as he had not paid his council tax, had avoided all correspondence and was no longer at the property he was supposed to be living in. In other words, it was a warrant for his arrest. Tricky matter: Before the FA Cup tie with Southampton, Allen had to speak to one his players about an unpaid tax bill . I'd been on all the courses, gained my UEFA Pro licence and attended the LMA's business management course at the University of Warwick. But this was obviously a tricky, testing matter. So I called the player in before training and he said to me: 'I will pay it when we get paid at the end of the month.' I said I don't think that'll be good enough they want to speak to you now. But he said to me: 'Don't worry gaffer, they won't find me as I'm living at a mate's house.' I said to him: 'On Saturday afternoon you'll be playing in front of 27,000 people with probably about 500 police there, so let's hope they don't arrest you in the warm up!' CORTESE IS NO SAINT . Talking of Southampton, they've been making all the headlines recently. I most definitely do not agree that the club will now go into meltdown and that the players will leave because the chairman, Nicola Cortese, has quit. It's important to recognise he has done a good job, guiding the club forward and improving and helping the manager maximise the talented players currently there. Moving on: Nicola Cortese quit his role as executive chairman of Southampton this week . They have nursed the emerging young talent and done well with player recruitment. The young players that Southampton have – Luke Shaw, James Ward-Prowse, Calum Chambers – all these lads have been at Southampton a long time. Their academy has been helped with analysts, sports scientists, top schoolboy and youth coaches brought in, to help develop these players, which has made a significant improvement to their first-team squad. Cortese has overseen this, put everything in place, made big decisions and set up a crucial department to go into full detail on every player that has been signed. There's no disputing that. Staying put: Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino said he will not quit the club - for now . However, the players are all under contract and they clearly enjoy playing for Mauricio Pochettino. The players will probably be disappointed but footballers very, very quickly move on. Just as they would've done had Pochettino quit upon hearing the news that Mr Cortese was leaving. The bottom line is, it's the players going on the pitch to play. Not the chairman that sits in the boardroom eating prawn sandwiches. It's the manager who should get the credit just as it is the manager who gets the bullet. On Tuesday night, I watched the FA Cup game between Charlton and Oxford at the Valley. It was lovely to see both the managers after the game. Chris . Powell has done a wonderful job getting Charlton promoted and with no . investment managed to keep them hanging on in the Championship, which is . a fine achievement. Chris Wilder has done a great job at Oxford, . getting them promoted to League Two from the Conference. His team put in . a great performance to draw 2-2. Doing a good job: Both Oxford boss Chris Wilder and Charlton manager Chris Powell will be pleased . I think both managers were happy . with that result: one was probably very relieved to come back and the . other tinged with acute disappointment after being 2-0 up. The . public do not know how difficult it is for managers; the stress, . frustration and build-up of anxiety, and when I met Chris and Chris . after the game you can see it had been a difficult evening for both of . them. It's draining, it's tiring, and when I drove away from the . Valley, I was full of energy and enthusiasm ready for a return to the . Mad world of the technical area.","Yohan Cabaye is Newcastle's main man .

"By . David Mccormack . The bodies of a young couple who went missing just before New Year’s Eve have been found in the garage of the woman’s New Jersey home. Jorge Rodriguez, 24, and his girlfriend Melissa Pereira, 25, were last seen leaving her home in Wayne on Dec. 27, supposedly headed for a Pennsylvania bed and breakfast - but they never showed up. Their bodies were found on Sunday morning inside Rodriguez’s car some three weeks after they had been reported missing. Jorge Rodriguez, 24, and his girlfriend Melissa Pereira, 25, were last seen leaving her home in Wayne, New Jersey, on Dec. 27 . Investigators are awaiting the results of an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death, said Passaic County Assistant Prosecutor Michael DeMarco. It was not immediately known how long the bodies were in the garage and no notes were found, a source told the Cliffview Pilot. The couple had New Years’ Eve reservations at the Cherry Valley Manor, a bed-and-breakfast in the Poconos, but Pereira didn’t take her wallet and Rodriguez didn’t call work when he didn’t show on Dec 28. Since their disappearance, Pereira's cell phone had been in use, but would quickly get turned off. The couple had been dating for about two years and were said to be very happy and excited for the future . The couple were registered in the national missing person's database on Jan. 13. Earlier this month, Garfield Police . Captain Darren Sucorowski said there was no reason to believe Rodriguez . and Pereira were victims of a crime. An uncle of Pereira told the Star-Ledger that the family was ‘just in shock’ at the news. ‘At this point we're just still in shock and we're just trying to wait for what the medical examiners are going to say,’ he said. Angie Escobar, Rodriguez’s cousin, told North Jersey.com that she ‘found it kind of bizarre’ that the couple was found in Rodriguez’s car in Pereira’s garage. So in love: Family and friends say there is no reason the couple may have wanted to take their own lives. They were looking forward to their anniversary and had a bright future together . ‘It’s just so sad,’ Escobar said. ‘He was so young. He had so much to give.’ The couple had been dating for about two years, Escobar said, and they were very happy and excited for the future. Twitter profiles show a couple in love. On Dec. 27, Pereira tweeted 'weekend with my everything :) #lovehim.' On Oct. 14, Rodriguez sent out a note saying “I love my princess” with Pereira’s handle and a smiley face. On Dec. 4, he re-tweeted Pereira’s message that said 'adore you.' Perriera’s last job was as a production assistant for FOX News, while Rodriguez had worked as a manager in a photography studio.","Jorge Rodriguez, 24, and Melissa Pereira, 25, were last seen leaving her home in Wayne, New Jersey, on Dec. 27 .

"By . Will Payne . Davion Only's biological family are still desperate to have him live with them, telling MailOnline,  'He's our blood.... We want to be part of his life'. Orphaned teen, Davion, 16, stole the hearts of people round the world last year when he made an impassioned plea from a church pulpit for a, 'forever family' to adopt him. It looked like he had finally got his wish when a minister and his wife took him into their Ohio home just after spring break. But yesterday news broke that he had apparently got into a physical confrontation with another boy in the house and had been sent back to a children's home in Pinellas County, Florida, leaving his dreams of a normal life in tatters. Davion Only, 16, captured the hears of America when he pleaded for a 'forever family' at a church in Florida in September. News broke last week that he was back in a group home . Wanted him back: Davion's aunt Doris Barnes, pictured left in October, said Davion belongs with his biological family. She said she would take him in - but is not allowed because she has a criminal record . Davion was taken into care as a baby after being born to drug addict La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud, in the Clearwater area of Florida. She died last summer, something that apparently inspired Davion to make his emotional church speech. Today McCloud's sister, Davion's aunt, Doris Barnes said the family were devastated at the news their relative was back in care, but repeated their desire to have him live with them. She is convinced her nephew sometimes rebels because he knows he has a real family out there, who he wants to live with. They have spent time with him over the last few months, but have apparently not been considered for permanent adoption, partly because some members of the family have criminal convictions. Davion is due to spend July 4th celebrating with them in their home town of Clearwater. Speaking to MailOnline, Doris, 54, said: 'His cousin just picked him today. Davion is going to spend today with his family at his cousin's house. Davion was taken in by an Ohio pastor and his wife. However, he was kicked out and sent back to Florida after he got into a physical fight with one of the pastor's children . 'We're going to have a meal and talk to him. We are very upset that this information has got out. It shouldn't have been leaked. 'Who in their right mind is going to want to take him now? He has made a mistake, but he is still just a boy. 'I want to be part of his life, he is my family and my blood. I have a conviction from 14 years ago and haven't been In trouble since, but the way the system works I can't adopt him. 'No family is perfect, but this shows why he needs to be with his real family. We just want to be there for him.' She added: 'I think maybe he is acting up because he knows he has real family out there. I believe he wants to be with us and I believe that when he gets old enough he will come back to us anyway.' It is a major setback for Davion, who thought he had finally got the family he had always wanted. After Davion made his impassioned appeal, a minister and his wife flew Davion up to Ohio to visit over spring break. They introduced him to their three children and took him to church. Davion came back to Florida just long enough to pack a small suitcase. Davion turned his life around after his mother died in an attempt to get adopted by a family . Then he returned to Ohio, where the prospective parents signed him up to play football - something he had always wanted to do. 'I got baptized!' he wrote April 20, from his new phone, on his new Facebook page. The . adoption could take place in 90 days, said Terri Durdaller, whose . agency, Eckerd, oversees Tampa Bay's foster children. That would have . meant that Davion could have been adopted this month. Instead, he is back in Pinellas County, at a therapeutic foster home, 'upset and embarrassed, unwilling to talk.' 'There . was an incident in Ohio,' said Eckerd's director, Lorita Shirley. At . one point, she said, things got physical between Davion and another . child in the house, and with the dad. The family wanted him out. On May 30, Davion's case manager flew to Ohio and brought him back to Florida. 'This has been a major setback for him,' Shirley said. 'Our goal now is to get him treatment.' After . discovering his biological mother was dead last summer, Davion, who had . previously been in trouble at school, decided to turn his life around . and finally get out of foster care. He . went to the gym and lost 40 pounds. Last fall, he buckled down at . school, started getting A's. He tried to control his temper, be the kind . of kid someone would want. 'I'll take anyone,' Davion said last September. 'Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care.' 'I . know God hasn't given up on me,' he told the packed congregation at St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church. 'So I'm not giving up either.' His story went national. After appearing on the front page of the Tampa Bay Times on October 8, Davion's plea was picked up by news outlets across the world. Producers of The View flew him to New York to talk to Barbara Walters. An outing away from the group home he lives in allows Davion Only, bow 16, (left) to spend some quality time talking one-on-one with his mentor, Richard Prince, 22 . More than 10,000 strangers called offering to help or adopt him. Eckerd workers returned 2,500 of those calls, said Durdaller, the agency's spokeswoman. At first, Eckerd officials tried to connect Davion with a second cousin, a sheriff's deputy who learned of Davion through the newspaper. When that didn't work, they moved him from the group home to be with a foster family. But that family never intended to adopt Davion. In early March, Davion called his former adoption specialist to say, 'I had a blowout.' The foster family refused to keep him. But it was okay, Davion said then. He had met this great couple from Ohio. A minister and his wife with a bunch of kids. They said they wanted him. Finally, someone wanted him. 'On paper, this was the book-definition perfect family for him,' said Shirley, Eckerd's director. 'The father was a pastor who had worked with troubled kids. They knew about Davion's background and his issues.' 'The biggest thing that went wrong is that Davion spent 15 years in the system,' said Shirley. 'He has a lot of built up anger. It's been very devastating for everyone involved.' Eckerd therapists refused to let Davion talk to the media. He didn't respond to Facebook messages. He no longer has a cellphone. The Ohio family didn't respond to requests either. 'Davion is a maturing young man whose perspective on life continues to change as it does with most teenagers,' reads a statement from Eckerd. 'After Davion spent time with a prospective adoptive family this spring, it was determined that the family was not the right fit for him, with that we are asking for privacy during this stage of his life.' Since September, when Davion asked God and strangers for help, he has been moved away from his friends at his group home and school. He has lost his adoptions specialist. And he has cycled through four families. His mentor, 22-year-old Richard Prince, said he hasn't seen Davion since he was sent back to Florida. 'I'm extremely worried about him,' Prince said. 'We had a short conversation a couple of weeks ago, but it was very unsettling.' Eckerd's  website has its own page devoted to Davion, which has raised money and awareness about other teenagers in foster care. 'I am currently matched with a family,' says his profile. Which is no longer true. 'When he is ready, we will continue down the list of people who have expressed interest in him,' said Shirley. 'Now, we might be looking at empty-nesters, people who raised teenagers but don't have any other kids in their house. That might be the best match for him.' Since September, when Davion took the pulpit, 339 children in Pinellas and Pasco counties have been adopted. But the boy who became the face for older adoption, whose 'Davion Effect' was touted in Tallahassee and on TV talk shows, is still alone.","Davion Only, 16, made national news when he pleaded for a 'forever family' from the pulpit of a Florida church .

"By . Associated Press . American tennis player Victoria Duval, who lost in the second round at Wimbledon last week, has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and will undergo immediate treatment for the cancer. The player's management team said today that the 18-year-old was diagnosed after a biopsy was taken in England before Wimbledon and further tests in the United States confirmed the results. The statement said Hodgkin's, the most common form of cancer in adolescents, 'was caught in a very early stage.' Victoria Duval will start immediate treatment for the form of cancer (pictured at Wimbldeon last week) It says Duval 'will undergo treatment right away and due to her overall good health and isolation of the cancer, the prognosis is a full recovery in a few months.' Duval said in a statement: 'It is with a heavy heart that I will have to step away from tennis competition for a short period after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. 'I received the news after my first round of qualifying at Wimbledon but decided to continue to compete. Being on court provided me with much comfort. 'I have complete faith that God will assist me and my family with all that we need, to achieve victory and become stronger from this journey. Tennis star Victoria Duval pictured as a guest on the Jay Leno show in September 2013 . 'I intend to put up my best fight and have full recovery.

'I am grateful in advance to my fans and friends for their support and positive thoughts while I undergo my treatment and fight this battle.' Duval reached the second round of the U.S. Open last year, beating 2011 champion Sam Stosur in the first round. Her tennis career skyrocketed from the win, at just 17 years old.","Duval will undergo immediate treatment for the cancer .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Convicted killer Joran Van der Sloot can now truly appreciate the expression ‘ball and chain.’ The prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway married his pregnant Peruvian girlfriend Friday in a ceremony at the maximum-security prison where he is serving 28 years for murdering a woman he met in a Lima casino. Van der Sloot, 26, tied the knot with Leidy Figueroa, 24, in a private ceremony. Prison officials prohibited video and photos during the midday nuptials and none of the groom's relatives attended, said his attorney, Maximo Altez. Scroll down for video . Prison romance: Leidy Figueroa, seven-months pregnant bride of  Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot, arrives for her wedding ceremony in Piedras Gordas penitentiary July 4 . Groom: Joran van der Sloot, 26, the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, married his pregnant Peruvian girlfriend on Friday, July 4, 2014 in a ceremony at the maximum-security prison where he is serving 28 years for murdering a woman he met in a Lima casino . Wearing a tailored suit and dress shoes sent by his mother, Van der Sloot told his bride, who is seven months pregnant, that after he is released from prison, ‘”I want to marry you again,' and she told him the same,”’ said John Barrera, who officiated the wedding as mayor of the city of Ancon, where the prison is located. The blushing bride showed off her growing baby bump in a conservative white ‘mullet’ dress paired with a matching shawl. To complete her wedding day look, Figueroa wore a flower in her hair. Van der Sloot met and fell in love with Figueroa while she was selling goods inside the prison, according to his attorney. Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Altez showed an oil painting given to him by Van der Sloot depicting a tall, solitary woman in a red dress on a palm-studded beach under a radiant sun. The attorney, who acted as a witness during the ceremony, was one of only four people in attendance, among them another lawyer and the bride’s mother. Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot. In 2011, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for payment. They found love in a hopeless place: Van der Sloot (left) met Leidy Figueroa (right) in prison where she sells candy and cigarettes to inmates; they will welcome their first child in September . The newlyweds met at the prison, where Figueroa, an accountant by training with a young son from a previous relationship, sells candy and cigarettes to inmates. 'They became friends and . spent a lot of time together in his cell,' Altez told CNN earlier this . year. 'Unlike the United States, here in Peru, loved ones or relatives . can see inmates inside their jails.' Figueroa is due to give birth to Van der Sloot's child in September. All prisoners at the penitentiary are allowed conjugal visits, explaining Figueroa's pregnancy. Peruvian media have floated the possibility that Van der Sloot decided to get married to avoid extradition to the U.S. at the end of his prison term. But his attorney has dismissed the suggestion that the nuptials were a calculated move. ‘He's getting married because he's in love and is having a child,’ Altez said in May. ‘There are no hidden agendas.’ Leidy Figueroa told CBS News' Crimesider earlier this year that she usually visits Van der Sloot twice a week and brings him home-cooked meals. According to the bride, the convict has become a new person and is enjoying his prison arts and crafts classes. Van der Sloot is currently in prison for confessing to killing 21-year-old business student Stephany Flores at a Lima casino in 2010. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2012. Van der Sloot is also suspected of killing 18-year-old Holloway, who vanished during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005 and was last seen with him and another man. Mystery: Natalee Holloway went missing from Aruba in 2005 while on a high school trip. She was last seen with Van der Sloot and another man. Her body was never recovered .

The Alabama teen's body has not been found and Van Der Sloot has denied involvement in her disappearance. More than two decades from now, Van der Sloot will face charges in the U.S. for accepting $25,000 from Holloway's mom to lead her to the girl's body, something he never did. Van der Sloot has been spending his sentence teaching English to other inmates and painting.","Joran Van der Sloot, 26, tied the knot with his 24-year-old girlfriend Leidy Figueroa at Piedras Gordas penitentiary Friday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jewell Berggrun, pictured, was swindled out of $500 from a 'suitor' on a Christian dating site . A woman says she was scammed out of $500 from a would-be suitor on a Christian dating site. Jewell Berggrun, 54, from Winder, Georgia, told WSBTV that the man called her twice a day -- and that she fell in love before realizing what was going on. 'I put my heart out there, he took it and destroyed it,' she told the channel. After her husband died of a heart attack, Berggrun turned to the free Christian dating site to find new love. She told WSBTV that she quickly fell for 'Alexi,' a man who said he was a Texas resident and did business in Malaysia. 'Alexi' told Berggrun ran into money problems, asking her for $8,000, the channel adds. She ended up giving him $500 through a wire transfer. Berggrun quickly realized that 'Alexi' may not have been who he said he was, when she found out his photos were on three different dating sites using three different names, she said. On top of her recent troubles, Berggrun told WSBTV that she is on disability and on a fixed income. 'I can't get any medication or groceries for the rest of the month,' she said. Authorities say it is unlikely she will get her money back from the man. Berggrun, seen here with her late husband Terrell, went on the dating site looking for a new shot at love . Her dating site experience is similar to one MailOnline reported on earlier this month, where a divorcee was scammed out of $500,000 on Christian Mingle.com. The woman, 66, said she had been in contact with a Irish man named 'David Holmes' -- only to later find out he was Nigerian. His dating profile picture was allegedly that of a male model downloaded elsewhere. She was eventually convinced by 'David Holmes' to wire him $300,000, followed by another $200,000 to a Turkish bank, Mail Online reported. She became suspicious and contacted authorities -- who were able to freeze her funds before the man's associate could collect them. It is unlikely that she will be able to collect the remaining $300,000. Berggrun says 'Alexi' initially asked for $8,000, but she only transferred him $500 .","Jewell Berggrun, 54, went on dating site to search for new love after husband died from heart attack earlier this year .

"By . Alice Smellie . The surroundings of The Nash  – a five-bedroom house in the heart of Dorset’s Thomas Hardy country – are steeped in history. The house is on the outskirts of the village of Marnhull, which is mentioned (though called Marlot) in Hardy’s Tess Of The D’Urbervilles and has been  used as a location for one of the many television adaptations of the novel. Also, local pub The Crown Inn was renamed the Pure Drop Inn by Hardy and is where the beautiful and tragic Tess is first described. The Nash, located in Marnhull, Dorset, sits in the old grounds of a manor house in which Henry VIII¿s sixth wife, Catherine Parr, lived and died . There are links to English royalty too. The Nash sits in the old grounds of a manor  house in which Henry VIII’s sixth wife, Catherine Parr, lived. Parr – who, most would agree, was Henry’s most fortunate spouse, outliving him – retired to the manor house and, when she died, it passed to Elizabeth I. But, despite all this history, The Nash itself, which is for sale at £1.5 million,  is relatively new. It was built in 1984 – the time of Elizabeth II rather than Elizabeth I – but within the walled garden of what had been Elizabeth I’s house. On a still day, with no sound but the buzzing of bees and cheerful birdsong, it is easy to imagine these figures from history wandering within the now ancient walls. And from every single window of  The Nash you can see  either the spectacularly restored Elizabethan garden or the rolling Dorset countryside. ‘This is a home for garden-lovers,’ says  co-owner Adrian Shaw, 53. His parents  had lived in the house and he and his sister  are reluctantly selling it after his father  died last year. Dorset dream: Adrian Shaw has put the five-bedroom house on the market for £1.5million . Immaculate: Manicured hedges feature large in the secluded gardens at The Nash in Dorset . ‘It needs a family living here,’ says businessman Adrian, who is based in Surrey with his wife and two daughters. ‘My parents had just retired when they moved in, and they painstakingly restored the gardens over almost 30 years.’ Vast, dark green and manicured yew hedges are planted within the stone walls, creating a number of separate and secluded gardens amid the three acres surrounding the house. Within these, fresh scented box hedges are laid out in neat patterns, and stone urns  hold further shrubs. ‘There are few flower beds – the focus was on low-maintenance flowering shrubs,’ says Adrian. ‘Although the garden took a long time to complete, it’s not labour-intensive.’ Royal connection: Catherine Parr lived in the manor house after the death of Henry VIII, and Elizabeth I inherited it . The three-storey house was built from local stone by architect Brian Savage. And while he designed it in the style of the American Frank Lloyd Wright, it has an Italian feel – and an intriguing-looking tower. There is a good-size fitted kitchen and breakfast room that leads straight through an archway into a vast, light conservatory. Here, eight huge canvas curtains sway. ‘We commissioned them from ships’ sails,’ explains Adrian. ‘The room gets so warm and bright in summer that it needs some shade.’ This conservatory is  large enough to hold a dining table as well as a sofa and chairs, and folding doors open into a huge formal drawing room. The colours throughout are muted greens, apricots  and creams. A stunning large bedroom on the ground floor has doors into the garden and there is a charming bathroom with a corner bath. There is also a downstairs toilet, a wine cellar, a storage room, a huge bright garden room and  a double garage. ‘There isn’t a master bedroom as such,’  says Adrian as we ascend to the first floor,  where there are three further big bedrooms and two bathrooms. A wooden staircase leads up to the tower, which has 360-degree views and would make a perfect study or playroom. Nearby Gillingham has a mainline railway station with regular trains to Waterloo. Nick Evans, area director of Chesterton Humberts, Sherborne, says: ‘The Nash is a true gem. It combines landmark architecture and presence with a magnificent site, and will appeal to buyers looking for prestige, comfort, peace and tranquillity.’ Adrian says: ‘I have such fond memories  of this house. When my sister married, we had a marquee on the lawn, and of course many family Easter egg hunts, huge Christmas gatherings and my parents’ annual drinks party. ‘I’d love to think of another family enjoying themselves here as we did.’ Chesterton Humberts, 01935 812323 .","The Nash in Marnhull, Dorset is on the market for £1.5million .

"By . Paul Bentley . Father-of-one Zydrunas Laurinavicius (right) died after being stabbed in Hendon, north west London . Four people including two teenage girls were being questioned last night over the fatal stabbing of a father in front of children and parents on the school run. They were arrested along with two young men after 38-year-old Zydrunas Laurinavicius was murdered on Thursday afternoon. The builder was walking along a street with his father when he was jumped by a gang who tried to run off with his bag. When he refused to hand it over, they took out knives and slashed his arm and chest, witnesses said. One of the group also attacked his father, who survived only to watch his son die in his arms. Last night, devastated friends paid tribute to Mr Laurinavicius, a Lithuanian described as a ‘dedicated worker and loving father’. Officers from the Met Police, meanwhile, continued to question two men aged 19 and 20 and two girls aged 16 and 17 in connection with the killing. Mr Laurinavicius, who has lived in the UK for many years, had been working with his father Pranas, 67, to renovate a £1.6million detached house in Hendon, north west London. They were targeted as they walked in a leafy area close to St Mary’s Church of England High School, Hendon School and a nursery as parents were taking children home. Pranas told friends they were jumped by a gang of black youths, who tried to steal a bag his son was carrying. As the robbery quickly became violent and knives were drawn, two of the gang attacked the younger man, while another punched his father and cut his hand. Witnesses said good Samaritans tried to revive Mr Laurinavicius as he lay in a pool of blood but he died at the scene. Newly-qualified doctor Joseph Machta, 26, who was joined by a passing nurse, said: ‘It was awful. We were doing CPR and there were families around, one mother was helping while another woman looked after her baby in a pram. His heart had stopped. We tried to save him but he was so badly injured.’ Witnesses said Samaritans tried to revive Mr Laurinavicius as he lay in a pool of blood but he died at the scene . Mr Laurinavicius was murdered as he walked in a leafy area close to St Mary's Church of England High School in Hendon, north west London on Thursday . Staff from a Jewish community ambulance service also helped but could be heard shouting ‘he’s gone, he’s gone’ long before paramedics and an air ambulance arrived. Mr Laurinavicius is said to live with his sister in London. His son, who lives with his mother in Lithuania, was due to visit this weekend along with his grandmother. The builder’s former boss said: ‘He was a really friendly guy, who liked to make jokes but worked very hard. They tried to take his bag but Zydrunas is a big man, he did not want to just let them steal from him. ‘I don’t understand how they could just kill him like that in the day with so many people around.’ Bystander Jonathan Marriott, a company director aged 43, said: ‘A guy was just minding his own business and he got killed. It is not what you expect to happen in a nice part of north west London.’ Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner urged witnesses to come forward, adding: ‘This is a busy area for highway traffic and it was a bright, clear day.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Zydrunas Laurinavicius, 38, was stabbed to death in north west London .

"By . Murray Walker . Next week's British Grand Prix will be the 50th held at Silverstone. To mark the occasion, Murray Walker - the voice of Formula One - looks back at his 10 favourite races there... Legends: Murray Walker (centre) poses with Australian cricketers Shane Warne and Steve Waugh . 1948 - It was the first Grand Prix we had since the war and there was a feeling of euphoria. The foreign superstars, who we hadn’t really seen before in Britain, were out in force. Luigi Villoresi won for Maserati and team-mate Alberto Ascari was second. There was a crowd of over 120,000 people, despite the fact that it took hours to get in and out of the circuit. 1949 - This race was special for me because it was the first broadcast I ever did. I was at Stowe Corner when John Bolster (second right), in an ERA, came down the track, lost control, went barrelling end over end and was thrown in heap at my feet in the commentary box. I thought: ‘God, what do I say?’ I said: ‘Bolster has gone off’ — a masterpiece of understatement. Briefing: Drivers stand and listen to instructions before the start of the 1949 British Grand Prix . 1950 - It was the inaugural Formula One Grand Prix, and it also the . first, and so far only, Royal meeting. King George VI (far left), . Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret attended. It was also noticeable . because the Italian Alfa Romeo team were there in force. They entered . four cars and finished first, second and third. 1951 - Alfa Romeo, who were as dominant then as Mercedes are this year, . were beaten at a world championship Grand Prix for the first time by . Ferrari. It also marked the first time the Italian team had tasted . victory in F1. The race was won by a chap called Jose Froilan Gonzalez . (above).

Maiden win: Jose Froilan Gonzalez records Ferrari's first ever World Championship Grand Prix win in 1951 . 1960 - Graham Hill started second on the grid next to pole-sitter Jack Brabham, but he stalled his car and was 22nd by the end of the first lap. Incredibly, Hill fought his way back through the field and led the race on lap 55 with only 22 to go. He was pressed all the way by Brabham and spun off six laps before the end, with the Australian winning. 1969 - Great friends Jackie Stewart and Jochen Rindt battled side-by-side for 63 of the 84 laps. Stewart saw the rear wing end plate of Rindt’s Lotus was loose and in danger of cutting his tyre, which would have taken him off at enormous speed. Stewart gestured to Rindt and the Austrian pulled into the pits with the Scot taking victory. Star Brit: James Hunt driving his Hesketh Racing car at the 1973 British Grand Prix . Winner: Nigel Mansell in action in his Williams Honda during his Silverstone victory in 1987 . 1973 - Jody Scheckter, in his McLaren, started from fourth, but lost control and took out nine cars on the first lap. He’d wiped out the whole of John Surtees’ team and he had to go and hide! Surtees, who is not the best man in the world to cross, was very, very angry. Scheckter finished fourth when the race re-started . . . and Surtees never found him! 1987 - Nigel Mansell (right) had terrific vibrations on his car and had to change all four wheels, leaving his Williams team-mate Nelson Piquet to streak away. Nigel was 28 seconds behind Piquet, in an identical car, with 30 laps to go. But Nigel drove out of his skin and, with three laps remaining, he threw Piquet a dummy at Stowe, passed him, and won the race. Hard-fought victory: Damon Hill, driving for Williams Renault, fought off Michael Schumacher to win in 1994 . 1994 - There was so much controversy that year, starting at Silverstone. Michael Schumacher (near right) illegally passed championship rival Damon Hill on the parade lap. The start was aborted but the German did it again. Schumacher was later black-flagged but he ignored it. Hill won, but Schumacher was banned for two races. 2008 - Lewis Hamilton in the McLaren turned in an absolutely brilliant drive in appalling weather conditions.

"By . Jack Doyle . Union representatives were condemned today after they told David Cameron to ‘go to Dignitas’. Delegates to the Unite conference in Liverpool this week aimed a series of foul-mouthed insults at the Prime Minister and accused him of being a ‘racist and sexist pig’. They were invited by organisers of the conference to ‘Stick it to Cameron’ by writing messages on notes before sticking them on two life-size cardboard cut outs of the PM. Union members at the Unite conference plastered a cardborard cutout of the Prime Minister with offensive messages . One of the messages offered to send Mr Cameron to the Dignitas assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland . Today the Tories described the postings as ‘atrocious’ and called on Ed Miliband to condemn them. Around a dozen messages were left earlier this week, including one calling on the PM to kill himself at the Swiss suicide clinic. One wrote: ‘We can have a whip round, to pay for your one way ticket to Dignitas’. Another called on the PM to ‘Crawl back down the hole you came out of’. They also branded him a ‘racist and sexist pig’, a ‘Moron’, a ‘Posh w*****’ and a ‘T***’. Conservative Party Vice Chairman Bob Neill MP said: ‘Even by Unite’s standards this is a new low. ‘I hope Ed Miliband has the courage to condemn such atrocious behavior which has no place in public life.’ Astonishingly, a Unite spokesman refused to distance themselves from the posts, and refused to comment when contacted by the Mail. It follows revelations on Wednesday that a senior Unite figure joked to delegates about rounding up the richest people in the world and killing them. Assistant General Secretary Steve Turner said the spread of wealth in society was 'obscene'. He said: 'Oxfam put in a report... on global wealth inequality. There are 85 people who have a combined wealth on this planet equivalent to the poorest 50 per cent on this planet. ‘I was accused of [wanting to] put them all on a London bus and wanting to kill them when I was talking in the House of Commons recently. Of course that wasn't the objective, if I was going to do that I would use a train carriage. You can't get enough people on a bus.' He also said the union was demanding a Ministry for Labour and a powerful ‘Secretary of State for Trade Unions’ if Ed Miliband – who was backed by the union in the Labour leadership poll - gets in to Number 10. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey used his conference in Liverpool to attack the Tories and urge Labour to back an in-out EU referendum . On Monday, Unite general secretary, 'Red' Len McCluskey, told Mr Miliband to 'bring home the bacon' for union members as Unite pledged to donate up to £12million to Labour's election campaign on top of the £12million given to the party since 2010. Yesterday the union, the largest to affiliate to the Labour Party, urged Ed Miliband to back a referendum on EU membership. Unite said denying people a chance to vote on Britain's membership of the EU would be an ‘electoral millstone’ for Labour next May. Mr McCluskey said: ‘It is time that Labour's leadership took a new look at the referendum question. We do not seek a referendum to take Britain out of the EU, we seek a referendum rethink in order to help Labour into power. ‘Without such a pledge, our party will stand exposed, Ukip will be strengthened in some key constituencies and the Tories will hypocritically charge Labour with being anti-democratic. In a tight election, this can make the difference.’ Delegates at the conference approved a motion urging Labour to ‘urgently reconsider’ the idea of a referendum.","Unite members urged to stick messages  on cardboard cutouts of the PM .

"By . Jack Doyle . Union boss ‘Red Len’ McCluskey told Ed Miliband to ‘bring home the bacon’ for his members yesterday as he pledged £12million to bankroll Labour’s election campaign. At the same time, Unite members began to vote for a ‘wish list’ of policy demands – including higher taxes, more public spending, and the repeal of all trade union laws passed in the past three decades. And the union announced tens of thousands of members had voted to join strike action this month against pay restraint.

In his speech to the conference, Mr McCluskey said he would ‘stand fully behind’ Ed Miliband and praised his ‘radical’ agenda for Britain.

It’s is a people’s agenda and this union will be proud to fight alongside Labour to secure it.’ ‘Ed has to understand that only by offering hope to our kids, only by being on the side of the ordinary men and women of our nations, only by rejecting the siren voices of austerity lite will he win the trust of the electorate.’ ‘Have conviction, Ed.

Our members are not interested in how you eat a bacon butty, only that you bring home the bacon for working people.’ ‘And we will not let Labour fight for this programme with one hand tied behind its back.’ Demanding: McCluskey also boasted of Unite's influence in selecting Labour candidates to stand as MPs . Mr McCluskey also boasted of the union’s growing influence in selecting Labour candidates to stand as MPs, saying there were now ‘there are more union backed candidates than for a generation’. The money will come with strings attached, however. It will not be handed over in a lump sum but given to candidates who toe the Unite line and sign up to its policy agenda. Yesterday the union made clear what that was as delegates voted to end health service reform, renationalise the railways and take all major energy companies into public ownership. A motion to overturn all trade union laws passed under Margaret Thatcher and John Major is expected to be voted through later this week at the party’s conference in Liverpool - a move that would take industrial relations back to the 1970s. Mr McCluskey also threatened to break the law if further anti-union laws were brought in. He said: ‘The Conservative Party should not assume that we will put respect for unjust laws ahead of our duty to fight exploitation and ruthless employers. ‘We will fight for our members within the law where possible. But let the Tories be in no doubt that if they push us outside the law they will be responsible for the consequences, not us.’ The result of strike ballots announced yesterday means tens of thousands of Unite members, including bin men, street cleaners and elderly carers, will join nationwide strike action on July 10. Unison and the GMB union have already announced a 24-hour walkout over pay. Addressing the conference, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour was ‘grateful’ for Unite’s support, and said the party and the unions should stand ‘side by side’. He told delegates: ‘One of the main things I wanted to get over to you all this morning is we are grateful for your support. ‘We are grateful that you want to stick by us and we thank you for it. I and my colleagues in the party do not take it for granted. He added: ‘The time has come for us all to put differences aside and to show the country that there is still strength in this Labour movement of ours, when it stands together, party and unions side by side fighting for the things it created and it still believes in.’ But shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he remained committed to ‘fiscal discipline’ and make ‘difficult decisions that will be unpopular with the trade union movement’. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Len McCluskey has confirmed that his union will continue to bankroll the Labour Party, choose their candidates and write their policy.’ ‘Now he is even threatening to break the law if he doesn’t get his way.’ ‘This further demonstrates that Ed Miliband just can’t stand up for Britain against demands from the unions for more spending, more borrowing and more taxes. ‘It’s the same old Labour: no leadership and no long-term plan for the future of the country.’","Unite leader said he will 'stand fully behind' Ed Miliband in the election .

"By . Sarah Dean . A young mother-of-four was brutally tortured with a knife before she was murdered and left to rot in a shallow bushland grave north of Brisbane. Police will allege 28-year-old Tia Landers suffered a violent ordeal, which saw her legs cut and her body dragged into the shower because she was 'bleeding profusely' before she was shot twice, a police source has told MailOnline. Ms Landers had been missing for a month before her body was found in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane, on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Police allege Tia Landers suffered a violent death and was shot twice before being taken to a shallow grave . The body of Tia Landers was found following a search of state forest at Beerburrum, south of the Sunshine Coast, after she was reported missing on June 19 . Brisbane couple John Edward Harris, 42, and Linda Eileen Appleton, 40, who were known to Ms Landers, have been charged with torturing and murdering her and will spend at least the next six months behind bars after they were remanded in custody during a court mention on Friday. The couple did not appear in the Redcliffe Magistrates Court, where the matter was adjourned until January 12. Police say Ms Landers went willingly to a home at Brighton, north of Brisbane. Officers who've combed the property say there are signs she was brutally tortured there. 'There's evidence that there has been violence,' Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen told reporters. 'The offenders have been charged with torture.' Ms Landers' 19-year-old sister is desperate for answers. Jamie Landers was at the court on Friday and said her family want to find out why Ms Landers was killed. 'We want to know why. Tia's done a lot of bad stuff in her life, we all know that (but) it's not to be held against her,' she told reporters outside the court. Speaking to MailOnline on Friday, Jamie paid tribute to her caring big sister who bought her up when their father got sick with cancer. I am devastated… I helped her raise her kids, she was the best mum, they adored her, she was always spoiling them and making them princess dresses,’ Jamie said. The mother of four had been missing for a month before her body was found . Jamie described her sister as a popular and outgoing young women and said when she was murdered it wasn’t just Tia’s life that was taken but ‘a piece of all her family’. ‘She has so many friends, everyone knows her for being bubbly, out there, and having fun and living in a dream world. ‘So many people are missing her at the moment,’ she said. A friend of the slain woman has told ABC radio she was a loving mother. 'I've known her for eight years, she was there for me always, ups, downs,' Angela Dicker said. 'Loving mother, loving daughter, loves her parents, loves her family.' Ms Landers was last seen at midday on June 16 in the Redcliffe and Deception Bay area when CCTV cameras recorded her walking into a petrol station. Police held grave fears for her safety after it was revealed she suffered from a medical condition, believed to be schizophrenia. They spent almost three weeks looking for her before they made the grisly discovery. Ms Landers was previously accused of being involved in a violent home robbery . Supt Hansen said Ms Landers was no stranger to the couple charged with her murder. 'She's an associate of theirs. They're known to each other, have been known to each other for some time,' he said. He said police had put Ms Landers in the high risk category after she went missing. A month before Ms Landers was last seen, she failed to appear in court as Wade Bartz's co-accused in a violent home robbery. The case was heard in the Supreme Court but charges against Mr Bartz were dropped after a witness identified his photo on Ms Landers’ Facebook page. In May, Mr Bartz posted a photo of Tia on his Facebook profile with the caption: 'My world stops spinning when your not around.' But on her own profile she listed herself as in a 'complicated relationship'. Her family had set up a Facebook campaign to appeal for public help in finding Ms Landers and her disappearance is unrelated to Mr Bartz, who is currently behind bars. A post-mortem examination is being carried out after Ms Landers' body was found in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane, on Thursday .

"By . Brian Barwick . Football pundits are now a permanent part of the TV scene, dispensing their thoughts and theories in stadiums, studios and, at this World Cup, rather inventively on Copacabana Beach. For many recently retired footballers it has become a lucrative second career, while for others it’s a useful buffer between finishing playing the game and going back to it. So, it is fitting during a World Cup in Brazil to look back on the men who helped start the ‘experts’ ball rolling - in the year we saw Pele, Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Jairzinho and Co triumph in such glorious fashion. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alan Mullery's spat with Malcolm Allison . Good old days: ITV's 1970 World Cup punditry team which included Jimmy Hill (third from left) It is 1970 and the front cover of the Radio Times World Cup edition sports a photograph of revered England captain Bobby Moore standing proud, TV Times chooses a glamorous blonde model in an England shirt. Vive la difference! Their differences didn’t end there. BBC had Joe Mercer and Don Revie in Mexico, while ITV put together their famous World Cup panel in London: Manchester United and Scotland’s Paddy Crerand, Wolves and Northern Ireland’s Derek Dougan (The Doog), and the gloriously extrovert Malcolm Allison. They would regularly wind each other up and Allison became the star turn. He had an answer for everything - or almost everything and Arsenal left back Bob McNab, left out of Sir Alf Ramsey’s World Cup squad, was armed with a bell to ring when he wanted to get a word in edgeways. Cover story: England captain Bobby Moore for Radio Times (left) and a model for TV Times . Outspoken, irreverent, argumentative, occasionally bang out of order and good telly, the ITV panel created a real stir. And while the BBC still won all the big head-to-head battles, the viewers often turned to ITV on the final whistle to hear what the four musketeers — in kipper ties, flares and wide lapels — made of it all. They were a smash hit and with Brian Moore and Jimmy Hill firing the questions, things always got lively. Controversy was never far away. England midfielder Alan Mullery, fresh home from having been knocked out of the World Cup, went to the live studio and gave his chief critic Allison both barrels. He fished an England cap out of a plastic bag, thrust it in Allison’s direction and said: ‘I’ve got 30 of these and this one’s spare’. For once, the uncapped Big Mal was speechless. These days, World Cup punditry has become a little more ordered (plastic bags are at a premium!) with greater immediate analysis of the action, more camera angles and technical gizmos to help illustrate a point more clearly. Glory: Brazil with Pele, Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Jairzinho and Co triumphed in 1970 . The current choice of individuals on both channels reflects the wider world of football and there are still plenty of characters. But wouldn’t it have been fun to hear the most famous World Cup panel’s take on England’s super-early exit, Robben’s diving, the magnificence of Messi — and a certain Luis Suarez and his wandering teeth? Bob, time to get the bell out mate! Confident: Brian Clough as ITV pundit . Having watched football on TV for more than 50 years and worked at the top of the business for BBC and ITV Sport, I have listened to some great pundits — and gave some of them their break in broadcasting. Here are five who made the viewers sit up and take notice. Jimmy Hill . An absolute one-off. He starred on The Big Match and when he did Match of the Day, he presented the programme and did the analysis! Awash with ideas, he has always had the integrity of the game at heart. I once told him he had finished top of a popularity survey among football presenters. ‘Great,’ he said. I then told him he had also finished top of an ‘unpopularity’ poll. ‘Great as well,’ he said. ‘The place not to finish in that type of thing is in the b****y middle!’ Brian Clough . Irreverent, awkward, and self-opinionated, Clough was not short of self-confidence. It all made for compelling TV, even if it tripped him up — for example when he famously called the Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski a ‘clown’ a few days before he had the game of his life against England.  As a young viewer I hung on his every word. Class act: BBC pundit Alan Hansen . Martin O’Neill . Quirky, curious, independent, occasionally left-field and with a great career as a player and manager to back up his views. He’s now the  manager of the Republic of Ireland but I gave him an early break in TV when George Best failed to show up for the BBC’s coverage of the 1986 World Cup. O’Neill is currently providing interesting thoughts on the World Cup for ITV from Copacabana Beach. Gary Neville . Fresh out of the dressing room, bright, opinionated and articulate. He was interesting and forthright as a player and took all that enterprising thinking into a new career on Sky Sports. Alan Hansen . Took the class he showed as a player at Liverpool into his long career at the BBC. Hansen was nervous when he started but soon found his feet and has spent two decades dissecting goals and making perceptive comments. He retires after this World Cup and will be missed.","BBC had legendary managers Joe Mercer and Don Revie in Mexico .

"By . Rachel Reilly . A father who was told he was too radioactive to hold his newborn son has overcome cancer to finally cuddle his boy. Calvin Innes, 29, was diagnosed with cancer just two weeks before the birth of his son, Cohen, in June. The 29-year-old children’s book illustrator had thyroid cancer and immediately underwent surgery to have a tumour removed from his throat. Calvin Innes,  29, (pictured) was diagnosed with cancer two weeks before his wife, Kali, gave birth to son Cohen (pictured). Just a month after Cohen's birth Mr Innes underwent radioactive drug treatment . The surgery went well and he was healthy enough to be present when his wife, Kali, gave birth to their son. Several weeks later however, Mr Innes began drug therapy which involved taking a daily cocktail of drugs to prevent the cancer - which had already reached his tonsils, thyroid and the lymph nodes - from spreading any further. One of the drugs was radioiodine which make a patient's body become radioactive. Because of this the new father was suddenly unable to enjoy bonding with his new son. Mr Calvin, from Hull in East Yorkshire, said: 'When you take the pills you become radioactive and for three weeks I wasn’t allowed near my newborn son. 'I couldn’t pick him up, I couldn’t feed him, play with him or change his nappy. 'It was awful because I was having to watch my wife Kali do all these things and I was unable to help. Mr Innes has stopped drug therapy and is now able to cuddle and bring up his son . 'While you’re on the treatment, they have to check you with a Geiger counter every day to see how radioactive you are and if you’re safe to be around people.' Calvin, who owns publishers My Little Big Town, underwent radioiodine therapy for three weeks. The strength of the pills were enough to cause potentially fatal health problems if he got too close to his son. Mr Innes said: '[Getting cancer] was a complete bolt from the blue. 'It’s like a hammer blow. I’d never in a million years have expected it. You think that’s the sort of thing that happens to other people, not you. 'I found out I had cancer two weeks before my son was due so it completely knocked me for six. 'All I was thinking was ""Am I going to see my son grow up?"" or ""Am I going to see him born?"" 'I’d had a lump on my neck for a couple of months before but I hadn’t really thought anything about it. I felt fine. 'Then I finally went to the doctor, he said ‘we’d better get it checked out’ and it turned out it was cancer. It’s hard to take in at first.' Since stopping treatment last month, Mr Cohen has been told is free of the thyroid cancer which spread to his tonsils. He is now just waiting for the final results, to confirm that the cancer has not spread to any major organs in his body. Radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy. The treatment uses a radioactive form of iodine called iodine 131 (I-131). The radioactive iodine circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream. Radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy, administered as a capsule or drink . Thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body. The radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells. Radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment. It doesn't affect other body cells, because only thyroid cells take up the iodine. The treatment is usually administered as a drink or capsule. Patients having radioactive iodine treatment in hospital are looked after in a single room until their radiation levels have fallen again. The treatment causes the patient to be slightly radioactive for a few days, so time spent with staff and visitors is minimal. Sweat and urine also become radioactive, so bedsheets are changed every day and patients have to flush the loo more than once. Pregnant women and young children will not be allowed to visit. Even 12 weeks after treatment, patients who have had radioactive iodine therapy may set offradiation alarms at airports.","Calvin Innes, 29, from Yorkshire, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent surgery on his throat two weeks before his son was born .

"By . Tom Latchem . Many people dream of winning the lottery and quitting work forever - but not rising soap star Danny-Boy Hatchard. Instead, the chirpy real-life cockney actor insists he wouldn't swap his dream role  as EastEnders' newest rogue Lee Carter for anything. 'Honestly, if you offered me a winning lottery ticket or the EastEnders job, I'd choose EastEnders,' he says. 'What am I going to do with money? I'd get bored and find a job anyway. And I like working on something I appreciate.' Dann-Boy says that all the money in the world couldn't make him leave his dream role on EastEnders . Danny-Boy, 22, set his sights on an acting career after taking part in a school production of Oliver!. Later, the working-class lad from east London took any job going while waiting for a break. 'I had every job under the sun,' he says. 'On building sites, in restaurants, pubs, a flower stall, gardening - anything to earn a bit of money.' While his parents, who split when he was very young, wanted him to become a carpenter or plumber, Danny-Boy wouldn't be dissuaded. 'I knew I'd get a break because I was persistent,' he says. 'I was willing to wait until my 50s.' Fortunately, he didn't have to. Danny-Boy - who says his family came up with the unusual name in a moment of bizarre spontaneity - won plaudits last year on the West End stage in Beautiful Thing, alongside Suranne Jones. Then this spring he was cast as squaddie Lee Carter, the on-screen son of his real-life acting hero Danny Dyer. Lee caused a stir from the start by bedding Lucy Beale before her murder. 'I grew up watching Lucy, but never thought I'd end up a suspect in her murder,' he says. Danny-Boy says his first scene with Mick and Linda Carter was pretty special and that working with a legend like June Brown is amazing too . The only person more pleased to hear that Danny-Boy had landed the job was his No 1 fan - mum Simone, who promptly burst into tears. This winter Danny-Boy will make his movie debut alongside Dyer's teenage daughter Dani in British gangster flick We Still Kill The Old Way, and admits he can't believe how his life is turning out. 'EastEnders is an amazing opportunity to learn from the greats - Danny Dyer, Timothy West, June Brown, Steve McFadden. I'm happier than I've ever been.' Despite his success, Danny-Boy - who says he'd prefer to keep his love life private - appears to have his feet on the ground. 'I have a normal life; friends and family treat me the same as they've always done.' Danny-Boy is using his raised profile to fight homophobia and regularly tweets on the subject. 'Where I grew up, being gay was unheard of and at school I was prejudiced,' he admits. 'When I was nine or ten I gave this lad a whack because he was gay - and he battered me! A few years later, after I'd grown up a lot, I apologised to him - and we've remained close friends since. Peer pressure can change you into someone you don't want to be, like a bully. I nearly became one until I was strong enough to see it was wrong. I was disappointed in myself but I learned from it. 'Then at drama school I was surrounded by people of all cultures and sexualities, which showed me how important it is to be true to yourself, and not care what others think. They taught me a lot; the least I can do now is stand up for equal rights.' Ideal holiday - Europe or America? America - I'd love to see some theatre in New York. Pub food or restaurant?

Heather Muller Kunf, 29, found the bodies of her mom Donna Muller, 49, and brother Rich Muller, 22, each with a gunshot wound to the back of the head at the family's Philadelphia home. Neighbors reported hearing screams coming from the row house in the quiet suburb of Lawncrest around 3pm on Sunday after Ms Muller Kunf entered the house. Scroll down for video . Rich Muller (pictured left) and his mother Donna Muller (right) were found with gunshot wounds to the head 'execution style' at their Philadelphia home by Ms Muller's devastated daughter . Heather Muller Kunf, 29, (pictured with her young daughter) found her mother and brother shot dead at the home they shared in a quiet Philadelphia neighborhood on Sunday afternoon . Donna Muller's body was found in her bedroom and her college graduate son was found in the hallway by the family's 29-year-old daughter. Ms Muller Kunf's young daughter Kaitlyn was not with her at the time. Each victim had one gunshot wound to the back of the head, according to KYW. Ms Muller Kunf discovered her mom and brother after returning home around 3pm from an overnight stay at her boyfriend's house. Ms Kunf had taken her young daughter along with her mother on a trip to Disney World just before Christmas. No suspects have been named but police had recovered a single shell casing from the home. Investigators believe a semi-automatic rifle was used in the killings . but found no sign of a forced entry that might suggest a robbery. A . murder suicide had also been ruled out. Donna Muller has been separated for many years from ex-husband Richard Muller, a convict with a violent past. ‘It's definitely a violent crime scene because you have two dead bodies that appear to be shot in the head,’ Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small told WPVI. ‘We don’t have a motive at this time,’ Chief Small told KYW. ‘However, we have several witnesses that were transported to homicide, and they’re being interviewed by homicide detectives right now.’ Ms Kunf found her 22-year-old brother dead along her 49-year-old mother at their home in Philadelphia after she had spent the night with her boyfriend .

A search of criminal records shows . ex-husband Richard Muller has a violent past including convictions for . aggravated assault, burglary and driving under the influence of alcohol . or a controlled substance. He served almost 15 years in prison for those crimes after a plea deal led to other charges of criminal mischief, criminal trespass, making terroristic threats, simple assault and recklessly endangering another person being dropped. Richard Muller was also convicted last year of public drunkenness. It is not clear what punishment was handed down for that conviction. He has not been named a suspect by police and a call by MailOnline to his Philadelphia home went unanswered. Devastated: Heartbroken relatives could be seen outside the home crying over the loss of the mother and son . Crime scene: The block was teeming with police as they investigated the double homicide . Neighbors reported hearing gunshots in the early hours in the quiet, mostly residential Lawncrest neighborhood in the northeast part of the city. Footage from the scene showed police had cordoned off the row house as crying relatives were seen being interviewed by homicide detectives. One neighbor said he heard gun shots overnight. ‘I just heard two pops,’ Peter Riley told WPVI. Another neighbor said his wife heard fighting in the early morning hours. ‘She said she heard a lot of banging and noise at 3:30 this morning,’ John Downey added. Donna Muller lived with her son and daughter in this Philadelphia home (center) Police have told neighbors they have no reason to be concerned for their safety but many are shaken up by the violent deaths. ‘It’s crazy, you know?

'God can turn a mistake to redirect you. He can use a hurdle blocking your path to put you on the right path. It is all part of His plan.' She also officially changed her Twitter bio to say 'Olympic bobsledder' after the happy news. Referring to her failed attempts to win gold on the athletics track, she added: 'It didn't make sense in 08 or 12 but who would have thought those mishaps would put me on the path to be a Winter Olympian. Scroll down for video . Happy: Lolo Jones, pictured, has been selected to compete for the United States at next month's Sochi Olympics . Twitter: Jones officially changed her Twitter bio, pictured, to say bobsledder after the happy news . 'Had I not hit a hurdle in Beijing I would not have tried to go to London to redeem myself. Had I not got fourth in London I would not have tried to find another way to accomplish the dream.' She said Bobsledding was her fresh start and the sport humbled her, made her stronger, made her hungry, made her rely on faith and gave her hope. 'I push a bobsled but bobsled pushed me to never give up on my dreams,' she wrote. 'I am honored and excited to say I am on the 2014 Winter Olympic Team. Thank you to all the fans who have encouraged me to never give up.' Fellow track star Lauryn Williams will join Jones on the U.S. team. They are now positioned to join a group of eight other Americans who have competed in both the Summer and Winter Games. Williams is a three-time summer Olympian who helped the U.S. win a gold medal in the 400-meter relay at the London Games. Jones is a two-time veteran of the summer games in the 100-meter hurdles, missing out on gold in Beijing after a late stumble. Bobsled: Jazmine Fenlator, front, and Lolo Jones of the United States start their race at the two-women Bob World Cup in Innsbruck, Austria, Sunday, January 19. 2014 . Athlete: Lolo Jones competed as a hurdler in two summer Olympic Games . Jones is in her second season of bobsledding, and recruited Williams to the sport last year. They will join Aja Evans, another Winter Olympic first-timer, as the push athletes in Sochi, along with drivers Jamie Greubel, Elana Meyers and Jazmine Fenlator. U.S. officials announced the selections Sunday night. 'This is the deepest field of push athletes we've ever had,' said Darrin Steele, the CEO of the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation. 'We knew heading into the season that the Olympic selection was going to be extremely difficult. It's a good problem to have, but it meant that some outstanding athletes would not make the Olympic team.' In short, the U.S. had five women who became de facto finalists for the three push spots. Evans was widely considered a lock to make the team after a series of strong performances, both on and off the track. Celebrations: Elana Meyers and Lolo Jones, right, pose on the podium after their winning second place during the FIBT Bob & Skeleton World Cup at Bobbahn Winterberg on January 5, 2014 in Winterberg, Germany . New sport: Jones, pictured, is in her second season of bobsledding . Williams was part of four World Cup races this season, winning two silvers earlier in the campaign and then teaming with Greubel for a gold medal on Sunday that surely made her resume look a whole lot better. 'I had no idea what was in store for me this season,' Williams said. 'I just wanted to come in with positive energy and help out. This is the first time I've been a part of a true team sport, and there's someone else counting on you. You can't let that person down, and that's what drives me. It's very important to give everything I have whenever I'm on that start line.' That seemed to leave Jones, Emily Azevedo and Katie Eberling as the candidates for the final spot on the push crew. Jones won silvers with Greubel and Meyers driving this season. Eberling also had a strong resume, with world championship medals in the past and three World Cup bronzes this winter. In the end, Jones was the call. The U.S. qualified three men's two-man sleds and two four-man sleds for Sochi. Reigning Olympic four-man champion Steven Holcomb will drive USA-1 and Nick Cunningham will be at the control of USA-2 in both disciplines, and Cory Butner will drive the third two-man entry. Holcomb and his crew of Curt Tomasevicz, Steve Langton and Chris Fogt will be USA-1. Holcomb snapped a 62-year U.S. gold medal drought in the four-man event at the 2010 Vancouver Games, and now will try to give the U.S. its first two-man gold since 1936. Justin Olsen, Johnny Quinn and Dallas Robinson will push Cunningham's four-man sled.","'Everything that happens has significance.

"By . James  Nye . and Louise Boyle . and Ryan Gorman . A woman described as a 'James Bond-style enforcer' before acquitted last year of the murder of a 21-year-old model is now suing the Santa Monica Police Department. Kelly Soo Park, 48, was found not guilty of murdering Juliana Redding and recently filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles accusing police of gross misconduct in the investigation that led to the first and second-degree murder charges brought against her. Ms Park accuses detective Karen Thompson of failing to investigate all leads in the case, intimidating witnesses and even accepting an award for solving the crime 18 months before the trial even began, according to the lawsuit detailed by CNS. She is seeking damages for the 'extreme mental anguish' she's suffered and the drop-off in business at a restaurant she co-owns as a result of salacious media coverage depicting her as having gotten away with murder, according to the Los Angeles Times. Scroll down for video . Relief: Kelly Soo Park wept as she was acquitted last year of the 2008 murder of model Juliana Redding in Los Angeles . 'Far from acting as an impartial law enforcement officer, defendant Thompson's bias against plaintiff, her resulting commitment to having plaintiff found guilty at trial at all costs... caused defendant Thompson to interfere with plaintiff's presentation of evidence in support of her criminal defense,' the suit claims. Redding was found strangled to death in her apartment in March 2008, the investigation eventually turned into a cold case before Thompson dug it back up. Thompson soon matched DNA found on the victim's body to Park, leading officials to charge her with murder. The detective then was given a Medal of Merit for solving the case - more than a year before it ever saw a jury. Park's lawsuit also claims Thompson didn't pursue leads in the case leading to Redding's ex-boyfriend John Gilmore - a man with a history of violence who had assaulted Redding and trashed her apartment several times, including the day before she was found dead, according to the suit. Beauty: Juliana Redding was murdered in her Santa Monica apartment in 2008 and DNA from a woman who prosecutors then alleged worked for her ex-boyfriend Dr. Uwaydah was found all over her home and on her neck . 'Despite this information, defendant Thompson persisted on pursuing plaintiff as the sole suspect of the crime,' the filing says. Further evidence potentially tying Gilmore to the murder was his lack of an alibi around the time she was killed and his treatment of another girlfriend. According to the lawsuit, Gilmore told police he left a party around 1 a.m., text messages on his phone prove he left at around 10:30 p.m. Melissa Ayala told investigators the violent man choked her at least three times, and each time made references to making her feel how Redding felt, the suit alleges. Ayala even agreed to testify to a grand jury about his assaults after he was convicted of domestic violence for the incidents, but Thompson convinced her, as well as two other witnesses, not to testify, said the suit. Thompson then waged a campaign to destroy the reputation of Park's then-fiance, a former local police chief, according to the suit. The jury took seven days to reach a verdict after extra questions from the jury including the difference between first and second-degree murder and a lengthier definition of second-degree murder. Park was accused of working as an enforcer for a Dr Munir Uwaydah, a physician who once dated Miss Redding, a cover girl for Maxim magazine. During that time, Uwaydah attempted to go into business with Miss Redding's father, Greg, an Arizona pharmacist. However, Greg Redding began his own . background check into the doctor and discovered that Uwaydah was lying . about his age, was married and had a family. On learning this, Juliana ended their affair and her father also stopped the business venture he planned with Uwaydah. Greg Redding sent Uwaydah a letter March 10 ending their business relationship - five days before his daughter was killed. Prosecutors . said that Uwaydah made six-figure payments to Park and her family . before the killing and before Park's arrest. They said he had also . bragged that he had a 'female James Bond' ready to act. It . took two years to discover a suspect in the murder and investigators . linked Park through DNA evidence found on Redding's neck. Accused killer: Kelly Soo Park had been charged with killing Redding with her bare hands . However, Park's attorney had questioned the evidence. 'Forensic . evidence, the DNA evidence, the fingerprint, are not conclusive. DNA . evidence doesn't tell you when it got there or how it got there,' said . George Buehler. The doctor was never charged in the case. He has since moved to Lebanon. Initial . reports at the time described a desperate struggle during which Miss . Redding had managed to dial 911 for help when her killer apparently . grabbed the phone and hung up . Investigators in the case said . that Park was linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on . Redding's neck, however, defense attorney's argued that the real killer . is Redding's boyfriend at the time of her death, John Gilmore. Gilmore . was cleared as a suspect in the immediate aftermath of the murder, . insisting that he had several people who could offer him an alibi according to CBS News.

The 525-foot ""living"" building has1 44,450sq metres of green space, and can provide locally grown food for nearby residents, as well as green space for them to enjoy. Project Height: Sky farm (160m) Hydroponic Farm (45m). Total Area: Sky farm (144,450 m2) Hydroponic Farm (13,350 m2). Areas: Hydroponic Farm, Botanic Garden, Viewing Deck, Cafeteria, Farmers Market, Water Filtration Facility, Renewable Energy Production Facility . 'The Urban Skyfarm is a vertical farm design proposal for a site located in downtown Seoul by the Aprilli Design Studio which mainly hosts local food production and distribution while at the same time contributes to the improvement of local environmental quality through water, air filtration and renewable energy production,' the designers say. 'By lifting the main food production field high up in the air, the vegetation gains more exposure toward the natural sunlight and fresh air while the ground level becomes more freed up with nicely shaded open spaces which could be enjoyed by the public', they claim. The design is based on a tree, and the four major components which are the root, trunk, branch and leaf each have their own special characteristics which are suitable for various farming conditions . For instance, while the upper portions provide open to air farming decks for medium based vegetations, the lower portions enclosed by the structural skin provide more controlled environments for solution based leafy productions. During daytime the photovoltaic panels generate electricity to be used for night time lighting and heating to support farming. 'The Urban Skyfarm creates a mini ecosystem which brings balance back to the urban community.' Howe it works: The structure includes hydrophonic gardens . The tower boasts gardens and parks for people to enjoy . The tower is designed to be built in Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea, and will provide fruit and vegetables for nearby residents. 'The Urban Skyfarm proposes to create an agricultural hub for the local community which hosts social, environmental and economical activities to enhance trade, improve the environment and benefit the local market and community.'

"By . Alex Greig . and Associated Press . When David Good was a child and people asked about his mother, he'd give them an answer he knew would preclude any further questions: she died in a car crash. In fact, his mother was alive and well, only instead of baking cookies and helping with homework, she was barefoot and mostly naked, with sticks coming out of piercings in her face, gathering grubworms and roasting boa constrictors deep in the Amazon jungle. Good's mother was never the suburban mom she tried to be. Her name is Yarima, and she is part of the Yanomami tribe from Venezuela. Scroll down for video . Worlds apart: David Good greets his mother Yarima of the Yanomami tribe after an absence of 19 years . 'I didn’t want my friends to know that my mom’s a naked jungle woman eating tarantulas,' Good told the New York Post. 'I didn’t want to be known as a half-breed. And it was my revenge; I was angry that she left me. So I just wanted to stick with the story that she was dead.' Good is one of three children born to Yarima and Kenneth Good, an anthropology professor who encountered the Yanomami more than 30 years ago as a student and returned so frequently that he was regarded as a part of the tribe. Kenneth Good was supposed to be there for 15 months, but instead became enamored of the culture and spent 12 years there, on and off. Along with his acceptance into the tribe, Kenneth Good was offered a wife. Although she was only in her early teens, Yarima was promised to Kenneth Good and the two were married. Kenneth Good eventually returned to the United States, bringing Yarima with him, but it wasn't easy. Everything . was alien to the young woman, who had to learn to count because the . entire Yanomami numerical system consisted one 'one,' 'two,' and 'many.' Having . never experienced any type of technology, she was confused and at times . frightened, believing cars to be ferocious animals and struggling . through English lessons. There . were discoveries too: Yarima loved traffic jams, gold chains, country . fairs and action films. Kenneth Good once had to cancel the family's . pay-per-view when he received a sizeable bill because Yarima had watched . Rocky V seven times. But . Yarima felt isolated, spending most of her time in the couple's . Rutherford, New Jersey, home watching TV, unable to communicate with . anyone but her husband. In . 1991, Kenneth Good made a deal with National Geographic to film a . documentary of the entire family returning to Venezuela, including David . and his younger siblings Vanessa and Daniel. Nuclear family: Yarima and Kenneth Good with two of their children David (left) and Vanessa (right) Adjustment: Yarima had to adjust to a Western way of life when she moved to New Jersey with Kenneth Good, a task that eventually proved too difficult . While they were there, Yarima made the painful decision not to return to the United States. David was just six. 'After two or three years, I began internalizing it as abandonment,' David Good told the New York Post. 'Sometimes I would bring Yarima up,' Kenneth said. 'And when I did - dead silence. I thought, ""Well, that’s strange.""' Once, when David was about 10 years old, his class took a field trip to the Museum of Natural History where he saw a blown-up photo of his mom, taken by his dad on the wall as part of a tribal exhibit. 'I just froze,' David Good told the New York Post. 'All the blood drained out of me. I ran to a dark corner and hid for 10 minutes.' Finally, after a tumultuous adolescence where he self-medicated with drugs and alcohol and internalized his pain over his mother, David Good read a book his father had written about his experiences with Yarima and the Yanomami tribe called Into the Heart. He was 20 and finally ready to hear his mother's side of the story. In 2011, he left to U.S. to visit the Yanomami. It had been 19 years since Good had seen Yarima. The East Stroudsburg University graduate student didn't know what to expect. Home: When David Good went to visit his mother, he didn't even know if she was alive and well, because the Yanomami don't have any contact with the world outside their tribe . Prior to that summer trip, it had been years since Good left the United States — the last time as a small child on the fateful trip in which he would lose his mother to her tribe. The trip to Venezuela involved two years of coordination. Once there, Good had to navigate the Orinoco River with a tour guide and translator, deep into the Amazonian rainforest, where few outsiders venture. Living so remotely, Yarima was cut off from all forms of modern communication, and therefore Good had no way of knowing if she was even alive. The trip changed Good's life. 'That trip was all about uncertainty,' David told the New York Post. 'I didn’t know if she would like me, or if I would like her, or if she would reject me.' When she emerged from the jungle, David recognized his mother's face immediately. He didn't hug or kiss her - it's not the Yanomami way - but he told her something he'd wanted to say for years. 'I said, ""Mama, I made it, I’m home. It took so long, but I made it.""' They both cried. Good, then 27, was exposed to a way of life he never experienced in the United States. He was struck by the bare-bones nature of the tribe. Everything in their lives — food, shelter, the baskets they weave and arrows they make — comes from the land. In the middle of the rainforest, without the distractions of technology and demands of a global society, there was only the 'simple essence of human communication,' Good explained. Good has since made it his mission to address the needs of indigenous groups like the Yanomami, and to educate the world about their way of life. 'I want to rectify the world's image of them. You still hear so many stereotypes, like they are ""primitive,""' Good said. Embracing heritage: Since he first revisited his mother, Good has become more and more enamored of the Yanomami way of life . Bridging the gap: In his unique position as a Western Yanomami, Good is helping to preserve the culture while bringing in necessities such as medicine . In August, he started The Good Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to these goals. The organization is part of ESU's Business Accelerator. In December, the group registered as a nonprofit in Pennsylvania, and it is applying for its 501(c)(3) status. In November, Good did make another return trip to the Amazon, staying in his mother's village, Irokai-Teri, for more than a month. He also took a weeklong trip to Costa Rica to study and visit with the Cabecar tribe, one of the most remote groups in Costa Rica. On May 24, he left for his first official trip with The Good Project, returning to the Cabecar village along with four ESU students to continue his outreach there. Right now, he plans to focus The Good Project's mission specifically on these two tribes. It's really difficult for remote populations such as the Cabecar and Yanomami to receive basic necessities like clothing and medicine. Good hopes to bring supplies to these groups, but also wants to help preserve the Cabecar and Yanomami way of life and find out exactly what the tribes' people need. He is interested in ethnography — staying with the tribes for an extended period of time to 'walk in their shoes' and learn about their daily struggles. While Good doesn't plan to spend as much time in the villages as his father did with the Yanomami, he would like to take extended trips between three to six months. Mother and son: The Yanomami have no word for love, but as Yarima gives her son David Good a haircut it's clear the pair are family . New beginnings: After a long separation, David Good (carried by father Kenneth Good) and his mother Yarima (left) are building a relationship . He also hopes to bring others with him, particularly people in the Poconos. The group of ESU students traveling to Costa Rica in May is a diverse one, 'which is exactly what I wanted,' Good said. The group consists of a nursing major, biology major, math major and computer science major. For an outsider, experiencing a third world culture for the first time is shocking, he said. 'As Americans, we just want to figure out how to go at them and solve them, but they aren't really poor in spirit,' Good said of the remote tribes. The tribes are free from many problems faced by modern society, such as depression, suicide and even diseases like cancer. In fact, Good says he feels happiest at home in the Amazon rainforest. 'I never felt any happier than being alone in my hammock, rocking next to the fire at the end of a hard day's work in the garden,' he said. 'They are self-sufficient, they just live with less.' When he's with his mother, he lives just as she does. 'My dad tells me not to walk around barefoot in my underwear, but I want to,' David says. He eats grub worms, termites, boa constrictors, monkeys, armadillo. 'I really want to be Yanomami,' David says. 'I want to trek through the jungle like they do.' He and Yarima are slowly building a relationship after so many years and a culture apart. 'It’s not like there’s closure,' David said. 'We’re at the beginning of our story, in so many ways.'","David Good saw his mother Yarima for the first time since he was six in 2011 .

And now he believes Xavi will be the third big name to leave, after Carles Puyol also ended his career with the Catalan giants. You're next: Xavi looks set to join Fabregas in quitting the Nou Camp during the transfer window . Close: The two midfielders are currently on international duty together with Spain . ‘Xavi and (Carles) Puyol have decided to step aside, to be closer to their families and to move to a less demanding environment,’ Fabregas told Spanish newspaper Marca. Xavi has been linked with a move to Qatari side Al-Sadd in recent weeks, with reports saying that the new Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is planning wholesale changes at the club ahead of next season. If he were to join Al-Sadd he would be linking up with his former Spain teammate Raul, who joined the Qatari club in 2012 after leaving Bundesliga side Schalke. Still got it: Despite claims Barcelona are becoming weaker, Xavi is still a star for club and country . Hands off: The midfielder could join Wesley Sneijder in exiting one of Europe's top leagues pre-retirement . The 34-year-old’s current deal at Camp Nou runs until 2016. Xavi has won seven Liga titles and three Champions League since making his first team debut for Barcelona in 1998 and has played more than 700 times for the Catalan giants.

"By . Ray Massey . More than one in five drivers say they have been penalised because they do not understand 'confusing' parking signs . More than one in five motorists have had their cars ticketed, clamped or towed away because of ‘confusing’ parking signs. Some drivers avoid trying to park in areas where the signs are most prevalent, the poll by car insurers Churchill found. More than four out of ten of the 2,001 people polled said parking signs in their area were confusing, while a third avoided parking in their local town or city centre for this very reason. Almost one in ten even don’t risk parking near their home because of confusing signs. More than a quarter say areas near their home have multiple restrictions in place on the same street and almost a third think signs in their local authority area do not clearly indicate to which area the restrictions refer. Drivers avoiding parking in town centres due to sign confusion was most rife in London where nearly half of motorists admitted not even attempting to park in the heart of the UK capital. The next most shunned town centres are in the north west of England, followed by the east of England and south east England. Wales and north east England are the areas where motorists are most happy to attempt to park in town centres. The study says that overall a fifth of motorists have received a parking fine in the past two years as a result of not understanding the parking restrictions in that area. Some one in 20 of those have been clamped and one in 25 have had their vehicle towed away over the same period, as a result of parking sign confusion. Some drivers have endured one or more of these. Clamping on private land was outlawed two years ago but is still legal in certain circumstances by local authorities, the Government’s DVLA and bailiffs. In London alone last year some 8,273 cars were clamped on-street by local authorities, of which 8,167 were in Kensington and Chelsea, which is also the biggest for car tow-aways at 6,524. Churchill Car Insurance head Steve Barrett said: ‘It’s the driver’s responsibility to check which parking restrictions are in operation in a particular area. ‘However, when there are multiple restrictions in operation on a single street, it can result in motorists being confused and unintentionally parking illegally, incurring fines that could have been avoided.’ The findings come in the week that ministers announced that the use of CCTV ‘spy cars’ to catch people who park illegally is to be curtailed. They will no longer be allowed to routinely send out automatic tickets. Some one in 20 have been clamped and one in 25 have had their vehicle towed away over the past two years as a result of parking confusion, according to a poll by insurers Churchill . Instead parking wardens will instead have to fix tickets directly to windscreens, making it illegal for councils to issue penalties to drivers using just the CCTV spy cars currently used for on-street parking enforcement. However, councils will still be able to use the CCTV to issue postal tickets for any offences that occur on critical routes, such as those near schools and bus lanes, bus stops and on 'red routes'. The partial ban is being introduced following a three month to rein in 'over-zealous parking enforcement practices', which the Government says has forced people to shop in out-of-town centres or online, and give motorists and local shops a ‘fairer deal’. Ministers say the move will rein in ‘greedy councils’ who use the method of fining as a ‘cash cow’, and bring to an end the “plague” of tickets being issued by post.","More than 40% said parking signs in their area were confusing, poll shows .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A nine-year-old girl has walked in to a police station and turned in her parents for growing and selling marijuana. The child calmly entered the station in Barnesville, Minnesota on June 6 and told officers that her parents were growing marijuana plants almost as tall as her in the crawl space beneath their home. She said she had decided to seek help because the smell of the pot smoke made her feel sick, and she also worried about her dog's health because her parents would blow smoke into its mouth. 'She was a . very brave, very smart, very articulate little girl,' officer Ryan . Beattie told the Minnesota Star Tribune. 'It was almost like interviewing an adult.

Authorities carried out a search on the home and all of their discoveries - including seven marijuana plants and drug paraphernalia - were exactly where the girl said they would be. They also allegedly found a substance that tested positive for meth at the scene, the Forum News Service reported.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . U.S. Scientists are working on next-generation combat wear for U.S. soldiers inspired by the nano suit worn in the Iron Man films . U.S. Scientists are working on next-generation combat wear for soldiers inspired by the nano suit worn in the Iron Man films and it could be used two or three years away. The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would effectively give its wearer superpowers, such as the ability to see in the dark, super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets, but its is a work in progress. The U.S. Special Operations Command (Ussocom) has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films that uses nanotechnology. Such a suit would probably build upon work done by an MIT professor who is developing 'liquid armour', which captured the imagination of U.S. armed forces scientists who are looking for a way of protecting their troops from intensive combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. At a conference in May, U.S. Navy Admiral Bill McRaven challenged scientists to build a suit that would function as a 'practical exoskeleton' and protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets using Kevlar and nanotechnology. He said that the suit should be light enough for soldiers to wear in battle but also suitable for surveillance missions and the idea has captured people's imaginations - as seen in the animated video below. Professor Gareth McKinley has been working on his 'liquid armour' technology for 11 years, which is focused on the flow of unusual materials, according to the University. His team's research is based on his understanding of how liquids can be elastic or solid in certain situations. Once fully developed, the armour could transform from a more liquid form to a solid in a fraction of a second under the influence of a magnetic field or electric current as well as being able to monitor a soldier's heart rate, hydration levels and core temperature, Dvice reported. It is thought a suit would respond to the data, supplied by an on-board computer hooked up to sensors, to keep a soldier in the best conditions for battle. Professor McKinley told NPR that the suit sounds like Iron Man. 'The other kind of things that you see . in the movies I think that would be more realistic at the moment would . be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Alien, . where it’s a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting . capability of a human,' he said. The request for super body armour for troops was announced following the death of a soldier in Afghanistan. He was reportedly trying to rescue a civilian but was shot from the other side of a door - but he might have survived if he had have been better protected by his clothing. A Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would effectively give its wearer superpowers, such as the ability to see in the dark, super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets, but its is a work in progress. Currently soldiers have relatively little protection and take cover in the face of fire and explosions (pictured) Ussocom has asked academics, entrepreneurs and private laboratories to submit white papers detailing how its Talos suit could be built and how they could help make their designs a reality, while other reports suggest that Google Glass could be utilised to provide soldiers with information on the battle field. Exoskelteons to give people super humans strength and night vision already exist, but the challenge is building the technology into a lightweight suit. Professor McKinley said the name of the suit - Talos - has been chosen deliberately as it is the names of the bronze armoured giant from Jason and the Argonauts. He said: 'Like all good superheros, Talos has one weakness. For the Army’s Talos, the weak spot is either the need to carry around a heavy pump for an hydraulic system, or lots of heavy batteries. We don’t have Iron Man’s power source yet!'","The U.S. Special Operations Command .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Victim: American Basra Hassan, of Hamtramck, Michigan was killed in a Friday terrorist attack while working for UNICEF in Kabul, Afghanistan . A 59-year-old American woman working for UNICEF has been identified as the second of three Americans killed in a terrorist attack on a Kabul cafe in Afghanistan Friday. Basra Hassan was born in Somalia but had eventually moved to the U.S. to study. She was working in  Afghanistan as a nutrition specialist for UNICEF, a United Nations agency focused on the welfare of children. Another UNICEF staffer, Dr. Nasreen Khan of Pakistan, also died. Afghan police said 13 . foreigners and eight Afghans died when a suicide bomber blew himself up . outside the Lebanese restaurant, which is popular with tourists, while . two gunmen entered through the back door and opened fire . Hassan was from the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. She had a master's degree from Eastern Michigan University. Hassan joined UNICEF in 2005, Sarah Crowe, a spokeswoman for the group, told The Associated Press on Sunday. Hassan had been working in Afghanistan since May 2010 after serving with the agency in Pakistan, Yemen and in southern Africa. Hassan and Khan were working 'in one of the most dangerous places in the world,' and one in which large numbers of children lack basic food needs, Crowe said. 'She was responsible ... for setting up clinics for the treatment and for the surveillance of malnutrition,' Crowe said. Hassan left Somalia for Kenya in the 1990s and then came to the U.S. to study in Michigan, Crowe said. Scroll down for video . Wounded: Police carry an injured victim from the scene of a suicide bombing in a restaurant in Kabul, Afghanistan . In Hamtramck Mayor Karen Majewski said she was reaching out to Hassan's relatives. 'Our sympathies and prayers go to her family, friends and colleagues,' Majewski told The Detroit News. 'It's a personal tragedy and a tragedy for the world to lose someone who was doing so much good. Hamtramck is proud of the work she did.' 'The depth of our shock and sorrow at receiving this news - and the magnitude of our outrage over this senseless violence - is difficult to measure,' UNICEF said in a statement. 'These colleagues were an integral part of the UNICEF team in Afghanistan ... who are dedicated to improving the lives of others and building a better, safer world for all.' A Chicago woman, 27-year-old Lexie Kamerman, was also killed in Friday's attack. The Taliban said they staged the attack in retaliation for an Afghan military operation earlier in the week against insurgents in Parwan province . Victim: Lexie Kamerman, a 27-year-old university student development specialist, was one of three Americans killed in a deadly suicide attack in Kabul which claimed 21 lives on Friday . Heartbreaking: The family of Lexie Kamerman, 27, described her as 'smart, strong, beautiful, funny, stubborn and kind' Kamerman had been working at the American . University of Afghanistan since June. Her family were devastated to . hear about her loss and described her as 'an amazing young woman - . smart, strong beautiful, funny, stubborn and kind. And fearless.' 'She took the job at the American . University of Afghanistan to help the young women of Afghanistan get an . education and take their rightful place as leaders in Afghan society,' the family's statement said. Kamerman completed a Masters in higher education at the University of Arizona in 2012 and was a keen water polo player. One of Kamerman's university colleagues was also killed in the blast, along with a U.S. victim identified by the United Nations as a Somali-American. Two Canadians, one from Quebec and the other from Ontario, were also killed. The Samson and Associates employees were in the Afghan capital doing auditing work for the Canadian International Development Agency. 'This is the first time that we've ever had such a thing,' company chief Pierre Samson said, explaining that his firm has done work in Afghanistan for some time. 'As auditors we're not on the front so we don't usually go where it is very dangerous, but in a case like this the attack was directly in town, so it was not in a danger area. But unfortunately we were there at a bad time.' Scene: More than 20 people died when explosives were detonated at the gate of the popular La Taverna du Liban restaurant, a Lebanese eatery popular with tourists . European Parliament election hopeful: Labour leader Ed Miliband  confirmed that Del Singh, right, who had been campaigning to become MEP for the South West, was killed in a suicide attack in Kabul . Samson said he was given the news Friday evening by the Canadian embassy in Kabul. He didn't identify the men because his firm is still trying to get in touch with family members. Others identified were two Britons - development specialist Dharmender Singh Phangura, also known as Del Singh, and close protection officer Simon Chase - two Lebanese, a Danish police officer, a Russian, a Malaysian and a Pakistani. Phangura, who along with the Malaysian worked as an adviser for Adam Smith International, was to run as a Labour Party candidate in upcoming elections for the European Parliament. Also among the dead were the International Monetary Fund's Lebanese representative, Wabel Abdallah, and Vadim Nazarov, a Russian who was the chief political affairs officer at the U.N. Mission in Afghanistan. Nazarov was one of the U.N's most experienced officials, fluent in the country's languages and with experience dating back to the 1980s. He was one of three U.N. victims. Operation: Afghan security forces arrive at the scene of the explosion in the capital, Kabul . The attack comes as security has been deteriorating and apprehension has been growing among Afghans over their country's future as U.S.-led foreign forces prepare for a final withdrawal at the end of the year. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who is deferring signing an agreement allowing U.S. forces to stay past the planned withdraw until after the country's April 5 presidential election, criticized America while condemning the attack. 'If NATO forces and in the lead the United States of America want to cooperate and be united with Afghan people, they must target terrorism,' he said without fully elaborating on what America should be doing. He added that America had followed a policy that 'was not successful in the past decade'. Order: A solider organises his colleagues in the street outside the restaurant in the Afghan capital . Police: Armed officers surround the scene after the bombing. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack an hour later . Meanwhile, the attack was condemned by the U.N. Security Council, NATO, the White House and the European Union. 'There is no possible justification for this attack, which has killed innocent civilians, including Americans, working every day to help the Afghan people achieve a better future with higher education and economic assistance,' the White House said in a statement on Saturday. Insurgents have frequently targeted foreign interests around the country and in Kabul. However Friday's horrific blast has been described as . the deadliest single attack against foreign civilians in the course of a . nearly 13-year U.S.-led war. Treatment: Kebab cook Abdul Majid is stretchered into the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital following the deadly attacked . Survived: The cook witnesses the attacked and was left with broken bones as he fled the scene . The . Taliban claimed responsibility within an hour of the attack, which was . said to be part of a stepped-up campaign of violence against foreign and . government interests. It . is believed the extremists are trying to send a message that they are . not going anywhere as the involvement of foreign troops winds down this . year. The attack was carried out at a time when the restaurant would have been busy with diners. The suicide attacker detonated his explosives outside the gate of the heavily-fortified restaurant, the country’s Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said. Then two gunmen entered the restaurant and started shooting at survivors inside. The attackers were eventually shot dead by security forces when they arrived at the scene. The area is home to a number of foreign embassies and organizations. Jan Kubis, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, said: 'I strongly condemn condemn the targeting of civilians in any form, and, in particular, the continued use of suicide bombers. 'This violence is unacceptable and must stop immediately.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has said she believes it is okay for women to cry at work, to share emotions and be honest about their femininity. Sandberg has gained international recognition following the publication of her best-selling book 'Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead' which talks about women's struggles in the male-dominated workplace and advises women to 'lean in' to reach their true potential. Her forthright opinions have earned her both an army of admirers and a host of critics. She has been praised for articulating a new modern feminist vision and lambasted by others as an over-privileged multimillionaire out-of-touch with the average working woman. Sheryl Sandberg COO of Facebook has said she believes it is okay for women to cry at work . In an interview with India's Mint on Saturday, the 43-year-old admitted that: 'I cry at work,' adding women are not 'one type of person Monday through Friday' and 'then a different person in the nights and weekend.' 'I think we are all of us emotional beings and it's okay for us to share that emotion at work,' said Facebook's number two, who has a personal fortune of $500 million. In her book, Sandberg admits to having cried on Mark Zuckerberg’s shoulder at work and writes that 'sharing emotions build deeper relationships.' But she also admitted that there has to be a cutoff point. ' I am not recommending that if anyone wants to get promoted, then go out and cry,'  said the executive, who was named in Time magazine's 2013 list as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Out of touch? Sandberg is estimated to be worth upwards of $500 million . Discussion topic: Sandberg's tome sparked controversy when it hit the shelves in March . 'What I am recommending is that as we think about being good colleagues, being good workers, being good employers, we ask people ""how do you feel"", not just how you think because so many of our decisions are based on how we feel,' she said. Sandberg, who is married with two young children, said on the subject of her book 'the messages of believing in yourself and sitting at the table, getting compensated fairly, those can happen at any point in your career.' The question of whether women can 'have it all' in terms of pursuing careers and raising families is 'very problematic', added Sandberg, who got $26.2 million in salary, bonus and shares last year from the US social networking giant. Last month Sandberg stood up for another senior female tech executive when she delivered a withering response to the media's coverage of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's decision to order stay-at-home employees back to the office. Labeling the reporting sexist, Sandberg was delivering a lecture at Stanford University to promote her book. 'It is really hard to know what is happening at Yahoo. There have been no public statements. But the scrutiny, the media firestorm, is about her being a woman. Full Stop,' said Sandberg. Comparing a similar decision at . electronic giant Best Buy to stop telecommuting, she said, 'When . it's a man, no one pays attention.' Sheryl Sandberg said last month that if a man had declared the end of working-from home at Yahoo instead of Marissa Mayer (right) it would have been a non-issue . In . February, Mayer released a staff memo requesting that all remote . employees report to office facilities by June 1, saying: 'Speed and . quality are often sacrificed when we work from home... We need to be one . Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together.' Her . employees' unhappiness appeared to be compounded by the fact that . Mayer, 37, recently built a nursery adjoining her Silicon Valley office, . so that she could spend more time with her son who was born in . September. Sandberg’s comments during her . lecture were designed to support 'Lean In: Women, Work and the Will To . Lead', which was published in March. In . the book, which falls between a memoir and career guidance for women, . Sandberg says that women can succeed in the corporate sphere with a . combination of good fortune, hard work and help from other people - but . that they need to be more ambitious. 'I'm a pragmatist. I think, as a . woman, you have to be more careful. You have to be more communal, you . have to say yes to more things than men, you have to worry about things . that men don't have to worry about,' said Sandberg, whose book quickly . topped the New York Times Best Sellers List. Sisterhood: Sheryl Sandberg (left) said in a . Time interview published in March that her friend and Yahoo! CEO . Marissa Mayer (right) came under fire for making stay-at-home workers . return to the office because she is a woman . 'But once we get enough women into leadership, we can break stereotypes down. If you lead, you get to decide.' Lean In draws from Sandberg's own anecdotes as she climbed the corporate ladder, first at Google and then Facebook, to become one of the most powerful women in the tech industry. She writes about a moment when a group of all-male financiers were unable to tell her where the female toilet was because nobody had ever asked for it. In the book she urges women not to 'lean back' when it comes to their lives, but to 'lean in' - give it 100% in all areas of their life - so they can 'have it all.' Sandberg, who has two degrees from Harvard, has not helped herself with controversial speeches in which she has said: ‘The moment a woman starts thinking about having a child, she doesn’t raise her hand anymore.' She worked at Google and consultants McKinsey before joining Facebook in 2008 where she has been credited with driving the growth of the business. According to the company's SEC filing, she earned $31million in 2011, including stock options, making her one of the highest paid female executives in the U.S.","The Facebook COO believes women should be free to share their emotions at work .

"By . Glen Owen . The family of the former BBC journalist whose imprisonment in Egypt has sparked global outrage made an impassioned plea last night to Tony Blair to use his relationship with the country’s dictator to secure the reporter’s release. Australian Peter Greste, 49, was one of three journalists with broadcaster Al-Jazeera who were jailed for seven years for spreading ‘false news’ helpful to the opposition Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian government, headed by the President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, has ignored worldwide condemnation over the jailings. But last night, sources close to Mr Blair said he was working behind the scenes to secure the journalists’ release. Former BBC journalist Peter Greste pictured in the defendant's cage as he listened to the chilling verdict . The news came after Mr Greste’s brother Andrew asked Mr Blair – who is advising President al-Sisi on the economy – to use his influence. ‘I would like to think that in any meetings Mr Blair has with al-Sisi he raises Peter’s case and does everything he can to help not just Peter and his colleagues but all journalists whose right to free speech has been compromised,’ Andrew told The Mail on Sunday. Mr Greste’s father, Juris, added: ‘Let’s hope that with Blair’s involvement we can make some progress in the right direction.’ Human rights groups have criticised the convictions as a ‘witch-hunt’ to silence journalists in the crisis-ridden country. Mr Blair’s involvement with al-Sisi has proved highly controversial, with even the Labour-supporting Guardian saying: ‘Blair embodies corruption and war... now he’s advising the Egyptian dictatorship, his removal as Middle East peace envoy is a moral and democratic necessity.’ As The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year, Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s former spin chief, has been to Cairo to advise the Egyptian government on its public image.","Former PM asked to intervene to help get Australian Peter Greste released .

"By . Simon Walters . Rebekah Brooks faced fresh controversy last night, 12 days after she was cleared of all charges in the phone hacking scandal. The Mail on Sunday has learned of an alleged attempt to meddle in the appointment of Britain's top policeman – who was later forced to resign over his links to the former News of the World and The Sun editor. Sir Paul Stephenson stood down as Metropolitan Police Commissioner in July 2011, hours after Mrs Brooks's arrest on phone hacking charges. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson succeeded Sir Ian Blair . He admitted that he had employed former News of the World executive Neil Wallis as an aide and had enjoyed a free £12,000 stay at a health farm which employed Mr Wallis as a public relations adviser. An investigation by this newspaper has established that when Sir Paul was appointed by then Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a senior News International figure – not Mrs Brooks or Mr Wallis – secretly told No 10 that Mrs Brooks did not want Sir Paul's main rival, Sir Hugh Orde, to get the job. Sir Hugh's hopes of getting the role had been hit when the News of the World revealed he had an illegitimate child from an affair with an undercover policewoman. Rebekah Brooks was acquitted of all charges at the Old Bailey . They are the latest developments in a long-running controversy over Mrs Brooks's relationship with the police, including the loan to her of a Metropolitan Police horse, Raisa, which was also ridden by her friend and Oxfordshire neighbour, Prime Minister David Cameron. Mrs Brooks and her husband, the racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, were cleared of all charges in the phone hacking trial, which ended nearly two weeks ago. No charges were ever laid against Mr Wallis. The new disclosures date back to the battle to succeed Sir Ian Blair as head of London's police in 2009, which came down to a contest between Sir Hugh and Sir Paul. Racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks was cleared of all charges in the phone hacking trial, which ended nearly two weeks ago . The Mail on Sunday has been told that shortly before Sir Paul was appointed, a News International representative contacted No 10 and said Mrs Brooks was opposed to Sir Hugh getting the post. 'The message was very clear. She did not want Hugh Orde to be the Met Commissioner, and she wanted that message conveyed to the PM,' said a well-placed source. Sir Paul got the job after he was backed by then Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, London Mayor Boris Johnson, and Mr Brown. There is no suggestion that his appointment was influenced by the News International approach. London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) stands with Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith outside New Scotland Yard after Sir Ian Blair stepped down as Commissioner in October 2008 saying that he did not have the support of Mayor Johnson . Sir Ian Blair and Boris Johnson. Sir Ian resigned after he said that Mayor Johnson did not have confidence in him . Sir Hugh had long been tipped as a future Commissioner after winning praise for his role in the inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, improving police relations with ethnic minorities and his record as head of the Northern Ireland police force. But his hopes suffered a major setback in 2007 when the News of the World revealed that he had an illegitimate child. The story appeared two weeks after Andy Coulson, jailed last week for phone hacking, stepped down as editor following a previous phone hacking scandal. Mrs Brooks was News of the World editor until 2003 when she became editor of The Sun. She was chief executive of News International, which owned both papers, from June 2009 to 2011. Mr Wallis was News of the World deputy editor from 2003 to 2007 and executive editor from 2007 to 2009. In his resignation statement, Sir Paul said that he had known Mr Wallis since 2006 and that the Metropolitan Police hired him as an adviser from 2009 to 2010. The News of the World story in 2007 which revealed the extra marital affair involving Sir Hugh, then head of Ulster's police force, said: 'Loverat top cop Hugh Orde last night pleaded guilty to... adultery. His three-year affair with a pretty Detective Constable led to the birth of a secret son.' It said a 'pal' of the lovers had revealed details of the affair and added: 'What the news of his existence will do for Sir Hugh's career is anyone's guess. Sir Hugh Orde: News of the World ran a story about his illegitimate child . 'The fact he's got a secret son tucked away in the Home Counties does not look good on the CV.' In September 2007, the News of the World was also first to report the affair had led to the end of his marriage. It said: 'Sir Hugh, tipped to be the next Met Police boss, broke up with wife Kathleen months after she found out about his affair.' A source close to Sir Hugh said: 'It is staggering that anyone from News International might attempt to influence the appointment of the country's most senior policeman. Sir Hugh is fiercely independent and would have run the Met in that manner.' Mr Brown could not be contacted. Sir Paul and Mrs Brooks declined to comment. A source close to her denied that she urged Mr Brown to block Sir Hugh.","Sir Paul Stephenson stood down as .

"By . Nick Craven And Robert Verkaik . Secret justice – of the kind that kept Rolf Harris’s name out of the media for weeks after his arrest and could have undermined the case against him – has become the norm across England and Wales, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Not one of the 43 police forces will issue the name of an arrested person to the press, while only a small minority will even confirm a suspect’s name when it is put to them by journalists, our survey showed. Anti-secrecy campaigners have repeatedly warned that many historical abuse cases may never come to court or be successfully prosecuted unless names are issued on arrest. Failing to name suspects also stops other victims from coming forward. Scroll down for video . Rolf Harris's lawyers battled to stop The Mail On Sunday reporting that the paedophile had been questioned by police on sex charges . Yesterday it emerged that more women came forward yesterday to claim they were also indecently assaulted by Harris. One of the alleged victims, all from New Zealand, was aged nine at the time. Many of the women say they had been encouraged to come forward after Maggie Barry, a New Zealand MP, revealed on Friday that she was touched by Harris when she was interviewing him in the 1980s. She told him he was a ‘sleazy creep’ after his hand slid up her thigh. New Zealand politician Maggie Barry recalled how 'sleazy creep' Rolf Harris groped her when she was a radio reporter . Since the revelation, her office has received eight emails and four phone calls from those with similar stories. The Mail on Sunday found that only six forces – or 14 per cent – will give confirmation or guidance to journalists when a suspect’s name is put to them. After Harris was arrested in March 2013, his lawyers, Harbottle & Lewis, initially threatened the press with ‘consequences’ if he was named, claiming the public interest would not be served by doing so. Yet after he was named the following month, a dozen witnesses came forward with their own stories of abuse, which helped to convict  Harris, 84, on 12 counts of indecent assault last week at Southwark  Crown Court. Peter Watt, NSPCC director of national services, said: ‘If a suspect’s name is not known, the case against them may collapse through lack of witnesses, potentially putting children at risk of harm.’ One of the Leveson Report’s most controversial recommendations on press reform was that the names of arrested suspects should ‘not be released to the press or public’. In May 2013, the College of Policing and the Association of Chief Police Officers issued guidelines to forces that enshrined these proposals. Jodie Ginsberg, of campaigning group Index on Censorship, said this newspaper’s findings raised serious concerns. ‘Such sweeping powers  are maybe appropriate in rare cases but should not be the norm. De facto anonymity in arrests is completely against the principle of open justice in the UK,’ she said. We asked all 43 police forces in England and Wales and received 33 responses. Some said their policy on naming suspects had not changed since Leveson; others that it had been reviewed. For most, a suspect will only be named in ‘exceptional circumstances’. Six forces – Derbyshire, Humberside, Kent, Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Wiltshire – said they would sometimes confirm a suspect’s name or reveal if a name was wrong.","After Leveson, not one of the 43 police forces will issue name of an arrested person to the press .

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson . Hanif Kureishi lost £120,000 when he was conned by a fraudster with a love for the glamorous lifestyle depicted in James Bond films . Hanif Kureishi was on his way to meet a friend for lunch when the call came. It was one of the partners from the author’s accountancy firm. ‘He said, “Your accountant, Adam Woricker, has been sacked. Your money’s gone, you’d better call your solicitor.” I was staggered.’ The 59-year-old, best known for his novel The Buddha Of Suburbia and the screenplay for hit film My Beautiful Laundrette, is a master storyteller but even he could not have predicted the drama that has unfolded since that fateful call in July 2012. Kureishi had invested £120,000 in a property scheme at the suggestion of Woricker, a partner with Fisher Phillips, a reputable North London accountancy firm. Woricker seemed conscientious, hard working and utterly dependable. In reality, he was a conman. A tubby 41-year-old who was obsessed with James Bond, he stole £2.4 million from clients, family and friends – partly to impress his Albanian wife whom he had married in secret. Fisher Phillips denied any knowledge of Woricker’s actions, meaning the money – which Kureishi had set aside for his three sons’ education – had gone. Last Wednesday, Woricker pleaded guilty to 34 theft and fraud offences at Chelmsford Crown Court and was jailed for eight years. Recalling his first meeting with Woricker in January 2011 at his home in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, Kureishi says: ‘He was an East End boy, very clever, glasses, small, sweet, charming, very bright. ‘Everybody said he was really good at his job, knew the law, knew accountancy. ‘Fisher Phillips was a respected firm that had been around for years so there was no reason why you would have any suspicions. ‘Having an accountant is like  having a doctor or a solicitor. You expect them to be decent people – not complete lunatics who are going to steal all your money.’ So when, in September that year, Woricker told him about an investment opportunity, Kureishi had no reason to doubt him. It was a short-term investment, over 120 days, and promised a return of 15 per cent. Criminal accountant Adam Woricker was aiming for a dream lifestyle as depicted in the James Bond films . The author invested £50,000 and after receiving a payment of £7,500 on that initial deposit, he put in a further £70,000. He says: ‘I don’t have any interest in money or know anything about it. It’s like putting a car in a garage. You expect, when you pick it up, it will work and you don’t have to know all the details.’ But there was no property deal, only a woman and spiralling debts. Unbeknown to his family, Woricker had married Florentina Blacku in 2009. Bizarrely, the court heard the union was not consummated. Meanwhile, during their marriage, Florentina went back to Albania three times, each time coming back pregnant by her ex-boyfriend. Yet Woricker remained besotted. According to former schoolfriends, he was teetotal with a modest lifestyle, living in his grandmother’s old house in the grounds of his parents’ home in Woodham Ferrers, Essex. But in court it emerged he had spent thousands of pounds on Florentina, taking her on shopping sprees and splurging on luxury hotels. ‘He seemed the sort of guy who was very sexually inexperienced,’ says Kureishi. ‘He was a little fat, rather unattractive. Presumably he’d met this young woman and never had much fun before. ‘He liked Ian Fleming and had lots of James Bond memorabilia, which is not a good sign in a grown man. Adam Woricker pleaded guilty for fraud against Hanif Kureishi at Chelmsford Crown Court . Particularly a small chubby accountant who fancied himself as some sort of criminal.’ But when, in May 2012, Kureishi discovered his account had been emptied, it didn’t occur to him to suspect Woricker. ‘I was at the Halifax and tried to transfer some money. They said I hadn’t got any. I said, “Where’s it gone? I was only in here yesterday putting some money in,” and they replied, “Oh no, you’ve taken it all out. You went to this branch and you signed here, we had your driving licence and you’ve taken all the money out.” ‘I knew the money had been transferred so I went into the Nationwide next door, where I’ve never had an account, and asked if they had an account in the name of Hanif Kureishi. They said yes. I said, “Well, I’m Hanif Kureishi, can I have the details?” And they said, “We’re not sure you’re him, he was in here yesterday.” I gave them my ID and they said, “Well, he had ID.” ‘The first person I rang was my accountant and he said, “how terrible”. I asked him to come down and he replied he would if he could but he couldn’t make it. ‘I remember my ex-girlfriend saying the only person with access to my driving licence was my accountant. Even then I didn’t think it was him. I thought maybe someone broke into my house and copied it.’ With the fraud – if not the culprit – exposed, the money was back in his Halifax account the next day. Hanif Kureishi's most famous novel is The Buddha of Suburbia and has been translated into 20 languages . But then two months later, Woricker was fired from Fisher Phillips, and Kureishi discovered he’d lost £120,000 in investments. Yet Woricker insisted to Kureishi and his tens of other victims that he was going to get their money back. He says: ‘He claimed it hadn’t been stolen but misplaced. ‘As a writer, I was fascinated by the crime – that Graham Greene thing. Indeed, Greene was swindled by his accountant. ‘And I was fascinated by him. He was such a bizarre character. He was bettering himself. ‘He’d come from a semi-rural proletarian background in Essex. He was working with writers, had a huge 4x4 car, a big income. So the idea that he would make a bit more by risking everything was crazy. It was so destructive, so idiotic. The truth is, I think he was bipolar. He got really, really manic, he wasn’t sleeping, he was running around, moving money here there and everywhere. It was a kind of mania. When I met him, he was turning bad.’ Woricker was arrested and charged in March 2013. Even then, Kureishi continued to see him. ‘He was very smart. By the end I wanted to kill him. One day, he suddenly looked at me and said, “You can’t kill me. People have been coming to the house trying to kill me in the last few days and the police have offered me protection.” ‘By then I think he’d got involved with other criminals and there were quite heavy people chasing him. I do believe he was working really hard to get the money back – that was his only hope, if he could go to the judge and say I’ve got it all back.’ Kureishi also wrote the screenplay for the film My Beautiful Laundrette, featuring Daniel Day-Lewis (right) And his victims’ only hope too. With Fisher Phillips denying all responsibility, their only option was to take legal action. Kureishi says: ‘All your money’s gone, then you’re speaking to solicitors who are charging £500 an hour, who all say you’re going to have to sue the accountants and by the end you’re going to have to get a barrister and it’s going to cost you £25,000. You fall into a pit of horror thinking, “Not only have I lost £100,000, I’m going to have to spend £50,000 to get this back and I may not win.” ’ The author eventually reached a settlement with the firm a few months ago. He says: ‘There are people far worse off than me who have lost everything. ‘The accountants behaved very badly. Adam was a criminal and that’s that. You can’t expect him to be a nice fella. They were not.’ Fisher Phillips partner Robert Ward said: ‘Adam Woricker was not acting on behalf of Fisher Phillips but in a personal capacity. ‘He acted without our knowledge. We have every sympathy for those who, like ourselves, were affected by the thefts and frauds.’","Critically acclaimed author lost £120k at the hands of conman accountant .

"By . Snejana Farberov . When she was seven years old, Diana Markosian was taken away from her father after her parents' divorce and whisked away to Southern California. The 25-year-old award-winning photographer had spent 15 years trying to reconnect with her father, until finally last year she showed up on his doorstep in Armenia. Six months later, Markosian moved in with her long-lost dad in order to try and rebuild their relationship. Scroll down for video . Gaping hole: This is the closet thing Diana Markosian (pictured center as a toddler) had to an image of her father - a cutout of him in her mother's photo album. In her own words: Markosian, 25, an award-winning photojournalist, wrote of her long-lost dad (pictured): 'As a little girl, my father felt like a secret being kept from me.  When I would ask my mother about him, she would tell me he was gone' Broken home: When Diana was seven years old growing up in Moscow, her parents divorced and soon after the girl moved to California with her mother and brother, leaving their dad behind . Markosian, a 2010 graduate of Columbia University School of Journalism, documented her journey in a series of thought-provoking photographs collectively titled 'Inventing My Father.’ In a first-person account originally written for the New York Times last month, Markosian, who is currently based in Chechnya, looked back on the day in October 1996 when her life changed forever. Diana, her brother and their mother were barely making ends meet living in Moscow after the divorce, with the family having to collect bottles in exchange for food. Then one morning, Markosian's mother told her two children that they were going on a trip. The following day, the Markosians were in Southern California. The 7-year-old girl never got to say goodbye to her father who was left behind. Diana's mother marked the end of her marriage marred by her husband's frequent and prolonged absences by cutting him out of every family photo in their albums. Turning back time: Markosian's father inscribed an old photo of his daughter in Russian: 'I am searching for the little girl in her, the little girl I used to know. The one I was close to. In myself, I am looking for the remains of those feeling I once had for her' Precious mementos: A suitcase belonging to Diana's grandfather filled with undelivered letters, a newspaper clipping and a shirt for her brother's wedding . Touching the past: Diana also got to meet her 90-year-old grandfather, a painter whose works still hang in her father's apartment in Armenia . Diana eventually forgot how he looked, but every time she saw a plane in the sky over their home, she would imagine that her father was on his way to her. Diana Markosian knew very little about her father growing up. From the morsels of information grudgingly shared by her mother, she learned that he was a writer who enjoyed reading Vladimir Nabokov and wanted her to grow up to be a dancer. Diana ached for her absent father's approval, so she studied ballet for eight years until an injury at age 16 brought her dream of becoming a dancer crashing down. It was not until she entered Columbia University School of Journalism to study writing that she picked up her first camera. She eventually went on to a successful career as a photojournalist covering the Caucasus region, Afghanistan and Myanmar. In 2013, some 15 years after she became separated from her father, Diana Markosian and her brother traveled halfway around the world to Armenia and knocked on the door of the same apartment they remembered from growing up. What Diana found inside her estranged parent's home was a time capsule containing her long-forgotten childhood: family pictures, her brother's old toys and her elderly grandfather's oil paintings hanging on the walls. Dreams from her father: Diana Markosian grew up hating her father and lying to friends that he has died. In 2013, she sought him out and came face to face with a man who did not resemble the father she had created in her imagination . Two of a kind: The 25-year-old photographer admitted that she and her father share many traits, like the desire to be alone and creativity - but she still cannot call him 'papa' Family history: Diana's father moved from Moscow back to his native Armenia to take care of his father after his mother died . In a video made in 2013 for the organization World Press Photo, Diana confessed that having been brought up by her mother to hate her ex-husband, she was filled with anger and shame when she came face to face with him for the first time in 15 years. ‘Photography gave me strength,’ she said. ‘When I wanted to leave, I knew i had to stay.’ The father and daughter looked at old family photos and reminisced about the past - both good and bad. Getting to know her father was a jarring experience for the young woman: here before her stood a flesh-and-blood man who bore no resemblance to the father figure she had invented for herself. Growing up in California, she used to lie to her friends that her father died when she was a child because she was overcome with shame. And yet the 25-year-old photojournalist was interested in getting to know her dad - and he too was eager to make a real connection with his daughter. Diana wrote: 'Fifteen years later, I found my father standing just how I left him. In a doorway, neither fully in or out of my life' Sibling envy: Miss Markosian said photography helped her deal with the pain of seeing his father dote over his young daughter from a second marriage . Young and in love: An old home video shows Diana's parents as college sweethearts in Armenia - years before their bitter breakup . The two would have long, intimate conversations about the past and the present on their morning runs, during which Diana’s father would talk to her about his writing and his thoughts and feelings. ‘There were other moments, as well — times outside of our runs,’ she wrote. ‘The night he shared his poetry with me. The evening at the symphony when he snuck in chocolates for us. We ate them in the dark.’ The two also bonded over the photos that she was taking. Diana and her father would sit together for hours as she edited her work and discuss the images at length. But Diana Markosian often felt awkward around her dad: sometimes when he would move in for a hug, she instinctively pulled away, not quite knowing how to interact with this stranger who gave her life. ‘I keep looking for him. I think I always will,’ Diana wrote. For the 25-year-old, it was also painful to meet her father’s second family, including his baby daughter, and see the lanky grey-haired man who had abandoned her dote over his toddler. ‘It's not done yet - it won't be done for another 10 years,’ Miss Markosian said of her intimate photo project. ‘It's my life.'

"By . George Osborne . Moving portrait: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tells the story of his great-uncle and grandfather . As dusk fell at 6pm  on March 21, 1918, Derrick Osborne, a 20-year-old Lieutenant in the Durham Light Infantry, was killed. He was shot running across the Morchies Road, in Northern France, in a last-ditch attempt to reinforce his battalion’s right flank and stop it being surrounded by advancing German soldiers. Or so we think. It was certainly the last time he was seen alive. My great-uncle’s body was never found. He was billed as ‘missing’, and it was not until a full year later, in March 1919, that his distraught family put a notice in their local newspaper, the Sussex Express, accepting he had died and would never return. Derrick Osborne was killed after almost two years on the Western Front, and at the end of a long, desperate day of fighting that had started with gas shells raining down on his trenches at 5am. All day the fighting had raged, as wave upon wave of enemy troops pushed the Durham Light Infantry further and further back. It was the first day of the great German Spring Offensive of 1918 known  as the Kaiserschlacht, or Kaiser  Battle, that was designed to deliver the decisive blow that would end the war in the crucial months between the exit of the now-revolutionary Russians and the arrival in strength of the Americans. After the initial breakthrough, the German advance continued for a further seven days and 16 miles until, having over-run the town of Albert, they reached the River Ancre. There, the Royal Sussex Regiment were the latest group of exhausted British soldiers who had been ordered to try to stop them, and had hastily dug some trenches in Aveluy Wood,  on the other side of the river, from which to mount their defence. There was bitter fighting, and the Royal Sussex were pushed back through the wood – but they managed to hold on. The German advance ground to a halt – and it was the furthest point that the spring offensive reached. The man who helped to command those troops in that final defensive was Derrick’s brother, Major George Osborne – my grandfather. Sadly, I never met my grandfather. Born in 1894, he was a quiet professional soldier from East Sussex who, before Aveluy Wood, had already been wounded twice in action and mentioned in dispatches. Family history: Derrick Osborne, a 20-year-old Lieutenant, was killed in the Kaiserschlacht in 1918, the same battle where his brother Major George Osborne –  George Osborne's grandfather - commanded troops . That day, in 1918, he was to win the Military Cross for his bravery. During my childhood, his silver MC with its white and purple ribbon and ‘Aveluy Wood, 1918’ engraved on the back, stared down at me from a display  case in my home. Alongside it sat the large bronze memorial plaque that commemorated the sacrifice of his younger brother.  It was one of 1,335,000 such plaques, or a Dead Man’s Penny as they were called, that were issued. I have always looked at the two  sets of medals and wondered at the fate of war. One brother lives, is  decorated for his bravery; goes on to have four children and dies many  decades later. The other is killed as a youth and the only trace he leaves behind is a bronze medallion, a long-faded memory and a name, engraved among countless others on a memorial in the Commonwealth War Graves cemetery in Arras. If the trajectories of the enemy bullets had been ever-so slightly different, then my great-uncle would have lived and my grandfather  would have died – and my father, my brothers and I and my children would never have lived. For me, like so many other families, there is nothing abstract about the First World War. It is deeply personal. And it is not just the scale of the slaughter that has struck me. It is the sheer randomness of who lived and who died. A few weeks ago, I went again to visit . the battlefields of Northern France with my children. I defy anyone who . stares at row upon row, column upon column, arch after arch of the . names of the dead on the Thiepval Memorial, or the Menin Gate in Ypres, . not to at least ask again the question: What could possibly justify all . this? What did my great-uncle and the other  32 young men from his small . village  in East Sussex die for? Derrick was killed trying to prevent . the final German effort to win the war – an effort that failed thanks to . his sacrifice and courage, the courage of my grandfather and of many, . many others. Attack: The Kaiserschlacht, or Kaiser  Battle, that was designed to deliver the decisive blow that would end the war in the crucial months between the exit of the now-revolutionary Russians and the arrival in strength of the Americans . It is difficult . to appreciate now  – because we know the outcome of  the war and all . that followed – that those fighting it did not know that Britain and its . Allies would win,  even by 1918. Indeed, faced with the relentless . German onslaught that spring, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig issued a . plea to all troops that said simply: ‘With our backs to the wall and . believing in the justice of our cause each one of us must fight on to . the bitter end.’ So these battles mattered in a war where the outcome mattered. When . the commemorations for the centenary of the First World War were first . being discussed, there was a risk that the reason we fought the war . would be forgotten. There is always the temptation to present it as . nothing more than a bloody struggle between rival empires ruled by rival . royal cousins. Thankfully, . we have, as a country, resisted that simplistic interpretation. Britain . was, for all its imperfections, a democracy seeking to preserve the . rule of international law on the Continent and resist German militarism. We know the far-reaching consequences of victory for Britain, and the . transformation it brought to everything from our attitude to war itself . to the role of women. We also know the peace didn’t last. But that does . not make it a conflict without any purpose. What is unknowable are the even more far-reaching consequences  for Britain had we lost. We do not know what our country would look like today – but it is difficult to believe it would be a better place; in all likelihood it would be very much worse. So I do not accept that  Derrick Osborne and all his comrades died in vain. And then there is the impact on the living. Some years ago, with my father and his brother, I went to explore Aveluy Wood and to see where their father had won the  Military Cross. There is no sign  or memorial to the struggle there. This was not Vimy Ridge or Ypres Salient; just another forgotten skirmish among thousands of others. We parked the car by the side of the . road, walked into a little copse by the side of the ploughed fields, and . it was as if we had been transported back nine decades. There,  in the wood, apparently . undisturbed except by the passage of time, were remnants of the barbed . wire, the shallow trenches and the shell  holes where my grandfather . fought and survived. 'I doubt my relatives who fought in Northern France would have imagined it possible that a century later their offspring, and offspring's offspring, would be marching through those woods and honouring their memory,' writes Chancellor George Osborne . There, by the side of the fields, was a row of unexploded German shells, exposed by the latest ploughing, that had been fired to kill him. And there too was the companionship of the Osborne family, almost 100 years later, brought together in remembrance of part of our own personal history. Last month I took my own children to visit the same area. I doubt my relatives who fought in Northern France would have imagined it possible that a century later their offspring, and offspring’s offspring, would be marching through those woods and honouring their memory. I doubt ten years ago that we would have thought it likely that thousands of our schools, our newspapers and broadcasters, and the public at large would take such a close interest in the centenary of the First World War. I’m sure that the courage of  British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan has reminded us all of the  sacrifice those in uniform make  to keep us safe. In an age when we worry about the fragmentation of our national identity, this centenary has reminded us not just of our shared past – but of the ties that bind us still. It was that nation, and those ties, that Derrick and George fought for. I already knew the story of my decorated grandfather. But the story of my great-uncle’s last day  on Earth is only known to me because of the work of people living in the village of Framfield, in East Sussex, where Derrick and George Osborne grew up. There, a group of fellow citizens have devoted a huge amount of effort to researching the stories  of the 33 men from the small parish killed in that war. They wrote to me earlier this year, enclosing the research they had done on Derrick. I am hugely grateful to them, not just because they honour his memory and sacrifice, but also because they have enriched my life, filled in for me part of my family history and connected me with the sacrifice of men who gave everything so that we could enjoy our freedom today. May the courage of Major George Osborne never be forgotten. May Lieutenant Derrick Osborne rest in peace. And may all who fought and died for our freedom in that almighty struggle be honoured again this year.","Chancellor's grandfather, Major George Osborne fought in Kaiserschlacht .

"By . Carol Davis . Graham Parker took part in a trial using stem cells to repair heart damage . A major new trial is using patients' own stem cells to treat heart . failure. One  of the first to benefit is Graham Parker, 41, an . archaeology student from Stanley, County Durham. He tells CAROL DAVIS . his story. Working as a supply teacher a few years . ago, I started feeling exhausted. I couldn't walk more than 50 metres . without pausing, was constantly breathless and would wake at night . coughing. At first I thought it was a cold or flu, or the stress of a . house move. But my mum, a retired nurse, pointed out I'd been ill for . two months, and sent me to the doctor. The GP suspected asthma, and . gave me an inhaler. But within a week it was worse and I couldn't walk . more than a few yards without retching. So I saw a second GP. She didn't say what she thought it was - she called an ambulance instead. I . was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead, then . transferred to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle while they ran several . tests, including an ECG (electrocardiogram) and MRI (magnetic resonance . imaging) scan. Doctors explained I had heart failure: part of my . heart muscle was damaged and the lower pumping chamber had become flabby . so couldn't pump blood round my body properly. This was why I was so . exhausted. It could have been caused by a virus, although sometimes . it's genetic. But there's no family history of heart disease and I was . very fit - I was a former policeman - so the diagnosis was a real shock. I . left hospital with medication to help my heart, including beta blockers . to relieve the load on the heart, ACE inhibitors to dilate my blood . vessels and help the heart pump better, as well as diuretics and . warfarin to thin the blood and stop it clotting. The risk with heart . failure is that blood can pool in the heart's chambers and is more . likely to clot, which can cause a heart attack. I had to take six . months off work, and felt incredibly weak and breathless. As my heart . was permanently damaged, I had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted . the following year to keep my heart beating regularly. This stopped me getting any worse, but I was still weak. I couldn't run more than ten minutes on the treadmill at the gym. Stem cells were taken from the bone marrow in Graham's hip, and injected into his heart . I'd . read online that many heart failure patients die within five years, . which was a terrifying prospect. So I gave up work and started an . archaeology degree, which I'd always wanted to do. Then, in June . 2009 I read in Good Health about a woman with a damaged heart valve . who'd had a new treatment in Germany to have stem cells injected into . the valve to repair it. A trial using stem cells to treat heart . failure was starting at the London Chest Hospital and I asked to join . it. The doctors explained that stem cells can potentially grow into any . cell, including heart muscle cells, for reasons doctors don't yet fully . understand. Stem cells would be taken from the bone marrow in my hip, and injected into my heart. The . treatment started in December 2010 and involved me first having a daily . injection of a protein that stimulates the bone marrow for five days. I then had a local anaesthetic while doctors used a large syringe to take bone marrow from my hip. This . was then sent to the lab to have the stem cells removed. Later that . day, I was given a local anaesthetic and sedated for the hour-long . procedure, to transplant the stem cells. The consultant, Professor . Anthony Mathur, fed a thin flexible tube up through the artery in my . thigh to my heart, then fed the fluid containing the stem cells into it. At first I felt no different. Since it was a trial, I knew some . patients would have stem cells and the rest a placebo. But over the next . few years I felt better and better. Eventually, I was able to run for more than an hour on the treadmill, far more than I'd managed in police training. I suspected I'd had the stem cells and last July Professor Mathur confirmed it - I was elated but not surprised. Now, . six years after my diagnosis, I do six miles of Nordic walking - . trekking using poles - every other day, have climbed mountains, have . more stamina than people half my age and my breathing is back to normal. I'm still classed as having heart failure and still take my medication but feel completely better -it's life-changing. It's relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an angioplasty and stent procedure . Professor . Anthony Mathur is a consultant cardiologist at Barts Health  NHS Trust . in London and professor of cardiology at Queen Mary University of . London. Heart disease is Britain's biggest killer, with 103,000 heart attacks in the UK annually. But . since we are getting better at treating heart attacks there are now . more than a million people living with heart failure, when the heart can . no longer pump sufficient blood around the body. It causes . breathlessness because the heart does not supply blood to other organs . properly. This is especially noticeable in the lungs. Doctors can try . treating heart failure with medication to help heart function, or by . fitting a pacemaker and defibrillator to help it beat properly. But . for the past ten years I have worked with the Heart Cells Foundation, . which has helped fund the Regenerate trials. These have treated . different groups of patients with their stem cells. Some patients . had had a recent heart attack, others had heart failure caused by heart . disease or by a virus (which probably happened in Graham's case). The . trials produced significant results. Following the trials' success, . we are now involved in the world's largest ever trial of stem cell . therapy in heart attack patients. The BAMI study will treat 3,000 . patients across Europe to see if administering stem cells within a few . days of a heart attack will prolong life by helping repair the heart and . keeping it working properly. We use stem cells taken from bone . marrow - a good source, and a well-tested procedure. Heart failure . patients begin with five days of injections of a growth factor, but in . the BAMI trial we don't do this because we want to treat them soon after . the heart attack. We then take 50-100ml of bone marrow from their . hip, which is processed to collect white blood cells, which contain the . stem cells. A catheter - a thin flexible tube - is inserted through . the artery in the groin to the main artery to the heart; we also inject a . dye so we can see the coronary arteries supplying the heart on an . X-ray.Then we feed the catheter into the coronary arteries - before . we inject the stem cells, we inflate a tiny balloon to block the artery . so the cells will not flow back out. Some cells will be flushed out, . but we hope some will find their way to the damaged heart muscle and . help to repair it, which takes six to 12 months. Results from the . Regenerate trials have already shown we can help patients with damaged . hearts. We hope the newest trial will show we could help many more, so . this could one day become a standard treatment after a heart attack. It's . relatively safe and the risk is similar to what people experience in an . angioplasty and stent procedure - where we open blocked arteries using a . tiny metal tube. The procedure costs the NHS about £10,000 and is . only available as part of the BAMI trial at the London Chest Hospital . run by Barts Health NHS Trust.","Graham Parker, 41, from County Durham is one of first to benefit from trial .

Spectators including Gabby Roslin and Sol Campbell also shouted their support from the sunny stands in SW19 today. Murray had never previously dropped fewer than six games in a match at the All England Club, while it was his most one-sided result at a slam since losing one game to Alberto Martin at the Australian Open in 2007. Rola's hopes of mounting the most unlikely of comebacks were dealt another blow at the start of the third set.

Having missed two break points, Murray played a stunning rally to move 1-0 ahead, ending it with a crisp forehand winner down the line. The 27-year-old was in complete control, showing off all facets of his game and giving Rola a thorough runaround. The Slovenian continued to have the odd glimpse on the Murray serve and created a third break point of the match at 3-0, but it went the same way as the others.

Greetings: Before taking her seat, a canary yellow Camilla greeted Britain's Laura Robson, Andy Murray's doubles partner . Murray said: 'I played well. This is the first year he's played on grass. He just came out of college and he's broken into the top 100 so it was tough for him. 'He doesn't have much grass-court experience but he'll definitely keep improving because he's got a good game. 'I just had to concentrate on my side of the net and I took care of my serve pretty well throughout the majority of the match.' Left-hander Rola had lost twice to British number three James Ward in the last month, at the French Open and Queen's, so was not expected to trouble Murray. And Rola's nerves were obvious as he allowed Murray to break serve in the opening game, throwing in a double fault and a number of mis-hits. Coffee break: Earlier, Andy's mum Judy excited queuing spectators by handing out coffees in purple and green Wimbledon cups . Murray has a famously excellent record against left-handers - Rafael Nadal aside - which is a legacy of growing up playing against his brother Jamie. Next up he faces a match against either 27th seed Roberto Bautista-Agut or Czech Jan Hernych. Murray said he expected high marks from Mauresmo for his display. 'I'm sure she'll be happy with it,' he said. 'We'll have a chat about the match this afternoon and then rest up and get ready for the next round.

The 22-year-old suffers from a condition known as Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS), which means that every time she stands up, her heart rate speeds up, causing her to pass out. Chelsey's PoTS is so severe that she has had to learn to walk on her knees around the house, and even carries a small stool with her wherever she goes. Out of the blue: Chelsey's sudden onset of PoTS was a mystery to doctors. She went from working 15 hours a day to being unable to stand for even a very short period of time . Doctors have been baffled by the sudden onset of PoTS and are still at a loss as to why Chelsey suffers from it. Chelsey . said: 'It all happened absolutely out of the blue. One minute I was . working, rushing about and getting on with things, and the next thing I . knew I'd fainted. 'From that moment on everything was different and I haven't been able to stand up since. 'I have to use my wheelchair whenever I go out, and I've learnt to get about on my knees or my bum around the house. 'It's . all just so surreal. I'd never been ill or been to hospital before . this. I feel like I'm living in a weird parallel universe.' Chelsey was working on the stroke ward at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford hospital when she began feeling ill. Chelsey went from leading an active life as a trainee nurse and part-time model before being being struck down by a rare condition which means she faints every time she stands up . 'I had a 15 hour shift ahead of me on the ward and I was just getting started. 'I felt fine and then all of a sudden felt faint. I hadn't had breakfast so I assumed it was that. 'I went to the staff room to grab something to eat, and when I came back out I fainted. 'Everyone ran towards me and the next thing I knew I'd been taken to A&E. Apparently I was unresponsive and people were really worried. 'It was like a dream. It was all so scary, I had no idea what was happening to me.' After various tests, Chelsey was sent home and told to go to her GP for a check up in 24 hours time. She added: 'It was horrible. Every time I stood up for even the shortest period of time I had an overwhelming feeling that I was going to faint. Doctors are baffled and are still at a loss as to why Chelsey suffers from the condition . 'I was asked to do some simple tests . like pushing on the doctor's hands and standing up for a short period of . time - but as soon as I stood up I heard the doctor utter the word . PoTS.' Chelsey then faced a long wait whilst test results were gathered and a diagnosis was made. She said: 'I was starting to model, going to the gym lots and training to be a nurse, and now all of a sudden I had to sit down to brush my teeth. I couldn't even sit up in bed. 'I used to work for 15 hours and then go on a night out - there's no way I could do that now. 'I'm always the lively loud one, so for my family to see such a change in me it was really hard. 'I got my wheelchair and then a mobility scooter, and everything was different.' 'I had three days of tests and they were gruelling. I was strapped to a tilt table and put in a standing position until I passed out. After being diagnosed with PoTS, Chelsey met her boyfriend Ashley, who she says has been supportive of her . 'After the tests I was finally given a . diagnosis in October last year. I then had to wait another six months . for a follow-up appointment, where I've been put on a course of . medication to try and deal with the PoTS. 'It's . a waiting game at the moment to see if any medication will work but I . always try to look on the bright side and hope for the best.' Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) can be a life altering and debilitating chronic health condition. Simply standing up can be a challenge for people with PoTS as their body is unable to adjust to gravity. PoTS is characterised by what's . known as orthostatic intolerance - the development of symptoms when . upright that are relieved by lying down. Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, palpitations, sweating, nausea, fainting and dizziness. They are associated with an increase in heart rate from the lying to upright position of greater than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing. For more information: http://www.potsuk.org/ . But despite the condition, Chelsey maintains a positive outlook, and has even started a YouTube . channel where she hopes to raise awareness of PoTS and her journey with . it. 'It was tricky at first but I still try and live as normal life as possible,' she says. 'I really missed getting to go out and go dancing with my friends, but luckily my friend's husband is a bouncer at a nightclub. 'He was able to carry me into the club, and get me sat down - I stayed on the same chair all night but it was amazing. 'I even met my boyfriend, Ashley that night. We started chatting and it was great because you'd never have guessed that I had anything wrong with me. 'Ashley's been so supportive about my condition. Going on a first date in a wheel chair was pretty daunting, but it didn't seem to phase him. 'We've never walked hand in hand, which is something most couples take for granted, but we have a great relationship all the same. 'In an ideal world I'd wake up one morning and be fine again. I hope that it will go away as quickly as it started. 'But in the mean time I'll try my best to live as normally as I can. 'I want other PoTS sufferers to know that they're not alone.'","Chelsey Reynolds, from Essex, suffers from Postural Tachycardia Syndrome .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded Wednesday that it's 'possible' convicted felons could become Obamacare 'navigators,' gaining access to tax information and Social Security numbers of Americans as they help them register for insurance coverage. Her admission came during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, in a tense exchange with Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn. 'Isn't it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background check,' Cornyn asked her, 'even though they will receive personal – sensitive personal information from they individuals they help sign up for the Affordable Care Act?' HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded that criminals could be helping Americans fill out health insurance applications, gaining access to the tax information required to determine their eligibility for government subsidies . Round Two: Sebelius faced an unexpectedly harsh grilling at the hands of Senators. Last week, she got a similarly hostile welcome in front of congressmen . 'That is true,' Sebelius responded in a moment of nervousness. 'States could add an additional – um – background checks and other features, but it is not part of the federal requirement.' 'So a convicted felon could be a navigator,' an annoyed Cornyn followed up, 'and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual, unbeknownst to them?' 'Uh, that is possible,' she said, shifting blame to the groups responsible for deploying navigators in the field. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Four Pinocchios' Much of Wednesday's hearing focused on President Obama's now-debunked promise that Americans who like their health care plans would be able to keep them after Obamacare went into effect -- a promise that The Washington Post called a 'whopper' Line of fire: Sebelius faced calls to resign over the shambles by Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts . 'We have contracts with the organizations, and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators, and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job.' Sebelius also mentioned 'a self-attestation' that navigators are expected to sign, confirming their identities and their intentions. 'But it is possible.' President Obama is headed to Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, where he will promote the navigator program, a feature of Obamacare that allows paid assistants, many from community organizing groups cast in Obama's historical mold, to help Americans with their enrollment. Despite the administration promoting the navigators as an alternative means of registration to the program's semi-functional website, they too must use the website to determine whether or not applicants are eligible for federal government subsidies. March to the gallows: Sebelius faced unusually tough questions from a typically more sedate Senate Finance Committee panel, with one member calling for her resignation . Under questioning from Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, Sebelius tried to qualify her startling admission about information security under Obamacare. 'The navigators must go through a minimum of 20 hours of training,' she said. 'A significant portion focuses on privacy and security issues.' She insisted that applying for insurance under the new law 'there is no personal health information ever collected or needed, so they don't have access to that.' But Isakson countered that 'to estimate the subsidy somebody's going to get under the Obamacare law, you'd have to know their income on their tax return.' 'Are the navigators going to be able to use that information in order to make that estimate?' 'If a consumer chooses – yes – to share that information,' she replied, 'they can give the consumer the information about what they qualify for.' Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from Sebelius' home state of Kansas, called for her resignation over the botched Obamacare website rollout.","HHS secretary says there's no background-check requirement for the thousands of community activists tasked with being enrollment helpers .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Apple is planning to put some muscle behind its future iPhones - literally. The Cupertino-based company yesterday published a patent application to use an ‘artificial muscle system’ for focusing cameras in devices such as its iPhone and iPad. The patent claims the system would contract in a similar way to how muscles move to focus the lens and take images. Apple yesterday published a patent application to use ‘artificial muscle’ for focusing cameras in devices such as its iPhone and iPad. The artificial muscle structure is pictured here. It is based on a class of ‘smart material’ that change shape when near an electric field. The contracting movement is similar to a real muscle . The system could allow for much slimmer mobile systems that use less power while carrying larger camera components, the company said. United States Patent Application No. 20140168799, entitled ‘Artificial Muscle Camera Lens Actuator’, describes how the structure will be based on electroactive polymers (EAP). EAPs, or artificial muscles, are a class of ‘smart material’ that deform in the presence of an electric field. The muscle that Apple has outlined would replace the comparatively large voice coil motor (VCM) currently used to focus mobile phones cameras. While it may sound like science-fiction, the idea to use artificial muscle isn’t new. The technology, for instance, is already being used in touch feedback in some video game controllers. The construction is built inside a metal frame and supported by springs. A circular electrode-EAP sits on top of the conical lens, with a hole that works as the camera's aperture. The movement is produced when the lens is subjected to an electrical field . Whether Apple will use the EAP technology in the future iPhone 6  (leaked image pictured) remains unclear . ‘There have been suggestions to use artificial muscle technology for implementing a camera autofocus lens actuator,’ Apple said in its application. However, the filing claims that EAP materials can now be ‘engineered and developed to for high volume manufacture.’ Apple claims they have also tried to use EAP to create an autofocus lens, ‘but a completely engineered solution for high volume manufacture or mass production may not be available.’ Their solution involves placing EAPs in a cone truncated shape, which is surrounded by negative electrodes on top, and positive electrodes on the bottom. Apple's solution involves placing EAPs in a cone truncated shape, which is surrounded by negative electrodes on top, and positive electrodes on the bottom. In this layout, the ‘artificial muscle’ can use the electrical potential between negative and positive electrodes to move the lens up and down . The iPhone 6 may be able to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code found in the iOS 8 operating system. The files suggest a built-in barometer could provide instant weather readings by forecasting changes in the air pressure. The barometer could also be useful for mountain climbers, runners or bikers, who want to keep track of their altitude while training. And as well as environmental readings, the new sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone’s location services. In this layout, the ‘artificial muscle’ could use the electrical potential between negative and positive electrodes to move the lens up and down. As well as this, a circular electrode-EAP sits on top of the lens, with a hole that works as the camera's aperture, according to Apple Insider. Apple said this will not only reduce costs ‘significantly’, but it will also ‘exhibit extremely low power consumption.’ The assembly, they claim, also has the ability to support larger optical technologies. However, whether Apple will use the technology in the future iPhone 6 device remains unclear.","Artificial muscle technology uses electroactive polymer (EAP) material .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Stunning fireworks displays enchanted onlookers around the country last night, as dramatic displays lit up the sky in cities around America for Fourth of July celebrations. For one man, though, the view from below wasn't enough, and he decided to use his GoPro-equipped drone to film the action from the sky. South African Jos Stiglingh flew his DJI Phantom 2 drone into the midst of a West Palm Beach, Florida fireworks display, and the resulting footage is stunning - but also illegal. Breathtaking: The drone had a GoPro camera attached which captured footage of fireworks exploding from the sky . Sky high: Stiglingh flew his drone into the sky over West Palm Beach in the midst of a fireworks display . Set to a dramatic Andrea Bocelli aria, the footage shows fireworks exploding sometimes right next to the drone. However, the video has been condemned by critics, who point out that flying a drone into fireworks is not only unsafe, it's illegal. During fireworks displays, authorities establish no-fly safety zones to protect the public. In Florida for July 4, the Coast Guard enacted a temporary rule: . 'The Coast Guard is establishing three temporary safety zones during Fourth of July firework events... Non-participant persons and vessels are prohibited from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within any of the safety zones unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Miami or a designated representative.' Unsafe: Many viewers pointed out that while beautiful, the footage is illegal . Rules: As drones become more common, the FAA is examining its UAV regulations . According to Forbes, the punishment for violating a safety zone is a $40,000 fine and for willful violations it is a Class D felony, punishable by at least five, but no more than 10 years in prison. Toy drones, which look like miniature helicopters, are becoming more and more common, with operators flying them over concerts and beaches, and the Federal Aviation Authority is in the middle of examining its current Unmanned Aerial Vehicle regulations. 'It should be obvious that flying a drone through a fireworks display is unsafe and illegal,' wrote law and public policy expert Gregory S. McNeal in Forbes. 'Unfortunately stories like these demonstrate that what is clearly unsafe to most people, is somehow lost on a few careless operators.'","Man flew drone with GoPro camera attached into a fireworks display .

'This is the next dream to have become a reality here in Brazil. I hope it's not the last either,' said Hummels, whose early header was the difference between the sides as the quarter-final failed to live up to expectations. 'We’re playing the kind of football that will give us a chance to win this trophy. We’re defending well, with passion and determination, so that needs to be stepped up with each game.' The Germans had suffered a virus in . their camp going into the game which laid seven players, but although . they managed only three attempts on goal they were still well organised . enough to make France look the more sluggish side. Philipp Lahm said: ‘We are in the semi-finals so who cares about anything else? It wasn’t easy, but we worked as a team and the team always comes first.' Hummels was one of a number of changes to the Germans' starting line-up that paid off handsomely for manager Joachim Low. On the back of an extra-time marathon against Algeria in the last 16 and battling a flu outbreak in the panel, Löw was elated with how his reconfigured team coped in the intense afternoon heat.

'What we saw today was players who were injured who had to go all the way to their limits. Remember the Algeria match where we went to extra time,' said Löw, who now faces a dilemma over whether to stick with his new-look side for Tuesday's semi-final. 'Now it's a matter of bringing all our forces together to see if they can recover and regenerate well. It's about seeing how the players cope with this match. Then we will make a decision.' Defeated France manager Didier Deschamps lamented his side's failure to truly get to grips with the Germans.

They have taken a great experience, but we just weren't effective today,' said Deschamps afterwards. 'We confronted a superior side that plays at a very high level. I believe that there is not that big a difference between us and Germany. But this German side has more experience than us and they are more accustomed to playing these occasions.

"Andy Murray defends his Wimbledon championship . Virginia Wade describes Mauresmo appointment as a 'joke' Tennis is part of a sporting landscape in which only 31 per cent of coaches are women . By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . The most remarkable aspect of Andy Murray beginning the defence of his Wimbledon gentleman’s singles title is not that he is the first British man to do so for 77 years, but that there will be a female coach in the players’ box on Centre Court. Amazing, isn’t it? You wait all this time for a British men’s champion and then he turns out to be a groundbreaker in more ways than one. In 2014, an elite male tennis player’s decision to hire as his coach a ‘lady’, as we women are so politely called at the All England Club, is considered trailblazing. Trailblazer: Andy Murray appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his coach - a groundbreaking move in tennis . Up and away: Murray puts in some practice on his serve during his session on Sunday . Virginia Wade, maybe still slightly irked that her 1977 Wimbledon triumph has been overshadowed by a British man doing the business, thinks it ‘a joke’, while others resort to pig-headed sexism when considering Murray’s revolutionary act. Murray’s decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo should be celebrated. Tennis is part of a sporting landscape in which only 31 per cent of coaches are women. How many can you name off the top of your head? Only one of the eight clubs in the top tier of the FA Women’s Super League, for example, has a woman in charge and not one of the world’s top-20 female tennis players has a full-time female coach. Men are apparently expected to coach other men because, of course, they have ‘played the game’ themselves. And yet there is no barrier to them coaching in women’s competitions that would have been alien to them as players. No daft, old-fashioned arguments about entering locker-rooms or whether late-night tactical analysis might lead to an altogether different type of relationship. No problem: Murray, who hit the All England Club practice courts on Sunday, defended his appointment of Mauresmo following criticism from Wimbledon legend Virginia Wade (R) There is a valid argument in tennis for wanting your trainer to also be your hitting partner but a sport such as athletics has no such get-out clause. At a time when many a coach’s beer belly provides a useful shelf for his stopwatch, only three female coaches had athletes competing for Britain at the weekend’s European Team Championships in Germany. Christine Bowmaker, who coaches Asha Philip and Jodie Williams — two of the country’s most talented young sprinters — quickly provides an insight as to why that might be. Bowmaker is married with two children, aged six and eight, and is also a part-time PE teacher working in sprinting, with all of its macho, testosterone-fuelled connotations. Her admission that it can be ‘very, very challenging’ is clearly something of an understatement. ‘At some points it hasn’t been a labour of love,’ she says. ‘There were times that, because of the  sexism in the sport, of not being recognised or valued for the contribution I made, I did think “What’s the point?” ‘But then . I’m not in it to be put on a pedestal. What motivates me is seeing . athletes achieve what they want to achieve, on whatever level that might . be. And if I give up, it won’t get any better. Sealed with a kiss: British No 1 Murray will be hoping to successfully defend his Wimbledon crown this year . ‘You have to be a certain type of character to survive. You have to be strong because coaching is hard.’ It is hard, as well as being time-consuming, unsociable and voluntary for more than three-quarters of the UK’s coaches, none of which are exactly conducive to bringing up a family. There are therefore scarily few role models for female coaches, while stereotypes about women offering better emotional support but less authority seem to persist. ‘It’s great to see a female like Mauresmo in the limelight,’ says Bowmaker. ‘It’s amazing she’s doing it. When you see another female coach it’s so exhilarating but we have to be good at what we do, too. ‘There’s still a hangover from the past. You ask all athletes, male and female, whether they would like a female coach and I think 90 per cent of them would still say “no”. ‘That won’t change until more female coaches bring more people through, so it’s about staying  professional and pushing yourself. ‘I have to be different from what they expect. I don’t need to be testosterone-driven to be a good coach and if I do a good job then my athletes will keep winning, simple as that.’ Diego Maradona accused FIFA of a ‘lack of respect’ after seven Costa Rica players were drug-tested following Friday’s 1-0 win over Italy, showing yet again just how out of touch football is when it comes to drugs in sport. Even more disrespectful is FIFA’s claim they are setting a ‘benchmark...in the fight against doping’. No positive tests at a World Cup since Maradona’s in 1994, so therefore nobody’s cheating? Give over. Hitting out: Argentina legend Diego Maradona accused FIFA of a 'lack of respect' after seven Costa Rica players were drug-tested after their win over Italy . PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKChile's 2-0 win over Spain. This was largely about the demise of Spain, but the joy, work ethic and energy of Chile, the so-called ‘minnows’, were a pleasure to watch. Performance of the week: Chile celebrated an unlikely win at the Maracana to eliminate champions Spain from the World Cup in the group stages .","Andy Murray defends his Wimbledon championship .

"By . Martin Robinson . Brave: Shammi Atwal was pushed under the wheels of a lorry as he fought a gang of six men who robbed his business and wife . Six masked robbers who pushed a father-of-two under the wheels of a lorry as he defended his wife were jailed for more than 70 years today. The gang made up of five Lithuanians and a Qatari-born Briton stormed the Glen & Co cash-and-carry run by Shammi Atwal, 45, in Barking, Essex, wielding iron bars and sledgehammers. Mr Atwal gave chase to defend his partner Damanjeet Kaur after one of the raiders dragged her out of the office by her hair and snatched her handbag. But he was crushed to death when one of the robbers pushed him into the path of an oncoming lorry in October last year. The thieves had only managed to grab £1,000 which was in the stolen handbag. Lithuanians Deibidas Sumskas, 25, Edgaras  Balezantis, 25, Vidmantas Gonskoves, 26, Aurimas Diliunas, 27, Reiniks Kivers, 27, and Farhan Sheikh, 38, who was born in Qatar, were all found guilty of manslaughter and robbery after a trial. They were jailed for a total of 71 years and eight months at the Old Bailey. Judge Nicholas Hilliard, Common Serjeant of London, commended Mr Atwal's bravery and courage and said his last thoughts were 'undoubtedly for his wife'. He said: 'All six defendants have been found guilty on the unanimous verdicts of the jury of manslaughter and conspiracy to rob. 'The conspiracy was put into effect and in the course of the robbery Shammi Atwal was killed. 'He was 45 years old, a married man with two children aged seven and four. 'In a moving statement Damanjeet Kaur his widow describes what was their 'perfect little family' and all that they had to look forward to. 'What you men did has had devastating and catastrophic consequences on the family who have to live with this for the rest of their lives, long after you are released from the sentences I have passed today. 'No sentence I pass today can make up for what you have done and the pain you have caused. 'None of you has shown what I regard as any genuine remorse of regret at all for taking Mr Atwal's life or for the consequences on his two small children.' Thugs: Aurimas Diliunas, left, was one of the men who dragged Shami Atwal's wife by the hair and along with fellow Lithuanian Deibidas Sumskas has been jailed at the Old Bailey today . Jailed: Edgaras Balezantis, left, received a sentence of  11 years and four months while Farhan Sheikh was given 13 years . Habitual criminals: Reiniks Kivers, left, who has carried out offences across Europe got 13 years and  Vidmantas Gonskoves received more than 11 years . The raid was carefully planned and the killers lay in wait outside the premises for an hour plotting for the right moment to strike. The gang of at least ten men made sure that the guard dogs had all left before storming the building. Two of the men barged into the office where Mrs Kaur was and Diliunas dragged her outside by the hair. She was terrified and said: 'I thought they were racists come to kill us.' It is thought the father-of-two was pushed in front of this lorry by a member of the fleeing gang . But the desperate thieves could not find what they were looking for - the company safe which had between £10,000 and £12,000 cash in it. 'They couldn't find what they wanted quickly enough and so they left still brandishing weapons as seen on the CCTV,' Judge Hilliard said. He added: 'No one has remarked upon Shammi Atwal's courage and bravery. 'Mrs Kaur can be sure of this - her husband intervened in the robbery whilst it was going on with considerable courage to try and stop the robbers getting away with his wife's bag. 'His last thoughts were undoubtedly for her. 'What happened was this - one of you pushed Mr Atwal and he went under the wheels of a passing lorry which was being driven entirely lawfully along the road by the gates of Glen & Co. 'Mr Atwal died from the injuries he received.' He continued: 'You must all know who it was but none of you has said who it was. 'Any offence of manslaughter is of course serious because a precious life has been taken unlawfully. 'What makes this offence particularly serious is its context - it was committed in the course of robbery.' Kivers and Diliunas both have a string of previous convictions including robbery, burglary, theft and blackmail for offences committed across Europe including in Spain and Lithuania. In a statement read to the court Mrs Kaur said her husband was the 'most loving father' and his family 'cannot cope' without him. 'I loved my husband with all my heart and he loved his family and children,' she said. 'Our life was a perfect little family and we had so much to look forward to.' Investigation: Mr Atwal's Glenn & Co Cash and Carry, pictured, cordoned off after the Metropolitan Police launched the investigation into his death . Flowers: A police officer places a tribute for the businessman at the scene . The gang had travelled to the scene in at least one BMW car, a black series 5 BMW saloon, last October 14. - sentencing judge Nicholas Hilliard . They were dressed in dark clothing with hoods or masks over their faces and some of them wore gloves. The raiders carried out the merciless attack on those who worked there, intent on taking whatever cash was there. But the cost to the business and those who worked there was considerably greater. They threatened anyone in their path and assaulted Ms Kaur in the raid. The six defendants, each dressed casually, were joined in the dock by multiple Lithuanian interpreters. Sheikh is a British national but the other five killers could face deportation, the case will be considered by the Secretary of State. Kivers, of no fixed address, and Sheikh, of Thornhill Gardens, Barking, were both sentenced to 13 years behind bars. Diliunas, of Rosslyn Road, Barking, was given 11 years and eight months imprisonment. Balezantis, of Tollgate road, East Ham, Sumskas, of Ottley Road, Victoria Docks, and Gonskoves, of Grange Road, Plaistow, were each jailed for 11 years and four months.","Five Lithuanians and a Qatari found guilty of killing Shammi Atwal in Essex .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A gas station clerk from Arizona has been hailed as a hero for helping rescue a baby girl who police say was kidnapped by her own grandmother. Carolyn Ferguson, 57, was arrested Wednesday night in a Phoenix suburb for allegedly abducting 6-month-old Laylani Mosley from her parents’ home in Huntington Beach, California. The baby's disappearance had sparked an Amber Alert, which ultimately helped police track down the infant and her grandmother. According to authorities, the woman has a history of mental illness. Scroll down for video . Abduction: Carolyn Ferguson, 57 (left), is accused of snatching her 6-month-old granddaughter Laylani Mosley (right) from her parents' home in California and taking her to Arizona 300 miles away . Hero: Gas station cashier Karin Atkins has been credited with helping save baby Laylani by contacting 911 and stalling her grandfather until officers arrived . Police say Carolyn Ferguson snatched Laylani from her crib at around 9am and drove 300 miles to Tonopah, Arizona, where her 2007 PT Cruiser broke down. The 57-year-old called a tow truck, which dropped her off at Shell gas station where she went to seek help. Cashier Karin Atkins, who has a 2-year-old boy of her own, immediately suspected that something did not add up about the middle-aged woman cradling an infant in her arms, the station CBS5 reported. Atkins noticed that the baby was wearing a diaper too big for her age, and she saw Ferguson filling the child's bottle with cappuccino from the coffee machine mixed with strawberry milk. When Atkins approached Ms Ferguson, the woman claimed to be Laylani’s mother but could not tell her the girl's date of birth or middle name. Emergency: Ferguson went inside this truck stop in Tonopah, Arizona, to seek help after her vehicle broke down . Red flags: Atkins (left) noticed that the child was wearing a too-big diaper, and it seemed odd that the older woman who presented herself as Laylani's mother could not remember her date of birth . Saved: Sheriff's deputies arrived on the scene and whisked the abducted child to a hospital for a check-up . In custody: Ferguson, 57, has been extradited to Calfirnia to face kidnapping charges . Suspecting foul play, Atkins called her supervisor, who looked up online 'Amber Alert baby' and found out that an infant matching Laylani’s description had been kidnapped in California. 'It's a mom thing. If it wasn't her baby, it would kill me if I let her walk out that door and know later on that it wasn't hers and I could've done something at that moment,' Atkins told ABC7. Atkins immediately called 911 and occupied Ferguson while awaiting officers to arrive. She changed the baby’s diaper and even found some formula for her. Unstable: Ferguson's family told police the woman is bipolar, and she has been ranting about the end of the world before the kidnapping . Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies converged on the gas station at around 7pm and arrested Ferguson, who was described as acting disoriented. Baby Laylani was taken to a hospital where doctors determined that she was in a good condition. She was reunited with her parents early Thursday morning – more than 12 hours after her mother woke up from a nap and discovered that her daughter was gone. This afternoon, Carolyn Ferguson was extradited to California to face charges of child abuse and endangerment. She is being held on $50,000 bond. Her relatives told police the grandmother was suffering from a bipolar disorder and was off her medication. In the days before the alleged abduction, Ms Ferguson’s mental state reportedly has taken a turn for the worse, with the woman raving about the end of the world, according to NBC Los Angeles.CBS 5 - KPHO .","Carolyn Ferguson, 57, charged with kidnapping her six-month-old granddaughter, Laylani Mosley, from Huntington Beach, California .

"By . Anna Edwards . Armchair explorers around the world will soon be able to cruise Britain's historic waterways from the comfort of their own home. While Google Street View allows people to see images of roads worldwide on Google Maps, the company's Trekker technology uses a wearable backpack to capture shots of remote locations from the Grand Canyon to the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa. But now people will be able to take in scenic locations closer to home as the  Canal & River Trust will use the Trekker system to capture footage of some of most scenic parts of England and Wales's 200-year old waterway network. Armchair explorers will be able to view the Regent's Canal without having to board a boat . The plan is to open up its canals, rivers and towpaths to millions of curious people worldwide. Google Trekker uses a 4ft, 40lb backpack fitted with a 15-angle lens camera to take 360-degree pictures every 2.5 seconds in public places that the Street View cars and Trike cannot get to, with the images added to Street View on Google Maps. It is the first time the technology has been on loan in the UK. The trust, which manages England and Wales's waterway network, will begin at Regent's Canal in London and aims to walk the Trekker more than 100 miles over the next month to capture locations such as canal tunnels, locks and villages. It wants to record imagery of the three-and-a-quarter mile Standedge Tunnel in Yorkshire, the longest and deepest canal tunnel in the country and Bingley five-rise lock, on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the steepest lock flight on the network. All aboard your chairs! The trust wants to record imagery of the three-and-a-quarter mile Standedge Tunnel in Yorkshire . Shots will also be taken of the blacksmith's workshop at picturesque Stoke Bruene village on the Grand Union Canal, among other places, the trust said. Wendy Hawk, partnerships manager of the Canal & River Trust, said: 'We're delighted to be the first people in the UK to get the Trekker on our backs - it's fantastic that our 200-year old network is being given a different lease of life thanks to cutting-edge 21st century technology. 'The footage we get will allow millions of people from all over the world to see our canals, rivers and towpaths and will hopefully encourage some people to make a trip to see them.' Google's Pascale Milite said: 'We are thrilled to be collaborating with the Canal & River Trust on such a fun project, and we hope to help boost the discovery of and make these historic canals more accessible to more people in the UK and across the world through Street View technology.' Google Trike has already mapped some of England and Wales's most dramatic waterway scenery, capturing Caen Hill lock flight in Wiltshire and the Grade I-listed World Heritage Site around Pontycysyllte Aqueduct in North Wales last year.","Trekker system will capture 200-year old waterway network .

"By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . When it comes to the World Cup, Thomas Muller is Germany's main man. His record of nine goals in nine matches coming from just 10 shots on target coming into the game with Algeria is astounding. And put simply: if Muller is on form, Germany win. His five goals in South Africa in 2010 made him the tournament's top goalscorer - and Die Mannschaft might have had a shot at winning that tournament if it wasn't for his suspension in the semi final against Spain. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Muller's spectacular free kick slip up . Out of luck: Muller had a difficult game but never allowed the ball to completely escape him - as seen here . One: Muller begins his run-up for the free kick . Two: But after Schweinsteiger steps over the ball, Muller falls to the floor . Three: Muller crawls a couple of steps and then launches himself back up, over the ball . Floor: He runs away from the ball, into the box, but the free kick taker cannot find him . Five: Muller speeds off, much to the bemusement of those watching at home . 1 minute: Germany look to play Muller in almost straight from kick off but the Algerians sweep up the attack. 23 minutes: Muller turns creator, slipping a ball out to Mesut Ozil but the Arsenal man's indecisiveness leads to him losing the ball. 35 minutes: Muller drifts a glancing header wide of the goal. 37 minutes: Germany's top goalscorer has a bit of a nightmare: He gets on the end of Ozil's parried shot but in an entirely out of character moment he hesitates, takes a bad touch and the ball runs out of play. 48 minutes: The Golden Boot winner tees up substitute Andre Schurrle with a cute layoff but Germany still fail to score. 50 minutes: Muller makes a claim for a penalty after some grappling in the Algeria box but the referee waves away his appeal. 80 minutes: Muller forces a great save from Rais M'Bohli with a diving header that the 'keeper beats away for a German corner. 81 minutes: After sidestepping a defender he toe-pokes wide to waste the best chance of the half. 87 minutes: Muller slips just before running up to a free kick - potentially deliberately - as part of a bizarre German set piece that ends in nothing. 92 minutes: He turns provider, playing a low ball across the box and a couple of deflections allow Andre Schurrle to get on the end of it and score. 117 minutes: Muller rounds the 'keeper but can't find the net in the closing minutes. And while Algeria were taking advantage of Joachim Low's side's shaky defence - the Germans' real problem was Muller. He has been in fine form for Germany at this World Cup but on Monday night his performance was not that of the clinical international goalscorer we have seen so often at this level. Instead, Muller looked laboured, easy to mark and amazingly for him: hesitant. A poor performance was summed up by his bizarre 'pretend-slip' free kick routine which ended with him alone in the penalty area but without the ball. Muller ran towards the ball but fell just before the ball, jumped up, hopped over it and ran into the box. Schweinsteiger looked to find him but Muller was in a terrible position. Earlier, in the first half when he found himself on the end of Rais M'Bolhi's parry from Mesut Ozil's shot. Where you would usually except this Golden Boot winner to pull the trigger and smash home the rebound, he instead stopped to think for a second. In that moment, the chance was gone - Muller waited too long and ended up foolishly kicking the ball out of play. It was an embarrassing error, and the Germans gave him few better chances to make an impact. Later, he missed the game's two best chances so far in the space of nine minutes, firing a powerful header at M'Bohli and then poking a shot wide from close range after rounding a defender. It has been an obvious trend at this World Cup. Germany looked great in their opener against Portugal with Muller on song, poor against Ghana when Miroslav Klose's cameo saved them, and alright against the USA when Muller scored again. Reflecting . on his successful tournament in 2010, Muller said: 'I basically got . lucky, I hit form at just the right time,' and in Brazil he has again . mainly showed that good form. Unfortunately . for him, and Germany, that did not show against the plucky Algerians. Luckily though, Andre Schurrle was there to pick up the pieces - . although Muller did put in the heavily deflected cross. Are we seriously doing this lads? The Germans chat about their dodgy training ground free kick routine . Almost: Muller looks on as M'Bohli saves his shot towards the end of the game . Hero: Eventually it was Andre Schurrle who was left to make the difference in extra time . VIDEO German survive Algeria scare . Thwarted: Algeria produced some brilliant defensive play to try to keep Muller quiet . Tough break: The 2010 Golden Boot winner constantly had defenders around him from early on .

"By . Andy Dolan . It is one of the great old names on the British High Street with a history spanning more than 160 years. But department store House of Fraser could be set to fall in to Chinese hands, with a conglomerate from the Far Eastern superpower yesterday said to have tabled a £450million bid for the chain. Nanjing-based Sanpower is in advanced talks over a surprise swoop for the UK high street chain, which has 60 branches. High Street department store House of Fraser could be set to fall in to Chinese hands . The discussions have been taking place as House of Fraser, which opened its first store selling cloth and fabric in Glasgow in 1869, also considers a separate plan for a summer flotation on the London Stock Exchange. Sanpower has more than 100 businesses in mainland China, including shopping centres, but is little known beyond the vast country. It is believed that Sanpower's offer has already been accepted by House of Fraser chairman Don McCarthy, whose family control 20 per cent of the UK company. The proposals are now being presented to other shareholders, including Icelandic banks and Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, who holds a stake amounting to 11 per cent. He already has a £180m fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, helped by the sale of retail chains Shoe Studio and Aurum. House of Fraser, which generates sales of £1.2 billion a year and employs 7,300 people as well as 12,000 concession staff at 60 stores, has held a protracted search for new investors in the last year and recently closed its branch in Northampton. House of Fraser is also considering a separate plan for a summer flotation on the London Stock Exchange . France's Galeries Lafayette, which has 65 stores, had exclusivity on talks with House of Fraser until the end of January. The chain is also believed to have held informal takeover talks with Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley. The department store retailer first listed on the stock market in 1948 and remained a public company until it was bought by Mohamed al-Fayed in 1985. It was listed again in 1994 before being snapped up in 2006 by a group of investors led by Icelandic tycoon Jon Asgeir Johannesson's Baugur Group in a £350 million deal. Sanpower is run by tycoon Yuan Yafei, whose empire spreads across finance, property, media, transport and IT and now employs 30,000 people with assets worth nearly £5 billion. Today's report said the business is planning to inject £70 million to £80 million into House of Fraser in order to finance a wide-ranging store revamp and website improvements. The tycoon may also take the department store into China by opening new stores or changing some existing sites to the House of Fraser name. House of Fraser declined to comment yesterday.","Nanjing-based Sanpower is in advanced talks over a surprise swoop .

Syrian government forces launched a series of blistering attacks in the major cities of Deera, Hama and Homs, a day after President Bashar Assad's offer of a referendum was rejected by both rebel forces and the entire western world. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers rumbled through residential streets while terrified citizens took shelter in their homes as heavy artillery rained down reducing many buildings to rubble. In Deera, the border city where the uprising began last March, locals reported large explosions and machinegun fire echoing through . districts under constant attack by government troops. Tension: A Syrian army armoured personnel carrier rumbles through the streets of the mountain resort town of Zabadani as government forces step up their assaults on rebel groups across the country .

Shattered: Almost every pane of glass in a towerblock is broken while flames leap into the air from a car and bombed-out building as the rebel-held city of Homs endures a 13th day of successive shelling by government forces . In Hama, a city with a bloody . history of resistance to Assad's late father Hafez al-Assad, opposition . activists said shelling and sniper fire had killed at least five people . and wounded 50 in 36 hours. And in the rebel-held city of Homs artillery . shells rained down for the 13th day in a succession as fires started when a . oil pipeline was hit continued to belch clouds of black smoke into the air. The city of Deera, close to the border with Jordan, was the scene of the first . demonstrations against Assad's rule, provoked by the arrest of several . women activists and the detention of schoolboys who had written freedom . slogans on walls, inspired by other Arab Spring revolts. Hussam Izzedine, a member of the Syrian human rights . organisation Sawasiah said: 'The . army bombardment started around dawn and after that exchanges of fire . occurred. 'Demonstrations . have resumed and the Free Syrian Army has been providing security for . protests in some parts of the city,' he added.

The . state news agency said security forces 'chased and fought with an armed . terrorist group in the Hamidiya neighbourhood of Hama that has been . terrifying citizens' and arrested some of its members, who had automatic . rifles and rocket propelled grenades. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist group, said at least four people were killed by army fire concentrated on Baba Amro district, a Sunni neighbourhood. There was no comment from Syrian authorities, who tightly restrict media access to the country. And in the capital Damascus, troops killed at least two youths when they swept into the Barzeh district, searching houses and making arrests, residents said. Defectors: Syrian soldiers who defected to join the 'Free Syrian Army' pose with their weapons in   the town of Al Baiadah near Homs . Fire: Black smoke rises from an oil pipeline hit by artillery shells in the city of Homs . Wreckage: A destroyed car sits in front of a wall ridden with bullet holes in the rebel-held city of Homs . Assad's offer of a referendum on a new constitution in two weeks' time, leading to multi-party elections within 90 days, drew scornful rejections from both the opposition and the West. The White House described the offer as 'quite laughable'. Speaking from Air Force One Carney as President Obama travelled to Milwaukee, press secretary Jay Carney said Assad's announcement 'made a mockery' of the Syrian uprising. Mr Carney claimed Assad has reneged on every promise of reform since the start of demonstrations against his regime and said his promises have usually been followed by increased brutality. France said it was negotiating a new U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria with Russia, Assad's ally and main arms supplier, and wanted to create humanitarian corridors to ease the plight of civilians caught up in the violence. An authoritative Chinese newspaper, apparently responding to criticism of China and Russia for vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution urging Assad to step down, said on Thursday that meddling in Syria by foreign powers risked stirring up a hornets' nest of bloodshed and instability in the region. The commentary in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, carried an author's pen name that is often used to state Beijing's foreign policy stance. Cover: A rebel fighter crouches by a wall as government tanks enter the northwestern city of Idlib . Casualty: A Syrian civilian shows a bullet wound to the leg after arriving at a hospital in the  Lebanese city of Tripoli . Another wounded Syrian civilian lies on a hospital bed after being brought in for treatment in the Lebanese city of Tripoli . 'The political ecology in the Middle . East is extremely frail, a tangled mess of thousands of years of ethnic . and religious conflict,' the commentary said. World . powers must realise this and handle bloodshed in Syria and Middle East . tensions with a sense of realism, the paper said, adding that the spread . of conflict would be a 'catastrophe' in a crucial phase of global . economic recovery. 'The Middle East is the world's most important fuel depot. If gripped by chaos, oil prices would skyrocket, shocking the stock market, financial systems and economies,' the paper said. Washington's aim was to install a friendly government in Syria to counter the influence in the region of Iran, it said. The Chinese foreign ministry said later that Vice Foreign Minister Zhai Jun would visit Syria on Friday and Saturday. The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French radio: 'The idea of humanitarian corridors that I previously proposed to allow NGOs to reach the zones where there are scandalous massacres should be discussed at the Security Council.' He said a U.N. General Assembly vote on Thursday on a non-binding resolution on Syria would be 'symbolic'. It follows a Feb. 4 veto by Russia and China of a draft Security Council resolution that backed an Arab League call for Assad to quit. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: 'If the plan is to use the Security Council and United Nations to adopt some language to help legitimise regime change, then I'm afraid international law does not allow this and we cannot support such an approach.' Checkpoint: A Syrian government  soldier returns a motorist's identity cards in the capital Damascus . Support: A government-approved photograph shows people attending a pro-regime rally in central Damascus . Diplomats said Arab delegations had rejected proposed Russian amendments which would weaken the Assembly resolution. The Arab League wants a joint U.N. Arab peacekeeping force to be deployed in Syria and has adopted a resolution that would allow its members to arm Syrian rebels. Libya's interim leader, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, said the exiled opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) would be allowed to open an office in Tripoli. 'We support the Syrian people and their aspirations,' he said. Syrian state media said on Wednesday a draft constitution to be put to a vote on Feb. 26 would establish a multi-party system in Syria, under Baath Party rule since 1963. Parliamentary elections would follow within 90 days of its approval. The constitution would allow the president to be elected for two seven-year terms. Assad's late father Hafez was president for 29 years and was succeeded by his son when he died in 2000. Melhem al-Droubi, a member of the SNC and the Muslim Brotherhood, told Reuters Assad must resign now. 'Bashar al-Assad has increased the killing and slaughter in Syria. He has lost his legitimacy and we aren't interested in his rotten constitutions, old or new,' he said. The United States also dismissed the referendum plan. The Syrian leader dismisses the revolt as the work of terrorists backed by a conspiracy of enemy nations. Thousands of civilians have been killed since the uprising began in March, inspired by other Arab revolts. The government says more than 2,000 soldiers and police have been killed.","Heavy shelling and machinegun fire reported in Deera, Hama and Hons .

"By . Daniel Miller . To never leave a man behind is a key part of the U.S. armed forces' code of honour, and it now appears the noble gesture is being extended to comrades of the four-legged variety too. A troop of National Guard soldiers have spoken of their delight at being reunited with the stray dog they adopted on tour in Afghanistan after she, as well as her seven puppies, were air-lifted into New York. The brave dog, a 65lb mixed breed, became a much loved mascot for the men, who named her Sheba after they discovered her wandering around their base in January. Dogs of war: Members of the New York National Guard are reunited with mascot Sheba and her seven puppies that they found while on patrol in Afghanistan earlier this year . She displayed her loyalty by joining them out on patrol and chasing away other strays that may have threatened the soldiers. After . Sheba gave birth to her pups in March, the soldiers were determined to . take care of their own -  nursing her back to health with beef jerky and army rations . before asking relatives to send bags of dog food from home. 'They really became part of the family to us,' 1st Lt Joseph LaPenta of Staten Island said. Soon, however, the soldiers learned their base would be closed as part of the U.S. draw down in Afghanistan. 'It really broke our hearts that we might have to leave them there' LaPenta said. That's . when Staff Sgt Edwin Caba of Long Beach sprang into action and . contacted an old high school teacher. She put him in touch with a Long . Island group called Guardians of Rescue, which has for several years . collected donations to bring dogs back from combat zones. They had . rescued about 20 when the request came in for help getting Sheba and her . pups. Comrade in arms: Staff Sgt. Edwin Caba holds one of eight dogs rescued from the battlefield in Afghanistan . Mascots: 65-pound mixed breed Sheba was 'adopted' by the team of soldiers earlier this year after she began joining them on patrol in Taliban territory . 'We won't turn our . back on the servicemen and we won't turn our back on the dogs,' said . Guardians of Rescue president Robert Misseri. Working with a private . Kabul-based organization called Nowzad, the groups arranged to have the . dogs sent to the United States so they could be adopted by the soldiers. Mr Misseri . estimates it costs about $4,000 for every dog rescued from a war zone. He said an online crowd sourcing fundraiser is still collecting money to . pay for Sheba and her pups. The money is needed to pay for . transportation and other logistics, including health care for the dogs — . they are quarantined for 30 days and given all their vaccinations . before being sent. The . effort appeared to pay off on Wednesday night when the dogs and the . soldiers arrived at the Save-a-Pet animal shelter on Long Island to . celebrate the reunion. 'For . this to happen now, leashes in their hands, they're kissing their . faces,' Misseri said with amazement. 'This is what we do.' New homes: Two of the soldiers are adopting two puppies each, while three soldiers are taking one each.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists are predicting an 'explosion' of flea activity in UK homes over the next few week. A magnified cat flea is pictured . Are you sitting comfortably? If you have a pet, that might be about to change. Scientists from the British Pest Control Association are predicting an ‘explosion’ of flea activity in UK homes over the next few weeks, as the temperature and humidity rates are set to reach the ideal climate for fleas to awaken and breed. Milder winters in recent years have seen the flea population swell, which means that infestations are seen on a larger scale than before. Homes with pets that either have fleas, or have not been treated as a precaution, are the most at risk. ‘Pet owners should be warned that these overwintered parasites may spring out of their dormant state during the warmer temperatures in July,’ said Richard Moseley of the British Pest Control Association. ‘Milder winter temperatures have seen flea populations rise over recent years, meaning that the risk of infestation will only increase in the warmer months. ‘They can thrive in our soft furnishings and carpets as larvae and eggs and have the potential to remain dormant as pupae for a long time. It just takes a few fleas left unchecked to turn into a full blown flea infestation,’ he warned. Famed primarily for their itchy bites, fleas can transmit diseases, some of which can affect humans. Pets and owners can suffer severe allergic reactions to flea saliva, resulting in dermatitis, too. Infestations of the parasite may become an annual event due to wetter summers and milder winters. ‘Once a home is infested, it can be difficult to treat and a quick vacuum won’t eradicate the problem,’ Moseley added. Putting her eggs in one sofa: The project revealed that a single female flea will lay up to 50 eggs per day and around 500 during her lifespan, so within two months, she could hypothetically generate more offspring than the number of humans on this planet - around 7.152 billion . 'Pet owners should be warned that these overwintered parasites may spring out of their dormant state during the warmer temperatures in July,' said Richard Moseley of the British Pest Control Association. A stock image of a cat scratching is pictured. One flea can bite a pet up to 400 times a day . Fleas can jump 13 inches (34cm) - 160 times their own length, which the equivalent of a human leaping over the Eiffel tower. They can survive a force of 100Gs. Fleas mature into adults in just 18 days, which means that under the right conditions, one flea can turn into 125,000 of the parasites within eight weeks. A single flea will lay approximately 500 eggs in her lifetime. In nine months, a female fleas can hypothetically create up to a trillion descendants. Adult fleas can survive up to 62 days without a blood meal. They drink up to 15 times their body weight in a single day - which is why pets with lots of fleas can be anaemic. Around 95 per cent of the flea population exists in immature stages in sofas and carpets etc. They can carry and spread sickness and diseases to pets and people including typhus and bubonic plague. A single flea can bite a pet - or a person - up to 400 times a day. There are over 2,000 different species of flea. 'All carpets, furnishings and pet bedding will need to be thoroughly treated and it is vital to ensure that all pets are treated with an effective product - ideally one which will protect both home and pet.’ Flea treatment brand Advantage, investigated the design of the flea, which has survived and thrived for 60 million years. The creatures can jump 13 inches (34cm) which is 160 times their own length. This is possible because of the unique structure of a flea’s rear legs, which catapult it to the height required to reach a passing host at speeds reaching 4mph, (6km/h) and subjecting them flea to forces in excess of 100 G’s. Their abilities put humans to shame. British long-jumper Greg Rutherford, who recorded a gold-medal-winning jump of 27 feet (8.31 metres) during the 2012 Olympic Games, jumped just four times his own length, while top top astronauts can withstand a gravitational force of five Gs before passing out. The project revealed that a single female flea will lay up to 50 eggs per day and around 500 during her lifespan. This means that within two months, she could hypothetically generate more offspring than the number of humans on this planet - around 7.152 billion. This is because fleas take just 18 days to reach adulthood and start breeding. Now that's long jump: Fleas can jump 13 inches (34cm) which is 160 times their own length. This is possible because of the unique structure of a flea's rear legs, which catapult it to height required to reach a passing host at speeds reaching 4.3 miles per hour, (6.9km/h) and subjecting the flea to forces in excess of 100 G's . So while the pests can breed very fast, and can bite a pet up to 400 times a day to drink up to 15 times their own body weight, most 95 per cent of the population exists in immature stages near to pets, such as carpets and furnishings. '[They are] waiting for the presence of a host to feed on, sensing movement, warmth and even breath of a passing host,’ Advantage said. ‘Resilient fleas inside pupae can remain in this dormant state in the home for a number of months under the right conditions - even surviving vacuuming - with our heated homes allowing the perfect environment for year-round flea activity.’ Armed and potentially dangerous: Famed primarily for their itchy bites, fleas (pictured) can cause more than significant damage, including the transmission of diseases, some of which can affect humans. Pets and owners can suffer severe allergic reactions to flea saliva resulting in dermatitis . Ian Wright, a parasitologist from the European Scientific Counsel Companion Animal Parasites (ESCCAP) UK and Ireland told MailOnline: ‘Even in the winter months, our cosy homes are the ideal breeding ground for the parasite, which means that their numbers will only increase in the warmer months - the key season for fleas. ‘They can thrive in our soft furnishings and carpets as larvae and eggs and have the potential to remain dormant as pupae for a long time. It just takes a few fleas left unchecked to turn into a full blown flea infestation.’ Presently there are more than 2,000 described species and subspecies of flea across the globe, with the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) being the most prominent species affecting cats and dogs in the UK.","Scientists from the British Pest Control .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, (pictured leaving Manchester Magistrates' Court) was found guilty of assaulting the officers in Cumbria last year . A soft porn model who assaulted two police officers in a drunken attack has been spared jail after telling magistrates she missed two probation appointments because she was getting a boob job in Belgium. Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, was found guilty of assaulting the officers in Cumbria last year and was ordered to carry out community work and undergo supervision by probation officers. However, she was hauled back to court and charged with breaching the order after probation staff claimed she failed to provide a reasonable excuse for missing the January meetings. But Dalzell was cleared of the alleged breach by magistrates after producing a letter from a plastic surgeon during a day-long trial at Manchester Magistrates' Court. It confirmed she was having a breast enlargement in Brussels at the time of the scheduled probation meetings. The law states that defendants can miss a probation meeting but only for a valid reason and if proof, such as a letter from a doctor or employer, is given. An alleged breach of an order can result in the individual being brought back before the court and potentially being sent to prison. Dalzell, of Manchester, hit out at probation chiefs after being cleared. She said: ‘I’m just annoyed I have had to go through this when I haven’t done anything wrong. 'I went for a breast enlargement. They were fine about it at the time and now they have tried to breach me for it.’ The case comes barely a year after the model was fined for refusing to wear an electronic tag in a separate case - claiming it would interfere with her adult TV work. Dalzell, who has 11 previous convictions, was ordered to wear a tag for eight weeks in 2012 after failing to carry out community service for criminal damage. She was convicted after she became involved in a row outside 5th Avenue nightclub in Manchester. During the dispute with a male driver of a BMW car, she slapped him in the face and kicked his car causing damage. However, when security firm G4S turned up to fit her electronic tag, she refused to let them put it on her ankle, claiming she would get the sack if she wore it. Dalzell, who was working for racy, late night TV channels at the time, was hauled back into court and fined £200. She was later found guilty of assaulting the two police officers during a night out in Workington, Cumbria.

The glamour model said: 'I'm just annoyed I have had to go through this when I haven't done anything wrong' Magistrates told her yesterday that she still had to pay more than £150 in unpaid fines. John Morris, defending, said: ‘There certainly seems to have been a breakdown in the relationship between some probation officers and the client.’ Magistrates were previously told she no longer worked in adult TV and had since moved into modelling, photoshoots, hosting and other presenting jobs. A spokesman for the Cheshire and Greater Manchester Community Rehabilitation Company said: ‘When appropriate, we return offenders to court for failure to comply with their orders.’ Dalzell was told by magistrates that she still had to pay more than £150 in unpaid fines but was cleared of an alleged breach of her probation order .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Muslim leaders yesterday launched an unprecedented appeal to would-be young British jihadists: Don’t travel to fight in Syria and Iraq. Some 100 imams asked the UK’s Muslim community to help prevent radicalised youngsters joining militants abroad. Muslims should continue the ‘generous and tireless’ support for those caught up in the bloodshed – but from the UK in a ‘safe and responsible way’, they said. Chilling: British jihadists in a recruitment video aimed at youngsters in the UK . The call was made by leaders from different Islamic theological backgrounds and was echoed by imams during Friday prayers. It came as claims emerged yesterday that up to three Al Qaeda instructors tutored by master bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri are believed to have slipped in to Syria to teach British and other Europeans jihadists to make ‘stealth bombs’. And a British man who claims he has been fighting in Syria told the BBC he will not return to the UK until he can raise ‘the black flag of Islam’ over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace. Speaking with a northern accent, the man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had received military training, making bombs and fighting with the extremist Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al Qaeda. He claimed to have been fighting for the establishment of a caliphate – which he referred to by the Arabic term Khilafah – across the Islamic world. ‘There is nothing in Britain – it is just pure evil,’ he said. Threat: The call came as it emerged three Al Qaeda instructors tutored by master bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri could be teaching in Britain . ‘If and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah – this Islamic state – comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower Bridge and over Big Ben. I don’t want to come back to what I have left behind.’ Osama said he initially faced opposition from his family but they now ‘understand that this is a good cause I am in’. It emerged yesterday that there are already believed to be three Al Qaeda instructors trained in bomb-making in Syria. It is feared they are poised to tutor young British Muslims who have travelled there in the art of making ‘invisible bombs’ – non-metallic devices that can get past airport scanners and can even be stitched inside a suicide bomber’s body. Security officers are said to have identified more than 100 of the 600 Britons currently fighting in Syria while US investigators have given their UK counterparts ‘dozens of names of interest’. However the US, which has demanded increased security at British airports, also accused the UK of ignoring for too long the threat posed by men like Osama. Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defence under Ronald Reagan, said British governments ‘turned a blind eye’ to recruitment operations and ‘embraced extremists’. He said of the Western jihadists in Iraq and Syria: ‘What they learn there are the skill sets to bring violence to us.’","Some 100 imams asked the UK's young Muslim community against leaving .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . ‘Out, damned spot! out, I say!’, cried Lady Macbeth after she had murdered King Duncan. 400-years later and Lady Macbeths’ torment are still echoed by huge numbers of people who feel dirty even when they are physically clean. Often this is a result of physical and emotional trauma, according to Stanley Rachman, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. Compulsive washing can occur in people who have suffered a physical or emotional trauma, such as betrayal . He claims this ‘mental contamination’ is caused by feelings such as degradation, humiliation, hurtful criticism and betrayal. In a recent editorial in the journal Nature, he says: ‘The source of the pollution is not an external contaminant such as blood or dirt, but human interaction. ‘The affected person develops strong feelings of contamination that are evoked by direct contact with the violator or indirect contacts such as memories, images or reminders of the violation.’ Often, people are unwilling or unable to speak the name of the violator. 400-years after Lady Macbeth obsessed over her cleanliness due to guilt, her torment is still echoed by huge numbers of people who feel dirty when they are physically clean. Actors Eric Jackson Bradley and Tori Sparks perform the parts of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in a New York production . Professor Rachman led a study of 50 young women who had been sexually assaulted. Many of the women reported feeling ‘polluted’ after the assault and engaged in compulsive washing. A substantial minority continued to feel unclean for months afterward. ‘This discovery has large and immediate implications for clinical treatment,’ said Professor Rachman. For instance a common technique to treat compulsive washing is something called exposure and response prevention, where patients are exposed to unclean objects. The therapy aims to untangle the psychological 'conditioned' association between fear and the source of the fear. The idea that it is possible to wash away our sins is deep rooted in many cultures and religions, including Christianity. For instance, Pontius Pilate washed his hands after condemning Jesus to death . Previous research has found that the areas of the brain that deal with physical cleanliness likely overlap with those that process psychological purity. For instance, a number of research teams have been able to establish a clear link between not only washing hands to clear trauma, but also by those who want to absolve guilt. The idea that it is possible to wash away our sins is deep rooted in many cultures and religions, including Christianity. Water is a cornerstone of baptism ceremonies and, in the Bible, Pontius Pilate washed his hands after condemning Jesus to death. ‘If the effects of the therapy are confirmed, it would have a major impact,’ writes Professor Rachman. ‘We would at last be able to treat the many patients who are currently, like Lady Macbeth, beyond our help.’","Causes include degradation, humiliation, hurtful criticism and betrayal .

"By . Alex Greig . The Jets fan who was caught on camera punching a woman in the face after Sunday's game against the Patriots has been revealed as an ex-con who served three years in prison for the stabbing death of a 17-year-old boy. Kurt Paschke, 38, a lifelong New York Jets fan, punched a small blond woman, square in the face during a post-match brawl. Following a furor after it was posted on social media, investigations have revealed that Paschke, then 17, was convicted of criminally negligent homicide and sentenced to three years in jail for the stabbing death of Henri Ferrer during a fight outside a pizzeria in Sayville, New York in 1992. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jets generations: Kurt Paschke (back left) is pictured with friends and family including his mother, Colleen (front left) The Jets Mobile: Paschke (left) has a van he has decked out with Jets paraphernalia that he drives to home games . Violent past: Paschke (right) seems to have channeled his energies into a love of all things New York Jets, but his passions overwhelmed him Sunday when he was involved in a brawl . According to the New York Post, Paschke was originally charged with murder but was convicted of the lesser crime. 'I am deeply sorry,' Paschke said at . the time of his sentencing in 1995. 'I can honestly say I never sought . the confrontation, but when it came, I did what I had to do.' The father of the deceased told the New York Post that Paschke 'got off . lightly' for the stabbing of his son because Paschke's father was a . Suffolk County police officer. 'I wrote the judge a letter, that this guy is going to kill again,' Robert Ferrer, 80, told the New York Post. 'He killed for no reason. He went out . of his way to get a knife to stab my son. My son was involved in a fist . fight and he went out to get a knife and stabbed my son. They were the . same age. They were the same size. He had no business killing my son.' Dragged away: The man in the number 80 green jersey is already being removed from the brawl by another man . Angry: This blonde woman seen in the red and white jersey advances towards the Jets fan . Hit: The blonde woman reels back as she is punched in the face by the large man . Friends of Paschke are quick to defend the bartender's actions on Sunday. 'He would never go after anybody if there wasn’t a reason,' said Ward Roser, 52. 'It looks like the girl went after him, not the other way around. He would never hit a lady.' The video shows a large man wearing camouflage shorts and a Wayne Chrebet jersey being hauled away from the crowd by another man. A blond woman, who has been identified as Patriots fan Jaclyn Nugent by the New York Post, advances towards him then reels back as she is punched squarely in the nose. The woman seems relatively unperturbed for someone who has just been punched by a man twice her size. She nonchalantly wipes her nose with her arm as the man who punched her is pulled away. Two law enforcement sources told NBC 4 New York that they expect charges against Paschke to be announced Tuesday. It's . unclear what started the brawl, but a new rule that helped the Jets . clinch the victory may have had something to do with it. According to Newsday, the new rule stipulates that a player may not push a teammate into the opponent's formation. The rule was brought to bear when Patriot Chris Jones pushed his teammate Will Svitek forward in an attempt to block the kick. After Jones was penalized, the Jets got 15 yards closer and Nick Folk made a 42-yeard game-winning kick . A Jets team spokesperson released a statement saying, 'We . are aware of the situation, and we do not tolerate that behavior. Parties involved were detained, and this matter is now in the hands of . the New Jersey State Police.' Hard hit: The force of the punch sends her staggering several feet backward . Recovering: The woman can be seen to the right of this frame rubbing her face with her arm . The New York Daily News spoke to Paschke's mother, who says her son punched Nugent to protect her. Colleen Paschke was at the game with her son and daughter on Sunday, in which the Jets bested the Patriots 30-27. 'He’s the victim, really,' she told the New York Daily News from her home. 'He was just concerned for his mother and himself.' Colleen Paschke says that from the beginning of the game she and her children were heckled by a group of Patriots fans. Those same fans, of whom Nugent was one, allegedly set upon the Paschkes as they were leaving the stadium. 'He was just hitting back to defend himself,' she said. 'It wasn't done deliberately. If you see the video, they just went wild.' Colleen Paschke told the Daily News that when Nugent left, she flicked blood - blood drawn by Kurt Paschke - at her. Paschke's Facebook page features pictures of his beloved Jets-themed van, named the Jets Mobile, and and, interestingly, an anti-bullying slogan. The court of public opinion, however, seems to be weighed heavily against Paschke. 'Leave it to a Jets fan to punch a chick in the face after a game,' wrote one. 'You guys can’t handle a win?' 'The Jets exemplify dignity and class #saidNoOne,' tweeted another. As of Monday evening, Paschke has not been charged with a crime. The New Jersey Police Department is investigating the incident.","The male New York Jets fan who punched a woman in the face after Sunday's game has been identified .

"By . James Tozer . They say no publicity is bad publicity. But when images of a £180-an-hour escort posing beside a four-poster bed in one of their plushest suites were posted online, bosses at an 18th century country house hotel reacted with horror to the unwanted plug. Posing in little more than her underwear and a string of pearls, the sex worker - who calls herself Helen Jones - touts for work showing herself lounging seductively in the £190-a-night wood-panelled Mahogany Suite of the Soughton Hall Hotel. No doubt the historic surroundings are intended to appeal to prospective clients of the 40-year-old, who claims to be a qualified accountant. Caught out: High-end call girl Helen Jones posing for advertising snaps in Soughton hall's Mahogony Suite . Certainly one satisfied customer was delighted with the service she offered, posting online: ‘If there were qualifications for escorts, Helen would definitely be PhD material. The arrangements were perfect.’ However managers at the family-owned hotel near Northop, Flintshire - close to the home of footballer Michael Owen - were less than impressed when shown the results of the unauthorised photoshoot. They are now trying to get the pictures removed from the website. Room service: Jones promises punters a 'discreet' service, but her promotional pictures have already attracted attention from the hotel's owners . ‘We were totally blown away - we are really shocked,’ general manager Annette Gallop said yesterday. ‘We’re going to try our best to get this removed from her website. We have never come across this before now.’ When asked for her part why she chose Soughton Hall for her photoshoot, Ms Jones said: ‘No reason other than (it’s) a nice hotel.’ On her site she describes herself as an ‘independent companion’ available for dates with ‘executive white and blue collar workers’. She proclaims: ‘I have an excellent reputation as a genuine, high class, personable and friendly personal dating service.’ The site is liberally illustrated with glamour modelling-style pictures in which Ms Jones demurely turns her face away from the camera. She describes herself as ‘almost 6ft bare-footed’ and with a figure ‘in perfect proportion to my height’, adding that she has been ‘blessed with a body that is naturally fit and lithe’. While ‘quite shy’, she says she has ‘impeccable manners’ and enjoys ‘good food and wines’, the theatre and horse-racing. She will only see clients aged over 35, giving them the option of coming to her apartment, going to their home, or visiting their hotel suite. Explaining the arrangements for meeting at a date’s hotel, she assures them she knows ‘discretion is paramount’, adding: ‘A tall, immaculately groomed, slim, well-dressed lady might turn heads - for all the right reasons - whereas a less discreet escort visiting you is sure to attract the wrong sort of attention!’ Plush: The suite will normally cost punters £190 per night . For a home visit, she will arrive in a business suit, she adds, rather than ‘tottering up your garden path - make-up by Ronald McDonald, and swinging a handbag!’ Clients have to pay £180-an-hour for her services. Overnight meetings of 12 hours cost £850, while a 24-hour ‘date’ with Ms Jones costs £1,500. She stresses they are paying for her ‘time and companionship’ and that ‘any consensual sexual activity that occurs is a private matter between individuals’. In comments on her site, one satisfied client describes how: ‘I opened the door to be greeted by this Amazonian-type woman. ‘The pictures on her site are genuine but in no way prepare you for seeing her in the flesh, so to speak. ‘She is blond, almost 6ft tall, so you can imagine the legs, but in splendid proportion, with a great figure and is also really pretty.’ Another wrote: ‘Very tall! Attractive and with a body stolen from an athlete 15 years younger. Annette Gallop, general manager of Soughton Hall, said: ¿We were totally blown away - we are really shocked,¿ . ‘Helen’s only priority was that I enjoyed our time together and in that she succeeded brilliantly.’ While a third commented: ‘Woody Allen once said that the brain was his second favourite organ. To spend an evening where both were fully engaged was a delight.’ According to Soughton Hall Hotel’s website, the Mahogany Suite is ‘elegant... with large mahogany four poster bed with views over rear gardens and parkland beyond’. The hotel dates back to 1714 and was originally built as a Bishop’s Palace, with former guests said to have included a chaplain to Queen Victoria.","Sex worker took snaps in wood panelled suite of Soughton Hall Hotel .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Two British soldiers died in a fire at Camp Bastion after a series of shocking safety failures, an inquest will hear this week. Privates Robert Wood, 28, and Dean Hutchinson, 23, lost their lives when flames swept through  a logistical centre at the Helmand province HQ on the night of Valentine’s Day 2011. Witnesses at the two-week inquest will tell a coroner that the office where Royal Logistics Corps troops were working and sleeping had no fire alarm and that the only exit they could have used to escape the blaze had also been sealed, leaving them trapped inside. Private Dean Hutchinson, 23, died in a fire in an logistics tent at Camp Bastion on Valentine's Day in 2011 . Last night, Pte Wood’s widow Becky Day, 33, said: ‘Rob died because of a series of safety failures which should have been addressed. 'If he had been shot or blown up I would accept that but he died in an entirely preventable fire and that is totally different. 'A lot of basic procedures were ignored for many weeks before this incident and nothing was done.’ An inquest will be told that Mr Hitchinson and Robert Wood, 28, who died alongside him were trapped in the tent after the only exit was blocked . Privates Wood and Hutchinson – plus one survivor – were sleeping in the tented office so they could respond more quickly when vital supplies arrived.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A decorated New York police officer was found intoxicated and nearly naked in a random woman’s apartment earlier this month only hours after receiving the department’s second-highest honor. Four-year NYPD veteran Eugene Donnelly, 27, received the Police Combat Cross June 10 for bravery while off-duty during a shooting. He was then stripped of his gun and shield that evening. Donnelly, stationed in a Bronx precinct near Fordham University, was so drunk he wandered into the stranger’s apartment wearing only his underwear, sources told the New York Daily News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Just hours earlier: Eugene Donnelly at One Police Plaza after receiving his medal, just hours before reportedly ending up in a woman's apartment wearing only his underwear . ‘He was apparently drinking,’ a police source told the paper. ‘He was celebrating. He went to stay with a friend.’ The officer is believed to have been celebrating in the hours after shaking Mayor Bill de Blasio’s hand while receiving the award in a ceremony at City Hall. Donnelly was staying at a friend’s apartment in Woodlawn, in the northern Bronx, when he somehow managed to leave the residence and ended up inside the woman’s apartment. The woman lived in the same building, and police say she accused him of getting into a physical altercation with her, according to the Daily News. ‘He has an encounter with a female, and she claims he roughed her up,’ a police source said. ‘He was in his underwear when this happened.’ High praise: Donnelly shook Mayor Bill de Blasio's hand as he received the NYPD's second-highest medal for bravery . At attention: The now-disgraced officer stands in formation before the medal ceremony . Melvin Hernandez, spokesman for the Bronx district attorney’s office, told the Daily News his office is looking into the matter. The Internal Affairs Bureau is also involved in the investigation. Donnelly’s defense attorney shot down the claims in comments to the paper. ‘The case is in the beginning of the investigation,’ lawyer Stu London said. ‘When a thorough investigation has been completed, it will be obvious that my client engaged in no criminal wrongdoing.’ Donnelly was awarded the medal just over two years after he arrested a teen gunman terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood in May 2012. He was off-duty while driving with a friend to meet his partner when several men ran from a park while being chased by a gun-wielding Javon Julien. Julien, 19, fired a shot at the men while running past Donnelly’s car. The cop shouted at Julien to stop, but the teen instead shot out Donnelly’s driver’s side mirror. The officer fired back, striking Julien four times before chasing down and arresting him. Julien was given eight years in prison for his shooting spree. The Bronx DA is still deciding whether to file charges against Donnelly.","Eugene Donnelly received the Police Combat Cross on June 10 for heroic actions in a 2012 shootout with a Bronx teen .

"By . Snejana Farberov . The husband of a California mother accused of stabbing to death her three young daughters has spoken out in her defense, saying that his wife's undiagnosed postpartum depression was to blame for the tragedy. Carol Coronado, 30, has pleaded not guilty to murder charges in the deaths of her  children, Sophia, 3, Yazmine, 1, and two-month-old Xenia. The Torrance, California, woman, is also accused of trying to kill her own mother after stabbing her daughters May 20.

Anatomy of a tragedy: Rudy Coronado (left) says if it were not for postpartum depression, his wife Carol, pictured right with their eldest daughter, Sophia, would have never killed their three kids . Angels: Sophia, 3 (left), Yazmine, 1 (right), and two-month-old Xenia (center) were found stabbed to death in their Torrance, California, home in May . Carol Coronado's defense team has retained the services of a psychologist who will examine her for any signs of postpartum depression. 'I'm not a doctor but I know for a fact that was that disease, and it wasn't my wife,' Rudy Coronado told NBC Los Angeles Thursday. The grieving father revealed that there had been many warning signs before the murders, but he did not know how to read them. ‘That's the reason why we need to bring awareness to [postpartum depression] because I was never educated on nothing like this,’ Mr Coronado said. ‘I didn't have a clue.’ He added that if it were not for the psychosis, his wife would not have hurt anyone 'in a million years.'

"By . Mark Prigg . Just days after it bought Beats, the headphone firm founded by Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine, Apple has revealed plans to abandon the headphone socket and make consumers buy headphones with a new connector. Apple's plans allow headphone makers to use the Lightning socket normally used for charging and adding accessories. The firm is expected to use the Beats brand to launch the first headphones to use the connector. Scroll down for video . Apple recently bought Beats, the headphone and music firm set up by Dr Dre (pictured) and Jimmy Iovine. Now it is expected to use the firm to create headphones that connect via the lightning port, bypassing the headphone socket. Beats was founded in 2008 by Dr. Dre, now a hip-hop producer, and Iovine, a longtime recording industry executive who is currently chairman of Universal Music Group's Interscope Geffen A&M Records. It now dominates the luxury headphone market. Its equipment also has been a big seller in Apple's stores. Operating from its Culver City, California, headquarters, Beats commands 62 percent of the $1 billion U.S. market for headphones priced above $100, according to NPD Group. The gear, which emphasizes bass, also has been endorsed by several star athletes, including San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and New Jersey Nets forward Kevin Garnett. Beats Music, the music streaming subsidiary of the electronics maker, has more than 250,000 subscribers, according to Cook. According to 9to5mac, Apple revealed the new system earlier this week. 'We’ve learned Apple has quietly introduced a new specification for manufacturers in its Made-For-iPhone/iPad/iPod (MFi) program that allows them to create headphones that connect to iOS devices using a Lightning connector instead of the usual 3.5mm headphone jack,' the site said. The Lightning headphones will be capable of receiving lossless stereo 48 kHz digital audio output from Apple devices and sending mono 48 kHz digital audio input. The input means that the headphones will also support a microphone for audio input following Apple’s upcoming update. Manufacturers will be able to add buttons to launch apps. Headphones will also be able to draw power from the phone - useful for noise cancelling features, for instance. A previous report claimed Apple was working on a version of its own in-ear EarPods using a Lightning connector and planned to enable higher-resolution audio playback in iOS 8. The $3bn acquisition of Beats is by far the most expensive in Apple's 38-year history, and comes three weeks after the deal was first rumoured - although the initial price was believed to be $3.2bn. Apple Boss Tim Cook revealed the deal, saying 'We have known these guys forever, we've dated, we've gone steady and now we are getting married.' Beats by Apple, from left to right, music entrepreneur and Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Beats co-founder Dr. Dre, and Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue pose together at Apple headquarters in Cupertino as Cook revealed Apple's $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics . 'I’ve always known in my heart that Beats belonged with Apple,' said Jimmy Iovine. As part of the acquisition, Beats co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will join Apple. 'The idea when we started the company was inspired by Apple’s unmatched ability to marry culture and technology. Apple’s deep commitment to music fans, artists, songwriters and the music industry is something special.' The price consists of $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in Apple stock that will vest over an unspecified time period. The deal is expected to close before the end of September. It is believed Apple is also interested in Beats expertise in developing wearable products and it edges closer to a much anticipated iWatch launch, . With $1.1 billion in revenue last year, Beats is already making money and will boost Apple's earnings once the new fiscal year begins in October, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview. 'This relationship started a decade ago, so we know there is an incredible cultural fit. 'These two guys have a very rare set of skills. It's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach. It's that rare.' Iovine, 61, and Dre, 49, will both become key executives in Apple's music divisions, though Cook said their roles haven't been determined yet. Cook said Beats' music streaming service was the main selling point in the deal. Beats headphones are sold along side iPods in an Apple store -Apple plans to roll them out across the world . The growing popularity of music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify has been reducing sales of songs and albums, a business that iTunes has dominated for the past decade. U.S. sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $1.4 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.","Firm recently bought headphone maker Beats for $3bn .

The 16-year-old had been using heroin for several months before the family went on a Christmas holiday to visit relatives in Miami, hoping it would break her addiction. Sasha Steadman, 16, was found dead by her mother at their home in Bromley, Kent, on January 28 this year . After staying clean for three weeks, . Sasha’s tolerance levels were reduced when she returned to Bromley, . Kent, leaving her body unable to cope with the fatal injection on . January 28 this year. Croydon . Coroner’s Court in South London was told the teenager had been using a . special computer router which gives users unencrypted access to ‘dark . web’ illegal sites, such as Silk Road, which sell drugs. Sasha had admitted to taking heroin about four times a week to her mother . Her . mother Claire Shaw said at the time of her death: ‘These sites fed her . impressionable mind with their damning gospel of darkness, grooming her . to perform what they wanted. 'They must be stopped.’ Mrs Shaw also revealed that Sasha had become obsessed with images of self-harm on social media sites. She . told the inquest she found out Sasha had been taking heroin the . previous November when she found drugs paraphernalia in her bedroom. Sasha admitted taking the class A substance about four times a week. Mrs . Shaw sought help from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, . which was already supporting Sasha over her depression. In . January 2013 the Orpington College student was experiencing low moods . when she visited her GP and had self-harmed by cutting her wrists. But a . year later, after returning from the holiday, it was felt her condition . had improved, as she had been clean for three weeks. Mrs . Shaw told the inquest: ‘She seemed to be doing really well for just . over a week when she came back … we were hoping she had turned a . corner.’ Describing the day of Sasha’s death, she said: ‘There was . nothing out of the ordinary … she was meant to go to college so I asked . her if she was going but she shook her head and I said OK.’ Mrs Shaw returned at 3.30pm, called Sasha and got no response, but didn’t check on her for another hour, the inquest heard. The art student's mother Claire Shaw said before the inquest that her daughter regularly visited photo-sharing social media sites where users post images on self-harm, suicide, drug abuse and eating disorders . She said: ‘She was lying on the bed. 'I took the needle out, it was in her arm. There was a sachet of drugs near her.’ Tributes were left outside the family's home in Bromley, Kent . A . statement by psychiatrist Dr Peter Hollis said: ‘It seemed to us that . she was self-medicating using heroin … to relieve stress and improve her . mood.’ Police found two . envelopes of heroin by the side of Sasha’s bed. Sergeant Gary Schofield . told the inquest that a search of her computer revealed she had been . searching for ‘heroin usage and how to cook heroin’. Expert analysis of the computer found she had also been ‘searching suicide on YouTube’. She . knew how to ensure her parents could not look at her search history and . used a web browser with a special router to gain access to sites . including Silk Road, the inquest heard. Coroner . Dr Serena Lynch, recording a verdict of accidental drug-related death, . said: ‘On January 28 Sasha injected herself with heroin at her home . without intending to die. 'It is absolutely heartbreaking … It seems . sometimes she was more concerned with helping others and not making . difficulties for other people.’ Silk . Road Market Place, launched in early 2011, allows users to trade drugs, . fake documents and other illegal items anonymously. It was shut down by . the FBI in October 2013 but is now running again. In the last month it . had 13,648 drugs listings. It is not known where Sasha bought the drugs . that killed her.","Sasha Steadman was found dead by her mother at their home in Kent .
