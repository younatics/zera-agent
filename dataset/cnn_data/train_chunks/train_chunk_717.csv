Horsewoman Jessica Mills was ordered to pay £1,500 in compensation to the teenager for damaging his car with her riding crop . A horsewoman was so enraged when a teenager beeped his horn as she rode down a country lane she beat his car with her riding crop. Jessica Mills was concerned her horse, Billie Bob, would be spooked when 18-year-old Jacob Knox sounded the horn of his £30,000 Audi A5 near the village of Mottram St Andrew in Cheshire. After a heated exchange, the 29-year-old threw the leather crop at the vehicle, a court heard. The teenage entrepreneur claimed the incident caused £1,700 worth of damage to the windscreen and bonnet of his new car, and told  police Ms Mills had used her horse as 'a weapon' during their encounter. Ms Mills has been forced to pay £1,500 compensation to Knox, who has three penalty points on his license for using a mobile phone while driving, after admitting criminal damage. The waitress, who lives on a farm in Woodford said she has been made to feel like a criminal for trying to protect herself and her horse. Macclesfield Magistrates' Court heard how the incident unfolded as the 18-year-old tried to overtake Ms Mills who was riding with a friend, Samantha Chesters, in June. Prosecuting Debbie Byrne said: 'He drove behind them for around 30 seconds before trying to overtake. 'He then saw the horse move towards the middle of the road blocking his . route. He beeped his horn to make sure the rider was aware of his . presence but Mills began shouting. 'He tried to pass the horses and he saw Mills grab the whip. He . accelerated as she threw her whip and shouted. The whip cracked his . windscreen and bonnet.' But, eyewitness Miss Chesters told the court: 'I knew the Audi was behind us because I could hear the engine. Jessica Mills, pictured at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court (right), said she has been made to feel like a criminal for what she described as trying to protect herself and her horse . 'It slowed and followed us for seconds before I heard a 2-3 second horn. The Audi was two metres behind the back legs of the horses. 'Jessica and I had a brief conversation about the driver and she turned . her horse round so she was facing in the opposite direction and started . to approach the Audi. 'He started to reverse and ended up four cars away from his original . position. She followed it and shouted for the driver. She was saying how . dangerous it was to beep the horn and how they could have got scared. 'She eventually returned and we both spoke about how ridiculous it was and carried on. The court heard how the Audi then . returned and passed the two women 'at speed'. Miss Chesters recalled how . it was at this point her friend 'threw her whip' which landed on the . car's roof and 'bounced off'. 'When it got ahead of us it angled itself across the road so we couldn’t . get by. He refused to get out and there was a lot of shouting between . her and the driver. Jacob Knox, 18, arrives at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court with his face covered. The entrepreneur said he wanted 'someone to pay for the damage caused' to his Audi A5 . 'He then got out and walked towards us. The driver then told Jessica to . ring the police as she had damaged his vehicle. I asked where the damage . was and he said ‘here’ and pointed to the windscreen and bonnet. 'The damage was low down and looked like it had been caused earlier. The . whole incident lasted for two minutes and was uncalled for. 'The driver of the car was totally inconsiderate as he had no reason to . beep his horn and he shouldn’t have driven past us as fast.' In a different version of events, internet entrepreneur Knox said: 'I waited behind the horses until the road was clear so started to overtake the horses as a normal person would. 'I did sound the horn when I was overtaking because they were not concentrating they were chatting so the horse moved over onto the white line so I was on the embankment so I had to let them know I was next to it. The experienced horsewoman claims she asked the teenager if he was aware of the highway code before throwing her crop at his car. She feared her horse would spook after Jacob Knox beeped his horn . A lawyer representing Ms Mills told Macclesfield Magistrates' Court (pictured) the encounter was 'a meeting of minds' 'As I beeped the horn I was called rude names. She started walking her horse towards me and it was very close and she was using it to intimidate me. After I reversed and got a bit of distance she calmed down but then wouldn’t let me past on purpose out of spite. 'There was enough room to pass. When I went to overtake she was still calling me rude names and as I went past I saw her lift up her riding whip with a metal handle and she threw it at the car and it hit the bonnet, windscreen and roof. I heard a really loud bang and saw the windscreen crack and realised what happened. 'The car is a 2010 Audi A5. I’ve had . it since February this year. The car was spotless with no damage . whatsoever. It’s a really nice car, I love it. 'I . worked hard to afford it so I take good care of it. I’m not sure if it . was appropriate to beep but I was making them aware of my presence. I . have written an apology letter for beeping my horn.' The incident was described by the defendant's lawyer as 'a meeting of minds' during which the teenage driver 'lost patience'. The . incident which bears a slight resemblance to a Fawlty Towers sketch in . which beloved character, Basil, beats his little red car in a fit of . rage after many failed attempts to park. The incident bears some resemblance to Fawlty Towers sketch in which Basil beats his car with a tree branch in a fit of rage . The reality of the situation is no laughing matter for Ms Mills however who, speaking after the case, said: 'At the time I asked him if he knew the High Way Code and suggested he go back home to learn it. 'I was only protecting my horse and I am very upset at what’s happened. I haven’t ridden since, I have tried to sit on a horse but I can’t. I am now at a point where I am that scared of something happening I can’t ride. 'Riders have to be more aware of cars and riders have to be polite and I am always courteous. But cars have to be aware that horses are wild animals and have their own minds and I wish motorists would understand.' Mr Knox said: 'I just want someone to pay for the damage they have caused. She did throw the whip and I beeped my horn but I was the calm one.'","Jessica Mills threw riding crop at teen's £30,000 Audi A5 when he beeped his horn .

"By . Tara Brady . PUBLISHED: . 02:29 EST, 21 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:44 EST, 21 May 2013 . A British mountaineer has reached the peak of Everest for a record-breaking eleventh time. Kenton Cool scaled the mountain as part of a challenge to reach three summits in one continuous climb. The 39-year-old, who lives in Quenington, Gloucestershire, is the first person ever to achieve the feat reaching the three peaks in three days. Scroll down for video . Mr Cool: Kenton scaled Everest as part of a challenge to reach three summits in one continuous climb . The three peaks he scaled were Everest (8,848m), Nuptse (7,861m), and Lhotse (8,516m). All three form what is called the Western CWM - a wall of rock and ice that is part of the route to Everest. An update yesterday on his Facebook page said he and climbing partner Dorje Gylgen were 'feeling strong'. At noon he tweeted: 'KC Update: Lhotse has been summited. Descent hard. 3 summits in 3 days. Finishing line in sight.' Reaching new heights: The three peaks Kenton Cool scaled were Everest, Nuptse, and Lhotse . The treble: Kenton Cool and Dorje Gylgen in their tent in Everest . The climbs have been described as a fitting tribute to Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay who reached the 29,035-foot summit of Everest on May 29, 1953, becoming the first people to stand atop the world's highest mountain. This week will mark the 60th anniversary of the ascent. Mr Cool last year took one of the 1924 Olympic medals to the summit of Everest to fulfill a pledge by one of the Everest pioneers - 1922 expedition deputy leader, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Strutt. Kenton Cool last year took one of the 1924 Olympic medals to the summit of Everest . He said: 'In 1894 Baron Pierre de Coubertin reconstituted the modern Olympic movement and made a deliberate choice to include our sport of climbing. 'He felt so strongly about climbing's inclusion that in 1924 he personally awarded the first ever Olympic gold medals for mountaineering, and in 2012 I fulfilled the subsequent promise made by Great Britain to Baron Pierre de Coubertin and the IOC to place one of the 1924 mountaineering Olympic gold medals on to the summit of the world's highest mountain 'for all humanity'. 'Climbing is the very essence of everything Baron Pierre de Coubertin meant when he wrote the Olympic motto of 'higher, faster, stronger', and it was there on the very first day of the modern Olympics. 'May 29, 2013 will be a momentous day for climbing. It is the 60th anniversary of the first successful summit of Mount Everest and it is the date the IFSC will present their case to the IOC. I'm backing the bid.' Climbing in the Olympics would be different to scaling Everest - competition climbing takes place on man-made walls and the IFSC is proposing a multi-discipline 'triathlon' of speed, lead climbing and bouldering. The bid is also being supported by Dame Kelly Holmes. She said: 'The proposed triathlon format for Sport Climbing's bid for the 2020 Olympic Games sounds like a great concept. 'I know climbing is very popular with young people and the format fits perfectly with the Olympic motto of Faster, Higher and Stronger. 'I know the case for inclusion in the Olympic Games is becoming tougher all the time, it could go down to the wire when the final choice is made by the IOC in September. Hopefully the general public will see that Sport Climbing has a big future ahead.'","The 39-year-old, from Gloucestershire, is the first person to achieve the feat .

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 23:21 EST, 14 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:32 EST, 15 December 2013 . A Maryland woman who lost her 15-month-old son last year and whose former fiance has been charged with murder gave birth to a daughter almost one year to the day after the death of her son. Police say Joaquin Shadow Rams, 40, drowned his infant son Prince during an unsupervised visit in his Virginia home last October ordered by the court, despite Hera McLeod's protests. McLeod, 33, chose to be a single mother to her second child; she does not know the father of her daughter, who was conceived via artificial insemination. Joy after sorrow: Hera McLeod with her baby daughter Estela Annabelle McLeod . She says that being a single mother . is far less terrifying than having to co-parent with a man she met on . Match.com, a man who would eventually be charged with the murder of . their child and who has now been charged with a further murder and is being . investigated for a third. After . the death of Prince, McLeod's friends and family were concerned she was . behaving irrationally out of grief, or trying to replace her beloved . son by having another baby by herself. McLeod told the Washington Post . that she knew she couldn’t stop being a mother, that she wanted another . child - but the idea of dating again or leaving her child's fate up to . the authorities that so failed Prince filled her with horror. 'Though . I have lived through one of the worst tragedies I can imagine, part of . honoring my son is knowing that I must also continue to choose love and . happiness,' McLeod wrote on her blog Capuccino Queen after revealing the pregnancy. 'My decision to have my daughter was one of the first steps I took on my personal journey.' McLeod's daughter Estela Annabelle McLeod was born October 30. The tiny girl is called a 'diva' by her mother and is doing well. Rams . has pleaded not guilty in the death of Prince, who authorities say Rams . drowned on October 20, 2012 in an attempt to cash in on three separate . life insurance policies he had taken out on Prince's life amounting to . $560,000. He . has also been charged in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend Shawn Katrina . Mason, the mother of his first son, who died in 2003. According to the Washington Post, he mistakenly . believed he was the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on her life . also. McLeod met Rams through Match.com in February 2010. 'I . was approaching 30 and wondering if I would ever meet my soul-mate, or . even if I had a soul-mate at all,' she told the Washington Post. McLeod was initially put off by Rams' scruffy appearance but was soon charmed. He . took her to lunch, sang to her and told her how he had been left to . raise his son after the death of the child's mother in an accident. Never forgotten: Prince McLeod died October 21, 2012, during a visit with his father Joaquin Rams who has since been charged with his murder . Unsupervised: Joaquin Shadow Rams was allowed visits without supervision with his son (pictured, right, with Hera McLeod) by a judge . McLeod would discover much later that . in fact, Rams' ex-girlfriend Shawn Mason had been shot in the face and . that Rams himself was a prime suspect. Rams told McLeod that after many bad dates, he was hoping to meet someone and settle down. He . also claimed he owned a successful software consulting firm, and was an . aspiring R 'n' B singer who had interest from major labels. Rams also . shaved five years off his actual age. But McLeod was taken in - he drove an expensive car, lived in a large home and never seemed to be short of money. McLeod, . who has a Masters degree in special education and works as an . intelligence analyst for a defense contractor, fell pregnant by accident . and two months later Rams proposed to her. He . and his pre-teen son had been drawn into the family by McLeod, and . though her mother wasn't enamored of Rams, she didn't want to alienate . her daughter, who seemed so happy and in love. Mary . McLeod told the Washington Post that 'one always has to be careful . about what one says about the person their child has fallen in love . with.' McLeod said that things began to go downhill after she became engaged to Rams and moved into his home. He . complained about bills but he never seemed to work. His musical career was non-existent and he was charged after his son told a school . counselor that his father hit him. The charges were eventually dismissed and McLeod put it down to the boy being angry with his father and trying to get revenge. Tutu cute: McLeod dotes on her new baby daughter was born after the tragic death of her son, who McLeod says dresses better than her . 'I had grown up with a mother and father who had been married for longer than I was alive and who would stay married until the day one of them dies,' she told the Washington Post. 'I hung on because I didn’t want to admit that this man was not the family man I had dreamed of. I guess I was afraid of losing that dream. I guess I was afraid of raising a baby myself.' When Prince was born in July 2011, McLeod was overjoyed. But two weeks later, her parents arrived on her doorstep with an unthinkable allegation: Rams had raped her 19-year-old sister. Charges against Rams in that case were dismissed but the Prince William police department is reviewing its handling of the case. It was enough for McLeod. She fled the house with her son. It was only during the ensuing custody battle that McLeod discovered Rams was a suspect in the death of Shawn Mason. She also discovered he was literally not who he said he was: Rams changed his name from John Ramirez in 2002. His only income was social security and the money he received in insurance after the death of his mother. The Washington Post reports that a Prince William social worker noted after the death of Shawn Mason: 'This worker has never interviewed anyone like Mr. Rams. It is not known if Mr. Rams’ stories are real to him or if he is just attempting to impress, but he clearly does not exhibit normal behavior.' The Washington Post reports that Rams was a suspect in the death a decade ago - and yet he was still able to gain unsupervised visits with his son. He was indicted on murder and other charges in the case of Shawn Mason in November. Little Prince: McLeod with her first-born, who died after an unsupervised visit with his father . The final murder Rams is implicated in is that of his own mother, whose death by suffocation in a plastic bag was originally deemed suicide. The case has since been reopened. In a statement released in May, Rams . denied killing Prince: 'I did not harm my son. It breaks my heart to . think that anyone would believe that I did. I’m still shocked to learn . how sick he was.' McLeod . is using her tragedy to try to change the system that she feels failed . utterly to do its job: Protect her baby son. She has spoken at a . Congressional briefing on 'Protecting Abused Children of Divorce and . Separation' and writes extensively on the topic on her blog. Rams' guilt or innocence has yet to be established by a court, but with a . long list of suspicious behavior, including an arrest for beating his . older son, an accusation of rape by McLeod's own younger sister, lies . about his age, producing pornography in his home and being a prime . suspect in the shooting death of his former lover, that any court could . allow unsupervised visits beggars belief. The Montgomery Circuit Court judfge Michael Algeo said there was no evidence, only implication of Rams' illegal activity which was all 'a lot of smoke.' McLeod was awarded sole custody of Prince, and Rams was given weekly supervised visits. But after a psychologist testified that Rams was fit to look after his child, he was allowed unsupervised visits. On the fourth visit, Prince died. According to the Washington Post, when the baby was brought into the hospital, staff notified Child Protective Services citing 'obvious unexplainable injuries.' An autopsy discovered 'small bruises and abrasions on the face and upper chest and back' and 'fluid in the sinuses, airways, lungs and intestines.' He was found to have died by drowning. McLeod's decision to have a baby as a single mother was made so that a judge will never have the power to make her hand over her child, against every maternal instinct that she has, to someone who might harm her.","Hera McLeod, 33, gave birth to a daughter, Estela, in October .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:58 EST, 16 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:47 EST, 16 December 2013 . A German family of evangelical Christians who came to the U.S. in order to legally homeschool their children has appealed a ruling to deport them. Uwe and Hannelore Romeike are the parents of six children who they wish to home school according their religious beliefs. Home schooling is against the law in Germany, where all children must attend school. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Denied: The Romeike family, pictured here in front of Cincinnati courthouse, fled Germany in order to continue homeschooling their children and were denied asylum in the U.S. today . The Romeikes fled Germany in 1998 after a German judge threatened legal action if they didn't send their children to school. They arrived in Tennessee and were initially granted asylum but the government sought to deport the family and an appeals court agreed that the freedom to determine the education of one's children is not a fundamental human right. The administration also agreed with the German court's finding that banning homeschooling teaches tolerance of diverse views. Now the family has appealed that decision and is being represented by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in the Supreme Court. 'We are pleased by the Court's interest in the issues we have presented in our petition,' HSLDA Chairman Michael Farris wrote in an email to HSLDA supporters, according to The Christian Post. 'Romeike v. Holder gives the Court an opportunity to address important religious freedom and human rights issues. We hope that after due consideration of the government's brief they will agree to hear our case.' The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered the Obama administration to respond to the petition from the HSLDA but there is no guarantee the court will hear the case.The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier ruled that U.S. immigration laws do not grant a safe haven to people . everywhere who face restrictions that would be prohibited under the . Constitution and said said Uwe and Hannelore Romeike and family do not . qualify as 'persecuted,' a prerequisite for asylum. School day: The Romeikes have six children and another on the way. They are seen here demonstrating how homeschooling works in their Morristown, Tennessee home . Many American home-school families and evangelical Christians have taken up the family's cause. A group called the Home School Legal Defense . Association helped the family's petition to the Obama Administration gain over 100,000 signatures in under 30 days. In 2008, the Romeikes moved from . Bissingen an der Teck in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to Morristown . in eastern Tennessee and applied for asylum. They faced fines and the threat of losing . custody of their children because they refused to comply with Germany's . compulsory school attendance law. That request was initially granted by . an immigration judge in 2010. But the Board of Immigration Appeals . overturned that ruling and the Romeikes appealed to the 6th Circuit. 'The question is not whether Germany's . policy violates the American Constitution, whether it violates the . parameters of an international treaty or whether Germany's law is a good . idea. It is whether the Romeikes have established the prerequisites of . an asylum claim - a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a . protected ground,' the court wrote. 'In this case, that protected ground . is religious freedom.' But the court found that the German . government treats all truants the same, regardless of their reasons for . not attending school. Prior to fleeing the country for America, the Romeikes had accrued $9,000 in fines for not having their children in a required school. Criminal charges also await them if and when they are deported to Germany. The HSLDA, which represented the Romeikes in court, has made a short . video posted to its website that shows the Romeikes' six children . studying together at a big table and chasing chickens in the yard. Danger: Their native Germany does not allow children to be home-schooled and allows the revocation of custody in some cases . Focus on the Romeikes: The family appeared on Mike Huckabee's Fox News program. They became a favorite cause of may conservatives in recent weeks . Mike Donnelly, director of international relations for the association, said the Romeikes planned to appeal. 'The court ignored the evidence that . Germany targets people for religious or philosophical reasons,' Donnelly . said, referring to a 2003 German Supreme Court decision that found the . compulsory attendance law served a legitimate government interest of . counteracting the development of parallel societies. The 6th Circuit considered this . argument but dismissed it, stating, 'Any compulsory-attendance law could . be said to have this effect.' In an April statement, HSLDA called the Obama administration hypocritical for its denial of asylum for the Romeikes. 'The public expects the White House to . explain the inexplicable,' said the HSLDA's Michael Farris. 'In a season . where the Administration has expressed leniency for millions of . undocumented immigrants, we are baffled by the extreme attitudes toward . this one German family.' Witchcraft: Josua Romeike, 9, left. and Lydia Romeike, 10, right, are taught by father Uwe. Part of why Uwe wants his children out of school is that he believes they teach children witchcraft . Spooky: Hannelore Romeike, described an incident in her seventh grade class where the school taught witchcraft in 'an excercise that involved pushing chairs and glasses around, and dangling a pendulum' In the petition filed by HSLDA, the organization argued 'every state in the United States of America recognizes the right to homeschool and the U.S. has the world’s largest and most vibrant homeschool community. Regrettably, this family faces deportation in spite of the persecution they will suffer in Germany.' Professor David Abraham of the . University of Miami Law School played the devil's advocate last month on Fox when he argued that homeschooling . isn't a basic human right, and that the Romeike family isn't entitled to . stay in the United States. 'Homeschooling may be a good idea. It may be a bad idea. It's a public policy question,' Abraham said. 'Not having homeschooling is not being persecuted. Asylum is about persecution.' 'They are not getting something they . would like,' he insisted. 'that's true for people everywhere, and that's . why we have legislatures.' Popular: Claiming persecution in Germany, the Romeikes petitioned the White House and received over 100,000 online signatures, but that didn't sway the circuit court's interpretation of asylum law . Not persecuted: Professor David Abraham from the University of Miami Law School (L)agreed that family isn't entitled to political asylum just because the German government has criminalized homeschooling . The U.S. government said in court . documents the Romeikes did not belong to any particular Christian . denomination and described the parents' objections to the . government-approved schools as vague. For instance, Uwe Romeike claimed a . textbook 'featured a story suggesting that ""the devil can help you if . you ask the devil, but God would not help you,""' the government said. But he could not recall the title of the story or its author. Romeike also claimed the schools . taught witchcraft based on a game played by classmates of his wife when . she was in the seventh grade 'that involved pushing chairs and glasses . around, and dangling a pendulum.'

He survived with barely a scratch even though the train rolled directly over him. Mr Mercado was able to roll into the trench between the tracks, which gave him just enough space to evade being crushed by the train. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

His head turned looking at the train. [Then] he’s right under the train!

Another witness yelled ‘he’s alive’ as the MTA worker climbed up off the track and back on to the train platform.

Dressed to impress: Albert Smith, who was charged with embezzlement, photographed dressed as a knight in armour in the odd shot . Dressed in a suit of armour, Frank Albert Smith looks to be a man of integrity and honour. But do not be deceived - as he was actually a known criminal operating in the late 1800s. In 1894 the offender was charged with embezzlement and his bizarre police photograph shows him dressed as a knight in armour. It remains a mystery as to why he is dressed in such attire. The image is one of many compiled by Bath police between 1892 and 1922 to help them identify criminals and repeat offenders in the city. As well as their rogues' gallery images other details were noted - such as offenders' age, physical appearance and of course their crimes. Fraudsters and tricksters brought to book by police at the time were also convicted and their mug shots added to police files. Many smartly dressed criminals were convicted of 'false pretences' - with their apparent respectability helping them lure their prey. Fraudsters included Alfred Mitchell, a mining engineer and Cyril Dudley Vincent, a music-hall artist. Samuel Zucker, who used the aliases of Edward Von Dalwick and Baron Jules Mercy was also charged. One police file said that in 1911: 'Oliver Love: . medium build, dark brown hair and moustache, successively convicted of . stealing ducks & fowl; a pair of boots; an overcoat; a fowl (again); . and finally an umbrella' was sentenced to several months' hard labour . in prison.

The chilling final radio transmissions from 19 'hotshot' firefighters were were killed in an Arizona wildfire in June reveal their last panicked moments pleading for water tankers to attack the fire that had surrounded them and cut off their escape route. 'I’m here with Granite Mountain . Hotshots, our escape route has been cut off,' Eric Marsh, the leader of the group, tells supervisors over the radio. 'We are preparing a . deployment site and we are burned out around ourselves in the brush and . I’ll give you a call when we are under the she- the shelters.' It was the group's last transmission. Experts say that at that time the fire had entirely surrounded the 19 firefighters and that they likely knew they were going to die. Scroll down for video . This is the final photo of some of the members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots - sent just before the firefighters descended the mountain and tried to battle the blaze . New video from a firefighter's helmet cam picks up the radio traffic from the final moments of the Granite Mountain Hotshots . The video was released Friday by the Arizona Forestry Division and it revealed that fire commanders overseeing the attack on the Yarnell Hill Fire didn't realize that the Granite Mountain Hotshots were even still battling the massive blaze - much less in mortal danger. The footage comes from a helmet cam of a firefighter who was far removed from the hotshots - but the microphone pics up the radio traffic of the group's final moments. All 19 of the hotshots - firefighters from the Prescott, Arizona, Fire Department, were killed after the inferno overtook them as they huddled in their fire shelters. The tragedy made it the deadliest fire in more than two decades and the most firefighters to die fighting a wildfire since 1933. Jim Furnish, a retired U.S. Forest Service deputy chief, told the Arizona Republic - which first published the video, that the hotshots realized that they were all going to die. One one member of the Granite Mountain Hotshots survived, a firefighter who was stationed as lookout on a nearby ridge . 'The sobriety of the last transmission is quite telling,' he said. 'They knew. They knew that this was the end. They had to get in their shelters - that was the last gasp.' Before the last transmission, Marsh - the hotshots leader - spent two minutes pleading with dispatchers to send water tankers to douse the flames in the area. 'Breaking in on Arizona 16, Granite Mountain Hotshots, we are in front of the flaming front,' he transmits. 'Air to ground 16, Granite Mountain, Air Attack, how do you read?' Marsh asks three times for planes and helicopters to attack the fire that was surrounding them.

Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was No. 1 at the weekend box office with $73.7 million, besting last weekend's No. 1 film, Disney's animated fable Frozen. Melting down to the No. 2 position, Frozen earned $22.2 in its third weekend, bringing its impressive overall domestic ticket total to nearly $164.4 million. Internationally, the Disney hit gained $31.5 million. Cha-ching: The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug raked in $73.7 million in its opening weekend . Hobbit: Warner Bros. opted to split the Hobbit into three parts, the second of which opened on Friday . Despite its first place position, The Desolation of Smaug fell short of topping its prequel's debut. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which opened this same weekend last year, gained $84.6 million. It earned $131.2 million in international sales. 'Hobbit rules this date and Warner Bros. has linked this brand to this time of year very effectively,' said box-office analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Rentrak. 'We had an excellent weekend,' said Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. 'Of course, it could have been a little better, but the weather back East was really tough last night and probably took a couple million dollars out of my pocket. But our box office will survive. We are right on target to do very similar numbers to the last `Hobbit,' which grossed a $1 billion worldwide (overall).' Lionsgate's holiday-themed Tyler Perry's a Madea Christmas came in third place with $16.2 million. 'All of the Tyler Perry movies have done in that $20 million plus range, but the weather was a factor in some of the performances of these films,' said Dergarabedian. Busy man: Director Peter Jackson and his daughter, Katie, attended the premier of his latest installment of the Lord of the Rings series . Scary: Warner Bros. released this photo of Azog, performed by Manu Bennett, in a scene from the new Hobbit film . Another Lionsgate film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, earned $13.2 million for the fourth place slot. To date Catching Fire has grossed $739.9 million, surpassing the worldwide box office total for The Hunger Games, which brought in $691 million. Disney's super hero sequel, Thor: The Dark World, continues to thrive as it remained in the top five with $2.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $198.1 million. In its second weekend, Relativity Media's redemption drama Out of the Furnace, starring Christian Bale and Casey Affleck, dropped to the sixth place position with $2.3 million after opening in the third place slot. Disney's comedy Delivery Man, with Vince Vaughn as the lead, dropped in at No. 7 in its fourth weekend at the box office with $1.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $28 million. The Weinstein Co.'s Philomena, starring Judi Dench, who received a best-actress Golden Globe Awards nomination for her performance as a nun in search of her son, landed in the No. 8 spot at the weekend box office with $1.8 million. Tech guy: Jackson says he hopes that the movie's story won't be overshadowed by the amazing technology and cinematography . In its sixth weekend at the box office, Fox's Nazi Germany-set The Book Thief, starring Emily Watson, Geoffrey Rush and Sophie Nelisse, held the ninth position with $1.7 million. Coming in at No. 10 was the Jason Statham and James Franco-starring Open Road crime thriller Homefront, which gained $1.6 million in its third weekend. Its total domestic gross is now $18.4 million. Opening in limited release in just six locations, David O. Russell's con artist tale, American Hustle, scored $690,000 over the weekend. This aces the success of his Oscar-winning film Silver Linings Playbook, which saw $27,687 during its opening weekend in December of 2012. American Hustle, featuring stellar performances by Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, has been nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Amazing: The imagery from the latest Hobbit is said to be even more spectacular than the previous films . 'The overall gross of this weekend's ticket sales is expected to surpass the $136.5 million gained the same weekend last year. ""All films this weekend should estimate $145 million,' said Dergarabedian. With only a few weeks left in the year for moviegoers to populate the multiplex, the wide selection of impressive films fares well for eclipsing 2012's box office record of $10.8 billion. 'We are half a percent above last year,' added Dergarabedian. 'And we have a really strong crop of films with some notable titles still yet to open in wide release, like Anchorman 2, American Hustle' and Saving Mr. Banks, among others.'","The new Hobbit movie is the second of three in the series .

Ian Brookes, consultant editor, told the Times: 'It has most recently changed from describing someone preoccupied with computing to someone who is passionate about any field of expertise.' He said he believed the more positive definition of the word was something worth celebrating. Bitcoin, the name for the untraceable online currency which has seen a meteoric jump in value this year, missed out on the top spot.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:50 EST, 15 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:51 EST, 15 December 2013 . Along the winding muddy waters of the Mekong Delta where he once patrolled for communist insurgents on a naval gunboat, Secretary of State John Kerry turned his sights Sunday on a new enemy: climate change. In this remote part of southern Vietnam, rising sea waters, erosion and the impact of upstream dam development on the Mekong River are proving a more serious threat than the Viet Cong guerrillas that Kerry battled as a young lieutenant in 1968 and 1969. 'Decades ago on these very waters, I was one of many who witnessed the difficult period in our shared history,' Kerry told a group of young professionals gathered near a dock at the riverfront village of Kien Vang. A trip back in time: Secretary of State John Kerry visited the Mekong River Delta during an official visit - his first time back since he served in the Vietnam War . Kerry commanded a swift boat as a young officer and received three Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star and the Silver Star for his acts of courage . 'Today on these waters I am bearing witness to how far our two nations have come together and we are talking about the future and that's the way it ought to be,' he said. That future, especially for the water-dependent economy of the millions who live in the Mekong Delta, is in jeopardy, he said, pledging a $17 million contribution to a program that will help the region's rice producers, shrimp and crab farmers and fisherman adapt to potential changes caused by higher sea levels that bring salt water into the delicate ecosystem. Kerry also said he would make it a personal priority to ensure that none of the six countries that share the Mekong - China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam - and depend on it for the livelihoods of an estimated 60 million people exploits the river at the expense of the others. In a pointed reference to China, which plans several Mekong Dam projects that could seriously affect downstream populations, Kerry said : 'No one country has a right to deprive another country of a livelihood, an ecosystem and its capacity for life itself that comes from that river. That river is a global asset, a treasure that belongs to the region.' The Mekong's resources must 'benefit people not just in one country, not just in the country where the waters come first, but in every country that touches this great river.' Though Kerry was keen to focus on the future, his return to the Mekong Delta, his first since 1969 despite 13 previous postwar trips to Vietnam, was clearly a homecoming of sorts. Kerry, pictured with Dr Dang Kieu Nhan, said life on the river hadn#t changed much in the four and a half decades since he was last there . Kerry, pictured center, saw active combat during his service - and it turned him into an anti-war activist once he got home . As Kerry's boat eased off a jetty onto the Cai Nuoc River, the secretary of state told his guide: 'I've been on this river many times.' Asked how he felt about returning to the scene of his wartime military service for the first time, Kerry replied: 'Weird, and it's going to get weirder.' On this tour, Kerry was clad in drab olive cargo pants, a blue-and-white plaid long-sleeved shirt and sunglasses instead of the uniform he wore as a Navy officer. In a new role and new garb, Kerry revisited the delta's rivers that made a vivid impression on him as a young lieutenant and eventually turned him against the war. Standing next to the captain and surveying the brown water and muddy banks, Kerry recalled the smell of burning firewood as his boat passed through small fishing villages where the aroma hasn't changed in 50 years. At one point, a family in a sampan traveling in the opposite direction smiled and waved. Kerry waved back, and noticing the family had a dog on board, remarked with a smile: 'I had a dog, too. Its name was VC.' VC was the abbreviation for the Viet Cong, forces fighting the South Vietnamese and their U.S. allies. Before his remarks in Kien Vang, Kerry visited a general store and bought candy for a group of children, delighting them with a few words in Vietnamese. While the ringing of cell phones may have replaced the thunder of artillery fire, back on the boat Kerry looked out at the jungle canopy that rises just off the riverbank, swept his arm and remarked: 'It hasn't changed all that much. A lot of it is same old, same old.' Kerry is hoping to shore up relations with Vietnam as the U.S. engages in a standoff with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea . 'This was what we called a ""free-fire zone,""' he said. 'The Viet Cong were pretty much everywhere.' Kerry first set foot in Vietnam 44 years ago after volunteering for service because, as he has said, 'It was the right thing to do.' He was decorated with three Purple Hearts, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star for fighting in a conflict that he came to despise and call a 'colossal mistake,' one that profoundly influenced his political career and strategic view. 'When I came home after two tours of duty, I decided that the same sense of service demanded something more of me,' he wrote in his 2003 book, 'A Call to Service,' as he was unsuccessfully campaigning for the presidency in the 2004 election. 'The lesson I learned from Vietnam is that you quickly get into trouble if you let foreign policy or national security policy get too far adrift from our values as a country and as a people.' He arrived back on Saturday for his 14th trip to the country since the war's end but his first in 13 years, determined to bolster the remarkable rapprochement that he had encouraged and helped engineer as a senator in the 1990s. In the city he first knew as Saigon, the capital of the former South Vietnam, Kerry met Saturday with members of the business community and entrepreneurs to talk up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a broad trade agreement that the U.S. is now negotiating with Vietnam and nine other Asian countries. To take full advantage of the deal's economic opportunities, Kerry said Vietnam, which has been widely criticized for its human rights record, must embrace changes that include a commitment to a more open society, the free exchange of ideas and education. He made the comments after attending Mass at Notre Dame Cathedral, built in the 1880s and 1890s under French colonial rule, in a bid to show support for the tenuous freedom of worship in Vietnam. Vietnamese authorities have been criticized for harassing, prosecuting and jailing Catholic clergy. In talks with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi on Monday, Kerry was expected to make the case that respect for human rights, particularly freedom of speech and religion, is essential to improved relations with the United States. He also was expected to raise the issue of political prisoners whom the United States would like to see released. The chief focus of the discussions, however, was expected to be maritime security and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.","Secretary of State returned to the Vietnam river basin he patrolled as a young Navy lieutenant .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:10 EST, 15 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:36 EST, 15 December 2013 . The latest scion of one of America's most powerful political dynasties is trying to convince voters he's something other than what his famous surname suggests. George P. Bush, the 37-year-old grandson of one former president and nephew of another, is launching his political career by running for Texas' little-known but powerful land commissioner post. But rather than campaigning on the mainstream Republicanism embodied by the family name, Bush says he's 'a movement conservative' more in line with the tea party. Moving right: In his bid to secure Texas Land Commissioner, rather than campaign on the mainstream Republicanism embodied by the Bush family name, George P Bush says he is more in line with the tea party . Move to the right: In his first campaign, George P. Bush is distancing himself from his family . As if to underscore the point, he says he draws the most inspiration not from the administrations of his grandfather, George H. W. Bush, or his uncle, George W. Bush, but from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who engineered the 1994 Republican takeover of that chamber. 'On social questions, national defense, economic issues, I'm a strong conservative,' Bush told The Associated Press. That kind of statement helps make him the latest - and perhaps one of the more unlikely - faces in the parade of Republicans marching even farther to the right in already fiercely conservative Texas. As he takes baby steps away from the Bush legacy, George P. could struggle to convince the party's far right that he's really more conservative than either of his elders who have occupied the Oval Office. 'A Bush can't be a true conservative,' said Morgan McComb, a North Texas tea party activist and organizer. Bush . insists that he's up to the challenge, noting that he was an early . supporter of tea party hero Sen. Ted Cruz, who after less than a year in . the Senate has rocketed from relative political unknown to ruler of the . Texas GOP. Family values: George P. Bush, the grandson of one former president and nephew of another, visits the Republican Party of Texas headquarters where he formally filed to run for Texas land commissioner, in Austin, Texas . 'That's something that we bring to the table that's different,' Bush said. 'We're a mainstream conservative that appeals to all Republicans.' James Bernsen, Cruz's former campaign spokesman, said the Bushes 'walk in certain circles, and some of those people might put their nose up at Ted sometimes, but George P. tries to cross that divide.' 'George recognizes that it's a blessing and a curse to have that last name,' Bernsen said. 'There's a reason he's not really being challenged on the ballot. But he also realizes there's a lot of people who will be very skeptical of him.' The Texas land commissioner administers state-owned lands and mineral resources that help pay for public education statewide. The position can be a springboard to higher office. The incumbent commissioner, Jerry Patterson, is running for lieutenant governor. And the incumbent lieutenant governor he's challenging, David Dewhurst, served as land commissioner before winning his current job. Squaring off against Bush are former El Paso Democratic Mayor John Cook and Republican East Texas businessman David Watts. But Bush has raked in more than $3.3 million and is expected to cruise to victory both in the Republican primary in March and the November general election. Republicans have not lost a statewide race in Texas since 1994. Bonds: President George H.W. Bush shakes hands with his son, President George W. Bush. George H.W. Bush was chairman of the Republican National Committee in the early 1970s but it looks as though George P. Bush may take a different path . But Bush's rightward drift comes with risks. It might hurt his image as a next-generation Republican who could reach out to Texas' booming Hispanic population. Bush is a fluent Spanish speaker whose mother, Columba, was born in Mexico. Hispanics vote overwhelmingly Democratic, but Bush said many also agree with the GOP on social issues, opposing abortion and large government. 'I'm willing to stand behind this concept, that as conservatives we can win the Hispanic vote without selling out the values,' Bush said. 'I don't think we need to compromise.' Bush says he wants to embody conservative activism while still leaving room to govern. He refused to endorse the Cruz-led effort to defund the White House's health care overhaul, which sparked a partial government shutdown. Bush called the measure 'a monstrosity' but also said the only option left was to look for market-based solutions to reform it. 'We need to get back to being the party of solutions,' Bush said. Gingrich's leadership in 1994 'was the last great case study where you saw a conservative party that came forward with solutions on the big issues of the day.' Son of Jeb: George P Bush is the son of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush . Born in Houston, Bush grew up in Florida, where his father, Jeb, was governor from 1998 until 2007. After college, he taught school in inner-city Miami, worked on his uncle's presidential campaign and earned a law degree from the University of Texas. He also clerked for a federal judge and founded a capital company in Fort Worth, where he now lives. In 2010, he served an eight-month tour in Afghanistan with naval intelligence under an assumed name for security reasons. Those close to the Bushes shrugged off any suggestion that some family members might be irked to see George P. distancing himself from the clan. 'The only thing the Bush family cares about is that George P. follow his convictions, whatever they are,' said Mark McKinnon, a GOP strategist and former advisor to George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. Karen Hughes, a former spokeswoman and diplomat for the George W. Bush White House, said any candidate runs 'based on his or her fundamental values and priorities, and that is true regardless of your last name.' Family ties: Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush waves during the game between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans at Reliant Stadium on December 1, 2013 in Houston, Texas . Others who know the family said Gingrich's 'Contract With America,' which was on the cutting edge of activist conservatism in 1994, is now far more mainstream for the GOP as a whole - including the Bushes. Still, Cathie Adams, president of the Texas Eagle Forum, a socially conservative activist group, said Bush's claiming of the movement conservative mantle isn't credible given the shadow his family has cast over state and national politics for so long. However, while many tea party backers remain enraged that Bush's uncle ran up enormous federal deficits and oversaw the bank bailout, they are unwilling to turn their back on the family, Adams acknowledged. 'I think Texans are very respectful of the gentlemen in politics, the kindness and compassion that the family has earned over a long period of time,' she said. Those sentiments will probably extend to George P. too, she added, 'even though it should not be that way.'","George P. Bush is gearing up to run for a little-known but powerful office .

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls has called for a renegotiation of 'certain agreements' to ease the burden of managing immigrants in Calais . An outspoken French Minister has called on Britain to loosen its immigration policy to ease the pressure on guards at Calais, caused by immigrants waiting to enter the UK. Interior Minister Manuel Valls has criticized the 'impasse' in communication between British border authorities and their French counterparts in the English Channel port. He has even invited the Home Secretary Theresa May to visit the area to see the pressure on French border guards. Speaking at the port yesterday, Valls said: 'We need full and complete cooperation between all parties. 'We will also, no doubt, need to flesh out and renegotiate certain agreements, in order to reinforce France’s cooperation with Britain and Europe.' The issue of migrant camps in Calais has been a thorn in the side of successive governments in France with a solution to the growing numbers staying there, yet to be resolved. As political pressure increases, guards have been accused of turning a blind-eye to immigrants who are sneaking into the UK, where they become the problem of British authorities. Valls said Britain should understand the plight of French guards and 'develop' its immigration policy accordingly. He said: 'Our British friends must realise the burden, the weight, which is on France. 'At the time (of original border agreements), the idea was that the UK would evolve and develop its immigration policy.' A . spokesperson for the UK Home Office said would not comment on the offer for the Home Secretary to visit. Speaking at the port yesterday, Valls said: 'We need full and complete cooperation between all parties' Valls wants a more sympathetic approach by the UK government to enable its border officers in Calais (above) to take the strain off their French counterparts . They did respond to the called for reform in a statement, however, saying: 'Border Force has staff in . Northern France to stop individuals before they reach the UK and in the . year to April 2013, 11,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were . prevented. 'Border Force works collaboratively and successfully with the French authorities to combat cross-channel illegal migration and the organised criminality behind it.' According to AFP up to 500 undocumented migrants currently live in semi-permanent camps at Calais. But that number is dramatically lower . than a few years ago when a raid by French Police in 2009 on known camps . such as a wooded area called 'the jungle', full of mainly Afghan . immigrants was cleared. The French seaside village of Sangatte, has seen its population more than doubled by an immigrant camp . It is not the first time that Valls has suggested a compassionate solution to a prickly issue. Earlier this year he championed new guidelines for the French Gendarmes which read: ' 'Police and gendarmes are placed at . the service of population. Their relationship with the public should be . characterised by courtesy and excludes the use of 'tu'. 'Their . behaviour should be exemplary in all circumstances and respect the . dignity of others. It should inspire respect and consideration.'","Manuel Valls has criticised the 'impasse' in communication between nations .

Workers from poor parts of Europe should be banned from moving to Britain until their home country’s economy has improved, David Cameron suggested today. The Prime Minister said tougher restrictions will be needed in future to stop an influx of migrants flocking to the UK in search of work and higher earnings. The radical idea emerged as Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan defied the EU to declare that benefit tourism ‘will not be allowed on my watch’. Clampdown: David Cameron told workers at a Tetley Tea factory in Darlington that he wanted tougher rules to stop an influx of workers from poor parts of the EU . The government has vowed to tackle the ‘pull factors’ including access to benefits which it claims attract migrants to Britain. From January, Bulgarians and Romanians will gain the same rights to work in the UK as other EU citizens and thousands are expected to move here. But Mr Cameron warned that problems with immigration only emerge when people choose Britain as a destination to settle because it is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe. ‘We're putting in very tough measures and controls but I think in the future we will need to go further,’ he told workers at a Tetlea tea factory in Stockton-on-Tees. He said that if other countries move to join the European Union in future the UK should insist on longer transitions . Tour: Mr Cameron said that wealthy countries like Britain needed to be able to impose tougher restrictions on workers from poor nations . He added: ‘Perhaps even saying until you reach a proper share of an average European Union GDP you can't have freedom of movement. ‘The reason for that is if you look at migration between Britain and Germany or France and Germany, countries of pretty even GDP, the movements are pretty much balanced. ‘It’s only when you have a real imbalance when you have a poor country and a much wealthier country that you get these vast movements. ‘Perhaps saying until your economy, until your wealth is similar to our wealth you can't have unrestricted movement.' Britain 'damned well shouldn't' be . forced by European judges to give prisoners the vote if Parliament . decides they should be barred from elections, David Cameron warned . today/ . In a . strongly-worded attack on interference from Strasbourg, the Prime . Minister called for the European Court of Human Rights to have its wings . clipped. The defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the Britain's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights. The ECHR has announced it is . reopening 2,281 compensation claims by UK prisoners. In . February last year the Commons called for the blanket ban to be . maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22, despite repeated . warnings from Strasbourg. Since . then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue, while . stressing that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to . decide whether or not to comply with ECHR rulings. Mr Cameron said: 'If Parliament decides that prisoners should not get the vote then I think they damn well shouldn't.' He added: ""It should be a national decision taken in our Parliament.' The government has unveiled a crackdown on benefit tourism, ahead of the lifting of controls on newcomers from Romania and Bulgaria. It includes rules that EU jobseekers will no longer be paid housing benefit to subsidise accommodation costs, there will be time limits before out-of-work benefits can be claimed and migrants who currently get jobseekers’ allowance after less than a month will have to wait three months before claiming. Net migration in Britain is on the rise – driven by workers from Spain and other southern Europe countries fleeing the collapse of their eurozone economies, figures have shown. Immigration from the European Union (EU) increased to 183,000 in the year ending June, up from 158,000 the previous year. There was a 'statistically significant' increase in citizens arriving for work-related reasons from the so-called EU15, which includes Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Mr Cameron added: I know an influx of non skilled workers is a major cause of concern. We belong to the European Union where there are rules saying that if you apply for a job in another country you can go and take that job. ‘That enables British people to go and work in Germany, Spain or elsewhere and it enables European nationals to come and work here. ‘But there are two things we've absolutely got to get right, firstly when a new country joins the European Union they should not have automatic access to our market. ‘Poland and the other eastern European countries joined in 2004 and they were given instant access to British jobs even though Poland and those countries are much poorer than us. ‘As a result the numbers that came were far bigger than anyone expected, 1.5 million came, it was one of the biggest movements in population we've seen in the last few decades. ‘That was under the last government and it was a very bad decision and we must not make that mistake again.’ From next week migrants arriving in the . UK will have to  demonstrate a ‘reasonable standard of English’ or be . barred from claiming benefits. Warning: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith vowed that benefits tourism would not be allowed 'on my watch' Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, announced that tests applied to those who end up claiming any work-related welfare payments will be tightened. He brushed aside complaints from the European Commission about plans to toughen the habitual residence test which claimants must pass before they can receive benefits. He wrote in The Times: ‘We are already fixing the broken welfare system we inherited from Labour but, as we end the something for nothing culture at home, it is right to ensure migrants who come here make a proper contribution. Benefit tourism will not be allowed on my watch.’","David Cameron proposed new rule to limit immigration for poor nations .

Joshua Smith, 21, has been jailed for 32 months after he was caught on a home owner's CCTV burgling his house . A burglar covered his hands and feet to avoid leaving his prints at a crime scene but was still caught after the theft was captured on the homeowner's CCTV. Joshua Smith, 21, has been jailed for 32 months after a police officer recognised him from footage of the break-in at a house in Ipswich, Suffolk. A court heard how Smith had covered his footwear and hands before breaking in to the property through a conservatory window so that he wouldn't leave any prints. But, unbeknown to him, the homeowner Jay Moore had equipped his house with hi-tech cameras which filmed Smith's every move. When Mr Moore discovered the break-in on returning home he played back the footage - only to see Smith helping himself to a games station, cash, perfume and a mobile phone as well as other items. Mr Moore reported the burglary to his local police station where an officer who had dealt with Smith in the past recognised the serial burglar from the CCTV footage. Smith, of Ipswich, admitted burglary at Ipswich Crown Court and asked for two burglaries and three thefts to be considered. Judge Rupert Overbury said he had an 'appalling criminal record' as he jailed him for 32 months. The judge told Smith: 'You were caught because you were caught red-handed on CCTV and you were identified by a policeman who knew you.' Craig Marchant, defending, said the intruder had tried to stay out of trouble but had returned to his old ways when he ran out of money. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: CCTV footage captured Smith walking through the property in Ipswich, Suffolk, and helping himself to valuables . Last night Mr Moore revealed how the CCTV shows Smith helping himself to valuables at his home -  and even stopping to go through his post. He said: 'The CCTV shows him walking past the property then returning before coming through the conservatory, going into the kitchen and opening the back door. 'He starts picking things up and filling his bag. He goes upstairs in and out of bedrooms.' He added: 'He is seen opening mail and checking the windows to see if anyone was going to disturb him. He then just goes walking up the drive and away.' Mr Moore got home 10 minutes later - and was alerted by one of his two female lodgers. Brazen: Smith stole a games console, cash, perfume and a mobile phone before spending a few minutes going through the home owner's mail . 'One of the girls had come home and said to me ""I don~t know what's going on but I think we have been burgled"". 'It's a horrible feeling actually watching someone burgle your home. It's a feeling of violation,' he said. 'The girls living in the house were very nervous after the burglary. One of the girls hasn't been sleeping properly. 'Even when they were in the house they would lock the door. It hit them a lot harder than it hit me and one has moved out since.'

Jewels worn by royalty and Hollywood legends will go on dazzling display in Cartier's biggest ever exhibition next month. Grace Kelly's engagement ring and pieces commissioned and worn by the Duchess of Windsor will be among the exhibits at the Grand Palais, Paris, from 4th December celebrating the art and history of the iconic jewellers. A display of diamonds wouldn't be complete with those worn by the late Elizabeth Taylor, and some of her stunning gems will be shown. Dazzling: Grace Kelly's emerald-cut 10.47 carat engagement ring, left, given to her by Prince Rainier of Monaco. She can be seen wearing the ring in the film High Society . Bird of beauty: The Duchess of Windsor's flamingo brooch, designed by Jeanne Toussaint, left, was made using platinum gold, brilliant-cut diamonds, calibré-cut emeralds, sapphires, rubies and one citrine. The Duchess can be seen wearing it, right, in 1940 . Design process: Toussaint's original drawing for the flamingo brooch will be part of the exhibition . Part of the display pays tribute to Jeanne Toussaint who became director of Cartier's luxury jewellery department in 1933. In a career spanning the decades, she designed and created some of the world's most exquisite pieces of jewellery. Her designs included a flamingo brooch created in 1940 that was commissioned by the Duchess of Windsor, Wallis Simpson, who was devoted to the Cartier's creations. The 9.65 x 9.59 cm brooch was made with stones belonging to the Duchess herself with the flamingo's body set with calibrated diamonds, sapphire feathers, rubies and emeralds. Her husband, Edward, the abdicated King, bought it for her shortly before the couple fled their home in France as the Nazis advanced. The item will be on show as well as Toussaint's original design sketches. Toussaint was famed for being fearless and politically engaged, creating brooches depicting caged birds when France was occupied by the Nazis during World War Two. They were displayed in the windows of rue de la Paix, symbolising the plight of occupied France. One of the brooches created in 1944, after the Liberation of Paris, will be in the exhibition showing a freed bird made from gems in France's tricolour. Historic: Elizabeth Taylor's 'La Peregrina', left, was a gift from Richard Burton that Cartier turned into a necklace. The actress can be seen wearing it, centre. It features a pearl that dates back to the 16th century once belonging to Queen Mary Tudor, right . On the silver screen: Actress Gloria Swanson commissioned Cartier to create her diamond, platinum and rock crystal bracelet in 1930 to celebrate her marriage to Frenchman Michael Farmer. She can be seen wearing them in the films Perfect Understanding and Sunset Boulevard . Still in fashion: This diamond hair ornament was created by Louis Cartier in 1902 and is 7cm in height at its centre. It was worn by designer Stella McCartney to the Met Ball last year, right . Extravagant taste: Barbara Hutton was one of Cartier's best clients when she was one of the world's wealthiest women as  heiress to the Woolworth stores. She was fond of tigers and asked Toussaint to create her a brooch and earrings, left, in the shape of the animal made from diamonds, emeralds and onyx. She can be seen wearing the brooch, right, in 1960, at her son's wedding . Decadent: Mexican actress Maria Felix asked Cartier to create necklaces and bracelets for her in the shape of crocodiles and snakes. The crocodile necklace, left, made in 1975, weighs more than 126 carats and she can be seen wearing it, right . The exhibition is curated by Laurent Salomé, scientific director to the Réunion des Musées Nationaux Grand Palais, and will feature 600 pieces of jewellery. Of those, 550 from the historic Cartier Collection while 50 are on loan from museums and private collectors around the world. One of the highlights is actress Grace Kelly's emerald-cut  10.47 carat engagement ring, given to her by Prince Rainier of Monaco. She can be seen wearing the gem in the film High Society, her final film before she retired from acting to focus on her royal duties and motherhood. Actress Gloria Swanson also worn Cartier jewellery on the silver screen, wearing diamond, platinum and rock crystal bracelets created by Cartier in 1930 in Perfect Understanding and Sunset Boulevard. She commissioned the jewellers to create the bangles at the height of here fame the year after the Wall Street crash to celebrate her marriage to Frenchman Michael Farmer. Elizabeth Taylor's jewels on show in the exhibition include her famous necklace made by Cartier featuring the La Peregrina pearl. The stone dates back to the 16th century when it was worn by Queen Mary Tudor. Centuries later, Richard Burton bought it at auction and gave it to Taylor as a Valentine's Day gift. More gems on display: A platinum tiara made by Cartier in 1914 with a tree made from black onyx set against a diamond background, left, and a Tutti Frutti strap bracelet, right, featuring diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds was made by Cartier in 1925 inspired by Indian jewellery.  This and other Tutti Frutti pieces enchanted women of distinct tastes, such as Lady Mountbatten, Mrs. Cole Porter and Daisy Fellowes . Symbolic: One of the brooches created by Toussaint in 1944 after the Liberation of Paris showing a freed bird made from gems in France's tricolour, left, meanwhile, this bold brooch was inspired by the Ballets Russes and illustrates Cartier's pre-Art Deco design. Made in 1913 using platinum, round old-cut diamonds, a 11.90 carat emerald, emerald cabochons and drop-shaped emeralds, natural pearls and onyx . She then had it set into a ruby and diamond necklace, which sold for a then record price of £7.1m which it was auctioned in 2011. Gems worn by another of the world's wealthiest women - Barbara Hutton, heiress to the Woolworth stores - will also be in the exhibition. Ever loyal to Cartier, she was known for her extravagant taste and frequently commissioned them to create jewellery for her. She was particularly fond of tigers and asked Toussaint to design a clip brooch and a pair of three-dimensional ear clips featuring the animal. Another of the jewellers biggest fans was Mexican actress María Félix’s. She once visited them at rue de la Paix in 1975 accompanied by a baby crocodile in an aquarium and requested that they reproduce the animal in the form of a necklace. The piece was completed a few months later and was two entwined reptiles made from gold inset with diamonds and emeralds and weighing more than 126 carats. She also commissioned Cartier to make numerous diamond inset snake necklaces and bracelets for her that she was often seen wearing wrapped around her neck and wrists. The exhibition charts Cartier's place in history to the present day with examples of jewellery worn by recent stars on the red carpet including a diamond hair piece wore by Stella McCartney to the Met Ball in 2012. It was designed more than a century earlier by Louis Cartier in 1902 and the jewellers said it is now owned by an anonymous American client.

Britain's cancer shame was exposed last night as a major report showed our survival rates are still no better than Eastern Europe . Britain's cancer shame was exposed last night as a major report showed our survival rates are still no better than Eastern Europe. Women with cervical cancer in the UK are less likely to be alive after five years than their counterparts in Slovenia and the Czech Republic, a major international study found. Our survival rates for breast and bowel cancer are also among the worst of the world’s industrialised nations, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development. Its report found that even Russia has a lower mortality rate for cancers than the UK – and that the NHS has fewer MRI scans to detect cancers and other illnesses than almost any wealthy nation. And despite Labour’s extra millions, far fewer women are being screened now for breast and bowel cancer than a decade ago. Last night a cancer expert described Britain’s position in the cancer league tables as a ‘tragedy’. The study shows that the UK is also at Eastern European levels on stroke survival – worse than the Czech Republic. All these factors add up to make Britons’  life expectancy at birth among the lowest in Western Europe, and for women it is even lower than Slovenia. Professor Karol Sikora, former chief of the World Health Organisation’s cancer programme, said last night: ‘We are improving but at nothing like the rate of the rest of Europe – we are not catching up at all. ‘In Britain there are lots of delays in the system. We need to speed up the whole process. A cell from human breast cancer tissue: Survival rates for breast and bowel cancer in the UK are also among the worst of the world's industrialised nations . ‘In France, when there is a concern the blood tests, the scans and so forth would all be done  in a week – here you might still be trying to get an appointment with your GP. 'A lot of this is about late diagnosis – GPs missing cancer or patients not being seen quickly enough once they are referred. ‘It is a really sad indictment of the priority we give to cancer … If we just met the average of the rest of the European league tables we could save 10,000 lives a year.’ The OECD report is the most comprehensive analysis of health spending and outcomes across richer nations. While there is some good news for Britons – our suicide rate is one of the lowest and only Sweden has fewer road fatalities – most of it makes grim reading. Ciarán Devane, of Macmillan Cancer Care, said: ‘It is simply unacceptable that cancer survival rates in the UK continue to lag behind those in the rest of Europe, and these latest figures are very disappointing. 'Clearly more needs to be done to encourage better screening attendance and early diagnosis.’","Women with cervical cancer in the UK are less likely to be alive after five years than their counterparts in Slovenia .

A devastated family fear false widow spiders killed three of their beloved pet guinea pigs. Jordan Richards, nine, made the discovery after going to feed Rosy, Roxy, and Emmy at his home in Hedge End, Hants. Mother Michelle said her son asked her if she had ever seen a guinea pig asleep before realising something was wrong. A devastated family fear false widow spiders killed three of their beloved pet guinea pigs . Mrs Richards, a childminder, said she found three of their five pet guinea pigs dead, with six false widow spiders and cobwebs around the hutch. The false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in Britain. Mrs Richards said: 'Jordan told me they were asleep. He saw mummy upset and I told him what had happened. 'I am a childminder and we had children over - a lot of kids saw what happened. 'We don't want this happening to anyone else. We want to make as many people aware of this as possible. 'I am not scared of spiders and I've never been bothered about them until these ones. Discovery: Rosy, Roxy, and Emmy which were found dead surrounded by false widow spiders and cobwebs . 'It's a rarity to be bitten and react badly but I have seen some horrific things happening to people recently. 'My husband Ray had to go out and get them. They had a look of agony on their faces. He's a tough guy but it was not good for him.' Mrs Richards said her home backs onto a primary school and fears the spiders may have made their way onto its playing field. Insect expert Ian Burgess from the Medical Entomology Centre said it is unlikely the spiders killed the guinea pigs. He said: 'It could only have happened if the guinea pigs attacked the spiders and I cannot imagine a guinea pig attacking anything.' The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most poisonous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONEThe key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs. Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight. If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","Jordan Richards went to feed Rosy, Roxy and Emmy but found them dead .

The couple accused of keeping three women as slaves for 30 years ran a Maoist sect in the 1970s that recruited young female foreign students. Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda were said to have put their followers under a ‘spell’. The pair were arrested last week after three women, who had allegedly suffered years of abuse, were rescued from a flat in Brixton. They called him Comrade Bala and their revolutionary cry was ‘Death to the British fascist state!’ Their base was a converted bookshop in Brixton, South London, where he and his followers would spread their Leftist poison and hatch plots against the Establishment. The Communist sect that Comrade Bala and his wife Comrade Chanda ran was called The Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought, an obscure political faction formed in the 1970s. Adopted as a baby, this is one of many pictures 'Rosie' sent from 'captivity' to her neighbour, Marius Feneck . Only a handful of people ever belonged to it – but the band of like-minded activists and fanatics proudly proclaimed the world would soon be liberated from capitalist oppression by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. If it sounds like an episode of the classic TV series Citizen Smith, in which Robert Lindsay played the leader of the Tooting Popular Front, it is not a coincidence. Bala’s group was the inspiration for the comedy series that featured Wolfie Smith and his Marxist dream, penned by the writer of Only Fools and Horses and screened for three years from 1977. Reality, however, may have been far more sinister. For Comrade Bala and his wife Comrade Chanda are currently at the centre of police investigations into allegations that three women had been held captive as slaves for the last 30 years. Bala – a short, bald 73-year-old called Aravindan Balakrishnan, and his 67-year-old wife Chanda, apparently known as ‘Mrs Busy Bee’, were arrested last week after it was alleged the women suffered years of physical and mental abuse at the couple’s succession of addresses around Brixton. A 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman were said to have suffered years of ‘physical and mental abuse’. Another, Rosie, 30, was adopted as a baby by the couple after her real parents died in a fire. This site in Brixton was once the headquarters of the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre - which housed a communist collective run by the slavery case suspects - reportedly Aravindan Balakrishnan, 73, and his wife Chanda, 67 . It emerged at the weekend she had been sending love letters to her neighbour, Marius Feneck, 26, describing her suffering and despair at being held captive in the Brixton council flat for more than 30 years. Bala and Chanda have now been bailed but are currently unable to return to their home. The pair, of Indian and Tanzanian origin, came to Britain in the 1960s. The Maoist inspired ‘collective’ they ran in the 1970s is understood now to be under investigation to establish any bearing it might have on the current case. The sect's idol - China's Chairman Mao . It was formed in 1974 after Bala, who studied economics and became deeply immersed in radical politics, broke away from an English branch of the Communist Party to form his ultra-Left group. The executive threw him out for ‘conspiratorial activities’, according to a party report at the time. His faction members had ‘attempted to put themselves above the discipline of the party’. The so-called Workers’ Institute he went on to create was based at the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre in Acre Lane, Brixton, a bookshop that is now an (unconnected) Algerian restaurant. The centre, named in memory of ‘our beloved chairman’, operated as a commune, reportedly with 13 of its 25 members living there. At least six were engaged in what was described as full-time revolutionary work. The centre had its own library and published a weekly journal, The South London Workers’ Bulletin. The group is said to have encouraged women to take a leading role in political organisation and structure. Described as a ‘guru’, Bala was clearly a powerful figure at the head of a band of devoted female followers effectively under his spell, or at least in his awe. Many were persuaded to give up their studies in order to ‘integrate with the working class’ and carry out ‘revolutionary work’. By day the centre was the group’s administrative head office. Most evenings the Institute ran lecture sessions and political film presentations. Bala would educate followers in his politics and tell them regularly what was wrong with the capitalist society of his adopted country. Printed leaflets called for the working classes to unite to bring down capitalism in Britain. Such were the bizarre outpourings of what was labelled a ‘lunatic fringe’ that The Times – viewed by the group as the Establishment tool of the bourgeoisie – reprinted some of its material in waspish diary items. Had the newspaper not done so, perhaps, the commune might never have come to public attention. Another of the pictures of Rosie - who was captive by 'evil monsters' in a 'dark dungeon' of a council house for more than three decades - and who wrote many letters to a neighbour . Letters sent to Marius Feneck from 'Rosie' one of the three women held captive in Brixton . But it was already under scrutiny by Scotland Yard and MI5 – and shortly after dawn on March 22, 1978, police swooped on the Institute to make 14 arrests, among them Comrades Bala and Chanda. Critics branded it the oppression of the fascist police state, and complained that some of the 200 officers with dogs and riot shields had assaulted the occupants and racially abused them. The centre was subsequently shut down, the organisation went underground and of course, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army never invaded. It is understood some of the women who were part of the original commune later moved with the couple to various addresses in South London. However, the sect may have helped to spread the message. A year before Bala formalised his organisation – at a time when he was already plotting his breakaway movement – extremists who identified themselves as a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist group stormed a London School of Economics lecture and attacked the speaker. Investigation: Police stand guard at the property in Brixton, south London, and are following many lines of inquiry including links to 13 addresses across London . Professor Hans Eysenck, author of a controversial paperback entitled ‘Race, Intelligence and Education’ was punched and bundled off the stage by around 20 people, some of whom snatched the microphone and gave a lecture instead on the evils of fascism. It is not clear whether the 20 were connected to Bala – but it was perhaps an indication of the ideals held by those who shared his views. A speech he later delivered gives a flavour. He talks about ‘upholding the revolutionary traditions of our martyrs’ to ‘defeat revisionism and counter the attacks of the British fascist state’. He added: ‘Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act. It is right to rebel against reactionaries. Only thus can you be genuine soldiers of beloved Chairman Mao and undertake revolutionary work which has never been done before.’ Oxford University professor Steve Rayner described the Brixton sect yesterday as ‘a tiny, very tight knit group’ that was ‘clearly under the spell’ of Comrade Bala. In his research for a 1979 thesis, Professor Rayner said Bala was able to exercise control by ‘his superior ability to manipulate the oracles’, disciplining those who challenged his power. His group of mainly young overseas female students – including two from Malaysia, four from China, one from the West Indies and three Europeans – seemed to have ‘difficulty adjusting to life in the UK’ and maintained a ‘hostile attitude’ towards the Establishment. He said the group’s ideology was ‘profoundly detached from reality’ – a description, perhaps, that might easily have been applied to Citizen Smith and his ‘power to the people’ plans for Tooting. But there was an important difference. Bala’s group was scathing of ‘so-called revolutionaries who spend their time talking in pubs’ – which is precisely what Wolfie Smith did. And its ambition to bring ‘death to the British fascist state’ was fact, not fiction. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Aravindan Balakrishnan, 73, and his wife Chanda, 6, ran Maoist sect .

'In the . past, if I had any problem, my excuse was to overeat – it was the only . thing in my life I could control at times. ‘I would also write off . the whole day if it started badly food-wise. Breakfast tended to be four . or five slices of toast, then more pasta and bread throughout the day.' Ms Morris blames yo-yo dieting for the fact she reached 26 stone at the age of 32 - adding: 'It was like an illness – but I had no-one to blame but myself.’ Now, after developing diabetes and suffering a heart attack, she . is desperately trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle and shed the pounds . before her weight kills her. Tonight's documentary . will uncover the . depressing truth of weight loss - that within one year of their diet, 80 . per cent of people will gain weight, often more than they lost. The average diet lasts just five and a half weeks, and the average woman . will embark on 61 diets in her lifetime - spending around 31 years of her . life trying unsuccessfully to lose weight. As well as Ms Morris, viewers will meet Claudia Connell, who has . accepted the only way she will ever be thin is to ‘starve herself – and I . can’t do that’. Scroll down for video .

Struggle: Ms Connell admits the real reason for her weight gain is because she lacks willpower  - but also because 'it's very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight' Ms Connell has gone up and down five dress sizes over the last two decades. She was . a size eight until the age of 30, but then gained four stone over the . next eight years. She then dropped to under eight stone before piling on . the pounds to go up to a size 18.

'It wouldn’t be exciting if you could always . fit into size 10 jeans.’ Despite this, Ms Connell says she wants to cry at . pictures of herself looking ‘morbidly obese’ and is terrified of being . ‘the fat person on the bus taking up the seat’. And . like many failed slimmers, the list of diets she has tried is endless, . ranging from cabbage, grapefruit to one that involved eating anything . red – ‘I ended up eating fruit gums’, she admits.

She is now a svelte size 10 . ‘I . go on crazy diets like the cup-a-soup one, where I lost two stone in a . month – but I put it back on as soon as I finished,’ she says, now . weighting 24 stone. ‘I am an emotional eater and it’s sticking with the . diet that’s the problem.’ Ms Connell is having more success – but even she fears it will be short-lived. ‘I’ve . lost one-and-a-half stone in two months, but I know I will put it back . on,’ she admits. ‘Starvation is what it takes for me to be thin  - and I . just can’t starve myself.’ And . it's not just ordinary women who are battling to avoid being in the 80 . per cent of people who gain weight after slimming down. Big Brother star Josie Gibson is among numerous celebrities to have had a . well-documented battle with yo-yo diets. At 28 years old and a size 10, Josie is the slimmest she has ever been – but she admits it is a daily battle. ‘I . am obsessed with food – I love it, have no “off” button and lick the . plate,’ the Big Brother star tells the documentary. ‘At times I’ve been so desperate to stop eating that I’ve . left the dinner table and gone and put a bikini on for 20 minutes. But it still doesn’t work.’ After appearing on Big Brother in 2010, Josie shed four stone – but piled it all back on when she broke her ankle.

A beautician died aged 21 just as she appeared to be winning her battle to lead a normal life after undergoing a heart transplant. Amy Wild had suffered repeated complications from the 2002 operation when she was just ten which left her in a wheelchair. Her body twice rejected the new heart in 2004 and 2007 and at one point she was given just a 20 per cent chance of survival. Heart transplant: Amy Wild, 21, who battled back after suffering a heart attack as a 10-year-old in 2002. She died in August after her condition suddenly declined . Yet the young woman, from Heaton Morris, Greater Manchester, defied doctors predictions and had started walking and wearing high heels. She also had plans to open her own beauty treatment business. But after complaining of chest pains and difficulties with her breathing, Amy was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester on Sunday August 11, where she was prescribed medication to combat an unusually fast heart rate. She died two days later. Following an inquest into her death yesterday, Amy's family said they had lodged an official complaint with the hospital questioning the care she received. Fightback: Amy Wild was described as 'healthy' before her death and had dreams of opening a beauty treatment business. She underwent a heart transplant in 2002 and her body twice rejected the organ. However, she had battled back and was leading a normal life . Beauty business dream: Amy Wild was planning to start her own company and was described as 'fit and well' when her condition suddenly deteriorated . Amy, from Heaton Norris, near . Stockport, had always been a healthy child but problems began in 2002 . when she complained of feeling tired and suffering from a pain in her . back. Just days before the . family was due to fly out to Tenerife on holiday, the youngster was . rushed into hospital and her heart stopped five times. She later underwent a three-hour life saving heart transplant at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London. At the time her mother Lynne told a local newspaper: 'Doctors did not think she'd survive, but two days after the operation she was up on her feet, three weeks later she was back at home and after eight weeks she was back at school. 'She had to be flown down to London as it was a race against time to save her. The doctors can't believe that she's recovered so quick, they say they've never seen anything like it.' Although Amy's body twice rejected the heart, she battled back. She lost the use of a leg after spending three months on a life-support machine and underwent a hip operation in 2011 which left her able to leave her wheelchair. She initially started walking again . with the aid of crutches then would leave them propped up during nights . out with friends so she could be seen standing on her own. Deterioration: Amy went to bed early in August and was taken to hospital the next day after complaining of chest pains . 2002 - Amy Wild complained of feeling tired and suffering pain in her back. She was rushed to hospital before a family holiday and her heart stopped five times. She later underwent a heart transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. 2004 - Her body rejects the replacement heart. 2007 - Her body again rejects the replacement heart. 2011 - Amy lost the use of a leg after spending three months on a life-support machine and underwent a hip operation in 2011 which left her able to leave her wheelchair. 2013 - She learns to walk again with the aid of crutches and plans to open her own beauty company . August 10, 2013 - She goes to bed early as she is very tired and pale . August 11, 2013 - Amy complains of chest pains when she gets up at 7am and she is taken to hospital by her mother Lynne, 50. Her condition is initially described as stable, but she deteriorates and dies two days later. In the time leading up to her death, she was described by her family as being ‘fit and well.' But . at an inquest in Manchester her sister Sophie Wild, 23, said: 'On . August 10 she was tired and very pale in colour and she went to bed . early. 'Before she went to . bed she was complaining of a bad back she had been suffering from for a . few weeks beforehand. She got up at about 7am and went to wake mum up to . say she had chest pains. She hadn't complained of them before that . morning. 'She said it felt . like her heart was coming out of her chest. She was really out of breath . and she couldn't catch her breath so we took her to hospital in the car . at 9am.' Amy was seen by the on-call cardiovascular team who prescribed beta blockers to slow her heart-rate down - but there was uncertainty over what exactly was causing the abnormal heart rate. Treatment began for a lung clot and the possibility the body was rejecting the heart once more. Her condition was initially described as stable, but she was prescribed medication to combat a rejection of the heart as a precautionary measure. Happy family: Amy Wild (left), pictured with her sister Sophie, 23, who had defied predictions and was leading a relatively normal life despite a heart condition . Heart transplant operations save lives - but there are often complications after surgery. A common complication after surgery is rejection. The immune system – the body’s defence against infection – mistakes the transplanted heart as a foreign body and begins to attack it. This can often occur even if the patient is being treated with medication to suppress the immune system. There are two types of rejection - acute, which occurs just after surgery, and chronic, which happens months or years later. One of the most serious complications that can occur after a heart transplant is that the donated heart fails to work and does not start beating, or stops beating soon after the surgery is completed. This is known as primary graft dysfunction. It is the leading cause of death in the first 30 days after surgery and occurs in around 1 in 32 cases. Infection is also common in the weeks after surgery when the immune system is weakened. In the years after surgery, many patients also suffer a narrowing of the arteries connected to the new heart. SOURCE: NHS . Ahead of a planned biopsy, Amy went into sudden cardiac arrest and could not be revived. Dr . Paul Bishop, a consultant histopathologist at Wythenshawe Hospital said . that as well as suffering from coronary artery disease, there was also . evidence of significant rejection of the heart. He . added: 'I was not surprised to find coronary artery disease ten years . after a transplant and it's very difficult to do anything about this.' Recording . a narrative verdict, coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'Despite the care and . treatment which was afforded to her and given properly , the reason for . her death was because of heart problems and known complications after a . transplant. 'This was a . tragic case of a young woman. She was just starting up her own business . and until these problems in August it seemed as though things were going . well for her. But then suddenly you were faced with this terrible . tragedy. 'When one hears a . story such as this it really does bring mortality home to us. There are . little words I can offer in way of sympathy for what you have gone . through. None of this was expected. You had a fit young daughter who . complained of these chest pains and in a couple of days she was taken . from you.' In a statement her mother Lynne, 50, said: 'Amy was just a girl who everybody loved. No one who met her would ever guess she was ill or what she'd been through because she was so full of energy and never took life too seriously. 'She was determined to live a normal life and there were times when I knew she was in a lot of pain but she'd never let me see it.' Sophie added: 'We thought there would be more care for her on the day she passed - considering her heart condition and how poorly she had been. We are extremely unhappy with how she was dealt with on that day.'","Amy Wild, 21, underwent a lifesaving heart transplant in 2002 .

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 19:15 EST, 17 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:29 EST, 18 November 2013 . Doris Lessing, the grand old lady of letters who has died at 94, lived long enough to turn against practically all the strongly held convictions of her youth. An avid Communist in her younger days, she later rejected not just communism but feminism and political correctness, too. Still, though, she retained some shocking political thoughts. Days after the attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001, she was belittling the act of terrorism, saying: ‘It was neither as terrible nor as extraordinary as the Americans think.’ Some years earlier, Englishmen were in her sights. In her 1962 feminist classic novel, The Golden Notebook, she attacked their uselessness, particularly their inability to satisfy their wives sexually. But, despite her scorn, it was to England that  she came, from colonial Rhodesia — now Zimbabwe — more than 60 years ago, settling into a gloriously ramshackle, tall, slim house in London’s West Hampstead. Titan: Writer Doris Lessing, pictured in 2006, has died peacefully aged 94 at her home in London . She derided literary prizes, but scooped them all including, in 2007, the Nobel Prize. At 88, she was the oldest woman ever to win it and only the 11th woman to receive the award. Her triumph came as no surprise to a woman formidably confident in her own intellectual abilities. While the Swedish Academy praised Lessing for her ‘scepticism, fire and visionary power,’ when informed about winning the prize, the writer responded: ‘Oh Christ! . . . I couldn’t care less.’ But she later said: ‘I’ve won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one. So I’m delighted to win them all. It’s a royal flush.’ Born Doris Tayler in 1919 in Persia (now Iran), she moved as a child with her British family to Southern Rhodesia. Her father, who lost a leg in World War I, ran a rundown maize farm, where he was looked after by an increasingly desperate wife, a former nurse, whom the young Doris was at odds with from earliest childhood. Her mother was refined, cold and unemotional, always beautifully dressed and more interested in perfectly polished silver and whether the piano was in tune than in Doris and her brother. ‘I have sacrificed myself to my children,’ she would complain in their hearing. Still, it was her mother who helped to forge  Lessing’s extraordinary literary career, shipping huge parcels of books from England for her daughter. Recognition: Lessing who was born in Persia - now Iran - was awarded the Nobel Prize aged 88 in 2007. She was the oldest woman ever to win it . ‘I was never educated, you see,’ said Lessing, who left convent school at 14. ‘Without the books, I would have come to grief.’ Determined to escape what she described as a stifling, provincial, expat world, she entered a doomed marriage to Frank Wisdom, a civil servant ten years her senior. She was only 19 and it was the eve of World War II. ‘Everyone got married,’ she explained. A fter less than five years and with two children, John and Jean, the marriage came to an end. Rather than subject the boy and girl to the cool neglect she had suffered from her own mother, she decided it would be preferable if she abandoned them, leaving their father to bring them up. In due course, in 1944, she married a German internee, Gottfried Lessing, and had another child. That marriage, too, failed after five years. In 1949, she fled to London with her youngest son. Honor: Lessing shows off her Nobel Prize. She responded to the accolade by saying 'I couldn't care less' Lessing later said: ‘I’m very proud of myself that I had the guts to do it. I’ve always said that if I hadn’t left that life, the intolerable boredom of colonial circles, I’d have cracked up and become an alcoholic or had a mental breakdown.’ Such callousness was hard to forgive. Her older son, John, later told her: ‘I understand why you left, but it doesn’t mean I forgive you for it.’ Just as the Cold War began, Lessing joined the Communist Party, but later came to see that it had been a mistake. ‘We believed this rubbish, absolutely. But I think there is something about politics that makes people mad, really.’ Whatever the shortcomings of her political and private life, she was undeniably a literary titan. Controversial: Doris Lessing's novel The Golden Notebook has been hailed as a classic feminist text . The Grass Is Singing, her 1950 debut novel about the racism of white colonials in Forties Rhodesia, was a sensation. A tide of novels, poems, operas, autobiographies and short stories followed. Over 60 years she published almost 60 books. They were not all rapturously received. After she won the Nobel Prize, the acerbic American literary critic Harold Bloom said: ‘Although Ms Lessing at the beginning of her writing career had a few admirable qualities, I find her work for the past 15 years quite  unreadable . . . fourth-rate science fiction.’ Those early, admirable qualities were most in evidence in her controversial novel The Golden Notebook. Explaining its genesis, she said: ‘I had been listening to women talk about women’s issues and about men. Suddenly when I wrote down these private conversations, people were astounded. It was as though what women said didn’t exist until it was written.’ The sexually graphic book tells the story of Anna Wulf, a deeply frustrated woman at the dawn of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movement. It is unremitting in its detail. It deals candidly with menstruation, the female orgasm and men’s sexual shortcomings. Lessing called England a country ‘full of men who are little boys and homosexuals and half-homosexuals’. She made it clear that she thought that public boarding schools had a lot to answer for. The Golden Notebook was widely venerated by feminists and declared ‘the Bible of the women’s movement’, though Lessing refused to become a feminist poster girl. She said: ‘What I really can’t stand about the feminist revolution is that it produced some of the smuggest, most unself-critical people the world has ever seen. They are horrible.’ Indeed, in the introduction for  a 1993 reissue of The Golden  Notebook, she said it was not a ‘trumpet for women’s liberation’. ‘I think a lot of romanticising has gone on with the women’s movement,’ she said a few years ago. ‘Whatever type of behaviour women are coming up with, it’s claimed as a victory for feminism — doesn’t matter how bad it is. We don’t seem to go in very much for self-criticism.’ And she told the Edinburgh book festival that modern men were ‘cowed’ by women. ‘They can’t fight back,’ she said. ‘And it’s time they did.’ Return: Lessing's novel was reissued in 1993 - a move called a 'trumpet for women's liberation' Lessing wrote her later works from a messy, chaotic home in Hampstead, North London, with worn-out carpets — more student digs than elegant literary salon. Her black and white cat Yum Yum (named after a character in Gilbert and Sullivan’s light opera The Mikado) would keep her company. So fond was she of her various cats that she wrote three books about them. She was desperate to escape categorisation as a particular kind of writer. Lessing noted that over the years she had been given ‘every conceivable label’ — starting off as a writer about the colour bar, then a Communist, then a feminist, then a mystic. The mystic label came about because of her interest in later life in Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism. She saw herself as none of these things, but as a storyteller. ‘Just being a writer was the thing,’ she told this newspaper when she was in her 70s. ‘For me, it still is.’","Author died peacefully at her London home early this morning aged 94 .

The tiny tot - now named Milagros (Miracles) - was born prematurely in Quibdo in the Pacific state of Choco in the early hours of Wednesday, November 13, last week. Her mother Jenny Hurtado was just 27 weeks pregnant when she was rushed to the San Francisco de Asis hospital at 2:45am. Baby Milagros was pronounced dead after being born prematurely by caesarian section at a hospital in Quibdo, Colombia, before being transferred to the hospital morgue (file picture) Medics performed a C-section but, unable to find signs of life, declared the newborn deceased just 35 minutes later - at 3:20am. Taken to the morgue, the baby was placed inside a box. Staff then waited for her fisherman father to collect her. But, on the father's arrival and as the attendant handed the baby over, they recognised signs of life and heard a soft cry. Realizing the infant was still alive, workers rushed her on board a plane to the Santa Teresita del Niño Jesus clinic in the capital Bogota. She remains there, accompanied by her aunt Reyes Hinestroza, receiving treatment for her underdeveloped lungs in intensive care. It was only when the baby's father came to collect his body from the morgue that they noticed signs of life and he was taken to intensive care (file picture) Her mother remains in Quibdo, where she is recovering from the ordeal. Specialist doctor Javier Zagarra told Semana that the mistaken death declaration could be down to a soft heart beat at the time of the birth. 'In some cases the heart movements are not perceptible even though the newborn is alive, they can declare it dead,' he said. 'When they wrap the baby in a sheet, upon receiving warmth, the baby can then revitalize,' he added.","Baby declared dead after premature birth by caesarian section .

'He was not awarded a Master’s degree by the Faculty of Law of Harvard University. Made up: The lawyer falsely claimed that he studied at Balliol College, Oxford, above, in order to impress employers . 'Further, he is not, and has never been, a member of either the New York or Irish Bars.' As a result of his creative CV, he was even listed in the Bar . Directory, the leading guide to barristers, with the a string of . falsified titles. His entry read, 'Dr Dennis Thomas Delcaron O’Riordan LLB, Hons, BCL D Phil, Oxon, MA.' The . false academic background helped him become a partner at two City law . firms, Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft and Paul Hastings. O’Riordan was originally called to the Bar by Inner Temple in 1993. The barrister then went on to become a senior in-house London lawyer for a number of overseas banks.

Tesco has ousted Asda as Britain’s cheapest supermarket for Christmas among the big five retailers. A survey of the price of 33 ‘essential’ seasonal products – from turkeys to satsumas – by trade magazine The Grocer found that Tesco’s basket cost £135.80 – 41p cheaper than Asda. There was little to choose between all the supermarkets, with Morrisons adding up to £136.93, Sainsbury’s on £145.14 and Waitrose at £147.55. Battle: For the first time in six years, Tesco is the place to do your Christmas shop, not long-time winner Asda . Competition: Asda blasted the survey's findings, which put a Tesco shop at 41p cheaper than its rival . Asda has been cheapest in the survey for the past four years. A statement released by The Grocer said: 'Tesco has won the Christmas Grocer 33 for the first time ever -- stunning rival Asda, winner for the past four years.' Asda, which markets a guarantee to be 10 per cent cheaper than its rivals, has won the ‘Christmas 33’ in five of the six years since The Grocer launched the festive version of its weekly price comparison table. But this year the the survey found Tesco's checkout bill was 41p lower than Asda with mark-downs on Champagne, red wine, streaky bacon and Christmas pudding. David Wood, Tesco’s UK marketing director, said: 'The team at Tesco are delighted to have won this year’s Christmas Grocer 33 basket. Budget: The Grocer found shoppers can get a good deal on pudding and bacon for pigs in blankets this year . Drink: Tipples including red wine and Champagne are also cheaper at Tesco than Asda this Christmas . 'Winning the Grocer 33 shows how hard we’re working to keep prices low on the products that matter most at Christmas.' But Asda labelled Tesco’s victory as 'hollow'.

Yes, we are disappointed, but we are in the long game.' Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer, said: 'It’s only the second time in 12 months that Tesco has won our weekly shopping basket price analysis competition, but the Christmas 33 is a particularly iconic basket because it’s so important to shoppers that a supermarket offers value over the Festive season. 'The fact that the difference between the cheapest - Tesco - and the most expensive - Waitrose - was less than 10 per cent shows how intense the fight in the grocery space is.'","A Tesco shop for this year's festive dinner is 41p cheaper than Asda .

The families who arrived for the first day of the Winter Wonderland festival in Milton Keynes were promised ‘all the magic of the holiday season’. What they got, however, were skinny Santas, reindeer without antlers … and an ice rink made out of plastic sheets. Organisers received so many complaints from furious customers that they shut the event down after only a day. Families had paid up to £65 in advance for various attractions at the town’s Campbell Park, including meeting Santa, ice skating and seeing huskies and reindeer. Skinny Santa: Parents at Winter Wonderland Milton Keynes complained that Father Christmas was too thin and had an ill-fitting beard and suit . Disappointment: The ice rink, which apparently did not contain real ice and was made of plastic instead . Tickets to Santa’s Grotto cost £6, but . it was closed for most of the day. When it did open, parents said  the . Santas were young, skinny, dressed in cheap costumes – and scared their . children. The first visitors to the site, on Saturday, were quick to complain about the experience on social media.

She wrote on her . blog: ‘This was definitely no Wonderland.

Harrold, from London, commented: ‘I took my granddaughters to see Santa . in MK, something we do together every year, and I was so disappointed. Animals: Two reindeer were present at the event, but they apparently had no antlers . Empty: A pen apparently meant to hold 'reindeer and huskies' at the Winter Wonderland event . Skating: The organiser of the event insisted that the rink was never supposed to feature real ice . ‘My . little Anais asked “Nanny have we been bad?” I said no, of course not, . why? “Well why didn’t the real Santa come to see us?”’ Another parent . wrote online: ‘My daughter trod in dog poo and was told by one of the . events team it was actually reindeer poo.’ Another visitor added: ‘The staff had cheap, naff costumes, which didn’t fit.

What Christmas present do you choose for the person who has everything? A book of nothing, of course. Scientists have joined together to write a book about why nothing is the key to understanding absolutely everything. From absolute zero and the power of placebos, to light bulbs, vacuums, dark energy, ‘bed rest’ and the birth of time, the book explores different aspects of the concept of nothing. A collection of 25 essays by writers from New Scientist magazine, the book, Nothing, is already flying off the shelves. The unlikely literary hit stands at No.4 in the Sunday Times paperback non-fiction bestseller list ahead of the autobiographies of Miranda Hart, the comedian, and the footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The book tackles questions such as, why do some animals spend all day doing nothing? And what happens in our brain when we try to think about nothing? For centuries, scientists have known that without nothing we would be precisely nowhere. Jeremy Webb, the book’s editor, told the Sunday Times: ‘It turns out that nothing is a really valuable thing and when scientists ask questions about nothing they come up with some really intriguing answers, that’s what the book is all about. ‘Without nothing we’d be precisely nowhere.’ He added: ‘Nothing has been a topic of discussion for more than 2,000 years: the ancient Greeks had a lively disagreement about it.’ Hit: The unlikely chart-topper is set to be a best-seller for presents over the Christmas period . For example, the book explores animals who appear to spend most of their time doing nothing. It turns out they are not taking it as easy as one would assume. Animals such as the Burmese python and the sloth spend their weeks barely moving but their metabolisms are actually working at a furious rate. The python’s digestion pushes its metabolic rate up to the equivalent of a horse at full gallop.","Paperback explores light bulbs, vacuums, dark energy and birth of time .

The attack is the latest worrying incident at the London museum, which has been criticised for reducing the number of assistants it employs – a move art experts fear could make its priceless collection more vulnerable to damage or theft. The woman was reportedly touched by a man while she sketched in a room at The National Gallery (pictured) Police called to the Trafalgar Square premises at around 5.30pm on Friday were told the woman was sitting in room 34 – which houses work by John Constable, William Turner and Thomas Gainsborough – when a man approached her. They arrested a 27-year-old South Korean man, believed to be on a short visit to London, who will appear in court today charged with ‘sexual touching’. More than 500,000 art lovers visit the National Gallery every year but its central location in the capital also makes it a magnet for troublemakers. In June, a Fathers4Justice campaigner was charged with criminal damage after allegedly sticking a photograph of a boy to the canvas of Constable’s The Hay Wain. In 2011, a vandal sprayed two paintings by 17th-century artist Nicolas Poussin, including The Adoration of the Golden Calf, with red paint.

Small shopkeepers and fast food retailer Subway are to levy a five pence charge for each plastic bag handed out. The Association of Convenience Stores – which represents more than 33,500 small shops and takeaway outlets – has decided to adopt the charges, which are due to become compulsory in larger stores in England from October 2015. The move follows the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, which has highlighted damage caused by discarded carrier bags. In the past two years, there has been a sharp rise in the use of throwaway bags – to seven billion a year. Levy: Small businesses will charge five pence per bag to reduce the damage caused by discarded bags . Many are used for only 20 minutes but take up to 1,000 years to rot away. They litter the landscape and kill marine animals and birds, which suffer long, painful deaths after eating them or getting tangled in them. Money from the new charges, to be introduced in 2015, will be handed to charities who have to deal with the impact of bags on the environment and wildlife. Shane Brennan, public affairs director at the Association of Convenience Stores, said there was a ‘strong appetite’ among shopkeepers to apply the charges. But the association wants to stay exempt from rules being implemented for larger retailers, who  must report proceeds back to the Government, to ‘avoid unnecessary regulatory burden’. Subway, which has 1,600 outlets in Britain, said it would be urging all its franchisees to charge five pence for bags. Fast food: Subway said it would be urging all its 1,600 franchisees to charge five pence for bags . The Keep Britain Tidy group believes the charges should be extended to all small shops to avoid ‘confusing’ situations where shops under the same brand but different franchisees have different policies on charging. ‘If a retail brand has some stores owned by the parent business and others owned by franchisees we could end up with some stores charging for a single-use plastic bag while others do not.’ Under plans announced by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, all single-use plastic bags will cost five pence in supermarkets and department stores in England from 2015. Scotland will introduce a five pence charge next year. In Wales, where all shops have been forced to charge for bags since 2011, the number distributed has fallen by about 80 per cent. Northern Ireland introduced a five pence charge on single-use carrier bags in April, which will rise to 10 pence.","Fast food restaurant Subway will also be bringing in charge .

Young people are half as likely to want Britain to leave the European Union as pensioners, a new study reveals. Just 32 per cent of 18-24 year olds would consider voting to sever ties with Brussels in a referendum, compared to 60 per cent of the over-65s. It raises the prospect of the in-out vote promised by David Cameron being fought along generational lines, with those in favour of remaining in the EU relying on getting young people to the ballot box. Young voters are much less likely to want to leave the EU than the over-65s, according to the ICM poll for British Future . The Tories have promised to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, claiming powers back from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. The new study by the think tank British Future shows young Brits are much more pro-European and fear leaving the EU would hit jobs and the economy. Among all voters, 26 per cent said they were planning to vote 'firmly out' in a referendum, with a further 24 per cent 'leaning' to vote out. Just 13 per cent were 'firmly in' and 22 per cent 'leaning in'. But among 18-24-year olds 20 per cent were 'firmly in' and 21 per cent 'leaning in', with 18 per cent 'leaning out' and 14 per cent 'firmly out'. The trend is reverse among the over-65s, who are traditionally more likely to vote. Among pensioners 12 per cent are 'firmly in' and 23 per cent 'leaning in', while 32 per cent were 'leaning out' and 28 per cent 'firmly out'. The over-65s were much more sure of their views, with only nine per cent responding 'don’t know' compared with 26 per cent of the 18-24 age group. EU age gap . British Future director Sunder Katwala said: ‘Our poll shows that British people are currently leaning more out than in when it comes to a referendum on Europe - but most are a long way from making up their minds and are waiting to see what deal David Cameron can get on the terms of our membership. ’It will be a challenge for those who want to stay in the EU, with only younger people in favour of staying in - a group that is less likely to vote than those aged over 65. ‘This could make a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU the first major political event where opinion is divided along generational lines, when we’ve previously viewed political questions as decided by class, geography or gender.’ Eight in 10 18-24-year-olds said jobs and the economy would be important when deciding how to vote in a referendum, compared with 62 per cent of over-65s. Unsurprisingly just half of pensioners were worried about the loss of the right to work in the EU, compared to 77 per cent of 18-24 year-olds. Younger voters were also most worried about having less influence in the US, less influence on border controls and losing EU funding for disadvantaged regions of the UK.

In 2008, his net worth peaked at £42.2 billion, making him the the third richest person in history.

It is not the first time the Mittal family have invested heavily in a wedding ceremony. When Lakshmi's daughter Vanisha got married in 2004, Kylie Minogue performed at an ostentatious ceremony in Paris, which is said to have set them back around £40m.

Pensioners could be forced to spend . £150,000 of their own money before receiving any government help with . care bills, it emerged today. The elderly would still face huge bills for residential care despite the Government's plan to cap costs at £72,000. Labour . claimed its calculations showed that many people will die before . reaching the cap, but ministers insisted it was taking much action which . Labour failed to take when in power. Costs: Elderly people will have to fund tens of thousands of pounds in charges which are not covered by the government's car cap . The planned cap does not . cover accommodation and living expenses which pensioners would still . have to pay while care costs only count towards the limit at the rate . the local council would pay for a place in a residential home. Labour . says it will take almost five years for elderly people to hit the cap - . during which time they will have clocked up more than £150,000 for . their actual residential care home bill. The . cap is due to come in from 2016-17, when councils will charge an . average of £522-a-week for residential care is estimated to be £522 a . week. But the average price . of a care home bed will be £610 a week, creating an £88-a-week shortfall . which people will have to pay themselves. Pensioners . in care homes will also have to pay £230 a week for their . accommodation, which is counted separately from care costs and does not . count towards the cap. In . some areas of the country with higher average care home costs, people . could face paying more than £500,000 before the cap was reached. Health Minster Norman Lamb dismissed Labour's complaints, arguing they failed to act when in power . In parts of Surrey a bed in a . standard residential care home typically costs around £800 a week, but . local council rates are around £326 a week. The difference would mean a resident must spend more than £560,000 over 12 years before seeing costs capped. Labour also estimated that six out of seven elderly people will have died before they reach the cap. Shadow . minister for care and older people Liz Kendall told the Daily . Telegraph: ‘David Cameron has repeatedly claimed that no-one will have . to pay more than £72,000 to pay for their care, but this simply isn't . the case. ‘On average, . pensioners will have to pay more than twice this amount, and the vast . majority will have died before they hit the so-called 'cap'. ‘David . Cameron should be straight with elderly people about what they will . really have to pay for their care. Families deserve to be told the . facts, rather than being conned, so they can properly plan for the . future, and not have the Government attempt to pull the wool over their . eyes.’ But health minister . Norman Lamb hit out at Labour's inaction on tackling the problem of . crippling care costs while they were in power. The . care and support minister said: ‘It's rank hypocrisy for Labour to . criticise the coalition's care cap when they did nothing to fix an . unfair social care system in 13 years of plenty. ‘At . the same time as dealing with Labour's debts, we have gone further than . they ever did and found £2 billion to cap care costs and end the . scandal of people being forced to sell their home in their lifetime to . pay for care. ‘Of course we . would love to be able to afford to go further, but we won't take any . lectures from the party who racked up a record budget deficit and forced . old people to sell their homes to pay for care.","Ministers have pledged to introduce a £72k 'cap' on care home bills .

Dorrington Academy in Birmingham had been on course to become one of the country's highest performing primaries. But the school has been dropped from this week's national league table after at least one Year 6 student was accused of cheating in the nationwide exams. Scandal: Dozens of students at Dorrington Academy (pictured) in Perry Bar, Birmingham, have had their SATs results ripped up following allegations of cheating. The ruling was made by the Department of Education . All of the pupils will now see their results annulled following a ruling by the Department for Education. Today, headteacher Loretta Barratt - who has been in charge of the school in Perry Bar for six years - said she was 'devastated' by the decision. 'It should have been the best year we ever had. But someone, for their own reasons, has not allowed that to happen,' she said. 'We had the most phenomenal cohort of pupils. We were meant to be celebrating becoming an outstanding school. High-performing: The 700-pupil school had previously been on course to become one of the UK's top primaries . Maladministration: Headteacher Loretta Barratt has refused to give any details about the alleged cheating . 'I am devastated, the staff are devastated. It has been a very difficult time.' The 700-pupil school - which teaches children aged between three and 11 - is one of just 25 across the UK to have fallen foul of exam watchdogs at the Standards Testing Agency (STA) this year. Stunned parents were informed of the ruling - which has affected dozens of 11-year-old children - two weeks ago. However, both the school and the STA have refused to give any further details about the alleged cheating. Miss Barratt, 49, said: 'I have been instructed by the legal department that I cannot say any more. 'At the end of the day, we have dealt with it. We have appointed an external invigilator to oversee exam procedure. Bad practice: The school is one of 25 in the country to have fallen foul of exam watchdogs this year . 'As a manager of this school, I am going to make sure the integrity of future procedures takes place. 'I am hell-bent on ensuring that happens. To that end, everything will be moderated externally.' Chairman of governors Lorraine Gumbs, added: 'Of course it's a shock - you don't expect your results to be annulled. 'Parents have been fine and been kept informed. I've had no comeback.' However, some parents claim they are yet to be informed of the allegations. Dawn Daisley, 41, whose daughter Jessica attends the school, said: 'I've not heard a thing about this. Nothing been said to us, I'm a little disappointed. 'But if they have put new measures in place then it shouldn't happen anymore.' Parent Ake Obi, 38, added: 'I'm unhappy to hear this. I'm not comfortable with this information.' It is the second bombshell parents have had to face this year after deputy headteacher Tim Caddick resigned for 'personal reasons' in July. And earlier this year, Miss Barratt described the school as having previously been in an 'appalling' state. In a statement to an employment tribunal hearing into a former employee's grievance, she said: 'The school had been 10 years behind in progress and teaching methods and standards had been appalling. 'Half the staff had left and a high percentage of parents had withdrawn their children.' A spokesman for the Department for Education refused to reveal the nature of the cheating allegations, but said: 'The number of schools where results have been amended or annulled due to maladministration this year is consistent with previous years. 'It illustrates that the majority of schools administer the tests rigorously.

Wearing their traditional costumes as they solemnly perform their rendition of the Nativity story, this 'Mary and Joseph' would not be out of place at any Christmas play. But look a little closer and you'll see that underneath Mary's headdress is a crash helmet, with Joseph also sporting the safety gear. Schoolgirl Libby Dorman, eight, and her brother Reuben, five, were made to wear the helmets in case they fell off their donkeys as they rode through the streets of Neath, South Wales as part of an outdoor performance. Safety first: Health and safety measures meant 'Mary', aka Elizabeth Dorman, 7, and 'Joseph', played by her brother Reuben, 5, had to wear crash helmets when taking part in a nativity play in Neath, South Wales . Organisers at The Bridge Church in Neath, took the extra measures in response to health and safety fears. Youth worker Mark Barrett, 44, said: 'We were advised that any young child riding a horse or donkey needs a hard hat for health and safety purposes. 'We had to consider that Mary was going to be riding a donkey on a public highway. 'I know that the donkey was not moving very quickly but we didn't want to flout the law. A break from tradition: Alongside their traditional costumes, Libby and Reuben were made to wear their modern safety helmets . Little Donkeys: Organisers at The Bridge Church in Neath, took the extra safety measures in response to health and safety fears . Easy riders: The donkey's owner told nativity organisers that he could lose his licence if the children did not wear helmets . 'The owner of the donkey told us that because of his licence Mary needed to wear a riding hat.' Christmas shoppers cheered on the young actors playing Mary and Jospeh as they rode through the town centre behind an organiser in a high vis safety jacket. Little Libby managed to hide her hardhat under a shawl as she made her way to the Christmas nativity play but Reuben couldn't disguise his riding hat. The young actors then knocked on doors in the town square to see if there was 'any room at the inn'.

These festive pictures show the country's only free-roaming herd of reindeer wandering across the snow-topped hills of the east Highlands. Rather than calling Lapland their home, the 150-strong Cairngorm Reindeer Herd can be found in two locations in Scotland. Around 50 animals can be found ranging the Cairngorm Mountains, such as these pictured, while the remainder stay the Glenlivet Estate - some 30 miles away. Born free: The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd, pictured, is Britain's only free-roaming group of reindeer and can be found in the Highlands in Scotland . Numbers: There are 150 animals in the herd - some of which roam the Cairngorm mountains while the others stay in the Glenlivet Estate 30 miles away . Santa's little helper: The hard-working animals are all tame and regularly appear at festive gatherings throughout the winter months . The reindeer were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by a Swedish reindeer herder, Mikel Utsi. He started with just a few reindeer, but the herd has grown over the years. It is currently held at between 130 and 150 by controlled breeding, with most deer being born in the summer months. An account of the introduction written by Mr Utsi is featured on the official website for the animals. One-off: The reindeer, more commonly associated with Lapland, were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by Swedish reindeer herder Mikel Utsi . Running free: The herd - which have also featured in numerous films and television shows - is kept at around 150 by controlled breeding . Well looked after: The animals are monitored and cared for by staff at the Reindeer Centre in Glenmore, which was founded by the animal herder . In it, he says: 'Looking across Rothiemurchus Forest to the Cairngorms from the railway bridge at Aviemore on a cold morning in April 1947, I was instantly reminded of reindeer pastures in Lapland. 'In 1952, I brought some of my Swedish mountain reindeer to Scotland as an experiment, to show that they could live and breed in these surroundings. 'Official difficulties which had caused delay were overcome mainly through the interest shown by the Press and the influence of the Reindeer Council of the United Kingdom.' The animals are tame and are often drafted in to pull sleighs during the months of November and December. Meet and greet: Visitors to the centre can go on guided tours of the area and even meet some of the free-roaming animals . Explorer: This rather intrepid animal looks far more at home in the Scottish Highlands than Lapland . In the winter months, teams of reindeer are rounded up to visit Christmas parades around the country - hopefully getting everyone in the festive spirit. The hard-working creatures also appear at certain promotional events and even work in film studios. In winter, a daily visit to the herd departs from the  Reindeer centre in Glenmore - with guides taking visitors to the animals. At certain times of the year a small group are catered for at the centre in a paddock. Working hard: The animals are often using in Christmas parades and can be found at Santa's grottos in the run up to Christmas .","Tame 150-strong Cairngorm Reindeer Herd roam two locations in the Scottish Highlands .

The owners of a Washington state drinks bottle company have turned an irate customer's rant into rave reviews. When Liberty Bottleworks co-founder Ryan Clark saw an angry review from a customer who complained she was unable to speak to anyone over a weekend, he responded straight away. But instead of using the customer is always right line, Mr Clark defended his staff's right to uninterrupted family time over the weekends and at holidays. 'People over profit': Liberty Bottle founders Ryan Clark and Tim Andis have been praised for standing up for their employees . 'We pride ourselves on doing things the American way,' Mr Clark wrote to the unnamed customer. 'Not the instant gratification 24-hour shopping on Thanksgiving kind of American way, but family and country kind of American way.' The response clearly hit a chord with customers and fans of Liberty Bottle, an all-American produced product that hires Vets to help with its work. Liberty's Facebook page received more than 10,000 new likes and orders nearly doubled from the previous month. 'You can't give up your people for profit. You can't give up your ethics, beliefs or your core principals simply for another bottle sale,' Mr Clark told KIMA TV. A screenshot of the polite response to the negative review, which had been written in capital letters, has since been removed but not before it went viral. Negative: A customer who had trouble with her order ranted about the company online . Company policy: Ryan Clark responded to the complaint, saying he was sorry the customer was upset but adding that staff were entitled to family time . A few days after posting the response, the company was inundated with so many orders that it had to post a message on its Facebook page asking customers to be patient and understanding. The angry customer had complained about a lost payment and, in her review, advised others that 'If they have a deadline - like Christmas - forget about it', Gawker reported. She complained that instead of being able to prepare for the holidays she had wasted her weekend trying to deal with her complaint. In response, Mr Clark politely . suggested that the customer should try embracing the holiday spirit . herself, adding that his staff had been 'home with their families, doing . their cards, baking cookies etc'. And, . although he gave her his personal cell number in case she wanted to . discuss the matter further, he also reiterated his company policy of . 'Family first, product second'. Co-founder Tim Andis defended his company's customer service hours. 'You're competing against people like . Google who have live support 24 hours a day. Being a small manufacturer we're not going to have live support 24 . hours a day.' The company have tried to learn from the experience and have taken note of suggestions customers made for improvements since the story went viral. All American: Liberty Bottle was founded as a green company that uses U.S. products and hires Vets . Mr Clark was pleasantly shocked by the interest in his company after the response, telling Yakima Herald: 'You can’t trade that for a bottle. You can’t trade that for 100 bottles. You can’t trade that at all.' He added: 'We have this silly belief that you can do well by doing good. To see the number of people reaffirm [the idea] is kind of a neat thing.' However, Mr Clark was uncomfortable with some of the negative and nasty comments made about his lost customer, saying his message had been 'Be nice ... not to say mean things'.","Liberty Bottle co-founder responded to rant by saying weekends should be spent with loved ones .

The Chief Inspector of Schools faced a . barrage of criticism from Conservative MPs last night after he said . grammar schools are ‘stuffed full of middle-class kids’. Sir . Michael Wilshaw said the dominance of affluent children meant selective . state schools had almost no role in improving the education of the . poor. ‘A tiny percentage are on free school meals – three per cent. That . is a nonsense,’ he said. ‘Anyone . who thinks grammar schools are going to increase social mobility needs . to look at those figures. I don’t think they work.’ Sir Michael Wilshaw (seen here in an East London school) says grammar schools do not improve the chances of poorer pupils . His comments angered . Tory MPs who believe expanding the grammar system could help reverse . the decline in social mobility. Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful . 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, described Sir Michael’s . intervention as ‘unwise’. The . former education spokesman, whose Altrincham and Sale constituency is a . bastion of the grammar school system, said: ‘We have some very bad . schools in this country and I think the chief inspector would be better . advised to focus his attention on improving those, not criticising some . of the good ones.’ Mr Brady . said grammar schools sometimes ended up selecting fewer children from . poor homes because they had been failed by the state primary system. He . said he was ‘angry’ that Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael appeared to . have ignored evidence that high schools that operate alongside grammars . in areas such as Trafford in Greater Manchester show ‘incredibly good . performance’. Statistics show areas with selective state schools dominated GCSE and A-level results last year. Reading . came top, with 45.9 per cent of pupils gaining grades AAB or equivalent . in 2012, followed by Trafford with 34.5 per cent. The state sector . average is 16.8 per cent. Sir Michael's comments angered Tory MPs who believe grammar system could help reverse decline in social mobility . High-performing local education authorities . (LEA) with selective schools also included Southend-on-Sea in Essex and . Torbay in Devon, which have some of the worst areas of deprivation in . the UK. Seven of the top ten best performing LEAs at GCSE also offered . grammar school places. Tory . grandee David Davis, who also went to grammar school, said the system . should be ‘maintained at all costs’ because it remained ‘the way . working-class children get their chance in life, on an equal footing to . children who can go to the private sector’. He admitted that poorer youngsters had been ‘elbowed out by ambitious middle class parents’ in some areas. But . he said the decline of grammars had left Britain ‘more dominated than . it ought to be by the products of private schools’. He suggested this . could be reversed if the grammar school system was allowed to expand. However, . in an interview with the Observer, Sir Michael suggested grammar . schools only helped an elite 10 per cent of pupils – often with pushy . parents. It is the second . blow in a week for the grammar system, following a decision by Education . Secretary Michael Gove on Friday to block an application to create a . new ‘supergrammar’ in Sevenoaks, Kent. The . scheme was the first test of new rules that allow grammars to expand on . satellite sites. But education sources said the bid was ‘botched’ and . would have effectively created a new selective school, which is banned . under existing law. Yesterday . the Department for Education refused to be drawn on the comments by Sir . Michael, who also claimed in a wide-ranging interview that summer . holidays were too long and admitted that when he used the cane during . his time as a teacher in the 1970s it had ‘never worked’.

Christmas shoppers are being faced with soaring prices as retailers increase the price of must-have toys in the run-up to Christmas. Stores including Tesco, Asda and Toys R Us have been attacked by consumer groups after they increased prices on Furbies, fairy dolls and doctor play-sets for the last weeks of festive shopping. The hikes, in some cases as high as 45 per cent, come after a price war in November when retailers were trying to out-do one another and offer the best holiday bargains. Hike: Tesco had been stocking the Furby Boom, left, for £49.99 but have increased the price to £54.99, while Toys R Us increased the cost of the Teksta robot puppy, right, from £47.99 to £59.99 . Increased: Asda was selling the Nerf Elite Rapidstrike foam gun for £25, but it now costs £35 . But now consumers who missed out are being left with the original prices, which consumers bodies say has allowed them to 'milk' shoppers for their cash as they run out of options. One of the products to increase recently was the Nerf Elite Rapidstrike foam gun at Asda, which was £25 but is now on sale for £35, according to figures in the Sunday Mirror. Parents looking to buy the must-have Flutterbye Fairy Flying Doll from Toys R Us would also have found themselves out of pocket as the item increased from £23.99 to £34.99 - a 45 per cent jump. Tesco also stopped stocking the Furby Boom virtual pet for £49.99, increasing the price to £54.99. Toys R Us also increased the cost of the 'Teksta' robot puppy from £47.99 to £59.99, the RoboFish playset from £14.79 to £19.99 and the Monster High 13 Wishes Party Doll range from £16.49 to £22.99. There was also evidence of traders on Amazon ramping up prices on Doctor Who merchandise not available in shops in the wake of the show's 50th anniversary. Sink or swim: Toys R Us had lowered the price of this RoboFish bowl play-set to £14.79, but has now returned it to £19.99 . The process of suddenly increasing prices as demand peaks - known as 'scalping' is said to be widespread in toy retail. Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group . website, condemned the rising prices, saying 'It’s set to be a very merry Christmas for everybody . except the consumer.' Alan Simpson, of the Toy Retailers Association, said: 'Some shops are using toys as a tool to drive footfall through their doors and sell other goods', adding that online retailers 'will milk' their stocks on toys in short supply to ensure maximum profit. However, the retailers defended their position, with Tesco saying: 'Our price for a Furby is among the lowest of any retailer.' Doll wars: The Monster High 13 Wishes Party Doll, right, has changed in price from £16.49 to £22.99, while the Flutterbye Fairy Flying Doll, right, rose from £23.99 to £34.99 at the same store . Toys R Us said 'We are always keen to ensure we offer the best and lowest possible prices to our customers which is why our price match policy is in place all year round to ensure we remain the best priced toy retailer.' A spokesman for Argos said the offers change constantly so that shoppers can 'always get a great deal'. He added: 'The Doc McStuffins Doctors Bag Set is not currently on offer, however, customers can choose from 1,000 other toy lines which are reduced as part of our Toy Sale, some of them up to half price.'","Stores including Tesco, Asda and Toys R Us increased prices .

Festive frenzy: Shoppers are expected to spend £12billion next weekend as last-minute bargain hunters hit the high street . Shoppers are expected to spend £12billion next weekend as last-minute bargain hunters hit the high street in the final few days before Christmas. Retail experts are predicting that shoppers will take to the streets in their thousands, spending almost as much in the four days from December 20 as they did in the whole of October. Analysts say that many people have been putting off their festive shopping in the hope of bagging a bargain, with many stores slashing prices in the run-up to Christmas. Some high street giants, including Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, John Lewis and Selfridges have been offering as much as 50 per cent off items in store as Christmas draws ever closer. Other shoppers have been leaving it late knowing that with many workers leaving their offices for Christmas on Friday they will have three days to do all their buying before Christmas Eve. Retail consultancy Verdict said that spending over the entire weekend could be as much as 20 per cent higher than it was last year, when Christmas Eve fell on the Monday. 'To put £12billion in context, shoppers spent £17billion in October: it's a huge amount,' Verdict's senior retail analyst Andrew Stevens told The Sunday Telegraph. 'People have been putting things off to see if they can get a bigger deal, but also you have the fact that the 23rd falls on a Monday. People know they can wait to the end of this week and still have three days to shop.' Many shoppers took to the shops this weekend, with retailers reporting brisk trading yesterday. More than 330,000 people were expected . to visit the Bull Ring centre in Birmingham over the course of the . weekend, while last weekend the Liverpool One complex recorded its . busiest day since its opening in 2008. Shop 'til you drop: London's Oxford Street was on course to host 6.2 per cent more shoppers this weekend compared to last year . Cutting prices: Many stores are offering discounts of up to 50per cent as they try to lure shoppers . Sales were up nine per cent on the corresponding Saturday last year, with takings in Union Square, Aberdeen, rising by the same figure. In the last week five per cent more people have visited the Silverburn centre in Glasgow compared with last year. One of the country's most famous shopping destinations, London's Oxford Street was on course to host 6.2 per cent more people this weekend compared to last year, while the Westfield Centre in Shepherd's Bush will stay open from 8am until midnight on the 23rd in order to cater for last-minute shoppers. The Bluewater shopping centre in Kent will also be opening until midnight on the 23rd, with 20 of the stores including Rigby & Peller and All Saints staying open. Robert Goodman, Bluewater's general manager, said: 'This weekend is likely to see a similar surge in sales and footfall to Black Friday, but driven largely by need rather than retailer promotions. 'For some, the weekend is the last chance to shop in earnest for Christmas presents, and our stores are going to be busy. 'Over the four days we will also have a lot of guests that are here to treat themselves, having completed their Christmas shopping already. 'We also expect guests to take advantage of our extended opening hours, including the debut of midnight trading on Monday, to make a day of their visit to Bluewater.' Christmas countdown: Bargain hunters, such as these shoppers in Cambridge, are expected to flock to the shops in their thousands next weekend . Tom Nathan, general manager at Brent Cross shopping centre in north London, said people were leaving it later than ever to do their Christmas shopping. 'Christmas really started from Black Friday which has become a far bigger phenomenon than previous years,' he said. 'People are leaving it later and later because retailers have better ranges available. 'The general view customers take is that if I want to buy something, I can have it.' Shops and restaurants at the Trafford Centre, just outside Manchester have also been reporting increased sales. General manager Richard Paxton said: 'Some of our retailers are offering pre-Christmas deals, in a bid to attract customers to their stores. Savvy shoppers are arriving early on Saturday mornings, or staying later into the evening, for uninterrupted Christmas shopping with the chance of some great bargains.' Among the stores offering discounts to entice savvy shoppers are Tesco, which is cutting prices on electronics, John Lewis, which is offering up to 50 per cent off selected womenswear brands including Hobbs and French Connection as well as deals on electrical items, and House of Fraser which has 40per cent off selected premium brands in a deal that ends at midnight. Gap has 50per cent off many items in store, Topshop is offering 30per cent off coats, Halfords have deals on bicycles and SatNavs and Mothercare has also cut prices by 20per cent. For hosts needing extra furniture to help them house guests over the Christmas period Homebase is offering a 20per cent online discount, and B&Q has half price Christmas lights for those who are yet to deck their halls and trim their trees. Mike Coogan, Toys R Us marketing and ecommerce director said: 'The additional days before Christmas will be outstanding for shoppers and big for retailers, Toys R Us are working hard to ensure we'll have plenty of the popular and best selling toys still in stock right through until Christmas Eve at the best possible prices.' Bargain hunters: Christmas shoppers on Oxford Street . Predictions: Retail consultancy Verdict said that spending over the entire weekend could be as much as 20 per cent higher than it was last year, when Christmas Eve fell on the Monday . Roughly £3.3billion of the £12billion total will be spent online, with £2.4billion on that on non-food items. Around half of the £12billion will be spent on food, £900million of which will come from online sales, with customers opting to have their groceries delivered, rather than brave the busy supermarkets. Waitrose is expecting the number of internet deliveries to rise by 60per cent in the final week before December 25, and expects 10am to 11am on December 23 to be its busiest hour of trading. A spokesman from Asda said that the supermarket is expecting the weekend before Christmas to be one of its busiest, with shoppers enjoying offers including £10 bottles of Pierre Darcys Champagne - with sales currently up 35per cent on last year. Alongside food the chain has noted an increase in shoppers buying festive jumpers and onesies, with £3million worth of Christmas knitwear sold in just one week, and 2million onesies sold since October at the rate of £1million worth every week.","Bargain hunters set to hit the high street in the run up to Christmas .

A judge has halted work on the Brazil stadium where England will play their opening World Cup game after two workers died in separate incidents in less than ten hours, it was reported today. Construction worker Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, 22, was killed in the early hours on Saturday after falling 115 feet from the roof of the Amazonas Arena in Manaus, northern Brazil. And just before lunchtime the same day another labourer, Jose Nascimento, 49, died of a heart attack while working on another part of the stadium complex. Family members later complained that he had been working without any days off because of pressure to deliver the venue to Fifa on time. Death: The 22-year-old fell around 35 metres from the roof of the stadium, pictured. He died in hospital at 4am this morning . The stadium, in Brazil's jungle state of Amazonas, is due to host England's opening match on June 15 against Italy. But last night a judge ordered all work to be halted on the stadium until authorities can be satisfied no more workers' lives are being put at risk. Maria Nely Bezerra de Oliveira said the death of Mr Ferreira was identical to another fatality in March this year, when another worker fell 16 feet from scaffolding above the stadium. She revealed that health and safety inspectors had made 114 reports of serious work law violations since construction began on the venue. She said: 'Because of the risks inherent with this type of development, we have constantly monitored the work. 'But despite the relentless work of the authorities, we have nevertheless witnessed the repeated noncompliance with work laws. 'Now with the death of yet another worker, we believe it is time to take action to prevent further tragedy.' Linked: Several construction workers have died while working on stadiums for the Brazil 2014 World Cup . Construction firm Andrade Gutierrez will face a £40,000 for every day they do not comply with the order, she added. And workers must continue to receive their full salaries, however long work at the stadium - due to be inaugurated on January 15 - remains at a standstill. Fears the stadium may not be ready in time for England's opener were raised further after a union leader last night threatened to call for a strike.

EU migrants could see their access to benefits cut as the Government considers reducing the number of people allowed into the UK each year. A leaked document has shown the Government could propose that the cap on the number of migrants from EU countries allowed into the country is cut from 106,000 to 75,000 a year. The paper is also said to suggest that British people are given 'national preference' for jobs and that labour movement from poorer countries in Europe is limited. A leaked Home Office document, which blames EU freedom of movement policy for a rise in homelessness and begging, has suggested slashing the number of migrants allowed into the UK from 106,000 to 75,000 a year . The report suggests the policy has had a negative impact on young British people and low-skilled workers . The document suggests that the EU's freedom of movement policy has led to a rise in homelessness and begging in the UK and also encouraged people and drugs trafficking, according to The Sunday Times. In a review of the policy, the Home Office also reports that there is 'widespread public concern' about it and that it has had a negative impact on young British people and low-skilled workers. It suggests that migrants should be blocked from accessing benefits and tax credits for their first five years in the UK. The report also recommends that professional and high-skilled migrants from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria only be permitted to move to the UK if they have a job offer. Low-skilled migrant workers, meanwhile, should only be allowed in if they find work on an approved national shortage jobs list. The review, which is a draft, is also said to have claimed that freedom of movement has caused a 'build-up of social tensions' in UK communities, stretched public services and encouraged benefits tourism. The newspaper reports that the proposed 75,000 cap is 'not yet' being strongly pushed by the Government, but adds that it may prove an important part of David Cameron's pledge to renegotiate the UK's relationship with Europe if he wins the 2015 General Election.

David Cameron’s key Muslim adviser is being investigated by police after an alleged House of Lords bust-up with a fellow Muslim whom he called a ‘f****** dog’ and threatened to beat up. Lord Sheikh is said to have launched the extraordinary tirade against imam Omar Faruk, whom he suspects may have been behind revelations in The Mail on Sunday that the Tory peer was besotted with a pretty waitress 45 years his junior. The peer vigorously denies threatening or swearing at Mr Faruk. Claim: Lord Sheikh, left, and Mr Faruk. The two have been reportedly had a bust-up in the House of Lords . In July, we revealed the 72-year-old married peer, who has advised Mr Cameron on Islamic issues at several private meetings, proposed to the waitress, 27, after offering a kilogram of gold in dowry. Lord Sheikh allegedly confronted Mr Faruk as the imam went into the Lords to lead the Friday prayer known as jummah in the multi-faith prayer room. The Tory peer – who is chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum – then allegedly abused Mr Faruk, calling him a ‘f****** s***’, and waved his arms at him. Mr Faruk, 44, who is also a barrister and was formerly Lord Sheikh’s chief-of-staff, was left tearful by the incident, and reported it to police. Scotland Yard confirmed it is investigating an allegation of ‘threatening behaviour’ against Lord Sheikh. Mr Faruk told this newspaper he entered One Millbank, which is part of the House of Lords, just after 1pm on Friday and was confronted by Lord Sheikh in the reception area. In Mr Faruk’s police statement, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘He came towards me full of anger, his eyes were red and bloodshot. He said, “F*** off, you f****** shaitan [satan], you f****** s***, f*** off.” ’ He added: ‘He [Lord Sheikh] was waving his arms wildly about to hit me. I was shocked and afraid as he kept shouting and screaming, “F****** shaitan”. He then said, “You s***, you f****** s***, I am going to kick the s*** out of you.” ’ The alleged incident took place in the House of Lords . Mr Faruk, from East Dulwich, South London, said Lord Sheikh also called him a ‘f****** dog’. He said the alleged spat happened in front of a police officer, who did not intervene. Mr Faruk said he left One Millbank after the incident and was initially pursued by Lord Sheikh. Lord Sheikh’s wife, Shaida – who is believed to be separated from her husband but still does his parliamentary work – is also said to have witnessed the incident. Tory MEP Syed Kamall is said to have seen  Mr Faruk being pursued by Lord Sheikh. Last night, Mr Kamall said: ‘I don’t want to get involved.’ Mr Faruk said he planned to carry on leading the Friday prayers, but added: ‘I was left tearful. He nearly assaulted me. It was humiliating.’ Lord Sheikh denied threatening or having a ‘verbal spat’ with Mr Faruk. The peer said Mr Faruk had attended Friday prayers uninvited, and was asked to leave by security. Lord Sheikh said that when Mr Faruk refused, he also asked him to leave. The peer said he never threatened violence against Mr Faruk and never swore at him. He also said police officers have not contacted him yet in relation to the incident.","Lord Sheikh allegedly called Omar Faruk a 'f****** dog'

Britain pays four times as much for its wind energy as Brazil, thanks to uncompetitive subsidies. A damning report from the Policy Exchange urges the government to hold the wind industry to its pledge to slash costs by the end of the decade. UK families are paying £95 per MWh for onshore wind, compared to £27 MWh in Brazil, according to its report. Gap: UK families are paying £95 per MWh for onshore wind, compared to £27 MWh in Brazil . It argues that the government should hold an auction of renewable technologies to allow the industry to compete for state support. This could start as early as next year for projects which would begin in 2017. Currently, ministers only plan to introduce energy auctions in 2018 for projects that will be commissioned after 2020. But this week Energy Minister Michael Fallon is set to unveil detailed plans about how to make subsidies more competitive. Announcement: Energy Minister Michael Fallon is set to unveil detailed plans about how to make subsidies more competitive this week . Critics fear this could mean more onshore windfarms by the backdoor as they are cheaper to run compared to offshore wind, which costs about 50 per cent more to generate. But government sources insisted that the plan will make it more difficult for the onshore windfarms to get state handouts because they will be subject to a ‘constrained allocation’. In Brazil, prices for onshore wind have dropped to world record lows since auctioning was introduced.But in Britain, ministers are much keener on more expensive offshore wind because it is less politically controversial. While onshore windfarms trigger fury from local communities due to their visual blight and noise, offshore windfarms are far away enough from homes not to spark protest. But offshore wind is about 50 per cent as expensive as onshore wind, with a strike price of £155 MWh. The most expensive technologies are tidal and wave power, which cost around £305 MWh. Simon Moore, author of the report said: ‘The government needs to act more ruthlessly to reduce household energy bills by cutting state support for renewable technologies that do not come down in price. He added: ‘Offshore wind may play an important role in our future energy mix. But it should not be given favourable treatment at the expense of other low carbon technologies which could reduce our carbon emissions at a much cheaper price.’ The report said of offshore wind, that ‘at its current costs it is simply too poor value an investment to be allowed to continue much longer’. The Policy Exchange also called for the government to abolish the EU Renewable Energy Target which it said imposed unnecessary costs on Britain’s energy. In its report, it said: ‘While the renewable energy target exists, introducing effective means of competition, or of cost-control more broadly, is seen as impossible. The legally-binding target makes no allowance for the potential high expense of meeting it.’ Future: Currently, ministers only plan to introduce energy auctions in 2018 for projects that will be commissioned after 2020 . The EU Renewable Energy Target decrees that 15 per cent of all energy in the UK - or 30 to 35 per cent of electricity - is generated by renewable sources by 2020. But emissions from the electricity sector are already capped by a separate European Emissions Trading System. Average electricity bills are already £563 a year, out of a total dual fuel bill of £1255. By 2020, this will rise to £598 out of a total bill of £1331. Various renewables targets are already contributing to £37 of this rise, and will account for £110 in 2020. ‘A policy that imposes higher-than-necessary costs risks failing if public support is lost,’ the report said. Part of the reason for Brazil’s low wind energy prices has been put down to unusually high wind speeds, a surplus of wind turbines and hidden incentives. Its wind turbines have much better capacity of up to 65 per cent, compared to up to 35 per cent in the UK and much of Europe.","UK families pay £95 per MWh for wind, compared to £27 MWh in Brazil .

Sir Ian Kennedy's call for MPs to receive a £7,600 salary hike to £74,000 a year caused turmoil in Westminster, with all three party leaders angering their backbenchers by vowing to block it . The man who triggered public fury last week by demanding that MPs receive an 11 per cent pay rise is to be axed from his job as the Commons watchdog. Sir Ian Kennedy’s call for MPs to receive a £7,600 salary hike to £74,000 a year caused turmoil in Westminster, with all three party leaders angering their backbenchers by vowing to block it. Now Sir Ian has had his bid to be reappointed as chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) rejected by Commons Speaker John Bercow. Sir Ian had wanted his £100,000-a-year contract, which runs out next year, to be extended until after the 2015 General Election, when the  pay rise is due to take effect. The Speaker’s veto has thrown an already demoralised Ipsa into further chaos. One MP who has worked closely with the body said: ‘With all this leadership uncertainty, and the  hostile reaction to the rise, I wouldn’t be surprised if the board just resigned en masse.’ The Mail on Sunday understands that earlier this month Ipsa’s board wrote to Mr Bercow requesting Sir Ian be reappointed to the chair unopposed. According to one well-placed source, the Speaker replied that he would not sanction it, citing  ‘legal’ grounds. A new head of the body will now have to be found – just as David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband plan to hold cross-party talks designed to head off the rise. As the law currently stands,  Ipsa’s recommendations are legally binding, meaning MPs cannot decline the rise. Their only option is to give the extra money to charity. Last week, Sir Ian, 71, was accused of talking ‘utter nonsense’ after claiming that a new package of higher pay, with lower pensions  and perks for MPs, had ‘significant support’ from the public. He added that any political interference in the decision would lead to ‘disaster’. ‘Part of the package is the part that they don’t like, but the package as a whole has significant support from the public,’ he said. ‘For example, the public is in favour of changing the pensions.’ Now Sir Ian has had his bid to be reappointed as chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) rejected by Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured) However, according to polling  carried out on behalf of the watchdog, 88 per cent of the public are against a pay rise. Sir Ian – a medical ethics lawyer who was knighted after chairing the inquiry into the Bristol heart babies surgery scandal – has endured a tumultuous four-year stint as the head of Ipsa, which was set up in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal to overhaul MPs’ pay and perks. His appointment to the body was overshadowed by coverage of his friendship with Alastair Campbell, for whom he acted as his ‘phone a friend’ during a celebrity edition of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? And in February 2004, Sir Ian was a guest of Tony Blair at Chequers, where he dined with Cabinet Minister Hilary Benn and former Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart. Last week, Sir Ian, 71, was accused of talking 'utter nonsense' after claiming that a new package of higher pay, with lower pensions and perks for MPs, had 'significant support' from the public . According to senior Commons sources, he even had to be ‘talked out of resigning’ within hours of  taking up his post over press reports of the break-up of his third marriage. Ipsa denies Sir Ian considered walking out. Last night a spokesman for Mr Bercow said Sir Ian’s contract  extension had been refused because it was not ‘legally possible’. A spokesman for Ipsa said: ‘Discussions were held about the situation when Sir Ian comes to the end of  his fixed-term contract. It is not  true to suggest that the Ipsa board is  considering a walk-out’.","Sir Ian Kennedy's bid to be .

Revolution: Labour MP Lucy Powell said attitudes in society towards working parents had to change . Working mothers are seen as ‘scatty clock-watchers’ who are given a bad name by out-of-date sitcoms, a Labour frontbencher has warned. Lucy Powell said attitudes had to change because the days of dad working while mum 'stays at home bringing up the kids' are long gone. The shadow childcare minister said she wanted to ‘bust the myth’ of working parents as unreliable employees. Miss Powell, who recently returned to Westminster from maternity leave, called for a revolution in the way employers and colleagues view working parents. She said attitudes will not change while there is just one mother in the Cabinet. And she complained that the depiction of mothers on television has not changed since the 1970s, when the sitcom Butterflies featured the frustrated, culinary-challenged housewife Ria, played by Wendy Craig. Mothers are wrongly seen as unfocussed employees who take too much time off while fathers have requests for leave rejected, she said. In her first speech since taking the role in Ed Miliband’s reshuffle, she said society must value the contribution parents make in the workplace. ‘They too often get a raw deal and suffer from prejudice. Too often working parents are given a bad name at work: seen as not focused on the job or having to leave early or take time off. ‘I want to bust this myth. I want to champion working parents, particularly working mums, and I want business and other organisations to join me. ‘Far from being scatty and clock-watching, working mums have done a day’s work before they leave the house - we don’t waste a minute of our day.’ Stereotype: The way that mothers are depicted on TV has not changed since the 1970s sitcom Butterflies, starring Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Palmer, Andrew Hall (far left) and Nicholas Lyndhurst (far right), Miss Powell said . The gap between what men and women earn in work has widened for the first time in five years, new figures show. Full-time . men now earn 10 per cent more than their female colleagues, but . including all employees the gap has risen 19.6 per cent to 19.7 per . cent. Unions seized on the figures as proof that years of ‘slow, steady progress’ on pay equality was being eroded. Full-time pay for men increased by 1.8 per cent to £556 a week and went up by 2.2 per cent for women to £459. Working mothers are ‘highly productive’ and ‘loyal and creative employees’, she added. ‘We should be celebrating, not berating, the role parents play in the workforce and in society. ‘This . is a job for all of us. It is shocking that there is only one mum in . David  Cameron's cabinet, and the depiction of mums on the TV hasn’t . moved on much from Wendy Craig's character Ria in Butterflies. ‘That’s why we need more working mums in positions of power and culturally to reflect the positive contribution we make.’ Childcare for working parents has become a major political battleground, with all the main parties claiming to be on the side of families. Labour has promised to extend free childcare for three and four year olds with working parents from 15 to 25 hours. It would also guarantee childcare before and after school for primary school age children. Meanwhile the coalition is offering free childcare for two-year-olds from the poorest households, and will a tax break worth £1,200 off the cost of childcare. Mr Cameron surprised the Commons yesterday when he revealed that matertnity pay will be included in the new cap on total welfare spending. The Treasury scrambled to say that if Britain’s benefits bill breached the new cap, likely to be around £100billion, maternity pay would be the last thing to be touched. But in last year's Autumn Statement Mr Osborne announced that maternity pay would be uprated by just one per cent, instead of in line with inflation, in a move dubbed the 'Mummy Tax'. Myth: Miss Powell said she wanted to change the idea that working mothers were unfocussed, scatty employees who kept taking time off . Miss Powell added: 'Gone are the days of dad working while mum stays at home bringing up the kids. While this is the choice of some, it is not the reality for the majority. 'My generation of women expected that we could 'have it all' but we are all too often still having to choose between career and motherhood, and being plagued by guilt whichever path we take. There remains an impenetrable glass ceiling for working mums. 'I want my daughter’s generation to be able to have the best of both worlds and to have real choice. 'So my main message to you today, is that in order for this to be realised we need an ambitious agenda for childcare and family policy. 'While there’s been a quiet revolution in the way people live their lives, we now need a childcare revolution to match it'","Shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell calls for a revolution in attitudes .

David Cameron has confessed that his wife Samantha only fell for him because he owned a car - and that she may not have been 18 when he fell in love with her. In a revealing interview with Total Politics magazine, the Prime Minister said he was ‘square’ when he met Samantha, who was friends with his younger sister. Mr Cameron, who is nearly five years older, said he was only able to woo the teenager because he drove her around and took her out for meals. Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha go out for a curry in Birmingham to celebrate his 46th birthday last year . ‘She claims I was the first boyfriend who had a car and asked her out to dinner,’ he said, ‘but it took a couple of years to persuade her to marry me.’ Mr Cameron seemed uncertain whether his future wife was an adult when he fell for her in his early 20s. The Camerons pictured in 1995. He confessed that she only fell for him because he owned a car . ‘She was a very good friend of my . sister Claire. We have an argument about when we met, but I think it was . when she was 18,’ he said. ‘She was this very laid-back, very . chilled, rather cool friend of my very cool younger sister, and I was . the sort of square brother. 'I got to know her on a family holiday, and . that was pretty much love at first sight.’ Mr Cameron said that since he became Prime Minister he has turned to his wife for support in times of stress. ‘She’s amazing in every single way. I can’t believe how lucky I am to have her,’ he said. The PM also told the magazine that Culture Minister Ed Vaizey was wrong to have once claimed that Mrs Cameron voted for Tony Blair in 1997. Mr Cameron also used the interview to toughen his line on Europe, admitting Britain could prosper if the UK leaves the European Union. In a concession to his rebellious backbenchers, the Prime Minister said there will have to be a ‘full and frank debate’ about whether to break links with Brussels. Mr Cameron indicated that he would prefer to remain in the EU and renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels, but his words will be seen as opening the door wider to the possibility of British withdrawal. The Prime Minister has promised a referendum on Britain’s position in the EU by the end of 2017 after seeking a better deal. But he has previously stressed the potential economic costs of withdrawal. But in an interview with Total Politics magazine he said: ‘Of course Britain could make her own way if we chose to do so.’ Mr Cameron, who is nearly five years older, said he was only able to woo the then teenage Samantha because he drove her around and took her out for meals . That echoes senior Tories like . Education Secretary Michael Gove and former Chancellors Nigel Lawson and . Norman Lamont, who have both called for Britain to quit the EU. Senior Tory Michael Gove has called for Britain to leave the EU . Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ll have to ask . ourselves: is that what we really want? 'I want to see a reformed EU; . that’s why I’ve pledged to negotiate a new settlement and then put that . to people in an in-out referendum. That . will be the time to have a full and frank debate about our membership.’ The PM dismissed claims by party grandees that he will not be able to . cut a new deal. ‘I do not agree that we cannot get anything from a negotiation with Europe,’ he said. ‘People said we wouldn’t get the European Union to agree to a cut in the seven-year budget, and they agreed to it. 'They said we couldn’t get Britain out of the EU bailout fund, and we did. 'There are many things people said we couldn’t get from the EU that subsequently we did.’ Leading Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell welcomed the change of heart. He said: ‘The Prime Minister has left himself some wriggle room. 'He has the option of turning round and saying the deal isn’t good enough. He could conseivably lead the out campaign. ‘I find this incredibly encouraging.

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 20:13 EST, 15 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:44 EST, 16 December 2013 . Distinguished judge: Baroness Butler-Sloss has warned of the peril of legalising assisted suicide . One of the country’s most distinguished judges has warned of the peril of legalising assisted suicide. Allowing the terminally ill to be killed would cross ‘a line in the sand’ towards euthanasia, according to Baroness Butler-Sloss. ‘The law rests on the principle that we do not involve ourselves in deliberately bringing about the deaths of others,’ she said yesterday. ‘Once we start making exceptions based on arbitrary criteria like terminal illness, that frontier becomes just a line in the sand, easily crossed and hard to defend.’ Lady Butler-Sloss, an appeal judge who headed the family court system until her retirement, intervened in the euthanasia argument on the eve of a landmark Supreme Court case. Nine judges will sit in a test case, which decides whether the assisted suicide law should be changed. The Supreme Court hearing, which will consider appeals on behalf of two men who want doctors to be able to help them die, coincides with a new attempt by right-to-die campaigner Lord Falconer to persuade peers to vote for a law to allow doctors to help terminally ill patients to die. Lady Butler-Sloss, 80, said: ‘We are seeing a predictable upsurge in the activities of the assisted dying lobby in the run-up to the Supreme Court’s hearing next week. ‘Assisting suicide is against the criminal law, and with good reason. The prohibition is there to protect vulnerable people. Yet some are suggesting that this process should be put into reverse for terminally ill people and that doctors should be licensed to facilitate their suicide.’ Case: The Supreme Court will hear appeals on behalf of the late Tony Nicklinson (left) and Paul Lamb (right) Lady Butler-Sloss, who is the former . president of the Family Division, accused right-to-die campaigners of . bending debate on the issue by twisting the language. ‘Campaigners . throw up their hands at the word suicide,’ she said. ‘Giving lethal . drugs to someone who is terminally ill isn’t assisting suicide, they . say, but assisting dying. ‘Similarly, . Lord Falconer’s Private Member’s Bill, now before the House of Lords, . describes the lethal drugs that it wants doctors to be able to supply to . terminally ill patients as “medicines”. Such euphemisms may make the . idea of changing the law more palatable, but they obstruct reasoned . debate.’ She said an . assisted suicide licensing system with ‘doubtful safeguards’ would suit a . few people determined to end their own lives. However, she added: ‘Parliament has to make laws to protect all of us, especially the most vulnerable. ‘It is hard to imagine any group of people more vulnerable than those who are dying. They need our support and protection, not our help to commit suicide.’ 'Assisting suicide is against the criminal law, and with good reason. The prohibition is there to protect vulnerable people' Baroness Butler-Sloss . Once assisted suicide was legalised, she said, the practice would spread beyond the set limits. ‘Anyone who doubts this should read the report of Lord Falconer’s self-styled “commission on assisted dying”, and its conclusion that legalising assisted suicide for people with severe physical impairments was not acceptable “at this point in time”,’ Lady Butler-Sloss wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. Under the 1961 Suicide Act, anyone who helps a suicide is guilty of a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail. The Supreme Court will hear appeals on behalf of Tony Nicklinson and Paul Lamb. Mr Nicklinson, who had locked-in syndrome following a stroke, died in August 2012 after losing his High Court case for the right to be helped to die. His widow Jane has been allowed to pursue the case. Mr Lamb, a former builder and a father-of-two, has been almost totally paralysed since a car crash in 1990. He wants a doctor to be allowed to help him die.","Comments from Baroness Butler-Sloss who headed family court system .

The elementary school in which seven children drowned after a monster tornado barreled through an Oklahoma City suburb on Monday had not built a tornado shelter as they could not afford it, officials have admitted. There was growing disbelief as cost-cutting state leaders revealed that even after a devastating tornado struck the area 14 years ago, most schools in Oklahoma still had no purpose-built shelters. And as Moore's mayor claimed that the death toll could have been over a thousand if so many residents hadn't been able to hide in underground shelters, it became clear why such a large proportion of the casualties were school children. In May 1999, the area was ravaged by a fierce tornado that killed 44. Many residents responded by building their own underground tornado shelters at their own expense. But, incredibly, school children were not afforded the same protection. Scroll down for video . Pulled from the rubble: A boy is saved from Plaza Towers Elementary School, which did not have a storm shelter . Plaza Towers Elementary School was in the direct path of this week's tornado and was reduced to a pile of twisted metal and rubble. Around half the children stayed inside, finding shelter where they could in bathrooms. Seven are believed to have drowned. An online petition was set up by a member of the public within hours of the tragedy demanding that shelters be put in every school, apartment building and mobile home park in Oklahoma. Glenn Lewis, the mayor of the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, claimed most schools in the state did not have special shelters except those rebuilt after being destroyed in the 1999 tornado. 'Most of the schools in Oklahoma do not have shelters. It's because of the cost,' he told CNN. 'The new ones that were hit in the 1999 tornado, they do have built-in shelters.' Before the storm: An aerial photograph shows Plaza Towers Elementary School before it was hit by the monster tornado on Monday . Destruction: An aerial view shows the school after the two mile-wide tornado touched down on Monday . He insisted that this gaping hole in the city's safety precautions would now belatedly be rectified. 'It's something that we’re definitely going to look at,' he said. 'The school system and the city are two separate entities but I'm sure we’ll be talking to them to try and get them federal emergency money to help rebuild these schools.' Mark McBride, a state congressman who represents Moore, said he was 'just choking back tears, trying to be strong' as he helped rescuers search through the rubble. Defending the lack of school tornado shelters, he said education already accounted for a large proportion of local government spending. 'Our budgets are stretched and education takes a lot of the money - 50 plus per cent,' he said. He admitted school shelters 'had not been a priority' but predicted that would now change. Missing: Family members have said that Janae Hornsby, left, and Sydney Angle, right, are missing . Tragedy: Eight-year-old Kyle Davis died instantly after the tornado struck his school Monday afternoon . In an emotional speech during a press conference on Tuesday, Susan Pierce, from Moore Public Schools, said that safety was their priority. 'I would like to extend my sincere sympathies to all those who have suffered losses,' she said. 'Our hearts go out to each of you and please know we are all here with you.' She added that while the path of the tornado was unpredictable, all storm procedures were implemented at every school site. It comes as it also emerged . that a storm shelter program that officials had devised for Moore was . put on hold just months before the town was flattened by the deadly two . mile-wide tornado. Officials had devised a plan to help . residents build storm shelters and applied for $2 million from the . Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to build safe rooms in 800 . homes in Moore. 'It is the . desire of the City to assist persons who are in Moore to have a place to . seek refuge from severe weather,' the letter read. But . a letter which was released by the city in February and first seen by . the Daily Telegraph shows that the program was put on hold as . authorities tried to navigate federal regulations. Hide out: A man looks down what appears to be a storm shelter in the aftermath of the tornado . The officials predicted in the storm . shelters should receive their final approval date of November 1, 2012. In . the letter, the city said regulations put in place by FEMA for the . money were a 'constantly moving target', which had slowed down progress . at getting federal funds. In . another complication, the federal grant program that was giving out the . money they desired allocates its funds during Presidential major . disaster declarations, the letter said. 'Oklahoma . has had few of these declarations in the past couple of years, so there . is not a lot of grant money available,' it explained. The statement, which was released in February on the city's website, revealed the city's frustrations. 'The . City's safe room rebate program is still ""on hold"", with not a lot . changed from our update of last May,' it read. 'We've found that the . FEMA requirements and their interpretations seem to be a constantly . moving target, more so with the new wrinkles.' Officials said they hoped to have another plan submitted by March, yet it is unknown if this went through. Search: Two firefighters break through concrete during the search for survivors at Plaza Towers . Shelters are not compulsory in the state despite its location in so-called Tornado Alley. Basements are rare in the state . because of the damp soil, meaning water seeps into storm cellars and . basements, which leads to mold and fungus. Water . pressure can also build up due to the soaked soil, which puts pressure . on basement walls and the concrete can eventually give way. 'People think they can dodge the bullet,' said Mr McBride when asked why schools had no shelters. 'We haven't had a major one [tornado] since 1999. We're brave and stand in our driveways watching the storms go by.' Oklahoma's Lieutenant Governor, Todd Lamb, dismissed reports that the ground was so hard in the state that it was impossible to dig out a basement without using dynamite. Nothing left: American flags wave over the remains of Plaza Towers Elementary school on Tuesday . He claimed some schools used basements instead of purpose built underground shelters. But he had to admit that the basement under Plaza Towers proved to be a death trap. 'There are basements, there are shelters. But of course not everybody has one,' he said. Neither Moore nor Oklahoma City have designated public storm shelters, and residents are told to go to their basements or storm cellars if they have them. If they do not, they are advised to go to interior hallways and to stay away from windows.","Plaza Towers Elementary School was a direct hit during the tornado .

Mr Dwyer, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire, and a former Assistant Chief Constable, had been asked if the planned wage cuts meant that officers were being undervalued.

'We've got to understand we're in very tight times and at least we're not working for HMV, are we? 'Our officers still have a job.' The . Police Federation has already said that the proposed cuts will fail to . reflect the dangers of policing roles because a new recruit will receive . a salary of £19,000, which is less than a trainee manager at fast food . chain McDonald's.

Changes: Whitehall insiders said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured yesterday) had ordered a review on changing the current sentencing regime . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is to change Britain’s ‘dishonest’ sentencing rules that allow inmates to walk free halfway through their jail terms. The shake-up follows the case of ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne and his former wife Vicky Pryce who were released after serving just two months of an eight-month sentence. Philip Davies, a backbench Tory MP campaigning for longer jail terms, said an ‘overwhelming majority’ of the public wanted inmates to serve the terms they were given. In reply, Mr Grayling said he had ‘sympathy’ with this view and hoped to be able to provide further ‘reassurance’ in coming months. The Tory Party has previously stated that it believes ‘many people feel that sentencing in Britain is dishonest and misleading’. Whitehall insiders said Mr Grayling had ordered a review on changing the current sentencing regime, which was introduced by Tony Blair a decade ago. It allows all bar the worst inmates to go free at the halfway stage. Mr Huhne and his ex-wife, who were jailed for perverting the course of justice by swapping speeding points, then had further time cut from their sentences in return for wearing tags. Initially, Mr Grayling’s plans will focus on the most serious violent and sexual offenders. Instead of being automatically freed, regardless of their behaviour, they will have to earn the right to be released. This could include carrying out education or other work behind bars and showing a willingness to earn the skills to go straight. The plan – likely to require additional prison places – will initially be limited to the worst offenders because of budget constraints. But Mr Grayling wants to move to a sentencing regime which is easier to understand and will rebuild public trust. Freed: The shake-up follows the case of ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne (left) and his former wife Vicky Pryce (right, both pictured on May 13) who were released after serving just two months of an eight-month sentence . One option is to introduce a system . where the courts can specify minimum and maximum sentences. The . prisoners will only be able to leave jail after their minimum sentence . is served by having earned their release. Campaigning: Tory MP Philip Davies said an 'overwhelming majority' of the public wanted inmates to serve the terms they were given . Mr Grayling revealed his stance in . questions at Westminster yesterday. Mr Davies, a Tory right-winger, . asked him: ‘Chris Huhne and his former wife were released from prison . recently after serving just two months of an eight-month sentence. ‘In surveys that I have . conducted, an overwhelming majority of my constituents believe that . prisoners should serve their sentences in full. 'Aside from locking them up for longer, will the Secretary of State say how long he thinks people should serve in prison before they are released?’ Mr Grayling replied: ‘On this matter, I have a lot of sympathy with what [Mr Davies] says. I am looking closely at this area. I hope to be able to provide further reassurances to him in due course.’ Making prisoners earn the right to be freed will be popular with Tory MPs left deflated by the recent rows over gay marriage and Europe. But it also fits in with Mr Grayling’s . theme of wanting a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ where inmates learn . practical skills behind bars. Steve White, deputy chairman of the Police Federation, said prison sentences should do ‘what they say on the tin’. He said: ‘It is hugely confusing for the public who read that Chris Huhne is sentenced to eight months and then see him walk out weeks later. The same applies to someone convicted of murder and sentenced to life, something most people think is unequivocal. 'The idea that you get up to 50 per cent off for good behaviour, which in effect is lack of bad behaviour, is nonsense' Steve White, Police Federation . ‘If it does not mean that the courts should say so. They should be open and honest. The idea that you get up to 50 per cent off for good behaviour, which in effect is lack of bad behaviour, is nonsense. ‘There needs to be transparency – the justice system is to serve the people. We should be honest and say that eight weeks for perverting the course of justice is an appropriate sentence.’ Mr Grayling also said yesterday that the Tory Party could fight the next election on a  platform of withdrawing from the European Court of Human rights. He said: ‘My party is looking at what proposals we want to put to the country. The vast majority of the population want changes to our human rights framework. If the Labour party disagrees, I look forward to having that debate.’","Shake-up follows early release of Chris Huhne and ex-wife Vicky Pryce .

'We hope these efforts will mean there are even more childhood cancer survivors in the UK in the years to come.'","In the last decade the number of children surviving cancer is 82 per cent .

Three wolves were shot dead yesterday after their pack escaped from a zoo near a residential street. Families were told to keep children indoors as experts warned the animals could pose a threat. A police helicopter, dozens of police cars and armed zookeepers were scrambled after the pack of five escaped through a damaged fence. Four were quickly recovered with two shot dead, but it took more than eight hours before the final wolf was found and killed. The wolf was shot dead near Colchester in Essex and is seen been taken away by police . Police are pictured carrying away one of the dead wolves which was shot dead after escaping from Colchester Zoo in Essex . Five of the animals fled through a damaged fence at Colchester Zoo in Essex at about 7.30am . Last night, the zoo in Essex was investigating how the timber wolves managed to break out. At around 7.30am yesterday, keepers at Colchester Zoo found that the fence around the wolf enclosure was damaged and five of the six wolves had escaped. One of the wolves returned to the enclosure and another was successfully drugged with an anaesthetic dart and recaptured. But the zoo said it had to kill the other three wolves as they managed to escape from the zoo’s grounds, posing a public risk. Two were shot dead close to the zoo. Police, helped by a helicopter, searched a nearby wooded area for several hours before the final wolf was found. A member of the zoo's firearm team is pictured searching for the wolves this morning . Police launched a helicopter to search a wider area for the missing wolves in Colchester, Essex . At around 4pm, seven shots rang out as it was killed. It was placed into a large black bag and carried away by officers and keepers. Zoo curator Sarah Forsyth last night said: ‘At 7.30am this morning we discovered that the perimeter fence of Colchester Zoo’s wolf enclosure had actually been damaged and five of our six timber wolves had left the enclosure. ‘It is not known at this stage how the damage occurred despite the fence being checked by the keepers on a daily basis. ‘One of the wolves did return to the enclosure almost immediately of its own accord, another one was secured within the zoo and was darted and recaptured and put back into the enclosure. ‘Unfortunately three of the other wolves did make their way out of the zoo, out of the safety of the zoo’s perimeter grounds. ‘An anaesthetic dart can take 15 minutes or more to work. In a highly stressed or excited animal it may not work at all. Zoo staff shot dead two more of escapees, because they had got further away from the zoo which is based on the edge of Colchester . (File picture) Five Timber wolves were discovered to have fled through a damaged fence at Colchester Zoo in Essex this morning . ‘So, we did have to make the decision that these animals had to be shot on sight. These are wild animals, they are dangerous wild animals, they are not pets and they are in a very unpredictable situation and they would have posed a very real risk to the public.’ Dog walkers at a nearby beauty spot had earlier spoken of their concerns about the missing wolf. Malcolm Lawrence, 62, said: ‘We saw the helicopter go up over the woods and I certainly am worried about my dog. I’m keeping a close eye on him as you just don’t know what might happen. ‘I think people will need to be careful but it seems that a lot of them are not even aware of it.’ The Essex Police helicopter spent the day searching for a wolf which escaped from Colchester Zoo . Officers and a police helicopter were searching the fields surrounding Colchester Zoo to find the final escaped wolf . During the search Richard Morley, of the Wolves and Humans Foundation, warned residents to stay indoors. He said: ‘I would suggest that people keep young children inside until the wolf is found. If it has been hand fed and it is used to approaching a keeper for food then it is more likely to approach the public. ‘People are at most risk if they are out on their own in woodland areas with food or pets. As with any wild animals I would advise people to take precautions.’ Five timber wolves escaped from Colchester Zoo in October 1986 when heavy rain undermined their fence, but on that occasion all were safely recaptured. In July this year, the zoo warned the public not to approach a red river hog after it escaped from its enclosure. Timber Wolves pictured at feeding time at Colchester Zoo.

The bank paid an undisclosed fee to hire the ballroom and made donations to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Ballet, which provided entertainment. Among the 100 guests were banking executives, Tony Blair, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, is at the centre of a new 'Palace for hire' row . A Palace spokeswoman said the event was part of Prince Andrew’s ongoing work to ‘support British prosperity’. But Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I understand the Palace needs to cut costs and raise money, but dining there should be a privilege rather than being open to the highest bidder. ‘The security implications are also an issue.’ The Household’s relationship with senior corporate figures was previously questioned after St James’s Palace was rented out, apparently at a cost of £30,000 a day, during the London Olympics. Buckingham Palace said that the State Apartments were occasionally used by outside organisations to generate income to pay for the upkeep of its properties – a recommendation made in a recent parliamentary report. The Royal Ballet performed at the Buckingham Pallace event . The event in the ballroom on October 30 was reportedly arranged by a personal friend of Prince Andrew called  David Mayhew, who is one of JP Morgan’s most senior staff.

Accusation: Tory MP Rob Wilson, pictured, has sent a bombshell tape recording to the chairman of the BBC Trust which he says proves there was a 'cover-up' over the Jimmy Savile affair . A Tory MP last night sent a bombshell tape recording to the chairman of the BBC Trust which he says proves there was a ‘cover-up’ over the Jimmy Savile affair. Rob Wilson has given Chris Patten a recording of Nick Pollard – who headed an independent inquiry into why the BBC’s Newsnight programme axed its investigation of Savile. On the tape, Mr Pollard is heard admitting that he made a ‘mistake’ by withholding a key detail from his report. He says he was told that BBC head of news, Helen Boaden, had personally informed director-general Mark Thompson of the sex abuse allegations against Savile in December 2011. Mr Pollard added he received the information in a letter from Ms Boaden’s lawyer. The assertion is at odds with Mr Thompson’s claim that he was unaware of the allegations against Savile until after he left the BBC in September 2012. In his final report in December 2012, Mr Pollard stated that he had ‘no reason to doubt’ Mr Thompson’s story. But during the tape-recorded private conversation, Mr Pollard adds: ‘It doesn’t particularly reflect well on me that I overlooked this [the letter] in the report.’ Now Mr Wilson has inflamed the long-running saga by telling Lord Patten, he must decide, ‘whether you wash your hands of this – or whether you listen to the evidence yourself.’ The £3 million inquiry was set up last year to investigate claims that Newsnight scrapped an investigation into Savile’s paedophile activities in December 2011 to avoid a clash with a Christmas tribute programme. Mr Thompson, now chief executive of the New York Times, has admitted that he rang Ms Boaden and other senior executives in BBC News in December 2011 to discuss Newsnight’s investigation of Savile. Disgraced: An investigation into allegations made against Jimmy Savile was axed by the BBC's Newsnight programme . Recording: On the tape Nick Pollard is heard saying he was told that BBC head of news, Helen Boaden, left, had informed director-general Mark Thompson, right, of the sex abuse allegations against Savile . But he maintains he did not discover what it was about until nine months later, after he left the BBC. Mr Wilson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This has a bad smell about it and looks like some sort of BBC attempt to cover over the truth of what really happened. ‘The public is being misled about what the most senior person in the BBC knew about Savile when the BBC were running tribute programmes and keeping evidence of Savile’s crimes under wraps.’ A BBC Trust spokeswoman said: ‘We made clear to Rob Wilson MP that he should raise his concerns with Nick Pollard, as a first step. We will, of course, consider further evidence if Mr Wilson wishes to send it to us.’ A spokesman for Mr Pollard said: ‘There has been speculation about the Pollard Review’s conclusion about the extent of Mark Thompson’s knowledge. This speculation is based on a false premise, namely that insufficient consideration was given by the review to a letter from Helen Boaden’s lawyers. ‘That letter was fully and carefully considered by the Review before the publication of my report.’ Probe: Nick Pollard headed the independent inquiry into why the BBC's Newsnight programme scrapped an investigation into Savile's paedophile activities .

Cruelty: Horse Breeder Evan Lloyd Evans has been jailed for ten weeks for keeping Welsh mountain ponies in such a state that the RSPCA put nine of them down and impounded another 51 . More than 100 horses have been destroyed after they were kept in appalling conditions at a farm, it emerged yesterday. The animals were among 400 found in a neglected state by RSPCA inspectors who swooped on the ‘deeply upsetting’ site. In one of the ‘most significant animal welfare events’ ever seen, a charity spokesman revealed that over 100 of the animals were put down while around 300 have been moved to sanctuaries across the country. The ‘owner’ of the horses, is the subject of an on-going investigation and cannot be identified. Meanwhile, in a separate case a few hundred miles away from the site in South Wales where the 400 horses were found, another horse owner was jailed after many of his animals were also destroyed. Evan Lloyd Evans, once considered a leading breeder, has been jailed for ten weeks for keeping Welsh mountain ponies in such a state that the RSPCA put nine of them down and impounded another 51. The 69-year-old, who is said to have cost the animal charity £30,000, was also banned from keeping horses for ten years after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the needs of his animals. A court heard the hooves of nine horses were in such an untreatable state it was decided by a vet to put them to sleep rather than put the animals through further suffering. Harrowing videos of the ponies’ living conditions and the condition of their feet were shown to Caernarfon magistrates’ court in north Wales. Distressing: A court heard the hooves of nine horses at Mr Evans's farm were in such an untreatable state it was decided by a vet to put them to sleep rather than put the animals through further suffering . The ponies were semi-feral, the court had been told, living in a hazardous environment. The RSPCA are expected to take separate legal action after the discovery of the 400 horses on a farm in the Vale of Glamorgan, in south Wales. The two cases show the shocking plight of horses in the UK - many of which were abandoned after the crackdown on the horsemeat trade branded them financially worthless. Charities and animal sanctuaries are struggling with an influx of horses in appalling condition after unscrupulous dealers, hit by a slump in demand following the horsemeat scandal, abandoned them. Around 7,000 horses are now considered ‘at risk’, according to the report by leading charities including the RSPCA and Blue Cross, with the horsemeat scandal a significant factor, but with over-breeding and the recession also playing a part. Harrowing: Videos of the ponies' living conditions and the condition of their feet were shown to Caernarfon magistrates' court in north Wales . Rescue centres have seen a rise of up to 40 per cent in admissions since it was revealed in January that some supermarket food labelled as beef contained horse. Vet Nic de Brauwere, from Redwings Horse Sanctuary, in Norwich, which helped co-ordinate the rescue operation in South Wales, said: ‘The individual suffering is something we have seen before and will possibly have to see again. ‘But it was the totality of the situation that made it the most significant horse welfare event that I have ever been involved in. ‘What we found was a property with a large number of horses and other animals. ‘There were concerns for the welfare of all the horses and with the environment and conditions they were trying to cope with. ‘There were problems at every level.’ Council officials, RSPCA officers, police and vets spent six days earlier this month assessing the horses and providing treatment. Court hearing: Mr Evans was also banned from keeping horses for ten years after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the needs of his animals . More than 300 horses were removed in lorries from the site, while other animals, including sheep, geese and dogs, were also removed. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘As more animals were assessed, the number of horses found to be in such a suffering state that they had to be put to sleep on veterinary advice rose to just over 100. ‘This was a tragic situation and one that was hugely upsetting for all those involved.’ She added that the charity was involved in an on-going animal welfare investigation and could not identify the horse breeder allegedly involved. Steve Carter, the charity’s national director of Wales, said the ‘absolutely tragic incident’ was the result of overbreeding across the country and a lack of food. He said: ‘There are just more horses than there are homes.’ Thousands of horses which would have been sold for meat are now simply being abandoned following the horsemeat scandal. Where unwanted horses might once have gone to the meat trade, now their owners abandon them rather than pay up to £100 a week to care for and feed them. Some are ‘flygrazed’ - a practice where owners, often from the travelling community, leave horses to graze on other people’s land without permission - on a patch of scrub. The Animal Sanctuary, in Dorney, Buckinghamshire, is caring for a third more horses than this time last year and is spending more than ever on vets’ bills as many arrive in a horrific condition. Head trustee Diana Coad said: ‘Before the horsemeat scare there was, sadly, a trade in horses for meat but now there’s no market for them. ‘People don’t want to pay to feed them or pay to have them put down, so unscrupulous owners are hiding them away in pockets of land and leaving them to starve very slowly and painfully to death.’","RSPCA inspectors found 400 animals in a neglected state on one site .

Researchers using the Large Hadron Collider in Cern say they create droplets three to five protons in size - 100,000th the size of a hydrogen atom or one-100,000,000th the size of a virus. The droplets are believed to be similar to a primordial matter that existed immediately following the Big Bang, the team say. The tiniest droplets: A reconstruction of the collision that produced collective flow behavior. The green lines are the trajectories of the sub-atomic particles produced by the collision reconstructed by the CMS tracking system. The red and blue bars represent the energy measured by the instrument's two sets of calorimeters. (CMS Collaboration) This surprise result was achieved by firing proton 'bullets' into lead ions, creating a subatomic blood spatter-like effect. Evidence of the minuscule droplets . was extracted from the results of colliding protons with lead ions at . velocities approaching the speed of light. To provide a sense of scale, that is about one-100,000th the size of a hydrogen atom or one-100,000,000th the size of a virus.

Archivists in California have unearthed vials of moon dust collected from the Apollo 11 mission, hidden within a warehouse at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Each of the 20 vials have handwritten labels on, dated 24 July 1970, and were found inside a vacuum-sealed glass jar on the lab's campus. Along with the jar was a copy of the . paper 'Study of carbon compounds in Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 returned lunar samples', published in the Proceedings of the Second Lunar Science . Conference in 1971. A total of 20 vials containing moon dust and rocks collected during the Apollo 11 space mission in 1969 have been found abandoned in a warehouse in California. The discovery was made by archivists at the Lawrence National Berkeley Laboratory. It is unknown how long the samples have been there, although handwritten labels date them at 24 July 1970. The vials were found in a vacuum sealed glass jar . The handwritten label on this vial of dust, found in a warehouse at the Berkeley Lab in San Jose, reads: 'Apollo, 11 Rock 1005 Dust Calcinated 24 July 1970'. The sample was collected by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during the Apollo 11 space mission. Samples were sent for tests to more than 150 labs worldwide and should have been returned to Nasa . Lunar soil is the fine layer of the loose rock found on the Moon's surface. Its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil. Lunar soil is primarily created by the breakdown of basaltic and anorthositic rock. These rocks and particles are left on the moon and caused by meteorites and other interstellar particles crashing into the moon's surface over billions of year. Earth soil, on the other hand, is formed by molecular oxygen (O2), humidity, atmospheric wind and other biologicial processes. The name lunar soil is slightly misleading, too, because soil on Earth is defined as containing organic materials, whereas lunar soil was found to contain none. There is no official definition of what size fraction of lunar soil is classed as' moon dust' - some scientists claim that dust is anything less than 50 micrometres in diameter, whereas others put it at less than 10. Archivist Karen Nelson made the discovery. Nelson has worked at the Berkeley Lab's warehouse in San Jose for 17 years and admitted: 'We don’t know how or when they ended up in storage.” Following the successful moon landing of Apollo 11 in 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin collected and brought back various moon rocks and lunar soil samples. These samples were catalogued and then sent for tests at around 150 laboratories worldwide. One of those was the Space Sciences Laboratory in Latimer Hall on the UC Berkeley campus. After experiments were carried out and the relevant papers published, the samples should have been sent back to NASA. Instead, the moon dust samples from Berkeley were put into storage and forgotten about. One of the authors of the 1971 Space Sciences Laboratory paper was Melvin Calvin, a former associate . director of Berkeley Lab, then known as Ernest O. Lawrence Berkeley . Laboratory. Calvin also won the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Nasa's Apollo 11 space mission was the first time humans had landed on the moon. American astronauts  Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon's surface on July 21, 1969. During the mission they collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material and brought it back to to Earth. The samples were sent to labs across the world for testing .

It has long been thought that hunting was the cause of the creatures’ extinction, but researchers have now revised their opinion. They believe a huge meteor smashing through the Earth's atmosphere broke up into ten million tonnes of fiery fragments, scattering over four continents. These fragments are thought to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun, causing temperatures to plummet, plants to die and landscapes to alter forever. The woolly mammoth was probably wiped out by rapid climate change caused by a meteor striking the Earth, not by overhunting as previously believed . Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that this caused the extinction, countering previous theories that the spread of human settlements and aggressive hunting was to blame. After the impact, some animal species, like humans, adapted by either moving away, downsizing to adapt to the resources around them, or simply changed their way of life to cope. But other species, including the woolly mammoth which roamed throughout Europe, parts of Asia and North America in vast numbers, did not adapt and were wiped out in a generation. The research says the impact changed the course of the Earth's history forever. According to anthropologist and geology professor Kenneth Tankersley, the change from booming population to total extinction happened 'within a lifetime'. The University of Cincinnati professor said: ‘Imagine living in a time when you look outside and there are elephants walking around Cincinnati. ‘But by the time you are at the end of your years there are no more elephants. It happens within your lifetime.’ Working with scientists all over the world, the team found evidence of burnt out fragments of carbon - called spherules - in sites on four continents, and all dating back 12,800 years. A meteor is thought to have stuck the Earth 12,800 years ago releasing toxic gases into the air and temporarily blocking out the sun causing temperatures to plummet . They examined the bedrock dating back to the ice age in 20 archaeological sites in the world which date back to this formative period in the Earth's history. The timing matches the known dates of the last woolly mammoths to roam the planet, along with other ice age creatures like the sabre tooth tiger. A meteorite hitting the Earth's surface or simply breaking up as it passed through the atmosphere, would cause a sudden and drastic change in the weather. Professor Tankersley said: ‘This likely cause climate change and climate change forced this scenario. You can move, downsize or you can go extinct. ‘Humans at the time were just as resourceful and intelligent as we are today. With mammoth off the dinner table, humans were forced to adapt which they did to great success.’ He added that the lessons learned from that time could apply to today as the Earth again goes through a period of ‘rapid and profound’ climate change. He said: ‘It's a reminder of how fragile we are. Imagine an explosion that happened today that went across four continents. ‘The human species would go on. But it would be different. It would be a game changer.’","A meteor hitting the Earth 12,800 years ago released toxic gases into the air and blocked out the sun causing temperatures to plummet and plants to die .

The Daniel Fast is based on the fasts of the Old Testament prophet Daniel (pictured) There are diets that involve substituting food for air and others that see slimmers consume alcohol instead of a meal. Now, there is also the so-called God diet. Officially known as the Daniel Fast, the diet sees people eat nothing but fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Followers only drink water and avoid eating meat, fish, bread and any sweetened or processed foods. The eating plan is based on that followed by the Old Testament prophet, Daniel. It is fasting in the sense that followers cut back, rather than stop eating food altogether - in a similar vein to the the 5:2 plan (where followers eat a restricted diet two days a week). Susan Gregory, author of The Daniel Fast, explained that the plan is based on his recorded fasting experiences. In a video, she explains that Daniel was among a group of men captured by Babylon and that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon wanted the men to be in top condition - so insisted they eat the same food as he ate. But when Daniel was served this food, he refused it, as he was committed to God and felt the food had not been prepared according to Jewish standards. He also believed it had been sacrificed to false gods. Daniel 1:8 states: 'But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank.' Instead, Ms Gregory says, he vowed to eat nothing but foods grown from seeds and drink only water. Later, Daniel fasted again while seeking God's word on the future of Israel and described this fast as involving no meat, wine or leavened bread. Daniel 10:3 states: 'I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks.' These biblical descriptions of Danielâ€™s fasts form the basis of the new eating plan. Ms Gregory, who described the Daniel Fast as a 'vegan diet with even more restrictions', says following the diet involves avoiding caffeine, chemicals and sugar and, as a result, it can ease headaches, leg cramps and fatigue. She added it can also cause people's cholesterol levels to fall and their blood sugar levels to balance out. The author adds that the diet often leads to weight loss and 'a general feeling of wellbeing'. However she adds that, while the diet is a very healthy way to eat, people with health problems might need to modify it. It sees people eat nothing other than fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Followers also drink nothing other than water and avoid sweetened and processed foods . For example, she accepts that people with diabetes might need to eat more carbohydrates and that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers might need to add fish, chicken and cheese. Sarah Neumann, from Michigan, tried the Daniel Fast as a religious exercise and without considering the weight loss that could go with it. She told The Atlantic that she initially struggled with it when eating in restaurants or with friends. However, she says she lost weight while on the diet and she still has a healthier diet as a result. 'Since the experience I've lost a lot of weight just from learning how to have more self-control,' she said. But nutritionist Zoe Harcombe is unconvinced by the health benefits of following the diet. She explained to MailOnline that the health impacts it would depend on how long someone follows it for. Nutritionists say there are some benefits to the diet as it sees people cut out junk food, white flour, sugar and processed foods. However, they also say it could lead to shortages in many vital vitamins . She said that if they only follow it for a few days, it would not cause too many problems. But longer than that could cause them to become deficient in numerous vitamins - especially those found in animal products. She said the diet is good in the sense that it involves cutting out junk food, sugar, white flour and processed foods. This reduces the chance of obesity and lowers a person's risk of some cancers, heart disease and diabetes. But, she added that followers would miss out on Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E and Vitamin B12. A lack of Vitamin A can, in extreme cases, lead to blindness, a shortage of Vitamin D can cause muscle weakness and bone pain and a deficiency of Vitamin E could cause the immune system to be weakened. She explained that, as a result, anyone following the diet for longer than a few days would need to take vitamin supplements to avoid health problems.

Penguins cannot fly because they are such good swimmers - and no bird can excel at both, said scientists. They started to fly through the ocean instead of the air as they developed wing-propelled diving skills that allowed them to forage for food at increasing depths. Penguins lost the ability to fly as they developed more efficient wing-propelled diving skills that allowed them to better forage for food at increasing depths of the ocean . The evolution of flightlessness in penguins has mystified scientists for decades. But now a study of guillemots - which closely resemble penguins in their diving and swimming, but can still fly - shows there is no such thing as a wing that's good for both. Scientists discovered that guillemots on Coats Island, Northern Canada, used substantially less energy than most other birds when they were diving. But the energy they needed for flight was the highest ever reported for a flying bird - 31 times greater than expended when at rest. There are 18 species of penguin - 13 of which are declining and five of them are considered endangered. While most people associate penguins with Antarctica, penguin populations can also be found in South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as many small islands in the southern Pacific Ocean. While swimming, penguins will leap in shallow arcs above the surface of the water, a practice called porpoising. This coats their plumage with tiny bubbles that reduce friction, allowing them to swim as fast as 20 miles per hour . The light front and dark colour of classic penguin plumage is called countershading and provides camouflage from above and below to protect penguins in the water. Penguinsâ€™ eyes work better underwater than they do in the air, giving them superior eyesight to spot prey while hunting, even in cloudy, dark or murky water. Depending on the species, a wild penguin can live 15-20 years. During that time, they spend up to 75 percent of their lives at sea. Professor John Speakman, of Aberdeen University, said: 'Like many people, I wondered why on earth they lost the ability to fly. 'It's great to be part of the team that has collected the data that resolves this issue. 'Our findings for the energy expended when diving and swimming by guillemots fit exactly into the predictions of the biomechanical model. 'The lack of flight in penguins has been an enigma because it leads to some seemingly poorly adapted behaviour. 'Emperor penguins, for example, walk up to 60km between their rookeries and the sea - a journey taking several days that could be covered in a few hours if they were able to fly. 'Also, many penguins are targets of predators such as leopard seals, at the points where they enter the ocean. 'This problem could be easily avoided if penguins could just fly over the top of the predators. 'However applying the [new] theory to penguins, their loss of flight may have been due to the tradeoffs in maximizing wing function in water versus wing function in air. 'As penguins evolved, their wings became more and more adapted to swimming and diving in the oceans where they catch their food - making this part of their lives very energy efficient. 'However at the same time the energy required for flying became greater and greater for the penguin. 'At some point it simply became impossible to sustain the very high energy costs of flight and the birds became flightless. 'Presumably the efficiency benefits when feeding offset the inefficiency of having to walk everywhere when they were on land. 'Our studies of guillemots have now shown that this biomechanical theory is very likely to be correct.' The study monitored guillemots because they resemble penguin ancestors. The birds can fly but also swim very efficiently, although flying uses up around 31 times more energy than flying for the species . Guillemots - members of the Auk . family of seabirds - are common on the Arctic coast and breed in large, . noisy colonies, with each female laying a single egg on a narrow cliff . ledge. In pursuit of a meal . they perform short shallow dives but they are more than capable of . reaching depths of 300ft or more to reach favoured fish and squid. Penguins can dive as deep as 1,850 feet in search of fish, squid and tiny crustaceans called krill but are awkward on land - waddling across the ice or sliding on their bellies. Professor Speakman said: 'Guillemots resemble penguins in their diving and swimming behaviour, but differ in that they are still able to fly. Scientists have been mystified by the penguin's inability to fly until now . 'In many respects they are like a modern equivalent to the ancient ancestors of penguins before they lost the ability to fly.' Paleontologists have proved penguins could once fly by discovering the density of bone has been increasing over the last 36 million years. What this means is a much heavier penguin today compared to its ancestor. Penguin bone used to be hollow. Birds today are able to fly in part due to the fact that they have hollow bones. Hollow bones are lighter then dense bones making it easier to fly. Penguins changed into dense boned, grounded birds, after they followed their food out of the air into the sea. Kyle Elliott, a zoologist at Manitoba University in Winnipeg, Canada, said: 'Clearly, form constrains function in wild animals, and movement in one medium creates tradeoffs with movement in a second medium. 'Bottom line is that good flippers don't fly very well.' The study was published in Proceedings of . the National Academy of Sciences.","Experts at Aberdeen University concluded that penguins started to 'fly' through the ocean instead of the air as they developed diving skills .

Over 170 photos - all taken during scientific research - were entered into this year's competition before judges whittled them down to the best 44 images, which are currently being displayed in a gallery on the university's campus. Students, staff and family members were then given the opportunity to vote for their favourites, and the winning entries have been made available online. The winning entry called East-West, West-East, was taken by Martin Jucker studying the . Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. According to Jucker, the winds around Earth are directed from west to east, or east to west. Jucker's image shows the direction of the wind around Earth, averaged over time. The blue area shows wind travelling in east-to-west direction, the red areas show wind travelling west-to-east . Second place was awarded to 16-year-old Michael Kosk. His photo is an enhanced image of a crushed piece of birch wood. Kosk explained: 'The dense cellular structure of wood is what protects it, in part, from microbes breaking apart cellulose and causing rot. In my materials science course we broke apart the cellular structure of birch by resorting to mechanical strength, crushing it along a specific direction and buckling the cellulose pathways that would normally be responsible for the distribution of water and nutrients to the rest of the tree' Pablo Debenedetti, Dean for Research at Princeton said: 'Like art, science and engineering are deeply creative activities. 'Also like art, science and engineering at their very best are highly unpredictable in their outcomes. 'The Art of Science exhibit celebrates the beauty of unpredictability and the unpredictability of beauty.'

He took a black-and-white photo of a crushed piece of birch wood for his entry and won Â£101 ($154.51). This entry into Princeton University's Art of Science contest is called Bridging the Gap and was taken by Jason Wexler and Howard A. Stone of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. When drops of liquid are trapped in a thin gap between two solids, a strong negative pressure develops inside the drops. If the solids are flexible this pressure deforms the solids to close the gap. In Wexler and Stone's experiment the solids were transparent, which allowed the pair to take photos of the drops from above. Alternating dark and light lines represent lines of constant gap height. These lines are caused by light interference, which also causes rainbows or patterns in an oil slick . Bands of social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus travel together. In order to hunt prey efficiently and protect one another, these cells coordinate the way in which they move - or 'glide'. In this image the gliding of hundreds of thousands of these cells was tracked over four hours.

The camera took just 15 minutes to shoot the panoramic image, which is 6,000 miles long and 120 miles wide . The LDCM travels at 438 miles (705 kilometres) above the Earth. It orbits at speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour. The satellite takes just 20 minutes to complete one orbit of the planet. It is the eighth satellite of its kind to orbit the Earth and will soon be renamed Landsat 8. The first satellie, known as Landsat 1 or Earth Resources Technology Satellite 1, was launched in 1972. Landsat 8 took 56 images during its final orbit in April. These images, stretching from northern Russia to South Africa, were stitched together by Nasa to form a seamless swath of land. It is the world's largest panoramic photo and is 6,000 miles long and 120 miles wide. After two months of testing and calibration in space, Nasa fired LDCM into space in February. It travelled to 438 miles (705 kilometres) above the Earth and orbited the planet. During its final flight in April it scanned a 120-mile wide swath of land starting at northern Russia and finishing at South Africa. The LDCM took 56 individual shots of the land as it orbited the Earth and Nasa stitched these images together to form the seamless swath. Each shot includes clouds, haze and varying angles of sunlight. The photos were enhanced using the Operational Land Imager (OLI) that can capture images at a higher-resolution that what human eyes can see. Nasa's LDCM orbited the Earth at around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 kph) and completed one full orbit in 20 minutes. It took the LDCM just 15 minutes to capture the 6,000-mile-long swath.

A report has criticised the variation between people’s ability in certain regions to access radiotherapy and drugs on the NHS. As a solution, doctors should get financial incentives to encourage them to reach the national target of being seen within two weeks, the report has found. But regional variations mean  that patients in some areas are four times more likely to wait more than two weeks to see a specialist than in others. Cancer: Patients in some areas are four times more likely to wait more than two weeks to see a specialist than in others. File picture . The findings of the all-party parliamentary group on cancer highlighted the variation in treatment.John Baron, the chairman of the parliamentary group, told the Telegraph: ‘It is a national disgrace: late diagnosis makes for poor survival rates. ‘We need to redouble our efforts at every level to promote earlier diagnosis - cancer’s magic key - so our survival rates catch up with other countries.’ There is a particular gulf between affluent parts of London and the Home Counties and the rest of the country. Premature cancer mortality rates are more than twice as high in Liverpool as in Kensington and Chelsea, west London. The report criticises the variation between people¿s ability in certain regions to access radiotherapy and drugs on the NHS. File picture . In Liverpool there are 157 deaths per 100,000 people under 75. This is compared to Kensington and Chelsea, where fewer than 78 people die early. Nationally, a quarter of the 320,000 patients diagnosed every year are not aware they have cancer until they attend an accident and emergency unit. Residents in the North East have more than double the chance of being sent for a targeted form of radiotherapy than those in the South West. File picture . The figures show there was a wide regional variation in urgent referral rates, ranging from fewer than 800 referrals per 100,000 people in areas of London to nearly 3,500 per 100,000 in the North East and East Anglia. Those residents in the North East have more than double the chance of being sent for a targeted form of radiotherapy than those in the South West. The report’s authors said: ‘Where a person lives should not determine whether or not they see a specialist to have potential cancer symptoms investigated.’ Earlier this year it was reported the elderly were being denied life-saving operations in a postcode lottery of age discrimination in the NHS. Some patients over 75 are six times more likely to have operations to remove cancer than those living in other areas where doctors have written them off because of their dates of birth. Age discrimination in the NHS has been illegal since last October and patients can take doctors, hospitals or GP organisations to court if they think they have been unfairly denied treatment. But figures uncovered by the Lib Dem MP Paul Burstow revealed patients’ chances of having surgery to remove tumours, hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depended on where they lived. Mr Burstow, a former health minister, and campaigners say the variations are so marked they can only be caused by age discrimination in some areas. The figures showed that women aged 75 in Mid Devon are almost six times more likely to have surgery to remove breast cancer than those living  in Birmingham.","Some patients four times more likely to wait over a fortnight to see specialist .

A little boy with a rare condition which gave him 12 fingers and 12 toes has defied doctors to learn to smile, walk and communicate in time for his second birthday. One-year-old Ryan Edwards was diagnosed with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome – a bone growth disorder - while he was still in his mother’s womb. His mother Natasha Williams, 26, was told after a 20-week scan that Ryan's body would probably not develop sufficiently to support his organs. She was advised to consider an abortion. Ryan Edwards, one, has Ellis-van Creveld syndrome - a rare bone growth disorder - which caused him to be born with 12 fingers and 12 toes. The condition also causes dwarfism and heart conditions . Ryan was diagnosed during a pre-natal scan and his mother was advised to consider aborting him. Doctors warned he might never walk or talk . She said: ‘The pregnancy was normal until that point. I felt numb when they told me. ‘When the doctor said I should think about termination, I wasn’t surprised - I had a feeling they would raise that as an option. ‘We only had a weekend to decide what we wanted to do. But I’d already made up my mind that Ryan deserved a chance. If he was going to pass away, I wanted him to go on his own terms. ‘It didn’t seem right to make that decision for him, before he’d had a chance at life.’ Ryan, who was diagnosed at St Michael’s Hospital, Bristol, was delivered by emergency caesarean section on Christmas Day 2011. Ms Williams, a former supermarket cash office assistant, said: ‘I had a lot of scenarios in my head. There was the worry that once he was born he wouldn’t be able to breathe by himself. Ms Williams said: 'He walked for the first time just a couple of days ago. I cried when I saw it. Of all the things that doctors said Ryan would never be able to do, I was sure they were right about walking' Ryan's mother, Natasha Williams, decided to give him a chance and he has now defied doctors to learn to smile, sit up, walk and communicate . ‘I was incredibly relieved to hear him cry for the first time.’ Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is an inherited disorder of bone growth that causes dwarfism. People with the condition have very short arms and legs and a narrow chest. They usually also have extra fingers and toes. More than half of babies with the condition are born with a heart defect - this can be life-threatening. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome occurs in one in 60,000 to 200,000 newborns.

He smiled and sat up for the first time in hospital and no longer requires constant ventilation. This week he amazed his mother by walking for the first time.

The unique strain of potato blight which triggered the Irish potato famine in the mid-19th century has been identified by scientists. The plant pathogen dubbed HERB-1 has been identified from potato samples collected in 1847 at the height of the famine. The specimen, held at Kew Gardens, allowed scientists to decode the genome of a plant pathogen and its plant host from dried plant samples. The unique strain of potato blight which triggered the Irish potato famine in the mid-19th century has been identified by scientists and named HERB-1 . Molecular biologists from Europe and the U.S. reconstructed the spread of the potato blight pathogen from dried plants which, although 120 to 170-years-old, had many intact pieces of DNA. The researchers found that the strain of blight originated in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire and evolved until it caused the massive crop failure in Ireland three hundred years later. It has since died out after new disease resistant potato crops began to be planted at the turn of the last century. Dr Kentaro Yoshida from The Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich said: ‘Preserved plant samples represent a rich and untapped source from which we can learn a tremendous amount about the historical distribution of plants and their pests - and also about the history of the people who grew these plants. The researchers examined the historical spread of the fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora infestans, known as the Irish potato famine pathogen. A strain called US-1 was long thought to have been the cause of the fatal outbreak but the researchers concluded a strain new to science was actually responsible. A strain called US-1 was long thought to have been the cause of the fatal outbreak but the plant pathogen dubbed HERB-1 has now been identified from potato samples collected in 1847 at the height of the famine . While more closely related to the US-1 strain than to other modern strains, HERB-1 is unique. Hernan Burbano, from the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Germany, said: ‘We have finally discovered the identity of the exact strain that caused all this havoc. ‘Both strains seem to have separated from each other only years before the first major outbreak in Europe.’ The researchers compared the historic samples with modern strains from Europe, Africa and the Americas as well as two closely related Phytophthora species. The scientists were able to estimate with confidence when the various Phytophthora strains diverged from each other during evolutionary time. The strain of blight originated in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire and evolved until it caused the massive crop failure in Ireland three hundred years later . The HERB-1 strain of Phytophthora infestans likely emerged in the early 1800s and continued its global conquest throughout the 19th century. Only in the 20th century, after new potato varieties were introduced, was HERB-1 replaced by another Phytophthora infestans strain, US-1. The scientists found several connections with historic events. The first contact between Europeans and Americans in Mexico in the sixteenth century coincides with a remarkable increase in the genetic diversity of Phytophthora. The social upheaval during that time may have led to a spread of the pathogen from its centre of origin in Toluca Valley, Mexico. This in turn would have accelerated its evolution. The potato blight specimen, held at Kew Gardens (pictured), allowed scientists to decode the genome of a plant pathogen and its plant host from dried plant samples . The international team came to these conclusions after deciphering the entire genomes of 11 historical samples of Phytophthora infestans from potato leaves collected over more than 50 years. Because of the remarkable DNA quality and quantity in the samples, the research team could evaluate the entire genome of Phytophthora infestans and its host, the potato, within just a few weeks. Dr Yoshida said: ‘Perhaps this strain became extinct when the first resistant potato varieties were bred at the beginning of the twentieth century. ‘What is for certain is that these findings will greatly help us to understand the dynamics of emerging pathogens. This type of work paves the way for the discovery of many more treasures of knowledge hidden in preserved plant samples.’","A strain called US-1 was long thought to have been the cause .

Britain's GPs are the best paid in the Western world, while their nursing colleagues are way down the pay league, a report reveals today. Self-employed family doctors pick up salaries of about £103,000 – 3.4 times the size of average earnings and the highest ratio among member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Their pay has soared at one of the highest rates across the OECD, thanks to Labour's botched 2004 contract. A report has revealed Britain's GPs are the best paid in the Western world picking up salaries of about £103,000 . But the report tells a different story for nurses, with Britain one of only three states that pays them less than the average wage. The typical nurse earns just 90 per cent the value of the average salary – a level that is worse only in Slovakia and Hungary. The Royal College of Nursing said the disclosure was another 'demoralising blow' for nurses, while the British Medical Association remained defiant, saying British GPs provide the 'widest range' of care in the world. The average salary of a GP is a third higher than before Labour's lucrative deal, which brought an end to out-of-hours work for many. The findings on health workers' pay are contained in a 200-page report by the OECD entitled Health at a Glance 2013. It said: 'As expected for highly-skilled professionals, the remuneration of doctors (both generalists and specialists) is much higher than that of the average worker in all OECD countries. (File picture) The average UK salary is around £31,000, but nurses take home 0.9 of the value of the national wage . 'The income of self-employed  GPs in the UK rose strongly following the implementation of a  new contract for generalists in  2004 that was designed to increase their income as well as quality of primary care.' Britain is one of the few countries where GPs do better than specialists. Consultants and hospital doctors, for example, earn 2.7 times the average salary of £31,413. 'In all countries except Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom, GPs earn less than the average  for medical specialists,' the  report added. The report also showed that, despite the high salaries they  earn, British doctors rank lowly  in terms of consultations per head of population. The average person in the UK sees a doctor around five times a year – less than the OECD average of eight. In nursing, of the 24 countries surveyed by the OECD Britain's nurses were ranked 22nd in a league table of pay compared to average wages. The average UK salary is around £31,000, but nurses take home 0.9 of the value of the national wage, ahead of only Slovakia and Hungary on 0.8. Luxembourg and Israel rank highest at 1.4 times the annual salary. Dr Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'This will come as yet another demoralising blow to nursing staff in the UK, who are already dealing with the prospect of yet more pay freezes. 'With pressure on the frontline more intense than ever, nurses continue to go the extra mile to keep vital services going. 'Surely it is common sense that properly valuing frontline staff is better for the staff, better for the health service, and better for patient care.' A spokesman for the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said GPs provided the widest range of care in the developed world. 'There is a much greater emphasis on prevention than elsewhere and general practice is also extremely cost-effective,' he said. 'All this benefits our patients as well as the taxpayer, as it's much cheaper to stop people becoming seriously ill in the first place. Many countries are looking at our model of primary health care because they recognise it works well.' A spokesman for the Department of Health accepted the figures, but did not believe that nurses' wages were below average earnings. 'Average GP pay levels have fallen steadily since 2006,' she added.","Self-employed family doctors pick up salaries of about £103,000 .

Saved her marriage: Fiona Potter and her husband almost broke up over her lack of interest in sex . A mother-of-two has finally achieved a 'mind-blowing' orgasm with her husband of 13 years after years of rejecting him. Fiona Potter, 34, from Mundon, Essex, had such a low sex drive it almost cost her her marriage, until the couple sought help from a sex therapist. Fiona admitted she would have been content to only have sex with husband, Adam, three times a year, explaining: 'It feels like a domestic duty, and that's why I don't want to do it because it feels like a chore.' The carer, who works nights, has a 15-year-old son called Luke from a previous relationship and a five-year-old daughter, Grace, with Adam. She explained her low sex drive was because she 'can't be bothered'. She said: 'I would rather . go to sleep because I'm always tired and working.' She added: 'I do love Adam, I just don't know how to show him.' Mechanic Adam revealed the situation became so bad he considered a separation. He said: 'Sometimes she'll say ""not tonight"" but most . of the time she'll lay there frozen solid and blank me out totally. 'It . got to the point where I had enough and I told her I was going to leave. I . was sick of the constant rejection. For me to not want to see Grace . every day shows how far I have been pushed.' The couple share their story in a new documentary on More 4 called The Week The Women Came, which reveals that one in three women have sexual difficulties that rob them of ability to orgasm. It's something sex therapist Trudy Hannington is all too familiar with as she regularly treats people with sex and relationship problems at her clinic in Yorkshire. Fiona talking to sex therapist Trudy Hannington about her low sex drive . She said: 'Sex is almost seen like a luxury, so . if something goes wrong it's the last thing that gets fixed and people . find it quite difficult to ask for help. 'It's almost like it's not . important enough. But from what I see, when sex goes wrong it's . devastating. It damages a woman's confidence and sex esteem, which has a . knock on effect on the rest of their life.' Trudy agrees to help Fiona and Adam ignite their sex life, and found some of their problems could be traced back to Fiona's childhood and turbulent teenage years. Fiona told how her parents split up when she was 11 and she rarely saw her father after he remarried and started a new family. She was raised as a Christian by her mother and taught that sex before marriage was wrong. As a result she 'rebelled', and at the age of 16 became pregnant. She explained: 'It was my way of saying ""up yours, it's legal, I can do what I want.""' Trudy agrees to help Fiona, pictured, and Adam reignite their sex life, and found some of their problems could be traced back to Fiona's childhood and turbulent teenage years . She had a miscarriage but then fell pregnant another two times, suffering another miscarriage and having an abortion, before having son, Luke, at the age of 18. Trudy said Fiona's early experiences of sex didn't show her how fun it could be but that it always came with serious consequences. Fiona then had another boyfriend who she said once forced himself upon her when she didn't feel like sex, and that left her emotionally damaged. She said: 'He kept persisting so in the end I just . had sex with him to get him off me. After that I used sex . as a means of control. I think might be why I have problems now.' But Fiona was keen to learn how to drop her defences and issues from previous relationships in order to save her marriage. Trudy advised the couple to be more affectionate with one another and regularly pay one another compliments. Fiona admitted she would previously avoided any intimacy with her husband - even a cuddle - for fear it would make him think it would lead to sex . Fiona admitted she would previously avoided any intimacy with her husband - even a cuddle - for fear it would make him think it would lead to sex. Trudy imposed a sex ban on the pair so they could learn to be affectionate without Fiona worrying that she would then be obliged to take it further. She also encouraged them to make more time for one another by having regular date nights and recommended Fiona read erotic fiction to get her in the mood more often. Trudy revealed that one in three women have sexual difficulties that rob them of ability to orgasm . After following Trudy's advice, the couple had a break through. They admitted the imposed sex ban increased their desire for one another and they then finally had sex they both enjoyed. Fiona said: 'The first time we had mind-blowing sex it was a turning point. We realised we had neglected one another for quite some time. We had sex like we've never had it before and sat there for ages afterwards saying ""blimey that was good"".'

It is a bitter pill to swallow for all of us who enjoy too many fizzy drinks, chocolate and sweets. Our teeth would be more likely to last the rest of our lives if the world's recommended sugar intake, already only slightly more than one can of Coke, halved to fewer than seven teaspoons a day. Researchers from Newcastle University found people who gained less than five per cent of their energy from 'free sugars', added artifically to foods and found naturally in juice, honey and syrup, were more likely to end their lives without cavities. Sweet tooth: Researchers said treats once saved for Christmas are being eaten every day, with harmful results . Professor of nutrition and oral health Paula Moynihan said people are eating sugary foods which used to be a birthday or Christmas treat on a daily basis, the Daily Telegraph reported. She added: 'People now expect to keep their teeth into old age and, given that the effects of sugars on our teeth are lifelong, limiting sugars to less than five per cent of the calories we eat would minimise the risk of dental cavities throughout life. 'We need to make it easier for people to make healthier choices when it comes to sugars by ensuring that options lower in added sugars are made widely available in schools, shops and the workplace.' The findings in the Journal of Dental . Research examined 55 previous studies on the causes of tooth decay, all . but eight of which showed a link between sugar intake and cavities over . a person's lifespan. A .

Sugar: Just one can of Coca Cola would exceed the recommended daily intake of sugar if it was halved . If the new limit was introduced, just one 330ml can of Coca Cola would exceed the limit, with 8.75 teaspoons (35g) of sugar in the UK. The sweet-toothed among us could just about manage a can of Sprite (5.5 teaspoons) or a bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate (6.4 teaspoons) before reaching the limit. The data was sourced from trials in countries as far afield as Latin America, the Caribbean, China and South Africa. However, the research warned that differences between the data quality in the studies meant the results could be unreliable.

Two players from the opposing team who are both first aid trained tried to revive Mr Connor using a defribrillator but he died later in hospital. Tragedy: Stephen Connor died aged just weeks after marrying long-term girlfriend Nicola. The 30-year-old collapsed while playing in a Sunday league football match . The tragedy occurred just ten weeks after Mr Connor, an NVQ assessor, married his long-term girlfriend Nicola Blaxall, 26, near their home in Chorley, Lancashire. The couple, who met seven years ago at Bangor University, had also just recently returned from a dream honeymoon in Las Vegas, San Francisco and Los Angeles and were planning to start a family. Mrs Connor said: 'We still don’t know what happened. Stephen was fit and healthy and played football regularly. There was nothing to indicate that something like this could happen. 'On the Sunday he left for the football and just said ""see you later"". That was the last thing he said to me. I was just going out shopping. 'It is such a shock and, to be honest, his death hasn’t sunk in yet. We were only getting married 10 weeks ago and it was the happiest day of our lives. The we had a lovely honeymoon and now this has happened. 'All I can say is that I am thankful for seven and a half wonderful years with Stephen. 'He was such a wonderful easy going person and he would do anything for anyone. He was one of the loveliest people you could ever hope to meet. 'Sports mad': Mr Connor complained of feeling dizzy on the pitch before he was taken ill with a suspected heart attack. Two players from the opposing team tried to revive him using a defribrillator . She added: 'Everyone knew him through . his love of football. He was a mad Burnley FC fan and was so happy to . see them top of the Championship. We’re going to have a Claret and Blue . funeral, in honour of the Burnley colours.' The tragedy ocurred on Sunday while Mr Connor, 30, nicknamed 'Dingle' was playing in midfield for Plough FC in the Chorley Nissan Sunday League. Thirty minutes into the game, he complained of feeling unwell then collapsed on the pitch. The North West air ambulance arrived at the scene at 11.05am while two members of the opposition team carried out first aid. The helicopter landed on the pitch at around 11.20am, airlifting Mr Connor to Royal Preston Hospital. However, efforts to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead. Mr Connor was airlifted to Royal Preston Hospital, but efforts to revive him were unsuccessful . Sam Bolton, one of the Halfway House FC players who tried to revive Mr Connor said: 'He collapsed on the pitch and we rushed to him and provided CPR. It was a mammoth effort from everybody. I’ve known Stephen for a long time. It’s a terrible situation and I’m feeling it badly.' Derek Heighway, league secretary, said: 'Everyone is in shock. He’d played Sunday League for a long time and was well known. He was a lovely lad.” Mr Connor joined the club as a junior and later helping to coach the youth teams. He had played eight times this season for Plough FC, scoring two goals and being awarded Man of the Match for the game against Springfield FC on October 20. John Cowley, club chairman, said: 'I can say, with absolute honesty, that he was probably the nicest lad I have ever been privileged to coach and work with. His personality was one of a very warm, open, sincere lad.' Mr Connor's brother Andrew said: 'There . is a massive, gaping hole left by his absence. He has played thousands . and thousands of hours on the pitch of different sports and nothing has . happened before.” Sister Tricia said: 'He was kind-hearted and was always there when we needed him.' He also leaves his parents, Tricia and Jim Connor, brother Andrew, seven nieces and nephews, and eight godchildren. A postmortem examination will be held this week.","'Sports mad' Stephen Connor complained of feeling dizzy on the pitch before he was taken ill with a suspected heart attack .

An unarmed man had just got engaged and was working two jobs when he was shot dead by police at an upscale North Carolina community that has four tennis courts, two swimming pools and a clubhouse. After crashing his car, Jonathon Ferrell climbed out the back window and made his way to Bradfield Farm, where he knocked on a door of a woman who then called police. When they arrived, one officer fired multiple shots at the 24-year-old college football player, killing him. On Sunday, his friends and family described Ferrell, who had no criminal record, as a 'good guy' and strong athlete who wasn't aggressive. Ferrell recently became engaged and moved to Charlotte just months ago where he was working two jobs - at Dillard's and Best Buy. Scroll down for video . Charged: Officer Randall Kerrick has been charged with voluntary manslaughter after shooting ex-FAMU football player Jonathan Ferrell, 24 . 'He wasn't really the aggressive . type,' former teammate Gregory Boler said of Ferrell, who grew up in . Tallahassee. 'He was a good guy, easy to talk to. ... He just liked to . be around his friends.' He added that e was surprised to hear his pal may have been in a confrontation with police. 'It just didn't sound like him,' Boler told the Charlotte Observer. 'He's not that type at all.' After . climbing from the wreck of his car, Ferrell walked at least half a mile . to the nearest home, which happened to be in the community of white two-story homes 17 miles east of Charlotte. New and resale houses are available in the $110,000 - $230,000 range in the 1000-home community. Possibly traumatized, the ex- . Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) football player . had walked to the home of an unidentified woman after the crash on . Saturday morning, and knocked on her door. But when she did not recognize him, she slammed the door and called 911- before officer Randall Kerrick shot him dead as he reportedly ran towards him. Kerrick has been charged with voluntary manslaughter. The homeowner initially opened the . door thinking it was her husband, but then closed it and called 911 when . she didn't recognize Mr Ferrell, according to reports. Officers found the unarmed man, and one shot him when a Taser failed to stop him from approaching. Upscale community: After crashing his car, Jonathon Ferrell climbed out the back window and made his way to Bradfield Farm, pictured . Within hours, investigators determined that the shooting had been excessive and charged the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer with voluntary manslaughter. Autopsy details have revealed that Ferrell died of 'multiple gunshot wounds' to his chest. A police statement Saturday said the investigation showed the shooting was excessive and 'Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter. 'In describing the accident, Police Chief Rodney Monroe has said Ferrell was driving a vehicle that crashed into trees off a northeast Charlotte road early Saturday, and the wreck was so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape. Monroe said he did not know what caused the crash and did not say whether Ferrell suffered injuries. Ferrell apparently walked about a half-mile to the nearest house and was 'banging on the door viciously' to attract attention, Monroe said. Thinking it was her husband coming home late from work, the woman who lives there opened the door. When she saw Ferrell, she shut it and called police about 2:30 a.m., Monroe said. Monroe said he didn't think the unarmed Ferrell made threats or tried to rob the woman. On Monday, Chestnut applauded police for charging Kerrick quickly. 'To shoot first and ask questions later is not an appropriate action for a police officer,' Chestnut said. Kerrick was scheduled to appear in court Monday to face a voluntary manslaughter charge. Thinking of what might have been: Georgia Ferrell, smiles as she holds a stuffed bear and talks of how she had promised to give the bear to her son, Jonathan Ferrell's first born child during a media conference .

During a news conference on Monday in Charlotte, Ferrell's mother said she was praying for Kerrick. 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. 'You took a piece of my heart that I can never get back.' 'I wanted grandchildren,' his emotional mother said. 'He promised me grandchildren years ago, but I guess that's out.' She described her son as a 'very uplifting, happy person' who 'wouldn't hurt anyone' and had a tendency for taking in stray animals. 'I had to teach Jonathan that worms were not our friends because Mama is scared of them,' Georgia Ferrell said with a smile. 'He was one of the most magnificent individuals I ever came in contact with,' Jonathan Ferrell's brother Willie said. 'Jonathan was never the type of person to harm nobody.' Chestnut praised the police chief for acting quickly with arresting and charging Kerrick. 'We applaud the chief for acting swiftly. That was a bold move. It is unprecedented for a chief to move so quickly in not only suspending an officer, but arresting him,' Chestnut said. 'You take away the badge from this officer. This was murder. This was manslaughter.' Brotherly love: Jonathan Ferrell's brother Willie said. 'Jonathan was never the type of person to harm nobody' Ferrell knocked on this door looking for help after being in a car crash, but the homeowner called 911 . Jonathan Ferrell, 24, had played for FAMU in 2009 and 2010, and had only recently moved to North Carolina . Ferrell played for FAMU in 2009 and . 2010. Friends said Ferrell and his young brother Willie were especially . close and the pair played on their high school and college football . teams together. The brothers were just 16 months apart and their father died when they were young. 'Don't know how much I miss u,' Willie Ferrell wrote to his older brother on Sunday. 'I never cried so much.' In . a 2010 story written about the brothers in the FAMU student newspaper, . Ferrell talked about how much he enjoyed playing football with his . brother. 'Playing football . with him again feels like it did in high school, summer nights you don’t . want to end because they are so much fun,' he said. 'It's refreshing to . come in the locker room and have your best friend to laugh with.' FAMU . Interim Athletic Director Michael Smith said Ferrell played the safety . position for the school's football team during the 2009 and 2010 . seasons. 'Our hearts and prayers go out to his family during their time of bereavement,' Smith said. Ferrell's high school coach, Ira Reynolds, told the Tallahassee Democrat the young man's death was a tragedy. 'To lose him that way is incredibly difficult to deal with for anyone,' Reynolds said. 'He practiced hard and played hard. He didn't talk very much, but when he said something, it spoke volumes.' A search of public records indicated that Ferrell began living in Charlotte early this year after moving from Tallahassee, Florida, home to FAMU. Police initially called Ferrell and Kerrick's encounter 'appropriate and lawful.' But in their statement late Saturday, they said 'the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr Ferrell was excessive' and 'Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.' Police said Kerrick was charged with voluntary manslaughter, which under North Carolina law involves killing without malice using 'excessive force' in exercising 'imperfect self-defense.' Kerrick, 27, of Midland, turned himself in for booking Saturday evening and was released on $50,000 bond, according to the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office website. Kerrick, who joined the police force in April 2011, is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.

"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 15:41 EST, 21 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:36 EST, 22 May 2013 . Teenagers are turning away from Facebook because of oversharing friends and concerns over their parents knowing what they are up to. A major new study found they are turning to Twitter and services like Snapchat in increasing numbers - where they are sharing more personal information about themselves than ever before. Researchers found a big increase in the number of 'selfies' being posted, along with information about their school, city and even their mobile phone number. The research also looked at what teens were posting online - and found photos of themselves and other personal information was the most popular . Teens told researchers there were too . many adults on Facebook and too much sharing of teenage angst and inane . details like what a friend ate for dinner. 'The key is that there are fewer adults, fewer parents and just simply less complexity and less drama,' said Amanda Lenhart of the Pew Research Center, one of the study's authors. 'They still have their Facebook profiles, but they spend less time on them and move to places like Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr.' In the latest poll, 94per cent of teens who are social media users have a profile on Facebook — flat from the previous year. Focus group discussions with teens show . that they have waning enthusiasm for Facebook, the researchers said, but . they keep using it because participation is an important part of overall . teenage socializing. The concerns come amid growing fears in . the city that 'Facebook fatigue' is setting in among users, and recent . figures show that 40 per cent of young Facebook users in the U.S. say . that they expect to use the site less this year than they have in the . past. 'One of the most frequent conversations I have with investors is about whether the younger demographic is disengaging from Facebook,' says Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets, recently told the FT. 'They believe that it is happening.' Focus groups carried out as part of the research found why teens are leaving Facebook. Here is what they said: . Female (age 19): 'Yeah, that's why we go on Twitter and Instagram [instead of Facebook]. My mom doesn't have that.' Female (age 15): 'If you are on Facebook, you see a lot of drama.' Female (age 14): 'OK, here's something I want to say. I think Facebook can be fun, but also it's drama central. On Facebook, people imply things and say things, even just by a like, that they wouldn't say in real life.' Male (age 18): 'It’s because [Facebook] it's where people post unnecessary pictures and they say unnecessary things, like saying he has a girlfriend, and a girl will go on and tag him in the picture like, me and him in the sun having fun. Why would you do that?' Female (age 15): 'I have two [Facebook] accounts. One for my family, one for my friends.' Female (age 16): 'And so now I am basically dividing things up. Instagram is mostly for pictures. Twitter is mostly for just saying what you are thinking. Facebook is both of them combined so you have to give a little bit of each. But yes, so Instagram, I posted more pictures on Instagram than on Facebook. Twitter is more natural.' Female (age 15): 'I have a Facebook, a Tumblr, and Twitter. I don’t use Facebook or Twitter much. I rather use Tumblr to look for interesting stories. I like Tumblr because I don’t have to present a specific or false image of myself and I don’t have to interact with people I don’t necessarily want to talk to.' 60% of teen Facebook users keep their profiles private, and most report . high levels of confidence in their ability to manage their settings. The typical teen Facebook user has 300 friends, while the typical teen Twitter user has 79 followers. The Pew report found twenty-six per cent of teen social media users were on Twitter. That's more than double the figure in 2011 of 12per cent. Socially needier: A new poll finds that teens are moving increasingly to Twitter to avoid their parents and the 'oversharing' that they see on Facebook . In what is likely a concern to parents, more than 60 per cent of the teens with Twitter accounts said their tweets were public, meaning anyone on Twitter — friend, foe or stranger — can see what they write and publish. About one-quarter of kids said their tweets were private and 12per cent said they did not know whether their tweets were public or private. 'Teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they did in the past,' the researchers warned. 'Twitter holds a different kind of attraction as an alternative or supplement to Facebook,' the researchers say. Additionally, focus group participants saw the 140-character limit as preventing the type of excesses found on Facebook. Male (age 18): 'Facebook doesn't have a limit to characters on it. So in Twitter, there's only so much you can say. On Facebook, they say so many details of things that you don't want to know. You'd be like, are you serious? No one really cares that much.' Male (age 16): 'A lot of friends convinced me to make a Twitter. Because everyone's saying Facebook's dead.' Female (age 15): 'I mean, I could just tweet forever. There's no limit on my tweets. Cause on Twitter like I express myself more, but at the same time, and like I said, I just do my thing.' Female (age 13): 'Like, sometimes you just like express your feelings [on Twitter]. Like you feel like yourself.' Female (age 15): 'I'm on Twitter more often, and it's easier. I mean Facebook is easy since I know how to do it, but Twitter is I think more addictive.' Female (age 13): 'On Twitter you like, get to say whatever you want, and you tweet it. But there's like a limit to what you tweet and everything. But whatever you tweet it's like random things of what's on your mind. And like she said, like, you could express yourself. No one judges you.' 'For the five different types of personal information that we measured in both 2006 and 2012, each is significantly more likely to be shared by teen social media users in our most recent survey.' However the researchers also found teens were aware of the security settings of the services they use. 'Teens take other steps to shape their reputation, manage their networks, and mask information they don’t want others to know; 74% of teen social media users have deleted people from their network or friends list,' they say. More than 90 per cent of teen social media users said they have posted a picture of themselves — up from 79per cent in 2006. The researchers plotters the use of twitter among adults and children, and found both had increased since 2006 . Seven in ten disclose the city or town where they live, up from about 60per cent over the same time period. And 20per cent disclose their mobile phone number — up sharply from a mere two per cent in 2006. The researchers surveyed 802 parents and their 802 teens. The poll was conducted between July 26 and September 30, 2012, on landline and cell phones. 'A popular new application brought up repeatedly in the focus groups is Snapchat, an image-messaging app where sent pictures and videos are displayed for only several seconds and then are deleted,' the researchers said. 'The primary attraction of Snapchat is its central feature, the limited time a recipient sees a picture or video. Focus group participants reported using this feature to send silly or embarrassing pictures.'Female (age 13): 'And [Snapchat] it’s really fast like if you sent it over a text it takes like two minutes to load.' Female (age 16): 'Yeah, [Snapchat] it's faster. And you can use Snapchat at school with the school's website - because I have the basic phone, I use my iPod.” Female (age 13): '[Snapchat] It's really great. I have to admit, it's better because I could pick the most embarrassing photo, and know that they'll [the recipient will] see it for 10 seconds, and then I'm done.' Female (age 17): 'And it's just kind of fun. Because it's like texting, but you get to use your face as the emoticon instead of an actual emoticon.' Female (age 16): 'Well, because Facebook, everyone sees what I'm doing. But Snapchat is just to one person, unless they're a jerk and they screenshot it and post it on Facebook. But mostly it's just the person that you're sending it to, so it's like a conversation.'","Researchers found the number of Facebook accounts among teens has not risen in last year - but the number with Twitter accounts has doubled .

If you think you give your workout gear a run for its money with punishing sessions of Bikram and British Military Fitness, spare a thought for the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, the stars of Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the second in the trilogy, released later this month. They're not just sweating in yoga studios and doing press-ups in the mud, they're throwing swords, shooting arrows and generally trying to stay alive in the most inhospitable environment ever. When the film's costume designer, Trish Summerville was trying to find the right sort of clothes for the tributes to wear in the arena, she googled 'futuristic sportswear'. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson adorn Lucas Hugh designs on set . Extreme pressure: Jennifer Lawrence's character Katniss gets ready for battle . Perfect fit: Josh Hutcherson, who plays Peeta Mellark, gears up for his role . What popped up was high-end sportswear brand, Lucas Hugh, the brainchild of Anjhe Mules, who had spent 15 years designing swimwear - for her own label, as well as with Speedo, Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen. 'Everything we do is about the future,' explains Anjhe, who developed the line after feeling that there was a gap in the market for designer-style sportswear that was attractive, functional and wearable outside of the gym. But the hostile setting of the arena is quite different from the yoga studios of West London, how could Anjhe be sure that her designs would stand up to the rigours of the Hunger Games? 'Everything we design is created for extremes of movement, so that you can do anything and your top won't ride up, or twist. Futuristic style: Hunger Games characters Katniss and Cinna share a moment before the games begin . The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is set for release on 21 November . Newcomer: Sam Clafin also sports designs by designer Anjhe Mules . 'All our seams are glued so that they . don't rub, and the fabrics have compression technology to support your . muscles, and are antibacterial and designed to wick away moisture,' says . Anjhe. 'All the pieces in my collection are . tested by professional sportspeople - I know a lot of personal trainers . so kit really gets put through its paces to make sure it really is fit . for everything from running and weight-lifting to pilates.' While many of the outfits - such as the Prince Albert jacket (£320) and the Dial capri pants (£165) which you'll see Katniss wearing while training for the Quarter Quell - translated directly from the main collection to the film set, one aspect that was slightly more challenging was menswear. 'I'd never designed menswear before and initially I thought I knew exactly what I wanted but at the first fitting it became clear that certain things just didn't work,' says Anjhe. Extension of the collection: Jennifer Lawrence adorns a similar style 'Prince Albert' jacket which can be currently brought online at lucashugh.com . 'There were - um - certain bits that needed to be concealed,' she laughs. While all the womenswear looks that are showcased in the film are available to buy at LucasHugh.com, any men who fancy emulating Peeta will have to wait a while. 'Designing menswear for the film has inspired me to create a menswear line alongside the existing womenswear collection, but that won't launch until next Autumn,' reveals Anjhe. And, it seems that Jennifer Lawrence was so taken with the Lucas Hugh kit, that when the cameras stopped rolling, she didn't want to take it off. 'I'm good friends with Jennifer's personal trainer and I have it on good authority that she still wears it and loves it,' beams Anjhe.","Film's costume designer teamed up with futuristic sportswear brand .

Murat Can Ertani, 22, said he has no regrets over running away with British schoolgirl Faye Jones . The Turkish waiter who ran away with British schoolgirl Faye Jones has boasted that he already has a new British girlfriend and said he has no regrets over the 16-year-old's disappearance. Murat Can Ertani, 22, and Faye were found on Monday after four days on the run from the Turkish resort of Marmaris, where the teenager was holidaying with her mother Rhonda. Ertani, who has been to prison six times, said English girls were 'easy' and claimed he would run away with Faye or another English girl, as long as they were over 18 - the Turkish age of consent. He told the Daily Mirror that he had already moved on from Faye with another British girl who had seen him in the news. 'I am in love with the girl next to me,' he said. 'When she leaves there is always another one. Girls love a bad boy and that is me. Girls get boring and I cannot stay with just one for more than a few weeks.' Ertani was arrested when the pair were found trying to hitchhike in Mugla, 35 miles from Marmaris, but released the next day after Faye refused to press charges against him. She told Turkish police officers: 'He shouldn't go to jail. He did nothing wrong. It was my fault for running away.' The convicted burglar, who had been chatting to Faye for a year through Facebook before they met, called their disappearance 'an adventure' in his 'boring' life and ungallantly said the 16-year-old was 'not so pretty really'. He claimed that she told him she was 19 but found out she was underage by reading a newspaper. He denied they had had sex, saying the situation was too stressful. Ertani told the newspaper that Faye was angry at her mother for making her go back home to Cramlington, Northumberland, instead of staying on in Marmaris with her grandmother as planned. Rhonda had seen Ertani slapping Faye's friend Georgina White, 15, during a night out. He claimed she had called him a 'dirty Turk' while Georgina said he had tried to strangle Faye and called her a 'slag' for dancing with other boys. 'I told her to ring her mum. Let her know she is ok,' he told the Mirror. 'She didn't want to. She wasn't bothered her mum was upset. [...] She was strong. She was very calm. She wasn't crying or anything. I was more worried than she was. Ertani was released on Tuesday after 16-year-old Faye Jones refused to press kidnap charges against him . Faye Jones was reunited with her mother Rhonda on Monday after four days missing . 'She told me she had £400 and her iPhone in a safe at her nan's house. She told me because I used to rob houses, which room the safe was in but there were too many police around.' Ertani said he enjoyed his time behind bars and had served one term for stabbing a man who 'looked at me funny'. He said he was a 'regular customer' at Mugla prison and had fun there, though he missed girls and drinking. Ertani, who has the name 'Hannah' tattooed on his arm from a drunken night out, even posed for a photograph holding up a newspaper story about Faye's disappearance. While the pair were missing it emerged that Miss Jones was not the first British schoolgirl Ertani has allegedly seduced. Faye Jones was reunited with her mother on Monday in Mugla but told police that she ran away of her own free will . Alanah Longshaw claims he groomed her via Facebook, told her . he loved her and persuaded her to leave her mother and move in with him . in Turkey three years ago. Miss Longshaw was 16 when she decided to give up her life in Scotland to go and live . with him and his family in the village of Adana just outside Marmaris in . January 2011. But after she . fell pregnant with his child - Aydin, now 18 months - Ertani told . her 'I hope you and the baby die in labour'. But in his interview he said he would like to see Aydin and promised he would not harm his son. Speaking . from her home in Scotland, Miss Longshaw said: 'We lived in an empty apartment . block with no electricity. Can would lock me in at night and often come . back drunk in the early hours of the morning. Ertani told a newspaper that Faye was angry at her mother for making her return home to Britain instead of staying on in Marmaris with her grandmother . Ertani has served six prison sentences - including one for stabbing a man who looked at him 'funny' 'If I dared to ask where he'd been he would often lose his temper and slap and punch me. 'I stayed because I believed I was in love with him - even in those dire conditions. I finally wised up and came home. 'I haven't seen him since and he's never seen his son and I doubt he ever will. 'The . last message I had from him was to say he'd washed his hands of our . baby and wanted nothing to do with him as he had a s*** for a mother,' she added.","Murat Can Ertani, 22, was found in Mugla with Faye Jones, 16 on Monday .

Leaving Mum in hospital at the end of visiting hours was like being wrenched from a terrified child. This warm, capable, intelligent woman - a former domestic science teacher - had borne years of living with terminal cancer with stoicism and dignity. But two dreadful weeks on a hectic hospital ward had reduced her to a confused and anguished wreck. Even now, it's almost unbearable to recall my mother gasping inconsolably down the phone: 'You have to come, you have to come.' Or her pinched, pleading looks each time my hospital visits came to an end. If those had been my last memories of Mum, I don't know how I would have coped. So many people do die like this - but our family was lucky, because Mum was able to move into a Sue Ryder hospice. Memories: Audrey with daughter Philippa on her wedding day, they had time to reminisce in her final days . Our lovely mum, Audrey Cole, passed away aged 77 more than a year ago, and the loss is still raw. But when dark moments of grief threaten to take hold, I remind myself how the last two weeks of her life, thanks to the hospice, were among the happiest times we'd ever shared together. It sounds bizarre, I know. But free from anguish, no longer distracted by pain, and cocooned in a place where she felt safe and secure, Mum was extraordinarily content - even though her life was ebbing away. It meant we could make every last moment together really count. I remember sitting in her cosy hospice room one warm afternoon, sunlight streaming through the open window, as, together with my older sister Lindsey, we pored over old family photos. How we rocked with laughter at the sight of Dad sporting some ridiculously baggy striped shorts on a holiday to France in the Fifties. And could that be Lindsey and me, aged four and seven, trussed up in matching purple dungarees? Mum was extraordinarily content - even . though her life was ebbing away. It meant we could make every last . moment together really count . Mum wasn't afraid of dying. She'd been facing her mortality since the breast cancer she'd been diagnosed with in 1991, when she was 56, had returned ten years later with a vengeance. Her original cancer in her right breast had been treated with a lumpectomy - but now she had secondary cancer through both breasts and in her chest. Despite a double mastectomy and chemotherapy, the cancer was too hard to control and within a matter of months of that diagnosis in 2001, Mum was given four to 18 months to live. We were left reeling - we were such a close family, how would we cope with losing Mum? But she never complained and accepted the prognosis with great courage, only to confound such predictions by living for another 11 years. Missed: Philippa and her sister with their parents on their golden wedding anniversary . In a speech at my parents' golden wedding party in 2009, I jokingly castigated Mum for the fact that both my sister and I had rushed to get married when she had first been diagnosed - and, three grandchildren later, she still was here. During ever-shortening periods of remission - sometimes as short as 18 months - she and my dad, Brian, a retired bank manager who is now 78, would seize life by the throat, taking trips to China and New England. She was treated like an individual by nurses who were enduringly friendly and patient . Mum had no intention of going quietly. She was indomitable. When, in a cruel twist of fate, Dad was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's six years ago, she insisted she would look after him at home - which she did. But in April last year, as the cancer pushed relentlessly inwards towards Mum's ribs and lungs, she had to give up caring for Dad and he was moved into respite care. Meanwhile, her doctors admitted that any further surgery would be risky and futile. Even then she didn't weep or sink into despair, insisting we all carry on as normal. Then, at the beginning of September, Mum was rushed to hospital with severe breathlessness. The cancer was causing her lungs to fill with fluid, and though doctors managed to drain this away, within a day or so her lungs had filled up again. Again they were drained, only to refill. The cycle repeated itself two or three times, over several days, until one evening, after my sister and I had left the hospital, Mum’s doctors told her there was no point in repeating the procedure as her lungs were simply going to fill up again. They were telling her there was nothing more they could do, yet they delivered the words without any compassion or empathy. Invaluable support: Philippa will always be grateful to Sue Ryder staff . I hate to think of her hearing those chilling words alone. She was given an oxygen tank to relieve the breathing difficulty, and that was that. The end of the road. Frightened and isolated, she immediately called me, sobbing so bitterly I couldn't understand a word she was saying. I raced back to the hospital only to find Mum - my quiet, strong, stoic and determined mother - crying and shaking like a terrified child. A nurse had given her a sedative and tried to explain to me what little she knew. It was three hours before a doctor came to explain Mum's medical situation, but in terms of morale and anxiety, the damage had been done - for all of us. Over the course of the next two weeks, Mum's situation at the hospital just seemed to go from bad to worse. Lindsey and I visited every day, but we seemed to spend most of our time trying to track down nurses to tell them Mum was in pain or that her bedding needed changing because her sheets were damp with sweat. Her basic physical needs were addressed, but the total lack of compassion and communication was so upsetting. It was clear that Mum felt utterly confused, lost. No one ever consulted her, no one told her what to expect or how long she would be there for. Matters came to a head when an elderly woman with severe breathing problems was installed in a bed directly opposite Mum. The lady's family kept a constant vigil since it was clear she didn’t have long to live. Mum could hear every cough, gasp and dying breath. She had no choice but to be a captive audience to this unfolding tragedy. She had to watch this woman pass away. It was then my sister and I knew we had to get her out of there. Mum insisted she wanted to die at home, a short  drive away in Potton, Bedfordshire, but in her advanced state of ill health, this wasn't possible. In the meantime, the palliative care team contacted Sue Ryder St John's Hospice in Moggerhanger, Bedford, who readily agreed to take her. I admit I was very nervous about what the hospice would be like, terrified that Mum would find it a morbid and frightening place filled with dying people. Women at risk . Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK. Around 55,000 women are diagnosed each year . But as soon as we arrived, it was clear my fears had been entirely misplaced. The staff insisted Lindsey and I have a cup of tea while nurses gently led Mum away so they could settle her in a lovely room - her own room - overlooking the gardens. They spent time talking about how she felt, what pain relief she needed. It created a template for those last couple of weeks of her life in which Mum finally felt she had regained control. She was treated like an individual by nurses who were enduringly friendly and patient. Lindsey and I could come and go as we pleased. I’d often pop in with my two daughters, Rosie, nine, and Chloe, five, on the way to school. Mum loved it when the girls came running in to bring Grandma her morning paper. The girls loved it, too: they'd been frightened by what they'd seen on the hospital ward, and had to be cajoled a little into going to the hospice. But after seeing how different it was, they were only too happy to go again. Meanwhile, we adults rarely acknowledged the great unsaid: Mum was dying - we were going to lose her all too soon. The warmth and peacefulness of the hospice stripped us of any morbid thoughts. Instead, we talked and reminisced. The only time Mum got agitated was discussing Dad - he was now in a home, but we reassured her he was in good hands. She also made it clear she no longer wanted to go home. She wanted to stay in the hospice until she died. Once she was there she seemed almost to 'bounce back' - her pain was better controlled, and she slept well thanks to the peace and quiet. Thanks to such new-found serenity, we developed a new, though all too brief, routine of just spending quality time talking to Mum. She was especially thrilled when I told her I was doing a sponsored 10km walk in aid of the hospice and had raised nearly £3,000. She died on a bright Sunday morning on the last day of September. It was early, around 8am when I got the call. Mum had fallen trying to get out of bed - independent to the last - and though not injured, once safely and comfortably back under the covers, she simply took a long, peaceful breath and slipped away. When Lindsey and I got to the hospice, we found Mum serenely laid out in bed, two fresh flowers on her pillow, her hands tucked under the sheets and wrapped around a little wooden cross. It was a beautiful, comforting sight. And so, as I come to terms with losing my mum, I carry those precious two weeks of hospice care with me. I think of her sitting peacefully in her chair, doing the crossword, watching television, tucking into a hearty casserole or delicious fruit crumble. I'm just so glad that despite all this she managed to reclaim the peace and control she so badly craved before she died. It’s the very least any of us can hope for.

Jessie Flower, left, never forgot the support the Gosden House gave her and sister Elsie, right, when their father died . A former secretary has left £2.1million to her old boarding school after it supported her through the death of her father when she was a child. Jessie Flower's bequest will be used to fund the education of 50 pupils who have lost at least one of their parents at her old boarding school. Mrs Flower, who died in 2011 aged 89, always remembered the help she and sister Elsie received from Gosden House in the 1930s when their father died. The charity foundation even paid for Mrs Flower to train as a secretary when she left the school in Bramley, near Guildford, in Surrey, aged 16. The young sisters were sent to Gosden House, the girls' school of Lord Wandsworth College (LWC) by their widowed mother who was struggling to support them. Mrs Flower never forgot the support she received and stayed in touch with the school until she died. LWC headmaster Fergus Livingstone said the bequest is the biggest they have ever received. He said: 'Mrs Flower's bequest is a very significant gift for our foundation. 'Mrs Flower was not only grateful for her own education, but could see the value of a boarding school education for children in a similar situation in today's environment. 'Her decision to support our charity in this way is a huge endorsement of the work that we continue to do here and will bring significant progress to our programme to refinance the foundation as it enters its second century. 'We . have a lot of records from the girls' time here - their mother . obviously needed a lot of help bringing them up alone and expressed her . gratitude very frequently. 'Times were very different then and there was not a lot of support for bereaved families left without a source of income. 'Mr and Mrs Flower's gift from their assets and savings is a massive one and we have never had a donation of this size before. 'The pupils who will benefit from it are absolutely amazed and so grateful.' Gosden House, girls' school of Lord Wandsworth College, said it the bequest is the biggest in their history . Headmaster Fergus Livingstone said the money will educate children for 20 years . A year after she left the school Jessie married William Flower, who worked in insurance, and they settled in Minehead, Somerset. The childless couple lived modestly and Mr Flower died before his wife, who stayed in touch with the school all her life. Shortly before her death, she was in contact and identifying herself and school friends in old photographs. The trustees of the foundation charity of LWC will invest the sum into the William and Jessie Fund. It will pay school fees for the 50 foundation pupils who currently attend the college and is expected to last around 20 years. The school site was originally bought using a £1.2million bequest by Lord Wandsworth, who wanted to help children who had lost parents through agricultural accidents. Since it opened in 1922, more than 2,500 pupils have received support from the foundation including England rugby player Ugo Monye, who left in 2001. The bequest brings the total given to the foundation in the past five years to more than £3.3million.","Jessie Flower kept in touch with Gosden House after she left in the 1930s .

When Dean Parnell realised his iPad had been snatched from a table in a busy city centre bar, he was determined to get it back. Within an hour, the quick-thinking solicitor had traced the £750 Apple tablet computer to four possible addresses ten miles away thanks to an in-built tracking application. But despite repeatedly asking police to recover the device, he was told they were too busy to attend. Detective work: Lawyer Dean Parnell used a special app on his iPad to trace the stolen after police refused to help him . So he travelled from Birmingham to the village of Water Orton in Warwickshire to recover the iPad himself. Last night, Mr Parnell, 45, condemned West Midlands Police for failing to help him. He said: ‘I went to the police . station. I was able to demonstrate that an apparent crime was taking . place and I was turned away. 'I guess I am more angry about the way I had . been treated at the police station than I was about an opportunist who . had pocketed my iPad.’ The drama began on Friday last week when Mr Parnell realised the 32GB retina display iPad had been taken from a table in a bar. Tracked: A resident of Water Orton got a shock when they opened to door to find solicitor Dean Parnell on their doorstep demanding the return of his stolen iPad . Staff at a nearby Apple store showed . him how to use the inbuilt tracking system and quickly pinpointed it to a . train heading out of Birmingham. Mr Parnell, from Northamptonshire, . said: ‘The train stopped at Water Orton and the iPad began moving slowly . as if someone was walking to a car park, then it began moving quickly. ‘I called the police and they said . someone would be along shortly but no one turned up. I then rang them . again and they said someone would ring me back, but they didn’t.’ Swiped: Dean Parnell had to turn detective after discovering his £750 iPad had been stolen while he enjoyed a night out in Bacchus Bar, pictured, in Birmingham city centre . At a local police station he was told . nobody was available until the following day – even when he said there . was a greater chance of ‘an incident’ without assistance from officers. Four more calls to West Midlands . Police proved fruitless - and during the final attempt he was told it . was now Warwickshire Police’s problem because he was now within their . jurisdiction. Mr Parnell then had to ‘go through the . whole story again’ and was told a patrol car would be there within the . hour. It didn’t arrive, and when he called back, he was told the nearest . car was still 30 miles away. Apology: West Midlands Police have apologised to Dean Parnell after saying no detective was free to help return his stolen iPad . The commercial litigation partner . eventually got the device back when he knocked at one of the four doors . pinpointed by the GPS tracking application and recognised the stunned . householder as a fellow patron of the bar he had been to. The suspect returned the tablet . computer – claiming he had found it and was planning to hand it in to . Apple the following day. Police later gave him a ‘stern warning’. Mr . Parnell, who has now received an apology from police, said: ‘The whole . event took some four hours from beginning to end. Had it not been for my . persistence, my iPad would have ended up as another statistic. ‘I appreciate the police may have been busy but it was their total lack of interest that was what really bothered me.’ Superintendent Danny Long, of . Birmingham West and Central Police, said the ‘standard of service’ fell . short and that officers should have been dispatched quickly.

Undercover: Frenando Jara spent five years under the guise of a radical Muslim after the 9/11 attacks . It may sound far-fetched, but a California man says he lived a real life spy thriller when he became an unlikely secret agent. Fernando Jara, of Kern County, spent five years completely off the grid beginning in 2001 when the seemingly normal guy joined the ranks of America's most clandestine agency. It was shortly after the September 11 attacks when Jara, who had recently converted to Islam, sent an email to the CIA, offering his services as a spy. To his surprise, the feds got back to him, and offered him the job, Jara told the Los Angeles Times. He had dropped out of high school, and at the time was working toward his equivalency degree at community college. Jara quickly got to work, traveling within California and to Virginia and Washington, DC, where he received training in Arabic, counter-terror tactics and weapons. He was also connected with David Manning of Ventura, California, who taught the then-26-year-old how to handle knives and guns. Manning told the LA Times: 'They said he was under the radar and getting ready to go to Afghanistan to infiltrate the Taliban. I told them, ""I'm not doing this."" I didn't believe them.' Jara credits Manning with turning him into 'a one-man army.' The next five years of Jara's life have remained a pretty guarded secret, but he tells the LA Times that he infiltrated numerous terror training camps in Yemen and Afghanistan while posing as a radical Muslim. The paper reached out to the FBI and CIA for comment on Jara, but both agencies declined to comment.

After that incident, Jara was ordered to escape Yemen. Upon his return to the U.S., things began to go downhill for Jara, who had developed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism.

Hacked: The Old Bailey was told that Sven-Goran Eriksson had his phone hacked by the News Of The World for almost his entire time as England manager . Sven-Goran Eriksson had his phone . hacked by the News of the World for most of his reign as England . football manager, a court heard yesterday. A private investigator working for the . tabloid targeted him for four years, listening to messages about his . fling with Football Association secretary Faria Alam as well as . discussions on players. The Old Bailey heard that Glenn . Mulcaire was paid £100,000 to hack phones by the tabloid and was tasked . with intercepting the England boss’s voicemails between May 2002 and . June 2006. During that time Eriksson, now 65, . became the subject of several high profile stories, including one about . his affair with Miss Alam. Police found scrawled notes detailing . Miss Alam’s London address, phone number and references to resetting the . personal identification number of her voicemail box in June 2004. A . month later, the News of the World broke the story of ‘Sven’s secret . affair’ featuring salacious details about their romance. It was followed a week later with the story that Miss Alam was also sleeping with FA executive Mark Palios. The prosecution pointed to a number of . alleged incidents of hacking, claiming each had occurred shortly before . a major story about Eriksson in the News of the World. In January 2006, Mulcaire hacked his phone five times in three days, the court heard. The court was told that Glenn Mulcaire, left, monitored Eriksson and his lover Faria Alam, right, between 2002 and 2006, leading to several high-profile stories . Job: The England boss's phone was also hacked just a day before his team were due to kick-off their 2006 World Cup campaign, the jury was told . Two days later, Eriksson was exposed . in a sting by News of the World undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, . known as the Fake Sheikh, who duped the manager into making a string of . indiscreet remarks about his future as England boss. Earlier, the court . heard that on April 12, 2002 a mystery woman claiming to be the mother . of Milly Dowler called a recruitment agency the News of the World . suspected of employing the missing 13-year-old. This was after Mulcaire had hacked . Milly’s voicemails and found a message about a job interview which had . been left in error by agency staff. Partnership: The court heard that after the expose of Eriksson's affair, several stories followed - including Miss Alam's thoughts on his then partner Nancy Dell'Olio, right . Dell'Olio was left embarrassed last night when a prankster wearing a Sven-Goran Eriksson mask followed her into the Shaka Zulu restaurant in Camden, north London . Go away; Dell'Olio, who split with the football coach in 2007, did not appear to be amused by the mystery man donning a mask of her former partner . A team of reporters chasing the false . lead camped outside the home of the agency boss, the Old Bailey heard. Valerie Hancox said a co-worker received a call from a woman who said: . ‘We know what’s going on with Milly Dowler and we believe she’s working . for you. I’m her mother and I want to know where she is.’ Milly’s parents were not told about . the News of the World story until April 13, so her mother could not be . the caller. Milly’s body was discovered five months later. She had been . abducted and murdered. Rebekah Brooks, left, and Andy Coulson, arriving at the Old Bailey today. They both deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 2000 and August 2006 . Former News of the World editors . Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, both 45, former head of news Ian . Edmondson, 44, and the tabloid’s former managing editor Stuart Kuttner, . 73, all deny conspiring with others to hack phones. Brooks further denies two allegations . of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice – one with her former . personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, and a second with her husband . Charles, 50,  and former News International head of security Mark Hanna, . 50. They also deny the charges. Brooks denies two counts of conspiring . to commit misconduct in public office, linked to alleged inappropriate . payments to public officials. Coulson denies two allegations that he . conspired with the News of the World’s former royal editor Clive . Goodman, 56, to commit misconduct in public office. The trial continues. Andy Coulson, pictured, was described as being 'very ambitious but not ruthless' by one of his oldest friends Dean Keyworth who gave evidence at the Old Bailey today . Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson is 'very ambitious but not ruthless', the jury in his trial for alleged phone hacking has heard from one of his oldest friends. Dean Keyworth told the Old Bailey that he had met Coulson while he was a 19-year-old journalism student - before he embarked on a successful career in the media and later politics. Coulson, 45, denies conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006 during the time he worked at the now-defunct tabloid. Mr Keyworth told the jury: 'He is a very loyal friend and despite becoming extremely busy and very important he retained his friendships, he took care of them and the few people who were close to him. 'He is very ambitious but I don’t think he is ruthless,' the witness said, adding that Coulson 'wanted to get the story but not at any cost'. The witness also said the two would have fun in nightclubs and at celebrity parties during Coulson’s time as editor of showbiz column Bizarre. He described his friend of 26 years as 'self-deprecating' and someone who 'played himself down'. The court heard that Mr Keyworth met with then editor of the NotW Rebekah Brooks in April 2002 when she was on holiday in Dubai with her former husband Ross Kemp. Coulson, who was NotW deputy editor at the time and who the court has previously heard was in a secret relationship with his boss Brooks, put his friend and lover in contact so that he could arrange a stay for her and Mr Kemp at the seven star Burj Al-Arab hotel. Mr Keyworth said he had met Brooks, then known as Rebekah Wade, for drinks and then lunch at a time when, the court was told, the NotW was investigating the disappearance of schoolgirl Milly Dowler by hacking into her voicemail. However, he claimed he had mainly spoken to Kemp about soap opera Eastenders, which the actor and television presenter had left months before. Mr Kemp, who shot to fame with his role as . hard man Grant Mitchell, was pleased that he had been moved to the Burj . Al-Arab because he liked the Hermes toiletries the hotel offered to . guests, Mr Keyworth told the jury. Mr Keyworth said he had met Rebekah Brooks in April 2002 while she was on holiday in Dubai with her former husband, actor Ross Kemp. The couple are pictured here together in 2002 . Mr Keyworth said he had seen Brooks talking on the phone with the NotW office on April 13, the date when, the court has heard, the newspaper took evidence obtained from Milly's voicemail to Surrey Police . Answering questions from prosecutor Andrew Edis QC, Mr Keyworth said he had seen Brooks talking on the phone with the NotW office on April 13, the date when, the court has heard, the newspaper took evidence obtained from Milly’s voicemail to Surrey Police. However, he said he had not heard what Brooks, who he had met previously at birthday parties, was talking about. He said that she had got up from the table 'a couple of times' to talk on the phone, but was mainly listening rather than talking. The prosecution claims that the decision to inform the police about what turned out to be a false lead found on the voicemail a day after it was hacked by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was taken at the highest level. Yesterday, Mr Keyworth’s friend William Hennessy, who also met Brooks on the same holiday, claimed that he had heard her mention 'the missing Surrey schoolgirl' at the time. Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, denies conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006. Mulcaire has admitted hacking phones.

Pictured during day release from prison in 2006, child killer David McGreavy can be named after a High Court order . A triple child killer who impaled his victims on spiked garden railings had his cloak of anonymity lifted yesterday in a major victory for ‘open justice’. David McGreavy – dubbed the Monster of Worcester – had used human rights law to claim the public should be kept in the dark about his bid to move to an open jail. But, after a legal challenge by the Daily Mail and other newspapers, the High Court quashed the secrecy order. It removes the chilling prospect of the public not knowing if one of the most dangerous men in Britain is close to being released. Last night, Dorothy Urry, the mother of his three victims, called for criminals to be banned from exploiting the Human Rights Act and said it was vital that Press freedom to report the workings of the criminal justice system be protected. Her plea came as police seek to impose draconian restrictions on the identification of suspects. ‘Why shouldn’t criminals be named,’ asked Mrs Urry. ‘We don’t know who we’re walking next to these days – the public has a right to know. 'If he was to move next door, you would have to know exactly who and what he was. It may stop people doing what he did if they knew how it ruined lives.” McGreavy, now 62, committed one of the most horrific crimes of the past 40 years when, on Friday April 13, 1973, he murdered the three children of Mrs Urry – who was then known as Elsie Ralph – and her husband Clive. He was a lodger with the couple and had been babysitting at their Worcester home when the youngest child, nine-month-old Samantha, began crying for her bottle. McGreavy went berserk, battering Samantha to death. Her brother Paul, four, was strangled and Dawn, two, had her throat cut. Police found their mutilated bodies impaled on a neighbour’s railings. He was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 20 years. Since this term expired, he has been trying to secure his freedom but has yet to be released by the Parole Board. Paul (left), Dawn (right) and Samantha (centre), pictured with their mother Dorothy Urry, were murdered by David McGreavy in 1973 . A picture from the time shows the scene where the bodies of Paul, four, Dawn, two, and nine-month-old Samantha Ralph were found after being impaled on railings . McGreavy, pictured in 1973, has spent 40 years in jail and has made nine requests for parole in that time . The triple killing has continued to shock the UK for the last 40 years . A key step on the road to freedom is . moving to an open jail. McGreavy has previously spent two years in an . open prison, where he was allowed out on day release, but was returned . to a closed prison at an undisclosed location. 1973: David McGreavy murders the three children of the family he is lodging with . 1975: He is the victim of a serious assault in prison . 1978: Threatened with violence . 1991: Prison cell fouled by other inmates just four days after he goes into closed conditions . 1994: Threatened with violence after press reports . 1995: Several prisoners try to attack him in an open prison but their plan is thwarted . 1996: Victim of another serious assault while serving in the general prison population . 2005: Threatened with violence after press reports . 2006: Pictured in Liverpool where he was visiting a hostel from Ford Open Prison . 2009: Unsuccessfully fought Home Secretary's decision that he must remain in Category C prison but was given anonymity order that lasted until today . January 2013: Keeps anonymity as he applies to be moved to an open prison . May 22, 2013: Anonymity order overturned . Earlier this year, McGreavy launched a . legal challenge against the Parole Board’s latest refusal of his bid to . move to an open jail. In an extraordinary ruling, the judge . agreed to a request by his lawyers that his identity should be kept . secret throughout the proceedings. They used the Human Rights Act to claim that – if inmates found out what he had done – he could be attacked. The Mail and other newspaper groups – . backed by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – immediately challenged the . ruling to defend the principle of open justice. Challenging the anonymity order at a . hearing last month, Guy Vassall-Adams, appearing for Mr Grayling and the . Press, said of McGreavy’s crimes: ‘The full facts are exceptionally . horrific by even the standard of murders.’ The gagging order restricted the . media to saying they were ‘three sadistic murders – but that doesn’t . even give you the half of it’, said Mr Vassall-Adams. Yesterday, Lord Justice Pitchford, . sitting with Lord Justice Simon, said: ‘In our judgment, there is at . present no real and immediate risk to the claimant’s life and safety . because he is serving his sentence in conditions in which his safety can . be closely monitored.’ McGreavy’s next parole review – his . ninth – is under way, with a target date of August 1 for a hearing, . although Lord Justice Pitchford said it was ‘doubtful’ that date would . be met. If it was, and it was recommended he be returned to open . conditions, that could occur in October, said the judge. If he did go back to open conditions, . the review would have to consider steps that could be taken to protect . McGreavy, which ‘might include a change of name’. Mr Grayling said: ‘I welcome the court’s decision. This is a clear victory for open justice.’ The only reason that McGreavy has ever given for the killing is that Samantha Ralph was crying for her bottle . A police officer stands guard outside the house in Gillam Street, Worcester, where McGreavy was a lodger and scene of the murder of the children . Lawyers for the Monster of Worcester used four sections of the Human Rights Act to try to keep his identity secret. These were article 2 (the right to life); article 3 (the right to protection from ill-treatment); article 5 (the right to liberty and security) and article 8 (the right to privacy and a family life). Most weight was placed on articles 2 and 3, with Quincy Whitaker, McGreavy’s lawyer, insisting that there was ‘a serious likelihood of a serious attack’ if fellow prison inmates learned of his identity through the media. But Lord Justice Pitchford said McGreavy – who is in a vulnerable prisoner unit – could have his safety ‘closely monitored’ in jail. Dorothy Urry, the mother of his victims, said: ‘He doesn’t deserve human rights, he’s not even human. He committed such a horrendous crime and should have to face up to it. ‘What about my human right to live my life without looking over my shoulder because the killer of my children is roaming free? What about the human rights of my children?’ Child killer David McGreavy murdered three children in Worcester in 1973, pictured shortly after his arrest . They were, in the words of High Court judge Mr Justice Simon, ‘exceptionally horrific crimes’.Three children were murdered, apparently for no other reason than to silence the crying of a nine-month-old baby. Then, their small bodies broken, they were impaled on garden railings in an act of grotesque savagery that shocked the nation. The date was Friday, April 13, 1973. Dorothy Urry, then known as Elsie Ralph, was 23 and working as a barmaid in Worcester. Her husband Clive Ralph had gone to collect her from work and had left their children in the care of David McGreavy, a family friend and lodger. The children knew him well, and had played with him happily in the past. The couple thought they had no reason to worry about the welfare of their children. Yet, when they returned to their home in Gillam Street, Worcester, they discovered that the police were waiting for them. An officer escorted to them to the local police station and broke the news: Paul, four, Dawn, two, and baby Samantha were all dead. The couple were told McGreavy had admitted killing them, but that police were still looking for their bodies. Later that night, they were found in a row, impaled on a neighbour’s spiked garden railings. McGreavy, 21, who had been kicked out of the Royal Navy, reportedly told police that Samantha had wanted her bottle and wouldn’t stop crying. ‘I put my hand over her mouth and it went from there,’ he said. ‘It’s all in the house. On Paul I used a wire. I was going to bury [Paul] but I couldn’t… I went outside and put them on the fence. All I can hear is kids, kids, kids.’ Paul was strangled, Dawn had had her throat cut and Samantha died from a compound fracture to the skull. It remains unclear if there was more to the killings and prison psychologists who interviewed McGreavy explored the possibility that there may have been a ‘sexual motive’. Mrs Urry, who took an overdose six months after losing her children, and has since moved to Andover in Hampshire, said she had lived through ‘40 years of hell’. ‘If he was released, I’d be waiting outside with a gun,’ she said yesterday. ‘Life should mean life and he should never get to walk free. He got off lightly with a life sentence – he should have been hanged. ‘I think about what he did every minute of every day because he took my life away. I can’t go to family parties any more, I can’t celebrate anything. Put yourself in my shoes, how would you feel? ‘I can’t and will never move on. For what he did to my three children and me, he deserves the same treatment that they got – death.’","David McGreavy murdered three children he was babysitting in 1973 .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:04 EST, 28 November 2013 . An experimental device is letting paralyzed people drive wheelchairs simply by flicking their tongue in the right direction. Users have their tongue pierced with a magnetic stud that resembles jewelry and acts like a joystick, in the hope that it will offer them more mobility and independence. Researchers reported on Wednesday that 11 people paralyzed from the neck down rapidly learned to use the tongue device to pilot their wheelchairs through an obstacle course full of twists and turns, and also to operate a computer. Scroll down for video . Wheelchair user Jason DiSanto, left, receives a tongue piercing at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. An experimental device is letting paralyzed people drive wheelchairs simply by flicking their tongue in the right direction . 'It's really powerful because it's so intuitive,' said Jason DiSanto, 39, of Atlanta, who was among the first spinal cord-injured patients to get his tongue pierced for science and try out the system. 'The first time I did it, people thought I was driving for, like, years.' The team of researchers in Atlanta and Chicago put the Tongue Drive System to the test against one of the most widely used assistive technologies, called sip-and-puff, that users operate by breathing into a straw. Using the tongue, patients operated their wheelchairs a bit faster but just as accurately - and on average, they performed about three times better on video game-like computer tests, said lead researcher Maysam Ghovanloo, director of Georgia Tech's bionics lab. The research, reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine, is an early step that allowed use of the device only inside laboratories. Larger studies in real-world conditions are required before the device ever could be sold. And the tongue piercing may be a turn-off for some potential users, the researchers acknowledge. But the work is attracting attention from specialists who say there's a big need for more assistive technologies so they can customize care for the severely disabled. Paralyzed patient Jason Disanto pilots a wheelchair using the Tongue Drive System at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He is one of 11 people now able to use the innovative system . 'For people who have very limited ability to control a power wheelchair, there aren't that many options,' said Dr. Brad Dicianno, a rehabilitation specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who wasn't involved with the new research. 'There is some interesting promise for this tongue control.' Here's how the system works: A headset detects the tongue's position when the user flicks that magnetic stud. Touch a spot on the right bottom tooth to go right, for example. The headset wirelessly beams that information to a smartphone the user carries. An app then sends the command to move the wheelchair or the computer cursor. Why the tongue? 'It's unobstrusive, easy to use and flexible,' said Ghovanloo, a biomedical engineer who created the system and has started a company that is working with Georgia Tech to commercialize it. Most people with spinal cord injuries - or neurologic diseases that also can paralyze - still can move the tongue. It doesn't require special concentration. The tongue is pretty tireless. And the amount of real estate the brain's motor cortex dedicates to the tongue and mouth rivals that of the fingers and hand, offering multiple complex movements, Ghovanloo said. He led the team of researchers from Atlanta's Shepherd Center for spinal injuries, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and Northwestern University. DiSanto, an electrical engineer who became paralyzed from the neck down in a 2009 diving accident, said the headset is less intrusive than the sip-and-puff device that he normally uses, which requires a straw-like tube to be worn in front of his face. More important, he said, the tongue drive gave him more control, allowing him to move diagonally, for example. Mr DiSanto said that the piercing took 'some getting used to' but that the device had made him more independent . As for the piercing, 'there is some getting used to it,' said DiSanto, who got his in 2011. It took about a week to heal, and speaking and eating felt funny initially but he got used to the sensation. It's not for everyone. The current study tested the device in 23 able-bodied participants and 11 paralyzed volunteers. By study's end, all of the disabled volunteers preferred the tongue system to their regular assistive device, said co-author Joy Bruce, who heads the Shepherd Center's spinal cord injury lab. But patients who were older or worried that a tongue stud wasn't acceptable in their profession decided against participating. Ten other patients signed up but dropped out. One had the piercing fall out, researchers reported, while others had problems finding transportation to the study site, unrelated medical issues or lost interest. Ghovanloo plans to add functions to the smartphone app to let users turn on the TV or the lights with a flick of the tongue, too. He's also made the device less visible - putting the headset's sensors on a dental retainer instead. Studies begin soon to tell if that approach works without compromising users' speech. DiSanto has signed up for that next round of testing. 'Somebody that's in a wheelchair already has a stigma,' he said. 'If there was something that could be developed to control my wheelchair and the environment around me, to make me more independent without having to have medical devices coming out of my mouth, it would be a huge benefit.'","Users have their tongue pierced with a magnetic stud that resembles jewelry and acts like a joystick .

"By . Francesca Infante . PUBLISHED: . 04:42 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:46 EST, 25 November 2013 . China's Foreign Ministry says it has . complained to the United States over its 'irresponsible remarks' about the territorial dispute with Japan over islands in the East China Sea. China's . Defense Ministry also called Japan's objections to its East China Sea . Air Defense Identification Zone 'absolutely groundless and unacceptable', . and said it had made solemn representations to the Japanese Embassy in . Beijing. But the remarks come as the latest in a continuing war of words over the air space of the disputed Senkaku islands, which has seen Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brand China's plans unenforceable and dangerous. Dispute: Uotsuri Island is one of the five uninhabited islands at the centre of an increasingly hostile debate between Japan and China. Both countries name them as their own . Abe told a parliamentary session that China's declaration of an air defense identification zone alters the state of affairs in the East China Sea and escalates a tense situation. He said: 'The measures by the Chinese side have no validity whatsoever for Japan, and we demand China revoke any measures that could infringe upon the freedom of flight in international airspace. 'It can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well.' On Saturday, Beijing issued a map of the zone and a set of rules which say all aircraft must notify Chinese authorities and are subject to emergency military measures if they do not identify themselves or obey Beijing's orders. Abe said the measures one-sidedly impose rules set by the Chinese military on all flights in the zone, and violate the freedom to fly above open sea, a general principle under the international law. Abe also slammed China for showing the disputed islands, called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, as Chinese territory in the zone. Since taking office almost a year ago, Abe has been spearheading a move to step up Japan's defense capability, citing threats from China's growing maritime and military presence in the region. Japan has had a similar zone since the 1960s. Violation: Japanese premier Shinzo Abe said the measures violate the freedom to fly above open sea, a general principle under the international law . South Korea also complained today about the Chinese zone, which includes the air space above a set of submerged rocks that are controlled by Seoul but also claimed by Beijing. South Korea's Defense Ministry summoned China's military attache in Seoul, saying the zone is unacceptable because it was drawn unilaterally, according to ministry officials. Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said South Korea's control over the area remains unchanged and Seoul won't notify China when its planes pass through the region. In a statement on Sunday Chinese foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that the zone's aim is to defend China's sovereignty and the security of its airspace and land. He said it is not aimed at any country and it does not affect freedom of overflight. But the move has not gone down well over seas and both US Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel have said the US is 'deeply concerned' about China's action. In a statement on Saturday Mr Kerry said: 'This unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea. Warning: US Secretary of State John Kerry speaks to journalists in Bali. China has warned the U.S. to stay out of territorial dispute with Japan over South China Sea . 'Escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident.' Qin said China told US Ambassador Gary Locke on Sunday that the US should 'correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks on China.' Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said the ministry had complained to the US Embassy's military attache on Sunday evening. The US doesn't take a position on who has sovereignty over the islands but recognizes they are under Japanese administration. Along with a rise in its economic and military power in recent years, China has become more assertive over its maritime claims. China claims over the islands extend back hundreds of years. But Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey and as a resultformally recognised them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. After the Japanese surrender at the end of Second World War in 1945 islands fell under the control of the allied forces and were administered by the U.S. occupation force. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.","China issued a set of rules on Saturday which say all aircraft must notify them and are subject to emergency military measures if .

A former reality TV star has been held on suspicion of playing a part in a £3million fraud allegedly run from Barcelona by the father of the fiancee of footballer Gareth Bale. Jamie-Lee Church, who won a record deal after appearing on ITV's Popstars: The Rivals in 2002 was arrested as US detectives investigate whether she was involved in the 'boiler room scam'. The crime is thought to have been run from Spain by Martin Rhys-Jones, 49, the father of Real Madrid player Mr Bale's fiancee Emma. The footballer and Miss Rhys-Jones are not accused of any wrongdoing. Jamie Lee-Church has been arrested in Spain and faces extradition to the US . Mr Rhys-Jones is currently on remand in a US jail, after people claimed that they were sold 'near worthless' shares at sky high prices. The Sunday Mirror reported that Miss . Church, 27, is one of 12 defendants being investigated in connection . with the fraud and now faces extradition to the US. She . is accused of posing as 'Charlotte Keys' and cold-calling victims to . persuade them to buy stocks containing 'false and fraudulent . representations'. Gareth Bale with his fiancee Emma Rhys-Jones and their daughter Alba Violet Bale. Neither the footballer, nor his partner have been accused of any wrongdoing . It is alleged that Miss Church, a former hairdresser from Brighton who has also appeared in men's magazines, made £50,000 from her part in the scam. She was arrested earlier this month. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Spain in November 2013. 'We provided consular assistance.' The gang are believed to have been operating for at least three years. Mr Bale, 24 and his fiancee are believed to have put their wedding plans on hold after Mr Rhys-Jones was extradited to the US in June and, along with 11 others, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. He . is accused of running a telemarketing scam from offices in Barcelona . between 2006 and 2009 that duped victims in the UK and Canada into buying expensive shares . that were almost worthless. Rhys-Jones set up business in the . Spanish city – where there is a ferocious footballing rivalry with Bale's new Real . Madrid – in 2005 after . separating from his wife, Suzanne, in Cardiff. He is facing up to 30 years in prison and a maximum fine of £160,000 if convicted. Investigators . claim Rhys-Jones got staff to generate false press releases claiming . share prices were of a much higher value than they were being traded. He allegedly hired staff to make fraudulent calls, offering them rent-free homes in Barcelona and a sales commission. US . investigators say the sales team would not tell customers that the . stocks were restricted, meaning they could not be easily sold on the . open market.

The indictment states that when customers were eventually sent share certificates ‘the value of the stock had dropped to nearly nothing’. More than £3.2million was invested by unwitting customers in the scheme before the money was transferred to bank accounts in New York, Spain, the UK and Switzerland, prosecutors say. They have accused Rhys-Jones of laundering money through an Abbey National branch in the Channel Islands, along with banks in Barcelona and Germany. The US probe is being run by the Homeland Security Investigations, Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs. US Grand Jury indictment documents reveal that Rhys-Jones also used the aliases Martin Reece and John Allen while in Barcelona. Miss Rhys-Jones and Bale, who became childhood sweethearts at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff, carried out a long-distance relationship for eight years after Bale’s moves to Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur and she moved into his Essex mansion only two years ago.

Walk of death: Convicted murderer Hsang Kham from Thailand is led from his prison cell as he is transferred for execution in Yunnan Province . In an interview broadcast in China beforehand, apparently recorded on February 27, Naw Kham looked upset as he said: 'I don't want my children to be like me. I am afraid of death. I want to live.' He added: 'I haven’t been able to sleep for two days. I have been thinking too much. I miss my mum.  I don't want to die. I have children. I am afraid.' . Kham came to nationwide notoriety in China following the slaughter of 13 Chinese sailors when their ships were stormed by armed men on the Mekong river in 2011. The bodies of the 13 fishermen were . found inside two cargo ships, the Hua Ping and the Yu Xing, on . the Thai side of the river in October of that year.

Throwback: Viewers in China condemned the decision to broadcast the footage as insensitive . Insensitive: Many in China complained the broadcast was an unwelcome reminder of mass execution rallies staged in the country in the past . The gang was accused of ambushing two flat-bottomed Chinese cargo ships on the upper reaches of the Mekong on October 5, 2011, in Myanmar waters. The waters are infested with gangs that make their livings from protection rackets and the production and smuggling of heroin, methamphetamine and other drugs. The Mekong flows south from Yunnan through the infamous Golden Triangle region, where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet, and provides a vital trade and transportation route between southwestern China and Southeast Asia. The ships were recovered downriver later the same day by Thai police following a gun battle with gang members, and the bodies of the 13 dead, some of whom were bound by the hands before being stabbed and shot, were fished from the river over the following days. Methamphetamines were found on the boats, leading to speculation they had been hijacked as part of a drug smuggling plot. The wave of attacks has been blamed on gangs operating in the area.

Rumors that a new player might be added to the cast started yesterday, when Gothamist reported that auditions were held earlier this month at the Groundlings theater for black female comediennes in L.A., following criticism that the show lacked diversity. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creater and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times yesterday that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. Scroll down for video . It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month (those asked to audition pictured) According to Michaels, the much talked about L.A. audition was just one of several casting sessions leading up to the final audition held on Monday in New York for nine women. Man behind the curtain: Lorne Michaels previously said that hiring a black actress was on the show's to do list . 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels added that as many as two of the nine that made it to the final round could make it onto the cast in January. But he says he doesn't want to add too many women since the cast already has five. Right now, the SNL cast consists of five men and five women, with one female and six male featured players. Michaels also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels says he can't remember ever adding a cew cast member in the middle of the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them into the last episodes of the season. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live . has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the . 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . While many have criticized the show for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. Laughing at themselves: When Kerry Washington hosted the show last month, the first skit made fun of the lack of black female cast members on the show by having Washington play Michelle Obama and Oprah in the same skit . Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past . As a result, there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring First Lady Michelle Obama since Maya Rudolph left the cast in 2007. The only exception to this came in November when Scandal star Kerry Washington was the guest host amid the diversity furor and she played Mrs Obama, Oprah and Beyonce in the same sketch as the show's way of poking fun at themselves. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Rudolph who is biracial. 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' Webb says she was invited to audition last summer, but was filming a television show and wasn't able to perform. One of the comediennes- Brunson- has a fan on the inside, as Pharoah has publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots. Supporter: Cast member Jay Pharaoh (left) has specifically named Darmirra Brunson (right) as someone he hopes joins the cast . 'Why do I think she should be on the show? Because she's black first of all, and she's really talented. She's amazing. She needs to be on SNL. I said it. And I believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year,' Pharoah told The Grio. The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to several high-profile departures. Seth Meyers is expected to leave the show mid-way through this season to replace Jimmy Fallon as the host of Late Night and Jason Sudeikis has confirmed that he will not be returning next season.","Lorne Michaels revealed Thursday that at least one new black female comedienne will join the cast of Saturday Night Live in January .

Warned: Prime Minister David Cameron held discussions with his senior aides after being informed two weeks ago about the affair . David Cameron has been warned that a secret love affair involving high profile figures has potentially serious political implications for him and his government. The Prime Minister held discussions with his senior aides after being informed two weeks ago about the affair, which is now over. The Mail knows the identities of the lovers but cannot reveal them for legal reasons. They are both middle-aged figures and neither of them is a member of the Cabinet. Insiders said Mr Cameron was ‘stunned’ when told the names of the pair and ‘immediately realised the importance of the story’. ‘None of us could believe it when we first heard it,’ said a senior source, adding that the revelation had caused ‘great personal distress to innocent parties’. Aides denied that the Prime Minister has held ‘crisis talks’. But they made it clear that Mr Cameron was aware the love affair would lead to negative perceptions of his party if the details are ever made public. Together they discussed the potential consequences of the situation with the prime minister amid fears that publication of the details would cause his leadership further troubles. Insiders say revelations could cause sufficient publicity that it would disrupt the Government’s news agenda and ‘blow out of the water’ any political initiatives they were planning. One senior source told the Mail on Sunday: ‘This revelation is dynamite. None of us could believe it when we first heard it. Then we just thought, “What a complete mess”.’ Those who know the identities of the former lovers dismissed the suggestion that the affair would shock voters in the same way as Sir John Major’s relationship with Edwina Currie, which was revealed when she published her diaries in 2002. ‘When the news first broke people were calling and texting one another guessing who it would be,’ said one MP. ‘There will be a few people who will be mightily relieved today that it isn’t them risking exposure.’ High-profile: Those who know the identities of the former lovers dismissed the suggestion that the affair would shock voters in the same way as Sir John Major's relationship with Edwina Currie (right) Mr Cameron’s leadership is already under strain following backbench revolts over Europe and gay marriage and rumours of plots being hatched to overthrow him. News of the secret affair comes hot on the heels of the revelation that Tory MP Patrick Mercer accepted £4,000 to put down parliamentary questions by a fake lobbying company set up as part of a newspaper sting. Twitter was last night full of speculation regarding the identities of those involved in the secret relationship, but many social media posts on the topic simply joked about the Coalition ‘love affair’ between Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg.","PM held discussions with senior aides after being informed about affair .

The recovery of the financial slump may be around the corner, but rising personal debt and a soaring cost of living is pushing people's finances to the brink of collapse, a worrying report has warned. Despite signs of a national economic . recovery, the Centre for Social Justice found personal debt in the UK remains close to its . all-time high of £1.4 trillion, while average household debt now stands . at £54,000 - nearly twice the level of a decade ago. Rising personal debt has become a 'significant problem' for people in Britain, with millions of families struggling to pay their rent or mortgage, according to a study by the CSJ. Despite signs of a national economic recovery, the CSJ found personal debt in the UK remains close to its all-time high of £1.4 trillion, while average household debt now stands at £54,000 - nearly twice the level of a decade ago . Some 3.9 million British families do not have enough savings to cover their rent or mortgage for more than a month, while thousands of people are being made homeless every year because they are unable to meet their payments, the study found. More than 26,000 UK households were accepted by councils as homeless in the last five years because of rent and mortgage arrears, including more than 5,000 last year, the think-tank said. There are now fears the number of . households being made homeless will increase in the coming years should . interest rates rise, the CSJ warned. The CSJ's report, Maxed Out, said poor people were bearing the brunt of a 'perfect storm' of rising living costs, falling real wages, low savings and expensive credit that has seen unsecured consumer debt almost triple in the last 20 years, reaching nearly £160 billion. The Bank of England has said it will only consider raising rates when unemployment falls from its current 7.6% rate to 7% . Households in the poorest 10 per cent of the country have average debts more than four times their annual income, the study found, with their average debt repayments amounting to nearly half their gross monthly income. The Bank of England has said it will only consider raising rates when unemployment falls from its current 7.6 per cent rate to 7 per cent. The report concludes: 'Rising personal debt levels represent a significant problem for people in Britain. 'While most personal debt is healthy and manageable, such as an affordable mortgage, student loan or low-interest credit card used to bridge income gaps, for many people their debt has become unhealthy and unmanageable. 'While people of all income levels can end up seeking debt advice or declaring bankruptcy, the problem of debt seems to be more of an issue for low-income and vulnerable households. 'A perfect storm of rising living costs, decreasing real wages, low savings and expensive credit seems to have pushed many to the edge and over a financial cliff edge.' CSJ director Christian Guy said: 'Years of increased borrowing, rising living costs and struggling to save has forced many families into a debt trap that is proving very difficult to escape. 'Problem debt can have a corrosive impact on people and families. Our report shows how it can wreak havoc on mental health, relationships and wellbeing. 'Across the UK people are up until the early hours worrying about their finances and bills.' 'Some of the poorest people in Britain are cut off from mainstream banking and have no choice now but to turn to loan sharks and high-cost lenders.' Essential bills have increased by 25 per cent since 2007, with one in six payday loans now used to pay for an outstanding household bill, the study found. Essential bills have increased by 25 per cent since 2007, with one in six payday loans now used to pay for an outstanding household bill . The market for short-term high-cost credit from companies such as payday lenders is now worth £4.8 billion a year, it said. Payday lenders have increased business from £900 million in 2008/09 to just over £2 billion - around eight million loans - in 2011/12, according to the CSJ. Around half of payday loan customers reported taking out the money because it was the only form of credit they could get, the study found. The number of people going to loan sharks is also said to have increased, with the current estimate at 310,000 people. Former work and pensions minister Chris Pond, who chaired the report, said: 'With falling real incomes and increasing costs of basic essentials, many - especially the most vulnerable - are sliding further into problem debt. 'The costs to those affected, in stress and mental disorders, relationship breakdown and hardship is immense. But so too is the cost to the nation, measured in lost employment and productivity and in an increased burden on public services.' The report found around 1.4 million people have no transactional bank account, while the CSJ estimates that millions of other people do not use their bank account because of fears over penalties and overdraft charges. The number of people seeking free professional debt advice from charities reached 1.7 million people in 2012, with some 5.3 million households said to be struggling to meet credit commitments.","Some 3.9 million British families do not have enough savings to cover their rent or mortgage for more than a month .

As the sea view from Bryony Nierop-Reading's bungalow got ever closer she adamantly refused to leave. One-by-one her neighbours moved out as the pounding waves eroded the cliffs below their homes. But the 68-year-old, affectionately nicknamed Grandmother King Canute because she seemed to think she could stop the tide, said no. Today though, after five years in her home, Mrs Nierop-Reading had to finally give in as last week's surge tide left the three-bedroom bungalow overhanging the 80ft cliff. Sad day: Bryony Nierop-Reading's cliff-top bungalow has been demolished today after it was left on the edge of a north Norfolk cliff after the storm surge last week . On the edge: The grandmother has lived in the home since 2008 and has even turned down large sums so she could stay as long as possible . Message: The resident was known affectionately as Queen Canute as she believed she could turn the tide, but today she has seen it demolished as it slipped towards the North Sea . A decade in the making: This photograph taken in 2003 shows how the bungalow then enjoyed a decent sized garden to the cliff edge. 10 years on it had all gone through erosion . She watched in sadness as her seaside home where she had hoped to live for several more years was demolished. Mrs Nierop-Reading bought her home with idyllic views of the North Sea for £25,000 when it was 20ft from the edge in 2008. As the sea approached ever closer she was offered £53,000 under a Government compensation scheme to leave, but she refused. The end came today though after the highest surge tide for 60 years tore away huge chunks of the cliff at Happisburgh near North Walsham, Norfolk, washing away part of the property's foundations. The lean-to extension of her 1930s bungalow containing her bathroom, toilet, pantry and part of her bedroom was left hanging over the edge and at risk of toppling over at any minute. Compromise: Mrs Nierop-Reading admits she was offered more than £50,000 to leave but said she could not be without her £1million view . Huge damage: Coastal erosion has brought Bryony Nierop-Reading's cliff-top bungalow closer to the waves on Happisburgh beach 20 years earlier than expected, and has been broken up by the local council . Mrs Nierop-Reading, a former maths teacher and owner of a tractor repair business, carried away the bulk of her possessions before demolition workers moved in. She has now moved into a nearby mobile home also on the cliff-top. As she surveyed the remains of her bungalow today, she said: 'I don’t regret buying this place as I have had five years of sheer pleasure living here. All change: This was the view in 2008, where Bryony Nierop-Reading's bungalow was in the middle of this row of houses. Today it was on the edge . 'It has been like being on holiday every day of the year, waking up to a fantastic view over the sea and watching the sun rise over the water. 'Only last summer, I was string in my garden with a glass of wine and a fantastic view. I just love the way that the sea and the sky constantly change colour. It is a constantly moving landscape.' Mrs Nierop-Reading who has seven grandchildren said she did not regret losing out on a £13,000 offer of compensation after she refused to move out in 2009. She could have got an extra £40,000 by selling a planning consent which would have enabled her to build a replacement home inland as part of the compensation package. The owners of ten other homes on the clifftop all accepted the compensation offer, leaving Mrs Nierop-Reading as the only remaining resident. She said: 'People say ""You threw away £53,000"", but I just reply: ""Look at the million pound view I have had for the past five years."" 'It has been magical living on the edge of a clifftop – the sea, the skies, the gulls – and I’m just jolly grateful. I have been incredibly happy here for the last five years. 'I have loved every minute of it. I bought the house knowing that it was going to go one day and I’ve got no regrets, although I had hoped to stay a lot longer.' Mrs Nierop-Reading said she had moved out of the main bedroom of her bungalow three-weeks-ago as a precaution and started sleeping in another bedroom further away from the cliff. She decided to stay in her mobile home on the night of the surge tide because she knew her home would be in danger. Mrs Nierop-Reading said: 'When the tide came, it was absolutely terrifying. Waves were smashing into the cliff and water was spraying 20ft into the air. I had never seen anything like it. 'When I saw the damage I realised I could never go back. Friends and neighbours have helped me move out most of my things over the last few days. 'I managed to salvage almost everything of value apart from my jewellery which was left on a shelf in the bedroom which was hanging over the edge. 'I couldn’t risk going back in there to get it as it was too dangerous and now it is somewhere in the wreckage which went over the cliff. Frightening: Demolition workers were forced to come in today after it became too dangerous for its owner to be inside . Crushed: The home was flattened today after the tidal surge last Thursday, which was higher than levels recorded in the 1953 floods that devastated East Anglia . 'I just consider myself fortunate that I was able to get nearly everything out.I am luckier than the people in Walcott and Hemsby who lost everything.' Mrs Nierop-Reading who separated from her husband in 2000 added: 'It is an incredibly sad day, seeing my home demolished. I have been so busy that I have not had time to shed a tear. 'But I've said goodbye to the house and later when I'm less busy I'll find a quiet corner and howl my eyes out. Meanwhile, we're British aren't we so I'll keep a stiff upper lip.' King Canute, who ruled England between 995 and 1035, is often said to have tried to turn back the tide – but failed as the waves began lapping around his feet. But historians say this is just a myth and, in fact, the Saxon monarch was really trying to show to courtiers that despite his powers he wasn’t great enough to stop the sea. Caravans were left balancing on the edge of a cliff after the storm swept the UK. The . surge, which flooded areas of Hull, including Victoria Dock and . Ferensway, and led to mass evacuations along the coast, caused damage . expected to cost millions of pounds to repair. The owner of the . caravan, in Ulrome, near Bridlington, East Yorkshire, was not inside at . the time, but her friend Tony Pountney could scarcely believe the . carnage that confronted him when he went to check the site. Mr Pountney said: 'The weather took down a massive retaining wall at the front and damaged two or three caravans.'

Two blind friends have been told they can't go on holiday to Majorca together just two weeks before they were due to fly because they need a carer. Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told by Thomson that they must take someone with them because they won't be able to see the in-flight safety demonstration. Lauren was looking forward to the break at the the luxury C'an Picafort resort as she recovers from a gruelling 11-hour operation and prepares for her next stint in hospital. She was so excited about her holiday . that she had already bought all her holiday clothes, booked in to have . her hair done and got her Euros. Holiday ban: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, who have been told they can't go on their Thomson flight because they can't see . No go: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told by Thomson it wasn't safe for them to fly because they are blind . They booked the break in January and were due to fly from Manchester Airport to Palma on May 8 but were told last week they couldn't go. Miss Wigglesworth, of Urmston, Greater Manchester, said: 'It's just not fair. They wouldn't accept any kind of compromise. That was it. 'I'm absolutely gutted. They said we can go if we take someone sighted but that's not the point. It was my first holiday without my mother so I was really excited - no parents. 'I've already changed my money and the company gave me our tickets.' Miss Wiggleworth suffered mid-facial disfigurement in the womb because of complications with her mother's pregnancy when hormones stopped being produced. The condition, which is genetic, left Lauren blind from birth. It is so rare that it is known to affect just 23 people in the world and doesn't have a name. However, she has bravely overcome her disability and is studying psychotherapy at . Salford University. Her mother Dawn, 50, said she flagged up her daughter and Stephen's condition when she booked the £538 five-night half-board holiday. It was only when they filled out a disability form in late April that the company backtracked and said they can't go. Anger: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, who has had a series of operations, had already got her travel money and had been issued with her tickets for the holiday when she was told she wouldn't be able to go without a carer . Mrs Wigglesworth said: 'It is absolutely disgusting. They have been looking forward to this so much.' Lauren and Stephen, from Hereford, were told that they would not know how to put on a . life jacket or an oxygen mask. But . she said: 'I have spoken to other blind people who said they were shown . how to put on the life jacket and explained the plane instructions . before they even boarded. So what is it about us that means they can't?' Natalie Doig, campaigns officer for . the Royal National Institute of Blind People said that by law companies . like Thomson have to work to accommodate those who can't see. Mother's anger: Dawn, 50, said she flagged up her daughter's condition when she booked the holiday . 'While we can't comment on individual . cases, we are most concerned by Thomson's apparently negative attitude . towards their blind customers,' she said. 'Blind and partially sighted people deserve to book holidays and take flights like every other customer. 'Why should those with sight loss . miss out on their holidays, or travelling for business, simply because . companies are failing to take accessibility standards seriously? 'The law requires airlines and . holiday companies to explore alternatives when dealing with customers . who require extra assistance, and they are supposed to consider this at . the time of booking.' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said that blind passengers do not need a chaperone - although airlines can refuse to carry people if for safety reasons. 'We would always want to see airlines engaging with their passengers at the start of the booking process, so the passengers have the opportunity to let the airline know about any support they need, and the airline has the time to make the necessary arrangements. 'Blind passengers are not required by the regulation to travel with a companion. This is very much dependent on the exact nature of their needs, but the airline should work closely with them to identify what support the passenger requires. 'If passengers with reduced mobility are unhappy with the service they have received from their airline, they can refer their complaint to the CAA.' A Thomson spokesman said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of Ms Wigglesworth’s disappointment at not being able to travel to Majorca. 'Both Ms Wigglesworth and her partner completed a special assistance form, in which they stated they would need assistance to complete a number of safety related actions, such as putting on a lifejacket, on board the aircraft. 'These requirements are taken from the Department of Transport’s Code of Practice that has been confirmed by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, to which Thomson and every other UK airline must adhere. 'Unfortunately, as Ms Wigglesworth and her partner are not able to complete these without assistance, we are not able to allow them to travel unaccompanied. 'We have therefore offered Ms Wigglesworth a full refund or the option to add a passenger to her booking who could assist her and her partner on their trip.' 'Thomson takes its responsibilities with regards to our customers’ welfare seriously. Our shop staff give customers the information they need to make a decision on which hotel and destination best suits their needs.'","Lauren Wigglesworth and Stephen Sherwood told they need a carer .

A nine-months pregnant mother, raped and killed by a former doctor who met her for sex before administering a lethal heroin injection, had turned to prostitution to make ends meet, a court heard. Deanna Ballman and her unborn child, planned to be called Mabel, died after the mother answered a Craigslist ad offering $200 to sleep with Ali Salim, according to a prosecutor. Kyle Rohrer, prosecuting, said the 23-year-old was in a difficult financial situation after moving home to Ohio from Colorado, leaving her husband and trying to support two children while pregnant. Deanna Ballman, pictured, was nine-months pregnant and had turned to prostitution for extra cash . Salim, a former doctor, used Craigslist extensively to meet sexual partners, with many references in his ads to exchanging drugs for sex, including heroin, the filing said. Many of the women were young, drug-addicted prostitutes, with several alleging they were drugged against their will and others saying they were sexually assaulted, the filing said. Salim also wrote prescriptions for hard drugs for women with whom he had sexual relationships, and bought heroin that he gave women who visited his house in an upscale neighborhood. A message was left for Salim's attorney, Sam Shamansky, who previously alleged Ballman was a prostitute feeding a drug habit. Ballman, 23, died of a fatal heroin overdose, but there is no evidence she was a drug user, Rohrer said. The 23-year-old was said to be in a 'difficult financial situation' after moving home to Ohio from Colorado . She was found dead in the back seat of her car on a rural road a few miles from Salim's house the day after she met him. Rohrer is pushing for a maximum sentence of 37 years at Salim's Dec. 20 sentencing. Salim, . 44, pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter in . October; he was accused of fatally injecting Ballman with heroin. He also pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. He . entered a type of guilty plea to a charge of rape under which he . maintains his innocence but acknowledges prosecutors had enough evidence . to convict him. Happy family: Miss Ballman pictured with her two children, was about to give birth to a little girl called Mabel . Thursday's filing disputes Salim's . version of events the day Ballman died, namely his claim she was alive . when she left the house and he drove her to a nearby grocery store . parking lot where he gave her directions to get home. Salim claims he . then walked home, according to the filing. But . investigators say video evidence shows Ballman nude and unconscious on . Salim's bed, apparently suffering distress consistent with a heroin . overdose, the filing said. She . didn't leave the house alive, according to the filing, which said Salim . left to get heroin in a neighboring suburb that evening while Ballman . was still in the house. Deanna's mother Lori Ballman holds a tribute to her late daughter, at her home in Pataskala, Ohio . Salim 'furnished and administered . heroin to a young lady who was nine months pregnant, a young lady who, . by his own admission, declined even a glass of wine' according to the . filing. It notes that . Salim, an emergency room physician, neglected his duty to help Ballman. 'Without regard for mother or child, he dumped their bodies in a remote . location as if he was taking out his trash' the filing said. A . second motion Thursday asks Delaware County Judge Duncan Whitney to . allow investigators to destroy video, photo and audio evidence in the . case after it's over, saying the material is obscene and shows acts that .

A lawyer for Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin revealed further shocking details on Thursday about the bullying he suffered at the hands of teammates. Martin walked out on the Dolphins last . week after reportedly suffering a catalog of abuse, including a racist . voice mail message from fellow player Richie Incognito, who has been . suspended. Lawyer David Cornwell said in a statement that along with Incognito calling Martin a ""half-n*****' in a voicemail, another unidentified player threatened to rape Martin's sister. Scroll down for video . Richie Incognito (left) has been accused of bullying and making racist threats by former teammate Jonathan Martin (right) Part of the violent and vulgar threat, directed at Martin's sister, included the words: 'She loves me. I am going to f*** her without a condom.' Martin's lawyer did not specify to ESPN whether the words were said to Martin or if it was a voice-mail or text. He also claimed that the player had suffered a 'malicious physical attack'. The statement continues: 'Jonathan endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing. For the entire season-and-a-half that he was with the Dolphins, he attempted to befriend the same teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment. 'This is a textbook reaction of victims of bullying. Despite these efforts, the taunting continued. Beyond the well-publicized voice mail with its racial epithet, Jonathan endured a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate, and daily vulgar comments such as the quote at the bottom. These facts are not in dispute.' Mr Cornwell said that his client looks forward to returning to football and intends to cooperate with the NFL investigation. The NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith said on Thursday that he had been in touch with Dolphins' players and said that every player deserves safe and professional working conditions. Incognito, told a local TV reporter that he was 'just trying to weather the storm right now' as reports have emerged that he may have been under orders to 'toughen up' Jonathan Martin . After leaving the team last week, . Martin briefly checked himself into a South Florida hospital to be . treated for emotional distress. The . Dolphins's management arranged for his parents to travel to South . Florida from their home in California where he is now staying. His father Gus told omg! Insider: 'He's a strong man. He's doing fine.' According to one source, who did not wish to be named, Martin . had considered giving up the sport because he was mistreated by other . offensive linemen. The source added Martin, who sought counseling for emotional issues, now plans to continue playing. Incognito . was reportedly told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin when he subjected . his teammate to abusive voice mail and texts messages. It . has been revealed that after Martin missed two days of organized team . activities (OTAs) last spring, coaches encouraged Incognito, the . offensive line's undisputed leader, to 'get [Martin] into the fold'. Just . days later Incognito left a threatening, and racially offensive voicemail in which he called Martin, who is bi-racial, a ‘half n*****,’ threatened to slap his mother across the face and uttered the words . ‘I'll kill you.’ The Dolphins suspended Incognito (left) this week for misconduct related to the alleged harassment of Martin, who abruptly left the team a week ago to receive help for emotional issues . Rant: An obscenity-laced video of Richie Incognito has emerged in which he uses the N-word when greeting a teammate . Last week, . Martin's agent said the second-year player from Stanford was harassed . almost daily by teammates in his rookie year and the hazing continued . into this season. That . prompted an NFL investigation, and the Dolphins suspended Incognito, who . sources said sent Martin threatening and racist messages during the . off-season. Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed a New York lawyer with experience in sports cases to investigate the case. Dolphins' players have rallied passionately defended Incognito and insisting they . didn't see the blowup coming. Most said Martin and Incognito were . friends. 'I don't know why . he's doing this,' offensive tackle Tyson Clabo said. 'And the only . person who knows why, his name is Jonathan Martin.' Guard John Jerry said he never heard Incognito use the racist term included in one voicemail and wouldn't have objected anyway. 'I . would have just laughed it off,' Jerry said. 'I know the type of person . he is, and I know he doesn't mean it that way. Everybody's got friends . that when you're out, they say those type of things. It's never made a . big deal.' Was Incognito under orders? It isn't clear whether the instructions to 'toughen up' Martin came from head coach Joe Philbin, pictured, or another coach . The 30-year-old . Incognito was kicked off his team at Nebraska, and has long had a . reputation as one of the NFL's dirtiest players. But he has been . universally praised by his teammates this week. 'Does he like to give guys a hard time? Yes. Does he like to pester guys and have fun? Yes,' Tannehill said. 'But . he brought a lot of laughter to this locker room, he brought a lot of . cohesiveness to this locker room and he was the best teammate that I . could ask for.' For Martin, . the final straw was a lunchroom prank at the team complex, and he then . left the squad. Tannehill and Jerry said the same prank has been pulled . on many other players. Hijinks are especially common among the offensive linemen, Clabo said. 'We . have a system of basically it's just a big joke, basically,' he said. 'It helps camaraderie. It keeps things light in the room. Everyone . participates. No one is exempt and so I don't see how ... we would all . be guilty of bullying.' Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, has taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates . The 24-year-old Martin was briefly hospitalized after he left the team and is now with his family in California. Tannehill said he was shocked when Martin departed. He . added: 'The whole thing, it's kind of mind-blowing to me. It's kind of . mind-blowing to most of the guys on our team right now. 'It's tough for me, because you can't help a situation that you didn't know existed - that no one on this team knew existed. 'We . have a bunch of good guys in this locker room. To be put in a situation . where everyone's attacking the locker room saying it's such a bad . place, such a bad culture, no leadership to stand up and stop the . situation - no one knew there was a situation to be stopped.'","Jonathan Martin took a shock leave of absence from the team .

When Roald Dahl dreamed up Willy Wonka and his amazing, impossible sweets in the 1960s, he enthralled children of that generation, and in generations to come. But while anybody who read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - or saw the acclaimed 1971 film - will know the products came from a world of 'pure imagination', scientists have come close to making one Wonka-style treat a reality. Researchers at the National University of Singapore have created a 'digital lollipop', which uses electric currents to transmit virtual tastes straight to your tastebuds. Scroll down for video . Tasty? A young woman tries out the gadget, which transmits taste with electrical impulses . Magical: The creation is reminiscent of the wondrous sweets in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The 1971 film adaptation is pictured . Pure imagination: The device has attributes of the fictional Everlasting Gobstopper and Chewing Gum Meal . The device has echoes of the fictional Everlasting Gobstopper, which never runs out, and the Chewing Gum Meal, which had several different flavours packed into one piece of gum. All of the four major taste groups - sweet, salty, bitter and sour - can be mimicked through a silver electrode which makes contact with the tongue. The gadget also makes tiny adjustments in temperature to simulate tastes more convincingly. Nimesha Ranasinghe, who led the research, told the New Scientist magazine: 'We have found noninvasive electrical and thermal stimulation of the tip of the tongue successfully generates the primary taste sensations'. The invention is relatively crude at the moment, but there are hopes to make it small enough that users can almost wholly close their mouth while using it. Sensational: Another tester uses the device, which can also mimic changes in temperature for a more authentic taste . Control panel: The invention can mimic sweet, sour, bitter and salty flavours . There are also plans to make the simulation more precise by simulating the smell and texture of real food, which are important parts of how we taste. Although at the moment the invention is little more than a novelty experience, Ms Ranasinghe says the lollipop could one day have medical uses. She said: 'People with diabetes might be able to use the taste synthesiser to simulate sweet sensations without harming their actual blood sugar levels. Cancer patients could use it to improve or regenerate a diminished sense of taste during chemotherapy.' The same team is also in the early stages of developing a way to transmit tastes from one device to another, in the hope that one day people will be able to 'taste message' as easily as email or text.","'Digital lollipop' device can transmit flavours electronically .

House prices are increasing at almost ten times the pace of average earnings, sparking fears of a new housing bubble. Average prices continued their upward march in November, rising by 7.7 per cent in the three months to November compared to the previous year - the highest since October 2007. The figures reveal a surge in demand, as Business Secretary Vince Cable warned there is ‘clearly still a danger of house prices getting out of control’. Rocketing: Annual house price inflation has soared over the past year, Halifax's figures show, 12 months ago prices were falling. The latest Halifax House Price index shows the average price hit £174,910 after prices rose by 1.1 per . cent in one month alone - adding £1,950 to property values.. The latest rise marks the tenth monthly increase in a row, although the typical price is still 12 per cent below its 2007 peak, the latest housing market study said. It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility admitted that government support was driving property prices higher and raised its forecast in Thursday's Autumn Statement. It now believes house prices will rise by 10 per cent more than originally expected by 2018. It sees inflation hitting 5 per cent in . 2013, peaking at 7.2 per cent in 2015, and then slipping back below 5 . per cent the next year before settling at just under 4 per cent in 2017 . and 2018. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable said there was ‘clearly still a danger of house prices getting out of control’, and cast doubts on parts of the Chancellor’s flagship ‘Help to Buy’ scheme, which helps people with small deposits get mortgages on houses worth up to £600,000. ‘It’s very difficult for people on middle incomes to get into the housing market without the bank of mum and dad. And the danger is if you fuel demand, then prices are driven up even more,’ Mr Cable said. ‘The key is to build more houses . We are beginning to see a big upsurge in construction - both social and private housing and that’s very good - but we need an awful lot more. On the up: The OBR has changed its predictions for house price rises, with a peak of 7.2% in 2015. Housing economist Martin Ellis said that low interest rates, improvements in consumer confidence and government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy have boosted demand. ‘However, continuing pressures on household finances, as earnings fail to keep pacewith consumer price inflation, are expected to remain a constraint on the rate of growth of house prices,’ he warned. Mr Ellis added that there are signs of a revival in housebuilding, which is likely to curb upward pressure on prices over the medium and long term. Private sector housing starts in England rose by ten per cent between the second and third quarter of 2013 to 26,380 – the highest level since 2008 and 28 per cent higher than in 2012. A new phase of the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme was launched in October to give more people with low deposits a helping hand on to or up the housing ladder. The scheme offers state-backed loans to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent. The Bank of England has said that it is not worried about a new housing bubble emerging, but is keeping a close eye on the property market. It moved last week, however, to shift the support away from the housing market that it has been offering by pumping cheap money through lenders to homebuyers. The Funding for Lending scheme which has been sent mortgage rates diving by about 1 per cent and lifted mortgage availability is being targeted away from homeowners to help small businesses. Lenders will not be able to get more funds from the scheme by increasing mortgage lending, although plenty of cheap cash remains in the initial pot they were given. The number of mortgages on the market has increased by around 40 per cent since Funding for Lending was launched last year. It allows banks and building societies to borrow at a rate as low as 0.75 per cent from the Bank. On Thursday, the Government announced . plans for overseas property investors to have to pay the so-called . ‘oligarch tax’ when they sell UK properties under plans to cool London's . overheated housing market. Crucially, however, it will not kick in until 2015 and only gains after that point will be taxed. Strong . house price increases in central London have been put down to . wealthy foreign investors looking for a safe haven to place their cash. High inflation has also filtered out to wider London and the commuter belt, with agents reporting brisk business, and boom time tactics, such as sealed bids. How the have changed: House prices have leaped in the past year, the Halifax House Price Index shows . Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, forecast that the rise in prices is far from over. 'House prices look set to see further strong increases over the coming months despite the Bank of England ending Funding for Lending support for mortgage lending, and they could very well see another marked rise in December and then increase by around 8 per cent in 2014,' he said. 'While these projected house price rises are expected to be driven by increases in London (especially) and parts of the South East, house prices are likely to strengthen appreciably in most regions and to make gains across the country. 'While the strength of house price rises in London is becoming an increasing concern and pushing up the overall national increase in house prices, we are currently some way off from an overall housing market bubble emerging.'","Average price hits £174,910 - up from £171,991 in just one month .

Expectations of continued rises in house prices hit a 14-year high in November, with almost two-thirds of surveyors predicting the value of homes will increase as demand outstrips supply. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said on Tuesday that 59 per cent of surveyors forecast prices would rise over the next three months, the highest reading since September 1999. A record level of surveyors also predicted sales will pick up in the coming months. However, Rics warned that without a 'meaningful increase' in the supply of homes, both house prices and rents will become more unaffordable. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said 59 per cent of surveyors forecast price rises over the next three months . It said the reading for the number of surveyors predicting price rises rather than falls is the highest since September 1999 and demonstrates the impact that the recovery is having on an 'anaemic supply' of properties for sale in the housing market. In what Rics said is a 'sharp' pick-up, a balance of 58 per cent more surveyors also reported already seeing house price growth last month. For the second month in a row, each region of the UK saw prices rise. House sales have also lifted strongly compared with a year ago. An average of just over 20 homes per surveyor were sold in the three months to November, compared with around 15 during the same period last year. The housing market has been showing strong signs of recovery throughout 2013 following a string of Government schemes such as Help to Buy and Funding for Lending which have widened mortgage availability and fuelled demand from buyers. A new phase of the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme was launched in October to give more people with low deposits a helping hand on to or up the housing ladder. The institution warned that without a 'meaningful increase' in the supply of homes then rents and prices would become more unaffordable . The scheme offers state-backed loans to . people with deposits as low as 5 per cent and lenders representing . around two-thirds of the mortgage market have confirmed they will take . part. But experts have said that stronger efforts must also be made to increase the number of homes on the market, with the mismatch between supply and demand putting an upward pressure on prices. Last week, Halifax reported that house prices rose by 7.7 per cent in November, marking the highest increase seen in six years. In his Autumn Statement last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced £1billion of loans to unblock large housing developments, including in Manchester and Leeds, and raising a borrowing limit for councils to fund new homes. Halifax reported that house prices rose by 7.7 per cent in November, marking the highest increase seen in six years . But housing charity Shelter called for 'bolder ideas' for more affordable homes to be built. Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist, said: 'It's no secret that the housing market is on the way up and prices are surging ahead in many parts of the country.' He continued: 'As the Chancellor pointed out last week, housebuilding is on the up, but it is rising nowhere near quickly enough to make up the shortfall that has built up in recent years. 'If there is not a meaningful increase in new homes, the likelihood is that prices, and for that matter rents, will continue to push upwards, making the cost of shelter ever more unaffordable.' The Funding for Lending scheme which has been credited with boosting mortgage availability generally is being re-directed away from households to help small businesses. The number of mortgages on the market has increased by around 40 per cent since Funding for Lending was launched last year. Mr Osborne also announced last week that non-UK residents will have to pay capital gains tax (CGT) on property sales from April 2015. This is expected to take some of the heat out of the London housing market as strong house price growth in the English capital has been put down in part to overseas investors looking for a safe haven to place their cash.","59 per cent of surveyors forecast price rises in the next three months .

A 94-yard village street with just 16 semi-detached homes has residents fuming after they counted 80 potholes. They will have to endure the bumps through winter as there is no money left to repair Rothbury Avenue, South Tyneside - and there is no guarantee it will be done next year either. Driven potty: Winter has only just begun but residents of bumpy Rothbury Avenue in Monkton Village, South Tyneside, have counted 80 potholes. There is no money left to fix them until at least next spring . Appalling: How one resident described the road, claiming it was the worst in Britain - is yours even worse? Funding gap: Labour South Tyneside Council says it will not prioritise the street because it is a minor road . Frederick Lazenby, 80, has launched a petition calling on South Tyneside Council to fix Rothbury Avenue, in Monkton Village. He said: 'It's in a terrible state. It has been like this since I moved in 30 years ago. It has just got worse and worse. 'There . are a lot of old people in the street and those in wheelchairs are . having difficulty getting across the road. Those driving cars are . finding the road terrible as well. 'They are trying to dodge them but you can't anymore - there are that many of them. 'It is definitely worse than any other street in Britain that I know of.' Resident Frederick Lazenby, 80, said: 'Those in wheelchairs are having difficulty getting across the road' Residents of the street's 16 houses have threatened to sue the council if their cars are damaged by the bumps . A Nightmare on Rothbury Avenue: The street in Monkton Village, South Tyneside, is just 94 yards long . South Tyneside Council says repairing the road will cost £5,157, a price it cannot afford - because its road repairs budget has already dried up. Executive director Mike Conlon said: 'The council's current mainstream road resurfacing budget is fully committed for the current year. Councils across England and Wales have united to claim potholes will hit 'crisis point' this winter. They begged the government for more cash, saying years of spending cuts meant projects already 'on the back burner' were being delayed further and further. Transport chairman for the Local Government Association, Cllr Peter Box, blamed 'decades of underfunding by Whitehall'. He said in March: 'We're now facing a bill of £10.5 billion to bring our roads up to scratch. Unless something changes we risk swathes of Britain's road network becoming dangerously strewn with potholes, particularly if flooding and severe winters become more common.' Potholes appear over winter when water repeatedly freezes and thaws inside cracks in the road surface, opening them wider. Most councils use instant 'emergency repairs' to fix danger potholes, but these have to be followed up with a permanent, more expensive fix which many authorities say they are struggling to afford. 'Rothbury Avenue will be considered for resurfacing during the next financial year commencing in April 2014. 'It . should be noted, however, that there is no guarantee that funding will . be available. The street is a quiet cul-de-sac and major roads and bus . routes will take priority.' He added there had already been 'extensive' pothole repairs carried out in recent years . to keep the road safe. Resident Brenda Melia, 67, said: 'I am disgusted at the decision. There is another winter ahead . and it is only going to get worse. 'It . is going to cost the council more in the long-term. If my car is . damaged when reversing I'll be claiming off them, that's for sure.' Her husband Dennis, 69, added: 'The . council keeps going on about Monkton Village being Jarrow's jewel in the . crown and yet they are allowing the road outside our homes to get into . this state. It is damaging the look of the area. 'What . would happen if I had to put my house up for sale and a prospective . buyer came and saw the state of road? There's no way I could sell it at . its true value.' Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'I think it is very dangerous. In this street 80 to 85 per cent of residents are old aged pensioners. I am 80 years old and my wife is 79. 'There is a lady in a wheelchair who has to travel up the street to find a safer part of the road to cross. The whole surface of the road is falling to pieces.' 'I am appalled by the state of it. If it was Councillors' Row it would be done immediately. It is only going to get worse when the bad weather comes.'

Callum Wilson died of brain damage after his mother Emma battered him, fracturing nine of his ribs, his arm and leg . A mother who took a selfie with the battered body of the 11-month-old son she had beaten, causing him to suffer brain damage which later caused his death, is today facing prison. Emma Wilson repeatedly hit baby Callum so violently her neighbour's ceiling shook. She then blamed the attack on his two-year-old brother, the Old Bailey heard. Callum was rushed to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with 'catastrophic injuries' on March 20, 2011. A post mortem revealed the 11-month-old had suffered fatal brain damage. During the attack Callum suffered nine fractured ribs, a broken leg and arm. After inflicting the injuries, Wilson posed next to her crying son, grinning as she took a selfie. The photographs revealed severe bruising to his face and another showed the 11-month-old moving away from a young boy wielding a pair of open secateurs. But in a bid to offer an explanation Wilson blamed the attack on her other child, claiming Callum's 'boisterous' and 'rough' two-year-old brother was to blame. She said he was jealous of his younger sibling. In a gruesome twist, the 25-year-old, who had told people Callum was her cousin's son, buried his battered body in an unmarked communal grave. A jury at the Old Bailey took 10 hours to find Wilson guilty of murder by a unanimous verdict. During the trial jurors heard how Wilson left her new-born son in Wexham Park Hospital after he was born on April 23, 2010. She then kept his existence a secret for seven months, while he was in foster care. She claimed she had put her son up for adoption because her boyfriend at the time, Neil Richardson, 'thought she couldn't cope with two children'. Emma Wilson, 25, took a selfie, grinning next to the injured body of her crying son. Neighbours told how their ceiling shook as they heard repeated bangs the day before Wilson dialled 999 reporting her son lifeless . Wilson, left, arrives at the Old Bailey today. A jury spent 10 hours deliberating before returning a unanimous guilty verdict . In November 2010 Wilson took Callum out of foster care and brought him to live in her council flat in Windsor. She continued to lie about Callum in the months after he came to live with her and Wilson told her nursery he was ‘Callum Keeler’, her cousin’s son. Neighbours described hearing five or six loud bangs that caused the ceiling to shake above their living room the night before paramedics were called to Wilson’s home in Windsor. In cross examination prosecutor Paul Dunkels QC said: ‘It couldn’t have been your eldest child, climbing up the furniture and jumping off. ‘Their evidence was they [the bangs] were seconds apart. ‘He wouldn’t have been able to get up, jump off it and climb up it again.’ The next morning Wilson had told an emergency operator the child was ‘lifeless and not doing anything'. Callum was rushed to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford on March 20, 2011 with 'catastrophic' injuries. A post mortem revealed he died of brain damage . The recording reveals Wilson said: ‘I just got him out the cot. He was fine when he went to bed. He’s lifeless and not doing anything. He’s making noises but I don’t know.’ Callum had obvious bruising to his face and later examination revealed he had suffered severe brain damage and fractures to nine ribs, left leg and his right arm. The jury were shown computer-generated images of the injuries, some of which Wilson tried to blame on her efforts to revive her son. ‘I was holding him really tight because his head was very heavy’, she told the court. ‘Well, I was panicking, he wasn’t holding his head.’ She added that when she tried to check her son's airway she tore his lip. She claimed she never hurt her son and said: ‘It’s the best thing in the world being a mum.’ But Mr Dunkels said that Wilson had been unable to put forward a ‘plausible explanation’ for the injuries. ‘Callum was in her sole care at her flat throughout that 13-hour period and nothing she has said can explain what has happened to him. ‘The effect of the injuries would have been immediate and catastrophic.’ Wilson was accused of killing her child because she knew her partner at the time, Neil Richardson, was not the father, according to her defence barrister Michael Turner QC. Mr Turner added: ‘Emma Wilson chose to bury Callum in a communal grave without a headstone.’ Wilson denied murder. She will be sentenced on January 24.","Jury find Emma Wilson guilty of murdering 11-month-old Callum .

Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes is at the centre of another row after claiming that only those with an ‘expensive education’, like the one he had, are able to understand William Shakespeare plays. He made the comment in response to criticisms by Shakespeare scholars over the rewriting of dialogue in his recently released screen version of Romeo And Juliet, starring Hailee Steinfeld, Douglas Booth and Damian Lewis. Caitlin Griffin, from the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC - home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare materials - was sceptical about Fellowes' approach. Controversy: Julian Fellowes (left) has claimed that only those with an expensive education can properly understand the works of William Shakespeare (right) She told The Daily Telegraph: ‘Fellowes’ adaptation, while poetic and set in the period of Shakespeare’s play, is . not using Shakespeare’s language. The advertising hasn’t been very . clear on this fact.’ And Professor Michael Dobson, the director of the University of Birmingham's Shakespeare Institute in Stratford, told the paper: ‘I think it is interesting that there is a trend at the moment to replace some of the bits of difficult vocabulary in Shakespeare to make it clearer, and that is clearly what Fellowes has done with this script - though some of it sounds a little bit clunky in the trailer.’ But Fellowes dismissed the comments, claiming that the language had to be dumbed down, as only those who’ve attended elite universities are capable of engaging with Shakespeare’s works. He told the BBC: ‘To see the original in its absolutely unchanged form, you require a kind of Shakespearian scholarship and you need to understand the language and analyse it and so on. ‘I can do that because I had a very expensive education, I went to Cambridge. Not everyone did that.’ However, Royal Shakespeare Company actress Janet Suzman told The Guardian that ‘you don’t need to have an education to respond to it’ and that ‘if talented actors understand what they’re doing and can communicate that, then that’s all you need’. Professor Stanley Wells, author of Shakespeare, Sex, And Love and Honorary President of The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, echoed these thoughts. 'Not all education has to be expensive. I know excellent Shakespearians who went to comprehensive schools' - Professor Stanley Wells, President of The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust . He told MailOnline: 'Not all education has to be expensive - I know excellent Shakespearians who went to comprehensive schools. 'Shakespeare's language runs the gamut from passages of considerable intellectual complexity as for instance in some of the speeches of Troilus and Cressida to others of sublime simplicity, such as the reunion of Lear and Cordelia. 'One of the advantages of seeing and hearing Shakespeare well acted is that the actors have done some of the work of comprehension for you, so that the listener may understand the feeling behind the lines without necessarily being able to paraphrase them. 'But nothing will come of nothing (as Lear says.) It's not unreasonable to hope that people - young or old - should make an effort to educate themselves into a state where they can understand and enjoy some of the greatest works ever written.' Penelope Middleboe, CEO of Shakespeare Schools Festival, which is giving 25,000 students across the UK the chance to perform Shakespeare in their local theatre, also disagreed with Fellowes' assertion, arguing that children from all walks of life are able to enjoy his plays. She said: 'When children are given the opportunity to frame Shakespeare in their own terms, the magic begins. We call it CSI Shakespeare – to challenge, support and inspire every child through performing Shakespeare’s work. Any child, whatever their background, and regardless of any learning, physical or cultural challenge they may be facing, can grasp the Bard’s great words and make them their own.' Douglas Booth and Hailee Steinfeld star in Romeo And Juliet . Mr Fellowes’ remarks follow controversy over a rape scene in Downton Abbey that attracted more than 200 complaints. He defended the scene, saying the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic. He told the BBC: 'The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously. We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people.’","Fellowes made the remark after criticism of his version of Romeo And Juliet .

Tragedy: An inquest has been launched into the passing of Shayla Walmsley, 44, examining whether her death could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump . The catchphrase ‘In better control .  .  .’ appears again and again on the Medtronic website. It  is the pharmaceutical company’s clever marketing strategy to promote their insulin pumps – medical devices often thought of as a foolproof alternative to the daily injections of lifesaving drugs needed by diabetics. Yet last week, an inquest was launched into the death in her  sleep of financial journalist Shayla Walmsley, 44, with the family’s legal team examining whether it could have been caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump. A year before, a 26-year-old woman, known only as Ffion as she wishes  to remain anonymous, claims to have suffered a massive overdose after her pump released a large amount of the drug insulin into her bloodstream. She spent two days on a life support machine and lay in an induced coma for a further two days, but has since recovered fully. In . May, a week after Shayla’s  body was found, the Medicine and Healthcare . Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) watchdog sent out a warning regarding . the device after the manufacturer discovered some to be faulty. Problems . identified included mechanical faults that could result in too much . insulin being released – a potentially life-threatening overdose – by . accident. Medtronic, . who make the MiniMed Paradigm pumps, one of the most popular brands – . models of which were used by both women – say their products were not at . fault in Ffion’s case. They tested her pump and found it to be fully . functional. Human error is a known cause of overdose with all methods of . taking insulin. The cause . of Shayla’s death is yet to be determined by the coroner. But lawyer . Mark Harvey, who is representing both the Walmsley family and Ffion, . says known problems may predate these incidents. On . April 2 this year, Medtronic sent an ‘urgent recall’ letter to all . Australian users of MiniMed Paradigm pumps, warning them that . malfunctions with the device might lead to overdose. In July, US regulators the Food and . Drug Administration (FDA) followed suit after Medtronic admitted similar . faults with the devices there. ‘Severe illness’ resulting  from . overdose was highlighted as a potential risk. Under investigation: Shayla was using a programmable insulin pump administering it continuously through a catheter into her body . Warnings . are usually triggered when doctors or, more rarely, patients report . back to manufacturers, or directly to the relevant regulators, that they . are having problems with a device. Harvey . is concerned by the delay in issuing a UK warning and the fact that it . was not an urgent recall as had happened in Australia a month before. ‘We are worried that British patients may still not be aware of serious . issues with these devices.’ People . with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin of their own, . which is a problem because insulin controls the body’s absorption of . sugars, or glucose. This  leads to dangerously high levels in the blood. Synthetic insulin is taken to control this problem. Insulin pumps are portable devices, about the size of a pack of cards, which stay connected to the body and deliver insulin from a reservoir via a cannula (tube) placed under the skin. They are programmable, allowing the user to modify the amount of drug they receive at any given time, which could be while sleeping. There are currently about three million diabetics in Britain, with ten per cent of those diagnosed with the type 1 form. In type 2 diabetes, the most common form, the condition is often controllable – and even reversible – with diet and tablets. For those with type 1, injections of insulin are the only treatment option. Typically, one daily injection provides a slow-acting background level of insulin, with additional fast-acting doses given with a separate injection ‘pen’ before or after eating or drinking. Before: A traditional insulin pen . The major problem with the treatment is the risk of hypoglycaemia (very low blood-sugar levels) if too much of the drug is taken. Often called ‘a hypo’, typically patients experience shakes, sweating, hunger, palpitations and mood swings due  to not enough glucose being available for use by cells throughout  the body. This is unpleasant but can usually be corrected by consuming a high-sugar food, such as a glucose tablet, fruit juice or sweets. But if blood-sugar drops for a longer period or sharply, patients can lose consciousness. This is considered a medical emergency, as the condition can be fatal. Just a few too many units of insulin given at any one time can be enough to trigger an episode. Insulin pumps eliminate the need for multiple jabs and, according  to studies put forward by manufacturers, also reduce the likelihood of hypos. Children – who may forget or misjudge amounts to inject – as well  as those who are very active or lead erratic lives, meaning they miss meals, and those with extremely difficult-to-control diabetes are usually considered candidates for  a pump. According to diabetes.co.uk, six per cent of adults and 19 per cent  of children with type 1 diabetes  use one. However, they are not foolproof. The FDA has reported 17,000 cases of health problems linked to insulin pumps made by manufacturers including Medtronic, MiniMed, Roche and Johnson & Johnson, all of which distribute in the UK. In some cases human error is to blame, but just how many incidents are related to mechanical faults is unclear. Ffion suffered an overdose of insulin in May 2012 after her pump released insulin into her bloodstream while she slept. She suffered convulsions which woke her boyfriend, who called an ambulance. Ffion initially sent her pump back to Medtronic for analysis. They wrote to her in April this year claiming there were ‘no anomalies’ with the device. She says: ‘Essentially, this implied it was my fault, not theirs. It made me very, very angry. If I had been sleeping alone, I wouldn’t be here now.’ Harvey, a partner at Hugh James solicitors, adds: ‘Their letter to Ffion fails to flag up the known problems in other countries. It was only after our own investigations that these malfunctions came to light. It seems strange that they did not mention the Australian urgent recall that happened in the same month.’ A spokesman for Medtronic said: ‘Patient safety is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring  high-quality standards of manufactured products to support them in their daily diabetes management. ‘Every day hundreds of thousands of customers use the Paradigm system in order to seek better control in their diabetes management. ‘We have not been contacted by any investigating authority or had the opportunity to examine the insulin pump Ms Walmsley used. Due to this and to patient confidentiality, we are unable to comment on the circumstances that led to Ms Walmsley’s death.’ A spokesman for the MHRA  said: ‘Our priority is to ensure that patients have acceptably safe  medical devices and we take prompt action to address any safety or performance concerns.’ Shayla’s older brother Stephen Walmsley is not reassured. He says: ‘If Shayla’s death was caused by a failing pump, the manufacturers need to take them off the market  to ensure no other family ever  has to go through the pain and misery that we are suffering.’","Shayla Walmsley, 44, is suspected to have died from an insulin overdose .

Four motorists had been standing at the on ramp's edge when a car span out as it sped past and slammed into one of their parked vehicles, knocking them down like skittles. Scroll down for video . Stark warning: These screen grabs show scenes from the CCTV footage of a shocking crash in which four pedestrians were knocked down like skittles by a parked vehicle after another car span into it on a highway .

To reinforce the message the Milwaukee Sheriff's Office and Highway patrol have released a shocking video of the incident on Tuesday, which left two people in hospital. Two others suffered minor cuts and bruises in the smash and a fifth, who remained inside the van, was unhurt. Wisconsin state trooper Robert Simpson told CBS 58 News that the safest thing to do in the event of a crash on the highway is to stay inside your vehicle. He said: 'You want to stay in your car, call 911 - call as many times as you want - until you see law enforcement there.' 'Wait': Wisconsin state trooper Robert Simpson said that the safest thing to do in the event of a crash on the highway is to stay inside your vehicle . He added: 'If you are going to leave your vehicle we advise against it unless the car's on fire. [But] if you're going to leave your vehicle get off the road and go up to the top of the hill.' The crash highlighted by Wisconsin police was the result a series of chain reaction crashes involving four vehicles that occurred on the west-to-north ramp (I-94 EB to I-45 NB) in the Zoo Interchange, Fox 6 Milwaukee reported. The first crash happened when the driver of a tan Ford lost control, hit the median and span out until it came to rest facing the wrong way, witnesses told the broadcaster. Sheriff's officials said that a red van then attempted to avoid the Ford by quickly switching lanes, but collided with a white utility truck as it did so, a smash which pushed it into the first crashed vehicle. At this stage there were no injuries and all three vehicles were able to move on to the hard shoulder, where four occupants got out and stood on the adjacent verge to assess the damage and wait for police. That's when the fourth vehicle came speeding up the ramp and lost control, slamming into the parked van which struck the pedestrians before coming to a stop across lanes two and three. Two people were taken for treatment at Froedtert Hospital.","Stark warning from Wisconsin police after pedestrians run over on Tuesday .

Doctors are encouraging people to draw up living wills saying if they want food and fluids withdrawn in the case that they become seriously brain damaged . Doctors are urging people to draw up living wills saying they want food and fluids withdrawn if they become seriously brain damaged. New guidelines encourage people to document their wishes in advance of a devastating injury that leaves them in a coma or vegetative state. Such advance directives help determine what happens when doctors or the family believe withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment is in the best interests of the patient. In any case, where food and drink is to be withdrawn, a decision must be made by a judge of the Court of Protection. But patients who have clearly expressed in advance their wishes to refuse treatment are likely to have the application upheld. A model planning document for Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment is included in new guidelines from the Royal College of Physicians. The guidelines, which are also intended for families, set out how doctors diagnose and treat prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC), which include coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). An estimated 10,000 patients a year with PDOC are being cared for in hospitals, care homes or in their own homes. At present just three per cent of the general public has indicated their wishes in advance using a planning document, compared with 30 per cent of those who have gone through the experience with a family member. Professor Jenny Kitzinger, co-director of the Cardiff-York Chronic Disorders of Consciousness Research Centre, who helped draw up the guidelines, said it was vital for people to consider what they want if they suffered a catastrophic brain injury – to help other family members carry out their wishes. She interviewed more than 50 families who had a loved one in a vegetative state. They included one family where the patient had made a formal advance decision to refuse treatment which they described as ‘very precious’, while others said the patient would ‘want life at any cost’. She said: ‘It’s no use people saying to their families ""if ever I’m a vegetable, switch me off"". That’s not a legally binding instruction. ‘None of us ever think this is going to happen to us so few of us ever make advance decisions to refuse treatment. ‘Around . three per cent of the general population do so but it’s 10 times higher . – 30 per cent – among those who had personal experience of a terrible . dilemma. The decision to withdraw nutrition from a person has to be made by a judge but is more likely to be permitted if the person has previously stated that this is what they want to happen . ‘People should think of an advance decision, formally witnessed, as a gift to those who might be faced with this situation.’ The guidelines put the onus on NHS trusts for the first time to initiate and pay for applications to the Court of Protection for withdrawal of treatment. Previously it was a grey area, with hospitals sometimes taking the lead, or a family member who felt strongly and had the resources. The court costs can run into ‘thousands of pounds’, say the guidelines, which stress that family members should be involved in meetings held by doctors and other professionals to decide the best interests of the patient. However, if a family does not want to apply for a court judgement, the consensus of the meeting would take precedence. Writing a 'living will' helps doctors and family members decide what to do in the case of an accident . Similarly, the family may apply for permission to withdraw treatment against the views of doctors with the court making the ultimate decision. Simon Chapman, Director of Public and Parliamentary Engagement at the National Council for Palliative Care, said: ‘The overwhelming majority of us are still failing to tell anybody our wishes about the type of care and support we would want if we couldn’t make decisions ourselves, with just one in twenty of us having made any sort of written statement about this. ‘The result is that, when it comes to making decisions about the care and best interests of people with prolonged disorders of consciousness, those closest to them will have a key role to play at a time which is inevitably exceptionally upsetting and stressful. ‘The guidelines are therefore absolutely right to emphasise the importance not only of listening to and involving the friends and families of people with prolonged disorders of consciousness, but also of providing appropriate information and support to them on an ongoing basis, so that they are not left carrying unnecessary burdens of responsibility.’ The guidelines provide a question and answer section to help doctors discuss withdrawing food and drink from patients, which leads to the body shutting down and people ultimately dying of organ failure caused by dehydration. This process can take two or three weeks, which can be very distressing for families, especially as patients sometimes show reflexes including increased movement, sweating or groaning that are not signs of consciousness. Prolonged disorders of consciousness are usually caused by a sudden brain injury, though they can also occur in later stages of dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. They are defined as lasting more than four weeks. The guidance sets out the criteria for diagnosing a coma, which includes the patient not responding to painful stimuli, light or sound, and lacking a normal sleep-wake cycle. At present just three per cent of the public has indicated their wishes in advance using a planning document, compared with 30 per cent of those who have gone through the experience with a family member . Patients in a vegetative state are said to be in a state of wakefulness but with a ‘complete absence of behavioural evidence for self or environmental awareness’. Meanwhile, those in a minimally conscious state show signs of self or environmental awareness. They show inconsistent responses which indicate some degree of interaction with their surroundings. The guidelines also recommend a new national registry for patients - at present there are no official figures on the number of patients with disorders of consciousness in England and Wales. Professor Lynne Turner-Stokes, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at Northwick Park Hospital in London, said: ‘The guidelines address some highly emotive and topical areas in which there is currently a dearth of formal research-based evidence to guide practice. ‘In this rapidly-changing field the recommendations are likely to need updating as new evidence emerges and as international consensus develops. ‘In the meantime, we have aimed to provide a practical and useful source of advice for clinicians who work with this complex group of patients.’","New guidelines from the Royal College of Physicians encourage people to .

The husband and father of two victims killed in a deadly June drunk driving accident isn't happy with the light probation sentence handed down to the 16-year-old behind the wheel. Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas faced 20 years in prison for killing four and seriously injuring two other but got off with just 10 years probation when the judge bought the defense that he suffered from 'affluenza'. They argued that his wealthy upbringing kept him from understanding the link between behavior and consequence. Eric Boyles, who lost his wife Hollie and 21-year-old daughter Shelby in the accident,  spoke with Fox's Martha MacCallum yesterday, saying he is dissatisfied with the easy sentence, and thinks Couch should have been tried as an adult. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Eric Boyles, the father and husband of two women killed in a June drunk driving accident, isn't pleased that the teen driver got off with just a 10 year probation sentence . No jail: Ethan Couch of Keller, Texas, pictured left on Tuesday, had faced 20 years behind bars but walked away with 10 years probation, something that has angering his victim's families . Since he was tried as a juvenile, Couch faced a maximum of 20 years in prison but would have been eligible for parole after 2 years. 'You look at 180 years of future life taken from the four individuals...Even a two year deal, a two year sentence before he's eligible for parole, didn't seem exactly fair under those circumstances,' Mr Boyle said. Additionally upsetting to Mr Boyle is the fact that Couch will receive his counseling at a 'country club'-style treatment center in ritzy Newport Beach, California. Mr Boyle was more emotional on Tuesday, the day the sentence was handed down. 'Money always seems to keep (Couch) out of trouble,' he told the Star Telegram. 'Ultimately today, I felt that money did prevail. If (he) had been any other youth, I feel like the circumstances would have been different.' At around 11:45om on June 15, Couch and a group his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford F350 pick-up and were speeding 70 mph in a 40 mph zone when the truck left the road. Drunk: Couch's blood alcohol reading was .24 and he also had a Valium in his system when he killed four people and injured several more on June 15 . Mad: Victim Breanna Mitchell's mother Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced Alex Lumas, whose brother was paralyzed in the accident outside of court . As it careered out of control, it clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact. It was revealed soon after that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that he was also on the perscription drug Valium when the started the chain reaction of crashes. The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported. Jennings, a Burleson youth minister, had stopped to help Mitchell, whose vehicle had a flat tire, and Boyles and her daughter had come out of their nearby house to assist. The SUV and all four victims were standing off the roadway. The red pickup then hit Mr Jennings' parked Silverado pickup with two boys inside. Couch's red pickup flew up into the air, flipped and crashed into a tree. None of the teens in the red truck were wearing seat belts, investigators said. They had earlier stolen a couple of cases of beer from a Walmart in Burleson about an hour before the crash and prior to that, they had tried unsuccessfully to buy alcohol at a convenience store. Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash . Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup . A psychologist called by the defense, Dr Gary Miller, blamed the teen's behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including 'freedoms no young person should have'. Dr Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences. He added that the boy had an 'intellectual age' of 18 but an 'emotional age' of 12. 'The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone,' Dr Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you sent him money.' State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense. She told the teen that he is responsible for what happened, but she said she didn't believe he would receive the therapy he needed in jail. If he violates the terms of his probation, he could be sent to prison for 10 years. Defense attorneys asked that he be sent to a private rehabilitation home near Newport Beach, California, which costs an enormous $450,000 a year. His father said he'd foot the bill. Killed: Brian Jennings, 41, was parked on the side of the road when Ethan Couch's pickup truck drove into him and three others . Scene: 911 callers described cars everywhere and kids' lying in ditches' after the June 15 smash . Injured: Sergio Molina remains in a coma whilst Soliman Mohmand, right, was seriously injured. They were both riding in Couch's truck when the cash occured . Prosecutors said the juvenile justice system also offered counseling. Breanna's mother, Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced the families of the other victims outside of the courtroom. 'He'll be feeling the hand of God, definitely,' she told WFAA.com. 'He may think he got away with something, but he hasn't gotten away with anything.' Alex Lumas, whose brother was paralyzed in the accident, was also in disbelief at the probation. 'To me, it's not right,' he said. However, the widow of one of the victims looked at the defendant in the courtroom and said, 'Ethan, we forgive you,' which caused Couch to swallowed hard and tear up a bit. Couch's family did not comment on the sentence and the teen wasn't allowed to go home with his parents. He will remain at a detention center until Boyd decides whether he can go to the plush California facility. Tragic: Jennings, pictured second from left, was a father of three and a youth minister in Burleson . Crash: One of four vehicles involved in the crash was sent flying into a tree . Soliman Mohmand and Sergio Molina were seriously injured and remains in a coma with a traumatic brain injury. His medical bills have exceeded $600,000 and could climb into the millions if Mr Molina needs permanent round-the-clock care. His parents are now suing Couch and his family for up to $20 million in a separate lawsuit. The Silverado was pushed into a Volkswagen Beetle, which was being driven by Ashlyn Evans, 18. She and her 14-year-old passenger were also injured. June's car crash wasn't the first time underage drinking had got Couch in trouble. In February of this year, in the town Lakeside, northwest of Fort Worth, police found Couch with a 12-ounce can of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of vodka in the early hours and gave him two citations - one for being a minor in possession of alcohol, the other for consuming alcohol as a minor.","Ethan Couch, 16, of Keller, Texas, had faced 20 years behind bars but walked away with 10 years probation Tuesday .

The millionaire husband of former Congresswoman and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris - who became known for the disputed presidential recount in 2000 - has committed suicide. Anders Ebbeson, 68, was found dead at the couple's waterfront mansion in Sarasota on Tuesday morning after battling health problems for years, the couple's pastor said. Police were called the scene of the couple's house on Bay Point Drive around 7.30am. They have not revealed how the Swedish businessman took his life. 'On behalf of the family, Katherine's husband took his own life,' Pastor William Hild told the Sarasota Herald Tribune. 'They are asking for privacy, prayer, thoughts and love from the community.' Tragic: Police in Sarasota said Anders Ebbeson, the husband of former Congresswoman Katherine Harris (both pictured), took his life on Tuesday morning. Friends said he had been battling health issues . Hild added that Ebbeson, a Swedish businessman, 'has been suffering health . conditions that he'd been attempting to deal with, which had been . increasingly part of his life'. Sarasota Police Chief Bernadette DiPino added: 'Mrs. Harris wanted the community, her family and friends to know that her husband is no longer suffering.' Harris and Ebbeson married in 1996 after meeting on a blind date at the opera, the Sarasota Herald Tribune said. Ebbeson, who had been married once before, became a U.S. citizen in 2000. Ebbeson had moved from his native Halmstead, Sweden and created InterCon Marketing Inc., an appliances distributor, in Sarasota in 1992. The company has a revenue of up to $25 million a year. Scene: Police stand outside the couple's waterfront home after finding Ebbeson's body inside on Tuesday .

In addition to running his businesses, he also spent his time playing golf, racing cars and cooking, the Herald Tribune reported. He is survived by his wife, two brothers and a daughter, Louise. Harris gained national attention while Florida's secretary of state during the state's disputed election recount in 2000 that ultimately made George W. Bush president.

Her ruling was overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court - before later being reversed in the U.S. Supreme Court. The final decision allowed her previous certification to stand. She later served in Congress from 2003 to 2007. She retired from public life after losing a senate race against Democrat Bill Nelson in 2006.

Elderly savers are being stripped of thousands of pounds by middlemen when they retire, a report claims today. They are handing big chunks of their pension pots to insurers, brokers and financial advisers for transfer services they assumed were free. Losses on a £100,000 fund can be as high as £6,000. Every year, more than 400,000 retirees turn their pension pots into an income for life – an annuity – in a business worth £12billion. A report by the Financial Services Consumer Panel found that many pension brokers baffle savers with jargon and retirees are being stripped of thousands of pounds for services they assumed were free . Half stay loyal to the insurer they have saved with while others turn to brokers in search of a better deal at a time of rock-bottom rates. But the report from the Financial Services Consumer Panel – an arm of the City regulator – found that many of these middlemen baffle the pensioners with complicated jargon followed by hard-sales tactics. Some savers are duped into believing the transfer service is free by misleading small print on the brokers’ websites. In four out of 15 cases examined by the consumer panel, firms claimed there was no charge. However, the pensioners were charged between £1,500 and £3,350 for moving their £100,000 pot. In some cases seen by the report’s authors the fees were as high as 6 per cent, or £6,000 – although it is unclear whether all the money came from customers’ pockets. Ros Altmann, a pensions campaigner and former Saga chief, said: ‘Pensioners are being thrown to the wolves. They are being left to fend for themselves in what is basically a retirement minefield. Many savers are handing big chunks of their pension pots to insurers, brokers and financial advisers and losses on a £100,000 fund can be as high as £6,000 . ‘It is the only time most of these people . will have to buy a pension and often they know nothing about how the . process works. The insurers, brokers and advisers know however exactly . what they are doing. ‘It is utterly unfair one side has all the power and knowledge, while the other is all too easily misled.’In some cases, brokers and advisers had lucrative tie-ups with panels of favoured insurers. These meant they received their cut from a pension pot without bothering to scour the market for the best place to park their client’s life’s savings. A poor choice of annuity provider can leave a saver lumbered with inadequate payouts until they die. Often, elderly savers who thought they were contacting an insurer or broker for help were instead unwittingly handing sensitive information to marketing companies. Their details were then sold on  at a profit to insurers, brokers  and pensions advisers who then bombarded them with calls, letters and emails. Eric Stoddart, pictured with his wife Pam, was put off buying an annuity because of the high fees . Eric Stoddart was put off  buying an annuity with his £37,000 pension pot by the hefty fees charged by some online brokers. The 65-year-old retired logistics manager from Nottingham tried to ask for quotes from three  different broker firms operating online. Because he has motor neurone disease, Mr  Stoddart was seeking an income for life that pays out more to the sick. This is known as an enhanced annuity. However, he was put off by the high fees that brokers demanded. These would have taken up to £1,000 out of his pension pot. Finally, after more than six months of searching through a variety of firms, he found that his £37,000 would not buy him enough of a pension to make it worth his while. In the worst quote given  to him by a pensions company, he was offered only £2,218 a year. Somebody in his condition should have expected to be receiving much more – up to £3,500. He said: ‘They were not very upfront about how much it would all cost. ‘It was all buried in the small print. I felt at the end of the day they were taking too much from my pot for doing too little.’ Mr Stoddart has now taken other occupational pensions for his income. These often vulnerable customers were . frequently left so terrified by endless uninvited emails and calls they . decided to stick with their old insurer – leaving them at risk of . receiving a poorer deal. Debbie Harrison, one of the report’s authors, said: ‘Retirees are being left to cope with what is a complete lottery. ‘They have no idea about how complicated the whole process of buying an annuity can be until it is too late.’ The report found many retirees 'are being left to cope with what is a complete lottery' Malcolm Tarling, a spokesman for the trade body, the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘The industry is determined to ensure that people can access the help they need to make the right pension choice for them. ‘We welcome moves to improve standards for non-advised sales through intermediaries, and  to improve access to advice  more generally.’ Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘For many people, the retirement process and in particular the purchase of an annuity is one of the most significant financial transactions they will undertake. ‘The challenge is to make that process as effective as possible.’ Mr McPhail said shopping around at retirement for the best rate and the best income ‘should be the default option for everyone’. He said more than half of pension pots were worth less than £20,000. Customers with smaller funds find it difficult to obtain paid-for financial advice. Advisers can instead direct them towards a non-advice product, which may pay the adviser a commission. Pitfalls can potentially include pensions offering good retirement incomes but stopping at death,  meaning a spouse is left without an income – a drawback which may not be spotted without professional advice.","Savers paying thousands of pounds for services they thought were free .

An Al Qaeda cell was feared to be in possession of a missile launcher capable of taking down a commercial aircraft after blueprints and instructions for the weapon were discovered at a training camp in Mali. The 26-page document in Arabic strongly suggests the group . now possesses the SA-7 surface-to-air missile, known to the Pentagon as . the Grail, according to terrorism specialists. Photocopies of the manual, which contained a detailed guide, diagrams and photographs, lay in heaps on the floor of a building once occupied by the terror group in the Islamic Maghreb in Timbuktu. The manual, recovered . by The Associated Press, also confirms that the Al Qaeda cell is actively training its fighters to use these weapons, also called man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS, which likely came from the arms depots of ex-Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. Deadly: A French soldier holds a SA-7 surface-to-air missile launcher in Timbuktu, Mali. The weapon is feared to be in the hands of Al Qaeda after a manual was found at a terror training camp in the town . Atlantic Council analyst Peter Pham, a . former adviser to the United States' military command in Africa and an . instructor to U.S. Special Forces, said: 'The existence of what apparently constitutes a ""Dummies Guide to MANPADS"" is strong circumstantial evidence of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb having the missiles. 'Why else bother to write the guide if you don't have the weapons? If AQIM not only has the MANPADS, but also fighters who know how to use them effectively, then the impact is significant, not only on the current conflict, but on security throughout North and West Africa, and possibly beyond.' This is not the first Al Qaeda-linked group thought to have MANPADS: they were circulating in Afghanistan and Iraq, and a terror cell in Somalia recently claimed to have the SA-7 in a video. But the U.S. desperately wanted to keep the weapons out of the hands of Al Qaeda's largest affiliate on the continent, based in Mali. In the spring of 2011, before the fighting in Tripoli had even stopped, a U.S. team flew to Libya to secure Gaddafi's stockpile of thousands of heat-seeking, shoulder-fired missiles. By the time they got there, many had already been looted. The manual is believed to be an excerpt from a terrorist encyclopedia edited by Osama bin Laden. Not the first time: A terror cell in Somalia recently claimed to have a surface-to-air missile like this one. But the U.S. desperately wanted to keep the weapons out of the hands of Al Qaeda's largest affiliate on the continent, based in Mali . It adds to evidence for the weapon found by French forces during their land assault in Mali earlier this year, including the discovery of the SA-7's battery pack and launch tube, according to military statements and an aviation official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised to comment. The knowledge that the terrorists have the weapon has already changed the way the French are carrying out their five-month-old offensive in Mali. They are using more fighter jets rather than helicopters to fly above its range of 1.4 miles (2.3km) from the ground, even though that makes it harder to attack the jihadists. They are also making cargo planes land and take off more steeply to limit how long they are exposed, in line with similar practices in Iraq after an SA-14 hit the wing of a DHL cargo plane in 2003. Concerns: The knowledge that the terrorists have the weapon has already changed the way the French (above) are carrying out their five-month-old offensive in Mali . In Timbuktu, SA-7 training was likely . part of the curriculum at the 'Jihad Academy' housed in a former police . station, said Jean-Paul Rouiller, director of the Geneva Center for . Training and Analysis of Terrorism, one of three experts who reviewed . the manual for AP. It's located less than three miles (5 km) from the Ministry of Finance's Budget Division building where the manual was found. First introduced in the 1960s in the Soviet Union, the SA-7 was designed to be portable. Not much larger than a poster tube, it . can be packed into a duffel bag and easily carried. It's also . affordable, with some SA-7s selling for as little as $5,000. Since 1975, at least 40 civilian . aircraft have been hit by different types of MANPADS, causing about 28 . crashes and more than 800 deaths around the world, according to the U.S. Department of State. The SA-7 is an old generation model, . which means most military planes now come equipped with a built-in . protection mechanism against it. But that's not the case for commercial planes and the threat is greatest to civilian aviation. In Kenya in 2002, suspected Islamic . extremists fired two SA-7s at a Boeing 757 carrying 271 vacationers back . to Israel, but missed. Insurgents in Iraq used the weapons, and YouTube . videos abound purporting to show Syrian rebels using the SA-7 to shoot . down regime planes. An SA-7 tracks a plane by directing itself toward the source of the heat, the engine. It takes time and practice, however, to fire it within range. The failure of the jihadists in Mali . so far to hit a plane could mean that they cannot position themselves . near airports with commercial flights or that they are not yet fully . trained to use the missile. Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies . at Georgetown University, said: 'There's a paradox here. On the one hand, . it's not easy to use, but against any commercial aircraft there would be . no defenses against them. It's impossible to protect against it.' Neighbors say they saw foreign . fighters running laps each day, carrying out target practice and . inhaling and holding their breath with a pipe-like object on their . shoulder. The drill is standard practice for shoulder-held missiles, including the SA-7. As the jihadists fled ahead of the arrival of French troops who liberated Timbuktu on January 28, they left the manual behind, along with other instructional material, including a spiral-bound pamphlet showing how to use the KPV-14.5 anti-aircraft machine gun and another on how to make a bomb out of ammonium nitrate, among other documents retrieved by the AP. Residents said the jihadists grabbed reams of paper from inside the building, doused them in fuel and set them alight. However, numerous buildings were still full of scattered papers. 'They just couldn't destroy everything,' said neighbor Mohamed Alassane. 'They appeared to be in a panic when the French came. They left in a state of disorder.' The manual is illustrated with grainy images of Soviet-looking soldiers firing the weapon. Point-by-point instructions explain how to insert the battery, focus on the target and fire. The manual also explains that the missile will malfunction above 45C, the temperature in the deserts north of Timbuktu. And it advises the shooter to change immediately into a second set of clothes after firing to avoid detection. Its pages are numbered 313 through 338, suggesting they came from elsewhere. Mathieu Guidere, an expert on Islamic extremists at the University of Toulouse, believes the excerpts are lifted from the Encyclopedia of Jihad, an 11-volume survey on the craft of war first compiled by the Taliban in the 1990s and later codified by Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden, who led a contingent of Arab fighters in Afghanistan at the time, paid to have the encyclopedia translated into Arabic, according to Guidere, author of a book on al-Qaida's North African branch. However, the cover page of the manual boasts the name of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. 'It's a way to make it their own,' said Guidere. 'It's like putting a logo on something. It shows the historic as well as the present link between Al Qaeda core and AQIM.' From the top: The manual is believed to be an excerpt from a terrorist encyclopedia edited by Osama bin Laden . Bin Laden later assembled a team of editors to update the manual, put it on CD-ROMs and eventually place it on the Internet in a move that lay the groundwork for the globalisation of jihad, according to terrorism expert Jarret Brachman, who was the director of research at the Combating Terrorism Center when the al-Qaida encyclopedia was first found. N.R. Jenzen-Jones, an arms expert in Australia, confirmed that the information in the manual in Timbuktu on the missile's engagement range, altitude and weight appeared largely correct. He cautions though that the history of the SA-7 is one of near-misses, specifically because it takes training to use. 'Even if you get your hands on an SA-7, it's no guarantee of success,' he said. 'However, if someone manages to take down a civilian aircraft, it's hundreds of dead instantly. It's a high impact, low-frequency event, and it sows a lot of fear.'","26-page document found in building occupied by terror group in Timbuktu .

Olympic hero Sir Bradley Wiggins has apologised today after a lewd joke about a sex act fell flat at a £300-a-head charity event to support child abuse victims. The cycling great was heard asking the compere to 's*** me off' because he had a 'posh voice' but diners at the Barnado's children's charity event in Harrogate were 'stunned into silence'. Alcohol had been running 'extremely freely' at the exclusive Rudding Park Hotel in North Yorkshire, but MailOnline understands that Sir Bradley, who was there with his wife Catherine, was not drunk. Off comment: Sir Bradley Wiggins with his wife Catherine (pictured last year) were at the event earlier this month where the cycling star made a rude joke that shocked diners . Wiggins had donated a signed shirt to raise money and as his face appeared on a big screen he was heard saying to Jon Hammond, the auctioneer, 'You’ve got a . posh voice. I like posh voices. S*** me off', according to the Daily Star. His shirt still made around £5,000 for charity. Today Sir Bradley's representatives apologised to anyone . offended by the joke, and said the knight had been enjoying 'banter' but was then 'caught unawares'. Guests at the Firecracker Ball event admitted they felt let down by what happened. Grand: Rudding Park Hotel hosted the Firecracker Ball, which cost diners £300 a head and raised money for Barnado's children's charity . Star: Sir Bradley after taking gold at the Men's time trial at London 2012, in a summer where he also won the Tour de France . 'Initially there was just stunned silence. It was bizarre and shocking,' businessman David Parkin told the Star. 'The chap sitting next to me said: ‘Before tonight he was my hero, but not any more. 'It was completely the wrong time and place to say something like that. People were completely disgusted by him.' Retired PR manager Malcolm Cowing added: 'Bradley’s remarks were at very best completely misjudged. On a stag do maybe, but not at a dinner for victims of childhood sexual abuse.' Great: Sir Bradley is one of Britain's greatest sportsman, but also has a reputation as a badboy, pictured here drinking at the London 2012 velodrome . Cycling’s ‘Modfather’ was taken to people’s hearts last year when he pulled off the minor miracle of becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France — before  winning the Olympic time trial and celebrating with a Churchill victory sign as he sat on the gaudy throne, providing one of London 2012’s imperishable memories. He won BBC Sports Personality of the Year by a mile after amusing Sue Barker by calling her ‘Susan’ in mock seriousness and was then awarded a knighthood to wide public acclaim. But a year on he has suffered, failing to compete in the Tour de France after a row with rival Chris Froome over who would lead Team Sky. After Froome won, Wiggins apparently did not phone to congratulate the new champion. Wiggins is also becoming known as the badboy of British sport, sometimes seen swearing at photographers, stumbling out of nightclubs drunk or having a cheeky cigarette. Last night Sir Bradley's spokesman said: 'There had been some friendly banter beforehand and Bradley was caught unawares by the auctioneer. We'd like to apologise to anyone who was offended by his language'.","Cycling great asked compere: 's*** me off' at £300-a-head Barnado's dinner .

Centuries ago a hunter-gatherer trekked across the desert in search of food and left behind just a single pair of perfectly preserved prints. The prints were originally found in the Cuatro Cienegas Basin of Mexico back in 1961 but researchers from Durham University have now managed to pinpoint when the steps would have been made. It is thought the prints date back some 10,550 years and may have belonged to a member of the Coahuiltecans group of Indians that inhabited the region. The single pair of footprints, pictured, were found in the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. They are thought to have belonged to a hunter-gatherer from a group called the Coahuiltecans and predate previous finds by almost 5,000, claims archaeologists from Durham University . By studying the stone in which the . footprints were made, archaeologists from Durham University were able to . establish that the single pair of prints was made approximately 10,550 . years ago, while nearby tracks date back around 7,250 years. The team also found pollen from trees . inside the 7,200-year-old tracks which suggests the region of the Cuatro Ciénegas basin wasn’t . always as dry and hot as it is today. Among this was pollen from a . so-called prickly pear cactus that grew during the time of the staple of . the Coahuiltecans – a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in the . region. The Coahuiltecan people is the . collective name for a small group of Indians that lived in the flat, . brushy areas of southern Texas and on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico . and it is thought the prints may have belonged to a member of this . group. The prints were originally discovered when the Mexican Federal Highway 30 was built across the Chihuahuan Desert. They were found encased in stone meaning excavators could remove them in a single piece and store them at a local museum. Once the highway was built, the original location of the prints was lost but researchers did find 11 tracks of additional prints in the Cuatro Ciénegas region surrounding the road. By studying the stone in which the footprints were made, archaeologists from Durham University were able to establish that the single pair of prints was made approximately 10,550 years ago, while the tracks date back around 7,250 years. Geoarchaeologist Dr. Nicholas Felstead who led the dig said: ‘To my knowledge the oldest human prints previously reported in North America are around 6,000 years old so these prints predate them by some 5,000 years.’ He continued that the prints are the only reported footprints ever found in the Cuatro Cienegas region. The prints were found in the Cuatro Cienegas Basin of the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico, pictured, during construction of Highway 30 . Felstead was able to date the tracks because they had been made in a sedimentary rock called travertine. Researchers additionally found tracks dating back around 7,250 years, pictured, in the nearby Cuatro Cienegas basin. In these tracks, the team found pollen from trees which suggests the region wasn't always as dry and hot as it is today . As water seeps through travertine, small traces of uranium remain inside the rock and because uranium decays at expected rates, Felstead and his team could measure ‘the ratio of those materials’ to determine the ages. The team also found pollen from trees inside the 7,200-year-old tracks which suggests the region wasn’t always as dry and hot as it is today. Among this was pollen from a so-called prickly pear cactus that grew during the time of the Coahuiltecans - a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in the region. The Coahuiltecan people is the collective name for a small group of Indians that lived in the flat areas of southern Texas and on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and it is thought the prints may have belonged to a member of this group. This also gave clues as to why the area became uninhabited in more recent years, when the area became arid and dry. The prints are not the oldest known footprints in the world - a track of prints were found at Monte Verde in Chile that is thought to date back 13,000 years - but they are the oldest discovered on the continent of North America. The prints are now being stored at Saltillo’s Museo del Desierto. It is thought the footprints were made by a member of the Coahuiltecan people - a collective name for a small group of Indians that lived in the flat areas of southern Texas and on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, marked in pink .","The prints were found in the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico, part of the continent of North America .

Scott McManis has been jailed for 34 months after he hit pedestrian Neil Wilcock while racing another car near his home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire . A judge has described his sentencing powers as 'ludicrously inadequate' as he jailed a hit and run driver for 34 months after he hit a pedestrian while racing against another car. Scott McManis, 21, fled the scene after he hit Neil Wilcock while racing in his father's Ford Mondeo. Mr Wilcock had to spend four weeks in intensive care with serious head and lung injuries, fractures to his skull and spine and two broken legs. The 52-year-old still requires 24-hour care, has permanent damage to his legs and has not returned to work following the incident last December. Jailing McManis at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Robert Bartfield said he could not give a sufficient sentence to match the crime. He said: 'This is going to be one of those rare occasions when I say the sentence is ludicrously inadequate. 'It allows me in no way to do justice to what happened here.' The court heard McManis took his father's car without permission and was racing with another car at speeds of up to 50 mph in a 30mph zone near his home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. One witness said she heard the cars revving 'as though the engines were being thrashed' before Mr Wilcock was hit at 7.20pm on December 12. After the incident McManis rang his father Gary, 48, who told him to hand himself in but he refused and said he was going to torch the silver car. Gary McManis then told his daughter Stacey, 25, to ring the police and report the car as stolen, prosector Ian Goldsack told the court. The family thought they had got away with it but police found a wing mirror at the accident scene and the make and model of the car was narrowed down. After officers searched their database they found Stacey McManis had reported a similar car as stolen and the family were questioned at their home but stuck to their story that the car had been stolen. Jailing McManis at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured), Judge Robert Bartfield said he could not give a sufficient sentence to match the crime . Mobile phone cell site evidence also put Scott McManis at the accident scene and again located him at woodland in Deepcar, near Sheffield, where the car was discovered burned out. Scott McManis eventually handed himself into police on December 29. The other driver has never been traced. In a victim impact statement the victim's sister said he was unconscious for weeks and they thought he was going to die. 'This is going to be one of those rare occasions when I say the sentence is ludicrously inadequate. It allows me in no way to do justice to what happened here' - Judge Robert Bartfield . Scott McManis admitted aggravated vehicle taking and conspiring to pervert the course of justice while his father and sister also admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Rebecca Stephens, for Scott McManis, said he was 'utterly ashamed' and wanted to apologise to the victim and his family. Jailing him, the judge said: 'Mr Wilcock suffered the most terrible injuries. Nothing can give him his life back. 'Both legs were fractured, he underwent multiple operations and he was in intensive care almost a month. It is a miracle he survived. I am satisfied you were vehicle racing, it was driving for fun on public roads. 'You knew you had knocked somebody down. Your reaction was to leave the scene and your counsel has rightly described you as a coward. You thought more of saving your own skin than of seeking assistance for that man.' Gary McManis and his daughter both wept in the dock as the judge said their lies had impeded the investigation, adding anguish to the victim's family. As well as being jailed for 34 months, Scott McManis was banned from driving for three years and told to take an extended test when he comes out. Gary McManis was given 12 months in jail suspended for a year with 120 hours of unpaid work while Stacey McManis received an eight-month jail term suspended for a year with 80 hours of unpaid work. After the hearing Inspector Pete Serhatlic, of South Yorkshire Police's road policing group, said: 'The McManus family have been brought to justice after a long and protracted investigation. 'I would like to wish the victim every success in his determination to regain good health and I would like to thank those members of the public that assisted us. 'Leaving the scene of an accident is morally irresponsible and the actions of a coward.'","Scott McManis fled the scene after he hit pedestrian while racing .

News of Allesandra Pacchieri, the Italian woman whose baby delivered by caesarean section without her consent and then removed from her by Essex social services has shocked the nation over the past week. Ms Pacchieri was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the UK while here for a training course. Her lawyers have launched a legal action in a bid to try to get her daughter back and have said the mother-of-three suffers from a relatively minor mental illness, a bipolar condition that can be treated with medication. Someone who sympathises all too well with the unimaginable pain of having your child taken from you is Kelly McWilliams,who last year had a similar experience. Her baby was removed at birth by social workers because she had previously suffered from depression . Scroll down for video . Ultimately it took Kelly over four months to get baby Victoria back after she was taken with no warning just hours after her birth . Although she has now been reunited her daughter Victoria, Kelly, 37, said on This Morning . that that she was left devastated when social services turned up out of . the blue to take away her baby while she was actually in labour. Kelly had struggled with with depression after the death of her 10-year-old son.She became so unwell that she admitted herself voluntarily to a psychiatric hospital, where, with excellent care, she recovered. ‘I was at my worst it was such a dark period for me. I admitted myself to hospital because I didn’t know what else I could do. 'I found living without my son very hard so I did self-admit myself to the psychiatric ward. The treatment there was fantastic. It was the best thing I could have ever done. ‘When I left I knew my life had to change. I wanted help and I wanted to get better for my children’s sake. I saw a mental health worker every week for a year, then every two weeks for a following year. It was mainly just for support, to make sure I didn’t slip and it just lifted me up and up and up. ‘I have never been as strong as I am now. I have no depression at all.’ At the end of December 2011, having been trying for a second child, Kelly was delighted to learn that she was pregnant. ‘I was so happy,’ Kelly says, ‘It was obviously the best thing that had happened to us since our son had died so you can’t imagine the feeling that you can make a future again and to start living for the future and not the past anymore.’ However her joy at greeting her new arrival was curtailed when, in August 2011, social workers enter her hospital room while she was in the middle of giving birth. Kelley spoke out about her experience on This Morning, saying that while she was reunited with Victoria, other families may still be suffering an unfair separation . ‘They arrived very coldly, knocked on the door and walked straight in.’ Clearly becoming emotional as she recalls the traumatic event Kelly explains: ‘They said to me “Kelly we’re here because you’re not very well and we are going to be placing your baby into foster care two hours after you give birth” ‘I thought it was a joke. I stood there with my mouth open. I couldn’t believe it.' When she asked why Kelly was told simply that she was ‘not well’ and that she had failed to attend a CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) appointment the previous year. This was despite the fact that the CBT appointment had been booked by Kelly herself in an effort to help her overcome a fear of spiders. Having admitted her history of depression at her first antenatal appointment Kelly saw a social worker just once when she was 6 months pregnant, and was told everything was fine. Baby Victoria suffered breathing difficulties when she was born and so was taken straight to Neonatal Intensive Care, from which she was taken by social services. Kelly was not allowed to leave the ward during this time and didn't see her baby. Having secured a lawyer from her hospital bed while in labour, Kelly found herself in court fighting for the right to keep her own child just two days after giving birth. ‘I feel I had to do everything to get her back. At first they only asked for my medical records to prove I wasn’t suffering with depression, then they wanted a psychiatrist’s report. I knew that would be fine and then they said they wanted a psychologists report. ‘When that was fine they started to bring my disability into it. I was made to stand in front of them and wash a doll to prove I could do it.’ Ultimately it took Kelly over four months to get baby Victoria back. Kelley says when  the social workers entered the hospital room when she was in labour she originally thought it was a joke . ‘I got her back after four months and even thought that was a very long time for me there are other families out there for who it has taken years. ‘It takes time and that is what’s so hard. They set the court dates and you can’t bring them forward. ‘They were worried it would cause my depression again but if anything it gave me more fight; I’d lost one there was no way I was going to lose another. They set these timescales but what they don’t realise is that when it’s innocent people it’s breaking the family apart. You can’t do it to the parents and you can’t do it to the children. The stress of the separation and fight to get Victoria back caused the breakdown of Kelly’s marriage. Despite the devastating effect of the incident on Kelly and her family, she does acknowledge the difficult situation social workers are in. However she says: ‘Children can’t be put at risk, but innocent people can’t be put at risk. There are just too many mistakes happening.’","Kelly McWilliams, 37, became depressed after her son died aged 10 .

Two Boston College students studying in Rome have shared their joy after exchanging skull caps with Pope Francis in front of the Vatican. Katherine Rich, from Minnetonka, Minnesota, and Ethan Mack, from Portland, Maine, were waiting along the barricades near St Peter's Square with a skullcap - called a zucchetto - on Wednesday as the Pope approached. The philosophy students, who are studying abroad for just a semester, had attached a note to the zucchetto reading: 'Boston College loves our Jesuit pope.' 'We thought he wouldn’t see us, but we both yelled, ""Papa!"" and at that second he turned around, saw us, and asked the driver to stop,' Rich, 20, from Minnetonka, Minnesota, told the Boston Globe. Excitement: Katherine Rich and Ethan Mack, who are students at Boston College, received a skullcap from Pope Francis in exchange for one they presented him. The American students are studying in Rome . They held out the zucchetto, which Mack had bought the night before for around $68, and the pope sent over a guard who took it to him, they explained in an email on Thursday. Francis smiled at the note and put on the cap after making sure it was the right size and then he handed his own zucchetto to the guard. 'The pope then gave a nod and smiled right at us,' said Mack, 21, said in an email. 'He took off with the one I bought, and the guard gave us his original one.' The Rev. Thomas Rosica, chief executive of the Salt and Light Catholic Television Network in Toronto, told the Boston Globe that popes have made this gesture often in the past. Generosity: The pope tested the size of the cap - called a zucchetto - before giving his to the students . 'It's a wonderful gesture,' Rosica said. 'It's a way of him reaching out to people.' Rich and Mack said they got the idea . from friends studying at Providence College and the Catholic University . of America, who had tried to trade the zuchettos, but they'd been the . wrong size. Mack explained that it was his last chance for an interaction with the Pope, who was heading to his weekly mass, because he and Rich are retuning back to the U.S. soon. 'It was a gamble, because this was our last audience,' Mack said. 'Getting close is just a matter of getting to the audience early. If you do, you can get on the perimeter of a barricade and he will drive right along.' The pair said they do not know exactly what they will do with the zuchetto but they plan on presenting it to the school or giving it away. Rich added: 'The best part of the whole encounter . was just seeing Pope Francis smile at us. He radiates joy . in a way unlike anyone else.' Chance: They waved the zuchetto at the pope as he drove in St Peter's Square (pictured last week) Francis, who took over the papacy in March, has given many public displays of respect and compassion, and has received praise from Catholics and non-Catholics alike. In November, he was pictured embracing Vinicio Riva, whose body is covered with large, painful growths. Following the experience, Riva said the display of compassion 'felt like paradise'. And following Easter Mass at the Vatican, a family from Rhode Island were moved to tears when the pope held up their son Dominic Gondreau, who suffers from cerebral palsy, and kissed him. He was also named person of the year on Wednesday by Time magazine. The managing editor praised him 'for committing the world’s largest church to confronting its deepest needs and for balancing judgment with mercy'.","Katherine Rich and Ethan Mack, who are studying in Rome, waited in St Peter's Square on Wednesday for the pope to pass .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 06:12 EST, 29 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:26 EST, 29 November 2013 . The young wife of a Jewish rabbi died in hospital from an undiagnosed stomach ulcer - just weeks after giving birth to their sixth child. Esther Cohen, 33, had complained of sickness in the weeks before and after the delivery of baby Avraham Tzvi. After being sent home from hospital following the birth, she was readmitted only to be discharged again despite her husband Rabbi Mendel Cohen fearing his wife, ‘wasn’t the complaining type’ and was still very poorly. Esther Cohen (pictured with her husband, Rabbi Mendel Cohen and four of their children), 33, died five weeks after having her sixth child when she suffered a perforated stomach ulcer which led to septicaemia and eventually to multiple organ failure . Mrs Cohen, whose grandparents helped found Jewish outreach activities in America and Canada, was sent back to North Manchester General Hospital after her sickness continued and she lost weight. She died a month later. Tests showed Mrs Cohen had a perforated ulcer which had not been detected by doctors but which caused septicaemia and led to multiple organ failure. At an inquest in Manchester, Rabbi Cohen wept as the hearing was told there is an ‘inherent’ difficulty in detecting diseases in the stomach or intestine when a patient has recently given birth - as symptoms can be attributed to the after-effects of delivering a baby. Doctors could not have detected the symptoms any sooner. Mrs Cohen - known as Esty and described as ‘very well liked and very well respected’ - was originally from Albany in New York State but moved to the UK in 2005 with her Manchester born husband. He headed a synagogue in Broughton Park, Salford, and ran the 60 pupil Lubavitch Jewish Boys’ School. During her lifetime Mrs Cohen was said to be dedicated to promoting Jewish life and the mission of Chabad-Lubavitch – an organisation which helps promote Judaism and provides Torah lectures. Mrs Cohen complained of sickness before and after the birth of her sixth child but was discharged from hospital when her condition started to improve and tests did not reveal any abnormalities . After marrying her husband she had given birth to her first five children Moishe, now 13, Mushka, 12, Rivka, 10, Chana, seven, and Yechiel, two. But problems arose after the delivery of Avraham Tzvi in August 2010. Following the birth tests performed on Mrs Cohen at the hospital’s emergency unit on August 29 showed everything appeared normal and despite her vomiting, she was discharged on August 31. Dr Tamer Al-Sayed said: ‘She spent the weekend in the emergency unit and according to nurses notes she was stable throughout. There was intermittent vomiting through the night and day but it stalled. ‘On August 31, I was asked to review the patient to see what the plan was. Her blood pressure was normal and she had been able to eat. Mrs Cohen (pictured with her family) returned to hospital when she started vomiting again and lost weight. In hospital her condition continued to deteriorate and she could not be saved . ‘I thought maybe the best the best place for her was home given that there had been no changes throughout the weekend. She was stable and ambient.’ During the hearing Rabbi Cohen’s lawyer Ian Cohen said he was concerned that his wife had no energy and was very listless. But Dr Al-Sayed added: ‘The sheer effect of reduction in nutrition would have accounted for her lack of energy. If a patient was presented in the same circumstances today I would follow exactly the same procedures. ‘Over and above being a doctor, I am a human being, and I would like to offer my sincere condolences.’ Mrs Cohen (pictured as a teenager) has been described as 'very well liked and very well respected' Dr Martin Patrick, a consultant physician in acute medication said it was not necessary to carry out an abdominal examination. ‘Because vomiting had stalled and she was eating she should go home,’ he said. ‘I saw Mr Cohen and explained this. She seemed well when I saw her and she was mobile. ‘If she wasn’t keeping down food I would have kept her in, but the notes I have are that she was eating. I know she wasn’t an “in your face” type person but that’s why I arranged to see Mr Cohen. If there had been no improvement I wouldn’t have sent her home.’ Mrs Cohen was discharged at around midday on August 31 but readmitted on September 3 where she was described as suffering ‘profound septic shock’. A coroner recorded a verdict of death from natural causes. Mrs Cohen is pictured as a child . Her condition again deteriorated on . September 9 and by this time, surgeon Professor Derek Alderson said . there was evidence of organ damage where the septic state had begun to . impact on the function of her organs. Professor . Alderson said: ‘The examination of the abdomen in women who have . recently given birth is one of the old chestnuts in surgery as you can . miss small diagnoses like acute appendicitis when they have not long . given birth. ‘We don’t understand why that is but most expert doctors have seen something like that. ‘Even if there had been something subtle there, the chances of you identifying something with a single abdominal examination are really small. You would have passed it as being normal and there is a risk you would have missed perforation.’ An inquest into Mrs Cohen's death heard she could not have been diagnosed earlier as it is very hard to spot stomach conditions in women who have recently given birth . Rabbi Cohen’s lawyer Ian Cohen said: . ‘There has been significant concern from the family that she wasn’t . eating and wasn’t holding down food. ‘You . have a lady who was quite passive and didn’t complain. We think that . may have been interpreted as she was OK and improving.’ But . recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Manchester Coroner . Nigel Meadows said: ‘It is obviously a complete tragedy that you have a . woman of 33 years old who is a mother of six and it deserved the fullest . investigation and that is why I have gone to the trouble of consulting . medical experts at public expense. ‘At the end of the day, I would hope you understand you have had a full enquiry and matters have been looked at carefully. My deepest sympathies are passed on and I know this brings back terrible memories.’ Family friend Rabbi Yossi Chazan, of Prestwich's Holy Law Synagogue, said: 'Esther was reserved, gracious and very God-fearing and built a beautiful family' Speaking after the inquest, Rabbi Cohen said: ‘I did think that the medical care was not perhaps up to par at the time but everything has been followed up and today has clarified the care was up to the correct standard. I want to thank the coroner and the medical staff for their incredible work.’ A collection of memories of Mrs Cohen by family and friends, as well as her own childhood journal entries, have been posted on a blog RememberingEsty.blogspot.com . Family friend Rabbi Yossi Chazan, of Prestwich’s Holy Law Synagogue, said: ‘Esther was reserved, gracious and very God-fearing and built a beautiful family. ‘She was an aristocrat of the spirit, but at the same time very devoted and always behind her husband in the running of the shul and the school. She sacrificed a tremendous amount for these communal organisations.’","Esther Cohen, 33, complained of sickness before and after the birth .

A serial drunk driver who allegedly ran down a woman last week before speeding away has been charged with murder after her family decided to take her off life support. Raymond Victor Morua, 32, a former Congresswoman's assistant, is accused of hitting Mallory Rae Dies on Friday last week. She died yesterday at 3.15pm after five days in intensive care. Morua, who has previous convictions for DUIs and a hit-and-run dating back to 2006, allegedly hit Dies just after midnight on December 6 in Santa Barbara, California, after leaving a party where he had been drinking. Raymond Victor Morua, 32, (left) a former aide of Congresswoman Lois Capps (right), has been charged with murder after allegedly running over a pedestrian in Santa Barbara last Friday before fleeing the scene . According to Noozhawk, witnesses saw Moura stop and look back out of his car before speeding off. They then followed Moura as he drove into a dead end street and tried to convince him to go back to the accident. According to Santa Barbara police Sgt. Riley Harwood, Moura refused, sped away but lost control of his vehicle before crashing into a palm tree where he was arrested and found to be two times over the limit. Moura now faces charges of murder, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. He is in custody in Santa Barbara County Jail where he has been refused bail and is scheduled to be arraigned at Superior Court today. The grade of murder, and maximum sentence which could be imposed, will be decided at a later date. For two years, until he was dismissed last week, Moura was a district representative for Congresswoman Lois Capps who herself was injured by a drunk driver in 1996. It was here, in the 500 block of Anacapa Street outside the EOS Lounge, where the accident was said to have happened just after midnight . Lois and her husband, Walter, were hit head on as they made their way home from a press conference. Walter was taken to hospital after suffering broken bones, cuts and internal injuries while Lois received cuts and bruises. In a statement handed to the Santa Barbara Independent Capps said: 'Words cannot express the sadness I feel over the death of Mallory Rae Dies. This tragedy tugs at the heart of all of us in the community. 'It is clear that Mallory brought light into the many hearts of those who knew her. This senseless — and avoidable — tragedy is one that all of us in the Santa Barbara community will struggle with for a long time. 'I know firsthand what it feels like to lose a child. That anguish is something that no parent should face. My prayers are with her parents and all those who mourn today. I wish her, her family, and her friends peace.'

A Miss Universe pageant hopeful is suing the organization co-owned by Donald Trump, claiming a recruiter asked her to give him oral sex in exchange for fast-tracking her modelling career. Ashleigh Blake, 21, from Tracy in Northern California, filed a suit Wednesday against the Miss Universe Organization, which she alleges is rife with sexual deviants who prey on unsuspecting young women. She claims Miss California USA recruiter Domingo Rodriguez lured her to a Starbucks parking lot with promises to land her modeling jobs and magazine covers. But when she met him in his car he allegedly explained that her end of the bargain involved giving him 'sexual favors.' Lawsuit: Ashleigh Blake, 21, pictured, from Tracy in Northern California, filed a suit Wednesday against the Miss Universe Organization, which she alleges is rife with sexual deviants who prey on unsuspecting young women . Miss Universe: Blake is suing the Miss Universe Organization, which is co-owned by Donald Trump, pictured right . Blake says she burst into tears and ran from the car. She says she went straight to the Tracy Police Department but was told she couldn't file criminal charges against Rodriquez because the recruiter didn't force her to perform the sex act. So she's suing the Miss Universe Organization claiming it knowingly hires 'scam artists' who lure young women with false promises of modeling contracts and fame. Blake is seeking at least $200,000 in damages according to TMZ. According to Jezebel, Blake was an amateur model and part-time tutor who fantasized about being a movie star or one of the Glee team when she was contacted out of the blue by the Miss California USA recruiter in November 2012. She responded right away to his request to schedule a meeting. 'I didn't expect them to pick me in a million years,' Ashleigh said in a YouTube video to raise awareness of the scam. 'When they did, I thought it was the start of my dreams coming true.' After filling out an online application, she was invited to an interview session with Rodriquez and a handful of other girls at a hotel near her home. They watched a promotional video and had one-on-one interviews, during which he told Blake he'd help find her sponsors to pay the $895 non-refundable application fee. Big dreams: Blake, pictured, was an amateur model and part-time tutor who fantasized about being a movie star or one of the Glee team when she was contacted out of the blue by the Miss California USA recruiter in November 2012 . He also told her, if she was interested, he knew a Miami magazine that needed a cover model. He followed up with her on email and later texted her. Blake said she was excited but unsettled by the middle-aged man's enthusiasm so she called the number on the pageant website and reached K2 Productions, which produces the California pageant, and they confirmed he worked there. He then asked her to send him modelling photos, which she did. He text back straight away saying the Miami magazine wanted her on the cover but they'd have to meet in person to discuss the terms of the deal. She agreed to meet him at a Starbucks in Tracy. However, Rodriguez showed up without any paperwork and asked Blake to get inside his car. She felt uncomfortable but got inside, thinking that as he was an official pageant recruiter there'd be no funny business. But once the doors were closed, Rodriguez told Ashleigh that the agreement wasn't written. It was oral. Help: After the Starbucks encounter, Blake said she contacted K2 Productions Director Keith Lewis, pictured left, to report what had happened and she said he told her he was upset but that she should keep it under wraps . Surprised: Blake, a 5ft 8in model was surprised when she was contacted by the Miss California USA recruiter to apply for the MUO pageant . 'Basically, I had to give him head and other ""sexual favors"" if I wanted to be on the cover of the magazine,' she said on YouTube. He said that this was simply the 'fast track' that 90 per cent of all successful actors and models had done to get to the top and her path to fame would be guaranteed if she did the same. He then asked her to 'prove herself' right there in the Starbucks parking lot. When she looked upset, he let her out of the car and told her to think about his offer. She told the police, who said it was a civil rather than criminal case because he didn't force her to do anything. She also approached Keith Lewis, the State Director for Miss California USA. She said he told Blake in an email that he was horrified by her experience and would remedy the situation, but advised her to keep her story under wraps. Rodriguez confirmed to Jezebel in March that he had met Blake in his car outside of a Tracy Starbucks to impart his knowledge about making it in modelling. 'She told me she would do whatever it takes, and now she's throwing my help in her face,' he told Jezebel. He denied that he personally requested a blow job, but said that he told her he knew of a magazine where 'young ladies can get on the cover if they do some type of sexual favors with the people at the magazine.' He said he had offered the same option to other aspiring models and at least one who took up the offer was 'doing very well.' 'This is character assassination and it's a shame because I've helped a lot of people in the past.' he said. He said he only met with Blake because she said she couldn't afford the fee for Miss California USA. 'The pageant industry is expensive for young ladies,' he said. 'I feel bad for those who dream about it but financially can't make it happen.'","Ashleigh Blake, 21, from Tracy in Northern California, filed a suit Wednesday against the Miss Universe Organization .

Pledge: The rising numbers suggest David Cameron's promise to keep net migration below 100,000 is running into trouble . Net migration in Britain is on the rise – driven by workers from Spain and other southern Europe countries fleeing the collapse of their eurozone economies, figures have shown. Net migration – the touchstone figure that shows how migration is affecting the population as a whole – went up by 15,000 to 182,000 in the year to June, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday. The increase was the second quarterly rise in a row, suggesting that David Cameron’s pledge to cut net migration to below 100,000 is running into trouble. The breakdown from the ONS showed that ministers are succeeding in reducing the numbers of migrants from outside Europe. But . a new wave of workers are now coming from longstanding southern EU . member countries, with European treaties stopping the Government from . restricting the flow. Yesterday’s . figures revealed that 118,000 EU citizens came to work in Britain in . the year to June, more than the number of workers from outside Europe. This included 37,000 Poles as well as workers from other eastern European countries. But . the ONS pointed to a ‘statistically significant’ increase in the number . coming from other parts of Europe, notably from countries in southern . Europe. Workers from the 15 . longest-established EU nations, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and . Greece, went up from 41,000 in the year to June 2012 to 59,000 in the 12 . months to June this year. Some . 27,000 came from Spain, 10,000 up on working immigrants from the . country in the previous year. Spain has now shot up to sixth on the . league table of the countries sending migrants to Britain. Separate . figures showed an increase of 52 per cent in new National Insurance . numbers issued to Italian citizens, 45 per cent to Portuguese nationals, . 40 per cent to Spanish nationals, and 31 per cent to Greeks.All . four countries have been hit by the eurozone crisis, experiencing high . levels of unemployment and a deep credit squeeze. The ONS revealed that . overall, there were 503,000 immigrants in the year to June – down from . 517,000 in the previous year. The figures also showed that Home Office limits on student visas have cut the numbers coming into the country to study. More people now say they come to Britain for work-related reasons than any other . The wealth gap between Europe's richest and poorest countries creates an 'overwhelming incentive' for people to move to Britain, Theresa May has warned. The Home Secretary suggested new EU member states would have to increase income levels at home before border the UK was forced to open its borders to them. She insisted the government was acting to 'address the pull factors that drive up immigration'. Benefits rules are being changed, with welfare payments ending after six months if someone has no prospect of finding work. But Mrs May added: 'Whatever the Government does in terms of reducing the pull factors that draw people to Britain, as long as there is such an enormous disparity between EU member states in terms of income per head, there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer member states to richer member states. 'That not only puts pressure on communities in countries like Britain, it robs poorer EU member states of their most talented people,' she wrote for PoliticsHome. 'So in future, we must put in place new arrangements to slow full access to each other’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration. This could, for example, be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed.' Around 176,000 students arrived in the year to June, down from a peak of nearly 250,000 in 2008. And . the number of students coming in to the country has fallen under the . number of migrants coming here to work for the first time in four years. However . net migration, the number by which migration pushes up the population . after emigration has been taken into account, was up to 182,000 compared . to 167,000 in the year to June 2012. Sir . Andrew Green, of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘The Government’s . immigration policy is succeeding in reducing net migration from outside . the EU, now down by over a third to its lowest level since 1998. ‘But . the recent increase in migration from the EU will render it still more . difficult to achieve their target. A continuing problem is the low . outflow of non-EU migrants which has been steady at around 100,000 for . ten years despite inflows of 300,000 or more for most of the period. ‘A very significant part of this is students who have been arriving at an annual rate of 139,000 over the last five years.’ Sir . Andrew added that none of the restrictions already placed on . immigration seemed to be harming the economy, as some people had . predicted. He said: ‘There is no evidence that the immigration policy is . constraining economic activity.’ With . British labour market restrictions about to end on citizens from . Bulgaria and Romania, the two countries that joined the EU in 2007, EU . migration was high on the agenda for Mr Cameron as he met fellow leaders . at a summit in Lithuania yesterday. And Home Office Immigration Minister Mark Harper insisted that the Government was working to bring net migration down. But, . with the two most recent sets of quarterly figures both showing net . migration on the rise, he chose not to repeat Mr Cameron’s promise to . get numbers down to 1990s levels of below 100,000. ‘Our . reforms are working and immigration continues to fall,’ Mr Harper said. ‘We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife, but are . still encouraging the brightest and best to come here to study and work. ‘Net . migration has fallen by nearly a third since its peak in 2010 and . across the Government we are working hard to bring it down further.’ There has been a sharp increase in the number of people from the EU moving to Britain for work .

Now it has emerged that Margaret Thatcher considered staying on as Prime Minister even after being ousted as Conservative leader. Baroness Thatcher’s former political secretary, John Whittingdale, made the extraordinary revelation as he delivered the Speaker’s lecture on great parliamentarians in the House of Commons. Revelations: Margaret Thatcher 'briefly toyed' with staying as Prime Minister even after losing the leadership bid, according to John Wittingdale (right) Mr Whittingdale, now chairman of the Commons culture committee, said she ‘briefly’ toyed with staying as Prime Minister even after losing the Conservative Party leadership in 1990. ‘She always said she had never been defeated by the people,’ the MP  told an audience at the Speaker’s House. ‘She had only been defeated by her colleagues in the House of Commons and she felt very strongly that it was an act of great disloyalty and betrayal. 'She even briefly thought about whether or not she could continue as Prime Minister without being leader of the Conservative Party. 'Over-emotional': Lord Tebbit criticised Meryl Streep's portrayal of Margaret Thatcher (pictured) ‘This was not an entirely practical . idea but she did feel very strongly that it  was improper that she had . been forced to leave office on that basis.’ Mr . Whittingdale insisted Lady Thatcher only considered the idea fleetingly . –  though constitutionally, there would have been nothing to stop her . refusing to resign as Prime Minister even if someone else had been . elected as Tory leader. He said that at the time of her brutal exit from Number Ten, she had been  playing a key role in the build up to the first Gulf War and was also leading international efforts to win freedom for people in eastern Europe. ‘I think it entered her head very briefly and those of us who were present soon  persuaded her this was not a sensible idea,’ Mr Whittingdale said. ‘But what you have to understand is that . . . she was very angry. I don’t  think it was a serious possibility.’ Mr Whittingdale described the ‘extraordinary night’ her leadership collapsed as she failed to win an outright victory in a leadership vote, and decided to withdraw rather than face a second. ‘I left Downing Street at 2am after working on what we all knew would be her final speech. The next day she gave a vintage performance, an absolute defence of everything she had achieved as Prime Minister.  I have to admit I sat with tears rolling down my cheeks,’ Mr Whittingdale said. There is renewed interest in Lady Thatcher’s premiership thanks to the film The Iron Lady, starring Meryl Streep. But former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit criticised her portrayal, saying: ‘She was never in my experience the over-emotional, over-acting woman portrayed by Meryl Streep,’ he said.","Former political secretary makes revelation during lecture .

Keen backpacker Dylan Harris has set up Manchester-based Lupine Travel to cater for danger tourists who like him are desperate to explore some of the most hostile destinations on Earth. Thousands have enjoyed golf trips in Iran, snow rugby in Mongolia and a body-destroying ultramarathon in Turkmenistan - where superhumans embark on a 162-mile run across deserts and vast desolate areas.

Ellie Thompson took so many tablets in her fight against cancer that her mother described her as a human ‘rattle’. On top of the gruelling chemotherapy treatment, the 11-year-old needed nearly 50 tablets, medicines and ointments a week to combat the wide variety of side effects. It meant her battle against leukaemia became like a military operation. Ellie was on so many medications that her mother, Lindsey, branded her the 'human rattle'. She required treatment to combat the effects of the chemotherapy which ranged from nosebleeds to dry skin . She was diagnosed after she and her brother, Josh, eight, both developed chest infections and her cough failed to improve. Tests showed her white blood cell count was low, and at the start of 2012 she became very unwell . The family put up a large whiteboard . that filled an entire wall in the dining room and wrote down a detailed . schedule, with every type of medicine, dose required and time of day to . be taken clearly set out. It was also vital Ellie was suitably . hydrated to protect her kidneys from the strong medicines and the board . was used to keep a tally of her drinks of water. Thankfully the treatment and her careful tablet-taking worked well. Ellie was treated at Sheffield Children's Hospital where she underwent a gruelling course of chemotherapy which left her so weak that she had to spend most of the last two years in a wheelchair . Cocktail of drugs.jpg . She was given the all-clear from . cancer a few weeks ago and is now delighted to be off her medication and . planning a return to school. Her mother Lindsey Thompson, 33, a . nursery nurse, said that at one stage Ellie had to take 11 pills in a . single dose and ‘put them all on one spoon’. She continued: ‘I used to say she would rattle, she was taking that many tablets. ‘We drew a weekly timetable because . she was taking tablets at different times of the day and we were so . worried we were going to mix up her doses. The chemotherapy was lowering her . immune system which was making her really susceptible to all different . kinds of infections and illnesses.’ Ellie, from Sheffield, was diagnosed . with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in February 2011 after she appeared . to fail to recover from a chest infection. Mrs Thompson, her businessman husband Carl, 38, and their son Josh, eight, were shattered by the news. The schoolgirl immediately started two years of treatment at Sheffield Children’s Hospital and she is now on the mend. Mrs Thompson said: ‘The hospital have . been amazing, they scooped us up and told us what they were going to . do.

"PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 2 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:10 EST, 3 June 2012 . British aid worker Helen Johnston beamed with joy as her rescuers delivered her safely to Kabul. The 27-year-old thanked could not hide the delight on her face as she was greeted by officials in the Afghan capital yesterday, having been flown from province of Badakhshan. Miss Johnston is recovering from her kidnap ordeal, which came to dramatic end on Friday when David Cameron sent SAS troops to free her after her captors demanded a £7 million ransom. The British soldiers – backed by US . Delta Force, American Navy Seals and Afghan troops – rescued Miss . Johnston and three other hostages from a cave in the north eastern . province. Safe and sound: Rescued British hostage Helen Johnston arrives in Kabul following her kidnap ordeal . The Prime Minister described it as an . ‘extraordinarily brave, breathtaking operation’. Six of the kidnap gang . were shot dead in the SAS raid. Brave: Helen Johnston was freed on Friday after being kidnapped on May 22 in Badakhshan province . Mr . Cameron gave the go-ahead for the operation when the gang . threatened to kill Miss Johnston and the other hostages unless an Afghan . drug baron was released from prison and the ransom paid. Miss Johnston had spent ten days . inside the cave in a heavily wooded, mountainous hamlet called Asphan, nine miles from the . nearest road or track. She was seized at gunpoint on May 22 by . a gang associated with the Taliban. The Briton, a nutritionist who . works for Medair, a Swiss-based humanitarian group, was held with Kenyan . colleague Moragwa Oirere and two Afghan men, who had been acting as . their guides. The gang demanded the immediate release of their leader, a drug baron and people trafficker known as Jallah, who had been arrested a month previously. They also wanted an $11 million dollar (£7million)  ransom and the cessation of all activities by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the area. By Friday, Mr Cameron had no choice but to send in the SAS after the Afghan government refused to negotiate with the kidnappers. An Afghan source said: ‘The Afghan government refused to give in to their demands. The gang was told to return the hostages safely or face the consequences.’ After the mission, Miss Johnston’s parents, Philip and Patricia, and her brother Peter said: ‘We are delighted and hugely relieved by the wonderful news that Helen and all her colleagues have been freed. ‘We are deeply grateful to everyone involved in her rescue, to those who worked tirelessly on her behalf, and to family and friends for their love, prayers and support over the past 12 days.’ Last night, Mr Johnston, a senior tutor in theology and religious studies at Hughes Hall, Cambridge, declined to add to the family statement. He said: ‘I’m sure you’ve seen our statement. That’s all we are going to say at the moment.' Rescue: The dramatic raid took place at 2am in Shahr-e-Bozorgd district, in a large forested area near the Tajikistan border called Koh-e-Laran . The SAS mission was given the green light by Mr Cameron at a meeting of COBRA, the national security emergency committee, in London at 3pm on Friday. He took action because information gained by MI6 and US intelligence agents in the city of Faizabad over the past week helped them establish that the risk to Miss Johnston and her fellow hostages was increasing. Senior military and intelligence officials attended COBRA meetings with MI6 chief Sir John Sawers every day last week as information about the kidnapping flowed in through GCHQ, the Government’s secret communications centre. It was during the COBRA meetings that the ‘nuts and bolts’ of the  rescue plan were put together, and  the Special Forces team was placed on stand-by to deploy once a signal was sent from London. Mr Cameron attended three of the COBRA meetings. As the threat to the hostages became increasingly serious, Mr Cameron took advice from the director of UK Special Forces, the head of Defence Intelligence and senior MI6 officials. They made contact with their US counterparts and those working with the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan before the mission was approved. The SAS and American teams were flown in a Black Hawk helicopter from Bagram air base at  low level just after midnight local time on Friday. Afghan troops are understood to have followed in a second helicopter. Weighed down with bullet-proof vests, weapons and heavy backpacks, the Special Forces troops then faced a gruelling trek of at least five miles across rough, forest- covered terrain before launching their attack. They had to land several miles away from their target because the heavily wooded terrain in the area made it difficult for the helicopters to touch down. It was also crucial that the gang did not hear the sound of the engines and rotor blades. Relieved: David Cameron gave the go-ahead for this morning's rescue of Helen Johnson, who had been working for a Swiss-based aid organisation . Kidnappers' lair: Aid worker Helen Johnston was held in a cave-dwelling complex . The Afghan troops were used to provide a security cordon around the area of cave dwellings where Miss Johnston and her colleagues were being held. The Special Forces troops, thought to number a dozen, moved in at about 2am, but were fired at by the kidnappers. The SAS men replied with a barrage of shots from weapons that included C8 SFW carbines fitted with grenade launchers, Heckler & Koch assault rifles, MP5 machine guns, L96A1 sniper rifles and Browning and Sig Sauer handguns. They are also thought to have carried a supply of Claymore anti-personnel mines and daggers tucked into boots to use in any close-quarters combat. Local sources said the gang was  heavily armed with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov assault rifles. By the end of the gun battle, six of the kidnappers had been shot dead, a similar number were captured and the four hostages were freed unharmed in what a senior military source described as a ‘textbook operation’. Heroic: The SAS were helicoptered to the cave where the hostages were being held and stormed it, killing the kidnappers and releasing all four captives alive . None of the rescue forces was injured or killed and they and the hostages were evacuated from near the scene by helicopter. A senior military source said yesterday: ‘It’s a great day for Her Majesty’s Forces on Diamond Jubilee weekend and an even better day for Helen Johnston’s family.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘It was an extraordinarily brave, breathtaking  operation that our troops had to carry out. I pay tribute to their skill and dedication.’ Speaking outside No 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister said the rescue should serve as a warning to terrorists across the world who targeted British citizens. ‘They should know if they take British citizens as hostage we do not pay ransoms, we do not trade prisoners. They can expect a swift and brutal end.’ Mr Cameron said decisions on rescue attempts were ‘extraordinarily difficult’ and ‘never rushed into’. But he said he decided the risks to the hostages lives were becoming too great. Mr Cameron added that he had spoken to Miss Johnston and to her parents and brother. ‘They are incredibly relieved about what has happened,’ he added. ‘It’s just a huge joy that they are finally going to be reunited and they are all healthy and all well.’ During their brief conversation, Miss Johnston thanked Mr Cameron for the efforts of all those involved in bringing her to safety. The Prime Minister said the rescue involved a number of British troops, helped by ISAF forces as well the Afghan government. Dead of night: Troops stormed the cave at 1am, in a bid to surprise the hostage takers while they were asleep . He confirmed that it involved a ‘long route march’ and said the  rescue team had at no time been  discovered. Paying tribute to the British troops involved, Mr Cameron said: ‘Above all, on this weekend of all weekends, we should say a enormous thank you to the incredibly brave forces that took part in this operation. ‘We will never be able to publish their names, but the whole country should know we have an extraordinary group of people who work for us who do amazingly brave things.’ He added: ‘This weekend we’re going to remember and commemorate 60 years of extraordinary work by Her Majesty the Queen and this weekend we can also remember the frankly incredible work that people who serve in her name do on our behalf all the time.’ Medair, which has worked in Afghanistan since 1996 providing relief to vulnerable and isolated communities, said it was relieved its workers had been released. Spokesman Aurilien Demaurex said that since the kidnapping, the charity had steered clear of publicity about the situation because it felt that might jeopardise efforts to secure a release. ‘Medair is relieved that our colleagues are safe. We are immensely grateful to all parties involved in ensuring their swift and safe return,’ Mr Demaurex said. Badakhstan: The hostages were held in a mountainous region close to the border with Tajikistan . The success of yesterday’s rescue comes in the wake of a number of tragedies involving aid staff helping the Afghan people. In August 2010, British doctor Karen Woo was shot dead in an ambush in Badakhshan as she delivered medical supplies. The Taliban claimed they killed the 36-year-old aid worker for ‘preaching Christianity.’ But Afghan authorities said her killers were more likely to have been bandits, as they stole Dr Woo’s belongings and passport along with those of her seven colleagues. Two months later, British aid worker Linda Norgrove died during a failed mission to rescue her from kidnappers in Afghanistan. Ms Norgrove, 36, was killed by a grenade thrown by a US soldier during the operation, although at her inquest Wiltshire coroner David Ridley did not blame him or his comrades for the tragic mistake. Three Afghans captured with her were released unharmed a few days later. In Nigeria in March building contractor Chris McManus was killed with an Italian colleague as Nigerian troops and British Special Boat Service commandos launched a rescue mission. Mr McManus had been held by terrorists associated with the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram since May last year.","Helen Johnston arrives in Kabul after her hostage ordeal came to end with a daring SAS recuse .

A new study into the bedroom habits of average Brit has found that people today have sex only three times every four weeks, a marked decrease from figures in 2001 which showed the average adult was having sex once a week. And the blame for that fall in under-the-covers activity has been placed on 'distractions' such as computers, iPads and mobile phones. The blame for a fall in under-the-covers activity has been placed on 'distractions' such as computers, iPads and mobile phones (picture posed by models) Prof Kaye Wellings of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the study leaders, said Brits could be 'blurring of the line in the home between the bedroom and outside' The figures have been taken from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, or Natsal, which is conducted every ten years. They indicate there has been a steady decline in British bedroom activity this decade. The results however did show a wide variation among the population with the latest figures suggesting that in 2012 a quarter of the people had sex more than seven times in four weeks, while the same number saw no action at all.

A haul of sporting memorabilia bought by a career criminal is set to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds after police seized the vast collection. Police hope to raise over £670,000 by auctioning off the prized sports collection of one of Britain's most notorious fraudsters - including Wayne Rooney’s boots and a signed Maradona football shirt. Thomas Scragg, 57, was jailed for 17 years after leading one of the biggest scams in British history in July 2010. The career criminal spent thousands of pounds of his ill-gotten gains on sporting memorabilia - including Wayne Rooney’s boots from the 2007 FA Cup Final. Up for sale: Diamond watches and sporting memorabilia are amongst the hoard of valuables which belonged to Tommy Scragg . Scragg also bought a Manchester United shirt from the 1963 FA Cup Final signed by club legends Dennis Law, Bobby Charlton and the late George Best worth £2,500. The sports-fan - who had snooker player Jimmy White as best man at his wedding - splashed out £3,000 on autographed pictures of Muhammad Ali and Brazil legend Pele. On July 8, 2010, police seized the valuables along with £200,000 worth of jewellery he gave to his girlfriend. Scragg also had a David Morris diamond suite necklace, earrings worth £70,000 in his home in Solihull, West Midlands. As well as his prized collection of . signed football shirts, police also discovered wads of £50 notes bundled . together and kept in drawers along with dozens of expensive gold . watches. Tommy Scragg with Rio Ferdinand, boxer Joe Egan and Ryan Giggs. The bulk of the 57-year-old's property consisted of around 70 football and boxing collectables . The items - valued at around £675,000 - have sat in West Midlands Police storerooms since 2008 when they were seized from Scragg's country house . A pair of football boots worn by Wayne Rooney at the 2007 FA cup final are expected to fetch several thousand pounds . They were found along with stacks of costly Louis Vitton, Gucci and Dior handbags and shoes. Scragg spent £14 million living a champagne lifestyle in glitzy London hotels and restaurants as well as splashing out on a fleet of luxury cars. The racket saw Scragg, 56, use his business Moya Payroll, which managed the wages of construction firm staff, to siphon off £26million in tax from 2002 to 2007. Workers would be paid in cash without deductions for tax being made, while VAT for work carried out by the construction firms – many of which were set up by Scragg – also went unaccounted. He would also include false expenses which affected his tax payments. Another investigation by West Midlands Police uncovered a further £8 million of stolen PAYE tax in a 10-month period from April 2007 to February 2008. Scragg’s empire collapsed and the criminal inquiry led to the convictions of 12 co-conspirators who helped him carry out the fraud. His accomplices laundered the cash in such a way as not to raise the suspicion of the authorities. Scragg was jailed for 13 years in November 2010 and was given a further four years in March 2011 - making it the second-longest sentence ever received in the UK for a white-collar crime.

All the goods are now set to be auctioned by police at Wilsons Auctions in Birmingham to help raise £1 million for local good causes. Detective Sergeant Derek Tinsley, from the Regional Asset Recovery Team (RART), said: . 'Tommy Scragg thought he had everything, the money, the lifestyle and the celebrity friends, but he lost it all when the law finally caught up with him. 'It’s our job to ensure Scragg never gets to reap the rewards of ripping-off the taxpayer and that the public are compensated for his crimes, which is why, when he was convicted, we seized all of his assets which we’ve now been given permission to sell off.

The parish council of Long Preston has been divided by Nazi slurs, corruption claims and a heated five-year health and safety row over the Christmas lights.

Mr Scott-Smith made the Nazi salute when the chairman refused to answer questions about councillors’ expenses. ‘I was told to remain silent,’ he said. ‘It turned into a shouting match between the chairman. It was farcical.’ He was protesting over an alleged conflict of interest as farmer Mr Thwaite was awarded a contract – reportedly worth up to £20,000 – to cut the grass and tend the verges in the village.

Traditional maps are still the navigation aid of choice among British motorists - but only just. In-car satellite navigation is inching ahead of the printed road atlas and is already first choice of younger drivers, according to a report from the AA. Its poll of nearly 24,000 drivers found nearly two thirds (63 per cent) of motorists had used a printed map in the past six months, compared to 60 per cent who used sat nav. Trusted tool: The faithful printed road map wins out, being used by 63 per cent of drivers . Just over a third (35 per cent) of drivers say they use both sat nav, and an atlas as back-up to plan a route - with just one in six (17 per cent) relying solely on sat nav. Regionally the proportion relying solely on sat nav ranges from one in five (20 per cent) in London to just one in seven (14 per cent ) in the South West. Younger drivers aged 18 to 24 are the group most likely to ignore maps altogether, with nearly half (43 per cent) depending on their sat navs alone to navigate the nation's roads. By contrast, fewer than one in ten (9 per cent) of over 65 year olds have ditched printed maps altogether, preferring a hard copy of the nation's highways to a digital direction-finder. Among those using both, the highest level is in Eastern England (40 per cent) compared to Scotland at just 27 per cent. About one in five (19 per cent) have used a print-out of the AA's own Route planner. Overall just over one in ten (11 per cent) plan their routes with a map combined with written instructions. However, just one in 20 (5 per cent) of 18 to 24 year olds do this compared to one in seven (15per cent) of over 65s. On the rise: 60 per cent of road users said they had used a sat nav recently, and many young people say it is the only way they find out where to go . When planning a route around one in 14 (7 per cent) use on-line maps, the same proportion use only a printed map, and one in every 100 say they never travel far enough to need a map or sat nav. The poll coincides with the launch of a new book called 'Mapping the Roads' by maps expert and author Mike Parker (AA Publishing, £25). Mr Parker said: 'The younger generation may be changing the way maps are used but even those using sat navs are still dependent on the mapping behind the devices, so maps and mapping the roads are still vital for the future of road travel.' He noted: 'Technology has brought us in-car navigation systems to make getting around without a human navigator far easier. However, there are numerous tales of those who rely solely on this technology finding themselves in either completely the wrong location or on inappropriate roads for their vehicles. 'With a good map, you can quite literally see the bigger picture, get a sense of the context of the landscape through which you're travelling and hunt down some unexpected gems along the way.' He added: 'The story of Britain's road development is also the story of its political, economic and social history, and the car, more than any other single factor, has shaped our landscape and changed our maps. 'Many people have a love-hate relationship with our busy, bustling, often congested, roads. 'Roads might be seen as a necessary evil to get us through the 'rush hour' to work but they also give us the freedom to live in different places, to visit friends and relatives, to travel and explore the many wonders that our country has to offer. Advances: Many cars, such as this Vauxhall Astra, now have built-in navigation systems . 'Without roads and maps our lives would be very different.' AA president Edmund King said: 'Most motorists are still turning to maps when planning car journeys even in the age of high tech navigation systems.' He noted: 'As a nation, the British are obsessed with directions and maps; just ask a group of people for directions and you will likely receive a variety of routes based on personal preferences and shortcut knowledge. ' He said: 'As the country's road network has developed, so has the technology behind the mapping. 'We depend on our road network for 86 per cent of passenger journeys and more than 90 per cent of freight including almost everything we buy in the shops or online. 'So knowing the best route is crucial to making these journeys as easy as possible. '","AA survey of 24,000 drivers shows that older methods still hold sway .

Work on the HS2 railway will begin in just four months, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin promised yesterday. A Bill paving the way for the £50billion link to be built is to be published today and the Cabinet Minister pledged to face down the scheme’s critics. Opponents will still have a chance to petition Parliament and have their case heard by a committee of MPs. Despite this concession, Mr McLoughlin said work would be starting early next spring. Prime Minister David Cameron received a declaration of support for HS2 from leaders and representatives of the UK's ten largest cities outside of London a few days ago. Supporters hope to see a new high-speed line running from London to Birmingham by 2026 . Preliminary contracts worth up to . £60million can now be handed out, though further legal hurdles remain . before the actual railway can go ahead. ‘HS2 . is the most ambitious and important infrastructure project in the UK . since we built the M25 30 years ago, and in 30 more it will be just as . integral a part of the nation’s prosperity,’ Mr McLouglin told the Sun . on Sunday. He added that . people had previously opposed large projects such as the M25 and the . Channel Tunnel but public opinion had eventually changed in support. ‘We . can’t let the opponents who have learned nothing from the past strangle . our future growth. I will not let the naysayers drag this country . down.’ Mr McLoughlin said HS2 would create 22,000 jobs in the next five years and revitalise towns along its 351-mile route. But . opponents of the £50 billion HS2 high-speed rail project are to . demonstrate in Westminster as an HS2 Hybrid Bill begins its passage . through Parliament. The . protest today is being organised by the Stop HS2 group with . demonstrators expected to come from as far away at Cheshire and . Yorkshire. Mr McLoughlin will give evidence before . the House of Commons Transport Committee on Tuesday, as will chiefs at . auditing firm KPMG, which has claimed HS2 would boost the economy by . £15billion a year. However, . transport economists told the committee they disagreed with the . £15billion prediction, with one saying the key calculation behind the . figure was 'essentially made up'. Opposition to HS2 has been vociferous and transport experts and economists have poured doubt on its forecasted economic benefit . A 'paving' bill - officially called the . High Speed (Preparation) Bill - received royal assent last week and has . kick-started the legislation that supporters hope will see a new . high-speed line running through Tory heartlands in the Chilterns from . London to Birmingham by 2026. A . second phase, taking the line to north west and north east England, is . due for completion in 2032/33. The cost of the project is now put at . £42.6billion with a further £7.5billion for the trains. Ahead . of the Westminster protest, Stop HS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin said: . 'With the widespread criticism of HS2 from independent bodies, it is . quite depressing that MPs and Lords speaking for the project recently . are so ill-informed and unwilling to listen to the exceptionally sound . arguments which make it clear HS2 should not go ahead. 'On . Monday, people from up and down the HS2 route will descend on to . Parliament, not to say they don't want HS2 to come near their homes, but . to say that they have studied the plans and justifications for HS2 and . that it should be scrapped completely. 'It . is sad that people in affected communities know more about HS2 than the . majority of Parliamentarians know about what HS2 means, and we hope to . change that.' Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, has welcomed publication of the Hybrid Bill. He said: 'We believe Britain needs not only a new high speed rail line but a high speed rail network. The House of Commons Transport Committee will be taking evidence from Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin on Tuesday . 'We would, ideally, like to see HS2 . run the length of the United Kingdom, being built from Scotland and the . south at the same time, meeting in the middle, linking HS1 (the Channel . Tunnel high-speed link) and going via Heathrow. 'The . number of passengers on our railways has doubled since 1995 while rail . freight traffic has risen by 65 per cent over the same period. 'The existing rail network is operating at near full capacity and neither new motorways nor domestic air travel are environmentally sustainable options to meet the mobility requirements of a British population expected to grow by 10 million by 2033.' Last week a report by a business group in Camden in north London claimed HS2 would mean big job and economic losses in an area which boasts some of London's top markets. This was refuted by HS2 Ltd. Today Camden council said: 'As a council we are opposed to the specific HS2 proposals because of the damage the scheme would do to our community in lost jobs, demolished or heavily impacted houses, threatened schools, shut down businesses. 'There is simply no business case for the HS1/HS2 link up, but it would cause substantial damage to the Camden Town area.' The merits of HS2 have been debated amid more antagonism and vitriol than those with long associations with transport projects can remember. Labour, although appearing to be cooling towards the project amid concerns at its high cost, seem to be supporting it in Parliament even though former Labour cabinet ministers Lord Mandelson and Alistair Darling have expressed reservations. HS2 Ltd spokesman Ben Ruse said: 'HS2 is the country's largest ever project. As such it warrants debate. However we must be clear that HS2 will yield hugely significant benefits while addressing the cripplingly strained transport network. 'Those that oppose HS2 are risking the very future of the country.' An HS2 proposed train design.

The huge storm that is bringing snow to most of the nation this Holiday week has already caused the cancellation of 200 flights today and tragically 14 deaths. The huge weather system has already caused up to a foot of snow to fall in the mountainous regions of Utah and Colorado, claiming 13 lives - including a 4-year-old girl who was killed in a car crash on icy roads in New Mexico. With up to 43 million people expected to travel 50 miles or more to spend their Thanksgiving with loved ones, the public has been advised to avoid driving unless necessary during the worst of the weather conditions that are expected on Tuesday and Wednesday. Scroll down for video . The perfect storm? Map of U.S. showing where a winter storm is expected to disrupt travel plans over the Thanksgiving holiday; includes information on where the storm has already has already hit . Travel threat: Thanksgiving travel plans for millions of Americans face disruption from a deadly storm that threatens to dump snow on inland regions of several Northeast states on the eve of the holiday . Up to three million people are thought to be flying this week and they have been told to expect delays in flights on Tuesday and Wednesday leaving New York, Boston, Baltimore and Washington D.C. However, this was not due to snow or icy conditions, but rather a forecast of low cloud and high wind which could affect take-offs and landings. In addition to the snow, those areas in the Northeast not experiencing snow will see gusts of up to 50 mph and rain through Tuesday evening and Wednesday. The storm is to clear by Thanksgiving, but will leave New York City chilly for the annual Macy's Parade. Nor'easter: The storm will hit Texas and the Southern states on Monday before it starts to move up towards the Carolina's on Tuesday . Travel Days: By Tuesday and Wednesday on the eve of Thanksgiving there could be serious problems with driving and airport delays across the Northeast . Potential for chaos: Meteorologists said they expected the Arctic mass to head south and east and threaten plans for Tuesday and Wednesday as people hit the roads and airports for some of the busiest travel days of the year . Predicted snowfall: It is predicted that up to 12-inches of snow might fall on the Northeast of the nation for the eve of Thanksgiving . Meteorologists said they expected the Arctic mass to head south and east and threaten plans for Tuesday and Wednesday as people hit the roads and airports for some of the busiest travel days of the year. More than 300 flights were canceled at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, representing about one-third of the scheduled departures, and a spokeswoman said deicing equipment had been prepared as officials planned for the worst in a flurry of conference calls and meetings. 'It's certainly going to be a travel impact as we see the first few people making their way for Thanksgiving,' weather service meteorologist Tom Bradshaw said. 'The worst is going to come on Tuesday and run into Wednesday, so if people traveling can get out before then, or wait until afterward, that would be the best thing,' he said. Delays: Crews spray deicing solution onto an American Airlines 737 before departure at Dallas-Fort Worth International airport, Monday, Nov. 25, 2013. Winter weather has caused travel disruptions throughout the area . David McCain of Abilene relaxes in the seats of the ticketing area for American airlines in Terminal C after his flight home to Abilene was canceled, as an arctic cold front begins to move into the North Texas area on Sunday . Temperatures: The weather system could bring freezing temperatures at night across the Northeast on the eve of Thanksgiving . The system will clear the East Coast by Thanksgiving Day, leaving just chilly temperatures in New York City for the annual parade . The large storm is expected to drop up to 12-inches of snow on Buffalo and Syracuse and up to eight inches on Pittsburgh. Indeed, the storm is heading for Texas and late Sunday night a winter storm warning for most of North Texas had been replaced with a winter weather advisory through noon Monday. A mix of rain, light freezing rain and light sleet was expected, but meteorologist Steve Fano with the weather service's Dallas-Fort Worth office said the temperatures would not be as cold as initially forecast. 'They will still go below freezing in some places, just not as much below freezing as we initially thought,' Fano said. Parts of Oklahoma have been under a winter storm warning, while other areas of the state have been under an advisory. Socked in: Snow battered New Mexico and made many roads treacherous. Here, cars can be seen sliding down a road in Albuquerque . Some communities in southwestern Oklahoma woke up to snow Sunday, including Altus, where several inches fell. 'It looks great. I love the snow,' said Damaris Machabo, a receptionist at a Holiday Inn motel. The snow and freezing temperatures made driving in the area treacherous, but Machabo said she had no problems getting to work early Sunday. Forecasts called for more snow in the area later in the day. Portions of New Mexico -- especially in some of the higher elevations -- also had several inches of snow, and near white-out conditions were reported along stretches of Interstate 40 west of Albuquerque. Then along the New Mexico-Texas border, into the El Paso area, a mix of snow, sleet and ice forced some road closures and created messy driving conditions. On the alert: A White Chinese Goose roams on the icy grass surrounding a pond in Odessa, Texas, where authorities have issued a winter storm warning . So cold: 'It feels like we're in the middle of winter and it's not even Thanksgiving,' says a senior meteorologist . Flagstaff in Arizona had 11 inches of snow by early Sunday, and was expected to get another inch by the end of the day before the storm petered out. Metro Phoenix and other parts of central Arizona received between 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 inches of rain over the course of the storm. The storms caused cancellations of sporting events and parades and damaged the roofs of homes across Arizona. In Tucson, firefighters on Friday recovered the body of a man who was swept away by high water in the Santa Cruz River. Tucson police said Sunday an autopsy revealed signs of trauma, and they were investigating the death as a homicide. They did not say whether they had ruled out the storm as a cause of his death. Some 1,000 people have already been left without power in Stafford, Willington, and Tolland, Connecticut, after high winds brought down a tree on a major power line, NBC News Connecticut reported.

Treacherous: Caltrans set a up a chains required station Friday just south of Mountain High Resort in Wrightwood, Calif . By early Sunday, the weather was blamed for at least eight deaths in several fatal traffic accidents. The storm also caused hundreds of rollover accidents, including one that injured three members of singer Willie Nelson's band when their bus hit a pillar on Interstate 30 near Sulphur Springs, about 75 miles northeast of Dallas. Dallas prepared for the storm by declaring 'Ice Force Level 1,' which is code for sending 30 sanding trucks to troubleshoot hazardous road conditions. At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, spokeswoman Cynthia Vega said most of the canceled flights were in the afternoon and evening hours and were with American Airlines and American Eagle. Darius Gomez, 9, center, and Amanda Lopez, 7, both from Palmdale, Calif, make snow angels together . The possibility of ice on the runways led to a series of conference calls and meetings early Sunday, she added, noting the airport had liquid and solid deicers ready for use. The storm system, though, was particularly hard to predict because a couple of degrees here or there with the temperature will determine whether regions see rain, sleet or snow, Bradshaw said. 'It's very difficult to pin those down,' he said. 'It's slow moving and it's sort of bringing its energy out in pieces so it's kind of hard to time these as they come across with a great deal of accuracy.'","Powerful weather system barreling across the country to affect up to 43 million Thanksgiving travelers .

Air travel poses ‘no significant risk’ for pregnant women and their unborn babies – even up to three weeks before the birth, doctors say. Healthy mothers-to-be having pregnancies without complications should be able to fly until the 37th week, their latest advice reveals. The most serious risk for women at 35,000ft is premature labour, say experts from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Advice: Healthy mothers-to-be having pregnancies without complications should be able to fly until the 37th week . Expectant mothers need not fear medical risks posed by full-body security scanners or a fall in oxygen pressure during flights, and have no reason to worry about travel sickness and deep vein thrombosis on longer flights if they take precautions. Those who are at risk of early labour because of factors such as a multiple birth should not fly from 32 weeks, says the college. The new advice is similar to existing recommendations from the International Air Travel Association and NHS Choices. However, many airlines still bar women from boarding if they are more than 36 weeks into a pregnancy. Some carriers request a doctor’s letter at 28 weeks to confirm the expected date of delivery and lack of complications. The latest advice said pregnant women should pay attention to the risk of DVT, which occurs in cramped conditions or during periods of long immobility. Doctors say it is a ‘concern of most pregnant women’ and can be combated with graduated elastic compression stockings. Takeoff: Those who are at risk of early labour because of factors such as a multiple birth should not fly from 32 weeks, say experts from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists . Body scanners, which use ionising radiation for security checks, also pose no additional hazard to pregnant women because of the low doses involved. However, obstetricians need to watch for medical conditions that may complicate the pregnancy and give rise to problems during air travel, such as severe anaemia, recent haemorrhage, serious cardiac or respiratory disease and recent bone fractures. A lack of iodine during pregnancy could harm a child’s future exam prospects, a study has found. Children born to women who are . deficient in the element – which is essential to brain development – . were 60 per cent more likely to have low IQ scores by the ages of 8 and . 9, researchers from Surrey and Bristol universities claim. Professor Ian Greer, of the University of Liverpool, who wrote the scientific paper producing the new advice, said: ‘For uncomplicated pregnancies there is no reason to give advice against commercial air travel, and specifically there is no issue with travel in early pregnancy as the main consideration is risk of labour. ‘However if the woman has a history of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy it would be sensible to suggest ultrasound prior to travel to confirm the location and viability of the pregnancy.’ Amber Howard, of travel insurance website Holidaysafe.co.uk, said many women can be left at the boarding gate if airlines suspect they exceed the company’s limit on how close they are to giving birth. ‘They can also deny boarding under health and safety rules if they feel that a pregnant woman may not be mobile enough to leave the aircraft in an emergency,’ she said.","Most serious risk for women at 35,000ft is premature labour, say experts .

China has collected at least £2billion in fines from parents who broke the country’s strict one child policy. The full amount emerged only because the country’s National Health and Family Planning Commission has begun a probe into where the money has gone. The government department said yesterday that 24 provincial governments had failed to account for ‘20 billion yuan’ (£1.97 billion) worth of penalties handed to families who flouted family planning laws last year. China has collected at least £2billion in fines from parents who broke the country¿s strict one child policy (file picture) A further ten provinces have yet to reveal how much they collected in fines during 2012, according to China’s state-run media, suggesting the total amount levied could run into millions more. The fines are known as ‘social support fees’ and can cost families thousands of pounds per extra child. The money is supposed to compensate local governments for the burden of additional children on social services. But provincial chiefs have so far refused to reveal how the revenue collected during 2012 has been spent. Wu Youshui, a lawyer campaigning on the issue in Zhejiang province, said: ‘The system has faced unquestioned abuse of power and corruption.’ Public anger has been growing about the one-child policy which was introduced in the late 1970s to prevent population growth spiralling in the country which now has 1.3 billion inhabitants. Policy: The policy covers 63 per cent of China, though rules have been relaxed over the years to allow some couples to have a second child . The policy covers 63 per cent of China, though rules have been relaxed over the years to allow some couples to have a second child. Officials in the country are known to carefully monitor women for signs of pregnancy. Many women are escorted to clinics to undergo forced abortions if they get pregnant for a second time and the one-child policy has been attacked for encouraging infanticide of female babies because males are preferred. Those couples who manage to give birth in secret are often later handed a financial penalty. At a key Communist Party meeting last month top officials announced that any couple where one parent is a single child can now have two children. The move has thrown a spotlight on how money from fines is spent. Famed Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou - who directed the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony - owes thousands of pounds in fines for having three children. And earlier this month a father of five from a poor rural community killed himself over fines he couldn’t afford. The NHFPC has vowed to continue punishing any violation of the law.","National Health and Family Planning Commission has begun a probe .

Michael Chopra arriving at Newcastle Crown Court, to give evidence as a witness in a £750,000 cocaine trial involving an alleged drugs factory . Former Premier League striker Michael Chopra has lifted the lid on his gambling addiction and spoken about how players would bet sums of £30,000 on the team bus. Mr Chopra was giving evidence in the trial of four men who are accused of being part of a £750,000 cocaine cartel. But their defence says that £50,000 found in a car was actually the player's gambling debts. Giving evidence at Newcastle Crown Court, Chopra, 29, went into detail about the level of debt he got into and how he and his family were threatened by loan sharks. He explained that just a year after making his debut for Newcastle at 17, he already knew he had a problem and had racked up debts of tens of thousands of pounds. He said: 'I started gambling when I was about 17, when I first played for Newcastle I was travelling with the first team. 'Players would gamble on the bus and I got involved. We would take thousands of pounds onto the bus, anything up to £30,000. 'It might change hands playing cards on the bus, we would go to the bank before and take out the money. It was part of team bonding. 'We were playing for real cash, if you were playing for £30,000 you would have it with you at the time.' He . said his addiction got so bad that he would set his alarm for 3am so he . could place bets on games that were taking place in South America. Michael Chopra (right) pictured with Jermaine Jenas playing for England under 17s in 2000. He signed for Newcastle aged 17, and it is there that he claims his gambling problems began . He also revealed that after playing for Newcastle and Cardiff, the reason he then signed for Sunderland was to use the signing on fee to pay off his debts. 'I was at Cardiff for one year and then I went to Sunderland. I got a signing on fee and paid my debts off. 'The main reason I went to Sunderland was to pay my debts off. When you go to the Premier League you earn more money.' Prosecutors in the trial of four men accused of being part of cocaine cartel claim £50,000 found in a car was drugs cash. Mr Chopra smiles as he prepares to give evidence at Newcastle Crown Court . But jurors were told yesterday it was money former Newcastle United and Sunderland striker Chopra owed to underworld loan sharks. Michael Chopra celebrates a goal while playing for Newcastle in 2006 . One of the accused barrister's told the court: 'Michael Chopra had a gambling addiction and spent or wasted, you may think, an awful lot of money gambling. 'He would bet on anything and reached a stage where he was owing increasing amounts of money. 'The amount he spent runs not into the thousands or hundreds of thousands but into the millions and he even owed money to team mates.' He said there came a time when Chopra was unable to get credit from legal bookmakers and was offered money by loan sharks in Liverpool. The barrister said: 'Eventually they started putting the squeeze on to him and they contacted his football club.' Unable to loan money from the bank, Chopra is then said to have borrowed money from shadowy figures in Glasgow. One of the men on trial is John Somerville, who knew Chopra’s father and agreed to help the footballer get the money to the men in Glasgow, Mr Bloomfield said. When police stopped a car leaving Somerville’s Newcastle home, they found £50,000, which prosecutors say is linked to the alleged drugs gang. The barrister said: 'That money was nothing to do with drugs, it was Chopra’s from the loan sharks to pay off his gambling debts. 'That’s what John Somerville was doing, not buying drugs, he was paying Michael Chopra’s gambling debts off.' Police allegedly found a flat in Washington turned into a drugs factory.

Widow Rebekah Sturdey, 56, hid her husband Geoffrey's body on their remote farm in Beth Berith near Tregaron, West Wales, and collected more than £70,000 of state handouts until she was caught in 2012. Mr Sturdey was 60-years-old when he was last seen alive in October 2008, but his body was only discovered by police last year after the Department of Work and Pensions became 'concerned about the farmer’s welfare'. Cover-up: The body of Geoffrey Sturdey was hidden by his wife Rebekah on a remote farm in West Wales . Swansea Crown Court heard how the Iranian-born Mrs Sturdey took disability and pensions allowance in her spouse's name for four years. She pleaded guilty to preventing the lawful and decent burial of her husband and was told she could face jail. Two other women - the farmer’s carer Boqer-Ore Adie, 43, and friend Carmel Adie, 24 - also admitted the same charge. Boqer-Ore Adie’s daughter Hazel Adie, 20, pleaded not guilty which was accepted by the prosecution. The four women lived together at the isolated smallholding with Mr Sturdey. Mrs Sturdey helped on her husband’s 20-acre farm when he became disabled and employed Boqer-Orie Adie as his full-time carer. Family: Hazel and Carmel Adie arriving at Swansea Crown Court.

Prosecutor Jacqui Lis told an earlier hearing: 'All four women were arrested after inquiries had been made by the Department of Work and Pensions as to Mr Sturdey’s whereabouts.' Sturdey and Boqer-Ore Adie admitted fraud by failing to notify authorities they were in receipt of disability allowance and pension credits in the farmer’s name. The court heard Sturdey and Boqer-Ore Adie had claimed £21,700 in disability allowance and £36,000 in pension credits. Boqer-Ore Adie claimed a further £9,400 in carer’s allowance and £10,100 in income support for Mr Sturdey.

It's Christmas time and it isn't just a season of good will and cheer, it's also the most likely time to conceive. National Birth Records for the UK indicate the most birthdays fall in September - making December a prime baby-making month. Some parents may plot a December conception on purpose to achieve an all-important September birthday, making their child one of the oldest in their class at school which has been proven to give them an academic advantage. Love is in the air: The festive spirit helps many couples conceive in December . But other couples struggling with fertility issues aren't as lucky as to be able to plan a conception. So Jo Hemmings, relationship expert for We-Vibe, said December can also be an excellent opportunity for those who have been trying for a baby to finally get lucky. She explains: 'If you are trying for a baby, Christmas . is a great opportunity to make the most of your time off together. And the cold weather also means that your partner's sperm quality is higher too. 'Trying to conceive puts pressure and stress on couples, but remember to . enjoy the experience.' Jo recommends women keen to conceive should make the most of the cosy nights in the winter months provide and have some fun rather than stressing about getting pregnant. She said: 'It's important to enjoy the simple . pleasures of sex and not just save it for when you're at your most . fertile,’ says Jo. ‘Conceiving a baby should be a joyous affair, however . long it takes. If you get stuck in the routine of only having sex on . your fertile days, it can be difficult to see making love as anything . more than a baby-making process.' She added: ‘December is the ideal time to reconnect . sexually with your partner - it's what cosy winter nights were meant . for! Watch a sexy movie together or dress up . and role-play in some seductive kit. Many outfits include props like . gloves, feather boas or corsets. They always feel appropriate in the . winter. 'Get out those stockings and suspenders, which . probably haven't seen the light of day during the summer months.' Be safe: Christmas festivities can also lead to some unplanned pregnancies if contraception is forgotten in a drunken fling . But while some couples may be hoping December will bring them a much-longed for baby, others might find it an unwelcome consequence of the festive season. Jo explained: 'The lead up to Christmas is becoming ever longer. It's party season, we're in a good mood and the drink is flowing. It's easy to be forgetful in all the merriment. It's not only a time of celebration, it's also the month when we're likely to forget to use our contraception.' For those who don't want to end up with a baby in 2014 thanks to a drunken festive fling, she has the following advice. 'If you're on the pill, try and take it at a regular time each morning in December, perhaps leaving the packet on your bedside table as a reminder for you, if you're tempted to forget. 'If you use a barrier method of contraception, such as a cap, pop it in before you go out for the evening. Alternatively, invest in a few festive condoms - there are loads of fun varieties available - and keep those in your bag or again, on the bedside table. That way you'll be making seasonal merriment without making a baby!'","Most British birthdays fall in September according to National Birth Records .

A bridge of material connects the two galaxies, showing they are interacting. The blue blobs outside of the circle are galaxies located much closer to us . The galaxy pair was initially identified in the Herschel data as a single bright source, named HXMM01. Follow-up observations showed that it . is in fact two galaxies, each boasting a stellar mass equal to about . 100 billion Suns and an equivalent amount of gas. The galaxies are linked by bridge of gas, indicating that they are merging. Capturing the creation of this type of large, short-lived star body is extremely rare, the team said, . HXMM01 is fading away as fast as it forms, a victim of its own cataclysmic birth, the researchers say. As the two parent galaxies smashed together, they gobbled up huge amounts of hydrogen, emptying that corner of the universe of the star-making gas. 'These galaxies entered a feeding frenzy that would quickly exhaust the food supply in the following hundreds of million years and lead to the new galaxy's slow starvation for the rest of its life,' said lead author Hai Fu of the University of California in Irvine. 'This monster system of interacting galaxies is the most efficient . star-forming factory ever found in the Universe at a time when it was . only 3 billion years old.

But cosmologist Asantha Cooray, the UC Irvine team's leader, said that they and colleagues across the globe found definitive proof that cosmic mergers and the resulting highly efficient consumption of gas for stars are causing the quick burnout.","Two galaxies collided .

Now a beaver has been found swimming in the wild again in Devon. But it’s a mystery where it came from. Strangely enough, it was spotted on the River Otter in Budleigh Salterton by Lorna Douglas, 35, as she walked her dogs. ‘At first I thought it was an otter but when I looked closer it was clear it was a beaver,’ she said. Spotted: Lorna Douglas spied the animal in the River Otter. The Budleigh beaver is believed to be the first of its kind spotted in England found living wild since they became extinct . ‘It didn’t seem perturbed by the dogs and swam around in circles a few times before going back under a tree. ‘I went back that evening with a camera and sat watching him for an hour. It was amazing. ‘He often goes up to trees and drags large chunks back to the shallows and then chews on the bark. ‘He seems to be really happy. He sits in the shallows and then hides inside the river bank. One day I followed him along the river and watched him go under banks, tree roots and hedges.’ Beavers became extinct in Britain towards the end of the 16th century through over-hunting, but in recent years they have been reintroduced in enclosures throughout the UK. Rare: The species died out at the end of the 16th century but has been reintroduced in enclosures in recent years. Experts say it is likely that the animal escaped from captivity . A breeding pair were brought to Ottery St Mary – about 10 miles upriver from Budleigh Salterton – in 2006. They had two young – known as ‘kits’ – but their owners confirmed yesterday that their beavers were all accounted for. In October 2008, three of the giant rodents, which grow to about 4ft long, including a 1ft tail, and can live for 24 years, escaped from their home in Lifton, Devon, but were all recaptured. Beavers were released into the wild in Scotland in 2009 and have successfully bred, but the Budleigh beaver is thought to be the first found living wild south of the border. Experts say it is likely to have escaped from captivity. Derek Gow, who keeps a small colony of beavers on his farm near Launceston, Cornwall, said: ‘It is definitely not one of ours, but it is a positive sign that one has been spotted. ‘They bring so much pleasure to people’s lives and are very important to Britain’s rivers and ecology.’","Beaver spotted on the River Otter in Budleigh Salterton .

A grandfather is seeing red instead of stars after being banned from using his telescope in case he is a Peeping Tom. Peter Norman, who has suffered a number of cardiac arrests, ditched his hectic life to settle in Swansea Marina with wife Kay to nurture his health and explore his astronomy passion. But after fixing his 18-inch telescope onto the balcony, he received a letter from his landlord ordering him to pull it down to preserve the privacy of other tenants - even though his balcony overlooks water. Stargazer: Pensioner Peter Norman has been banned from using a telescope on his balcony of his Swansea home in by his landlord . The former carpenter was so upset by the warning he gathered the support of almost 50 neighbours backing him to be allowed to continue his hobby. Peter is now fearful that the stress of the situation could trigger another angina attack. The 64-year-old said: 'Astronomy is a bit of a passion of mine, and I was looking forward to taking advantage of the location of the new home, because it has great views of the south and western skies. 'So I bought myself a new telescope and fixed it to the balcony. But then I got a letter to say I couldn’t use it, or any binoculars. 'But from the angle it is situated, it is not possible to see into other properties. You can see some from the side, but only the balconies, and not inside them. Swansea Marina, where Mr Norman was hoping to enjoy excellent views of the south and western skies . 'But the telescope was in a fixed position on the balcony at the front, which doesn’t overlook any properties.' The grandfather-of-twelve was once given an award from South Wales Police for organising a community support group similar to Neighbourhood Watch. Since receiving notice to remove his telescope, he sought support from his new neighbours, claiming he got 48 signatures from those living nearby backing his bid to be able to keep his telescope. And he questioned whether the instruction passed onto him meant he was not even able to use a mobile phone on the balcony. Peter said: 'The letter said it requested the telescope, or any recording device or camera device, was removed from the balcony within 24 hours. 'Does that mean I can’t even take photos of my grandchildren on the balcony with a mobile phone?' Peter’s landlord Coastal Housing said the decision was imperative to preserve neighbours’ dignity. A spokesman said: 'Coastal Housing’s priority is for its tenants to have quiet enjoyment of their tenancies and this applies equally to all residents of our 69 apartments at Harbour Quay. 'We do not want to spoil Peter’s pursuit of his astronomy hobby, but have to balance this with ensuring the privacy of other tenants is not encroached upon. 'We have not received a petition from Peter, but a number of Harbour Quay residents who have signed it have contacted us and asked for their signatures to be removed. 'They have further lodged complaints about the length of time that Peter uses his telescope daily, as his balcony overlooks those of a considerable number of other apartments, and privacy concerns are discouraging others from using their balconies.' Coastal Housing insist Peter can continue to use his telescope elsewhere on his property as long as it does not threaten to intrude on others .

Covered in bruises, his skin red and smarting, this  sobbing eight-year-old has just been stripped to his underwear, tied to a tree and beaten by his father. If that wasn’t shocking enough, many in the sizeable crowd that gathered around applauded as the father lashed him with a stick. The boy from Nanchong in Sichuan province, south-west China, skipped classes after receiving the equivalent of £10 from his father. He had also reportedly failed to return on time earlier in the week. After driving around the city in search of his son, the father caught him near a market and exacted his punishment. A crowd gathers at the scene where a father has . stripped his nine-year-old son and tied him to a tree before viciously . beating him. The man said his son was being punished for skipping school . and failing to return home . The picture taker, Lin Gang, said that . the temperature was only 5C when the all but naked child was tied to the . tree and beaten. Corporal punishment of the kind meted out to the Nanchong boy is lawful in China, although there are legal provisions to prevent excessive child abuse. The law even goes to far as to allow authorities to order parents to subject their children to 'strict discipline' if they are guilty of serious misbehaviour. Traditionally, corporal punishment is common among Chinese families, although attitudes are beginning to change in the country. In a letter to the South China Morning Post, Melody Koo, a pupil at Marknoll Fathers' School, wrote: 'Many traditional Chinese families use corporal punishment to teach their children. 'They believe that once the pain is over, the lesson will be engraved on the child's mind and the mistake will not be repeated. It's an easy way of ""teaching"" children right from wrong.' According to a 2010 study cited by the Global Initiative to End Corporal Punishment, around half of of girls and three in five boys in China had experienced 'mild' corporal punishment in the past month. That included spanking hitting, or slapping with a bare hand; hitting or slapping on the hand, arm, or leg; shaking; or hitting with an object, according to the study published in the International Journal of Paediatrics. A further 10 per cent of girls and 15 per cent of boys reported experiencing severe corporal punishment, which included hitting or slapping on the face, head, or ears or repeated beating with an implement. Corporal punishment is common among traditional Chinese families, and lawful in the country. A recent study found half of girls and three fifths of boys had been subjected to mild corporal punishment at home . This case from Nanchong undoubtedly falls into that latter category. According to the father, his son had been absent from school for several days without his knowledge, and the boy didn't even come back home the previous evening. In the morning, the father saw his son wandering the street. The boy tried to run, but his father caught him and beat him. With onlookers' interference and persuasion, the father soon untied his son and took him away.","It is legal and common practice for parents to beat their children in China .

'Tasteless': The offending Tweet was posted by the charity - and then later removed . In high places: Samantha Cameron, an ambassador for the charity and Save the Children UK CEO Justin Forsyth . It is also embarrassing for David Cameron, whose wife Samantha is a Save the Children ‘ambassador’ and who hosted a No10 reception for it. Earlier this month she launched its £1million Christmas Jumper Day appeal to encourage people to wear a festive sweater and give £1. On Friday, all Downing Street staff turned up for work in a woolly. Lady Thatcher, who died in April, was criticised by Labour while she was Prime Minister for refusing to back tougher anti-apartheid sanctions. But ex-Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit last night led a chorus of Tory criticism of the charity. ‘I would have thought a charity called Save the Children would have been better employed saving children than sending out malevolent, tasteless and stupid tweets about such an event,’ he said. Disrespectful: Former Prime Minister Lady Thatcher died in April this year . ‘Having met Nelson Mandela I know from personal experience he did not have an ounce of hostility towards Margaret Thatcher or her sensible stance on South Africa.

It was later deleted. The charity’s profile has been raised since Mr Forsyth became chief executive, partly thanks to its emotive TV adverts. But not all the headlines have been favourable. Mr Forsyth has been branded one of Britain’s growing number of charity ‘fat cats’. He earns £20,500 a year more than Mr Cameron; had £11,000 put in his pension last year and claimed more than £3,000 expenses.

The charity denied the allegation. Mr Forsyth also provoked controversy by arguing the charity’s work should include rescuing ‘starving’ British children, blaming Tory ‘cuts’.

A police force has been accused of trivialising rape after it distributed a bizarre Christmas poem about the crime. The verses – a version of ’Twas the Night Before Christmas adapted to tell the story of a woman being sexually attacked – were composed by Nottinghamshire Police as part of an awareness campaign. But members of the public branded the poem, renamed The Nightmare Before Christmas, ‘disgusting’ and ‘insensitive’. Critics have said Nottinghamshire Police's version of Twas The Night Before Christmas trivialises the horror of sex attacks . It features on a poster distributed at train stations across the county. At first glance, the design appears to be aimed at children, with a cartoon drawing of a snow-covered cottage with smoke coming out of the chimney. But women’s groups have called for it to be removed immediately, saying it is too explicit for children and that it belittles the horror of sex attacks. Cathy Saunders, of the Nottingham branch of Women’s Aid, said last night: ‘It’s a disgrace and should be withdrawn immediately. I utterly condemn it. ‘I have spoken to some of our clients who have been victims of sexual assault and they have been utterly distressed and shocked by this poem. ‘They feel that the re-working of a poem aimed at children trivialises the worst event in their lives … Children familiar with the proper Christmas poem would be left very confused if they came across this police version.’She added that the force should concentrate on a ‘stark, unambiguous message that rape is wrong’. One verse that has drawn particular criticism from campaigners reads: ‘Although she screamed “no” it happened in a flash / As soon as she could free herself she made a desperate dash.’ Earlier this week Nottinghamshire Police had to re-name an anti-crime poster campaign called Badvent after critics deemed it to be in poor taste . A spokesman for the group Sexual Abuse Survivors said the phrase ‘happened in a flash’ was not an accurate portrayal of a victim’s experience. She added: ‘That experience can feel like it goes on forever and even after the attack it will stay with that person for a very long time almost like a recording in their mind that goes over and over again.’ But Nottinghamshire Police denied the poem was offensive and said the poster aimed to make would-be rapists more aware of  the catastrophic harm sex attacks have on women. Despite admitting it had ‘caused a stir’ and holding a meeting yesterday to discuss the complaints, the force decided not to remove the poem from its website. Nottinghamshire Police yesterday insisted they had consulted two unnamed women’s groups before the poster was distributed. Superintendent . Helen Chamberlain apologised to anyone who had been offended by the . ‘re-working’ of the poem – traditionally read to children on Christmas . Eve. But she added: . ‘Issuing safety messages for people who are out enjoying Christmas . festivities is a valuable way of helping to protect, in the main, women . and girls from sexual attacks. ‘However, . sometimes, constantly reiterating these messages can make women feel . that they are at fault if they are attacked … We want women to know that . if they are raped or sexually assaulted, they are not to blame. ‘Our message to men is that it’s not . acceptable to take advantage of a woman because she has had a drink or . is being sociable. And women shouldn’t have to tolerate or be forced to . guard themselves from predatory behaviour.’ But Jo Costello, of campaign group Ending Victimisation, said last night that the police force had ‘failed spectacularly’. ‘Many . women tell us that they didn’t want to report to the police for a . variety of reasons, predominantly the fear of being blamed for their own . sexual assault,’ she said. ‘Police campaigns such as this add to the . commonly-held view that women can somehow prevent rape.’ Earlier . this week Nottinghamshire Police was forced to rename an anti-crime . poster it had called a ‘Badvent calendar’ after critics complained it . was in poor taste.","Support group says force's version of poem trivialises horror of sex attacks .

Furious neighbours are urging Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth and her husband Matthew Freud to keep the noise down after a spate of raucous celebrity parties at their London home. Police were called to the most recent bash at the £24million property in fashionable Primrose Hill, attended by Russell Brand, Jemima Khan, Justin Timberlake, Samuel L Jackson and Piers Morgan. Neighbours claim that since media executive Miss Murdoch, 45, and PR guru Mr Freud, 50, moved into the six-bedroom mansion in 2011 parties have been held three to four times a year, turning a quiet area into ‘little Beverly Hills’. Parties have been known to go on until as late as 4am on weekdays with music booming from speakers around a rooftop garden and pool, the residents claimed. One woman said: ‘People living nearby have to get up for work in the morning or to take their children to school. But at the last event they were partying around the pool and in the garden, where loud music was playing, and staff were serving food outside into the early hours. ‘You couldn’t get access to the house to complain because they had bouncers on the door. ‘It used to be a quiet area but it’s become like little Beverly Hills. They should at the very least let the neighbours know when the parties are going to be held and agree a finishing time.’ At the most recent party, held after the GQ Awards in September, dozens of cars took celebrities to and from the address. Another resident said: ‘There were something like 30 chauffeur-driven cars coming and going up until 1am. Many of the guests were drunk and making a right old racket.’ Police received complaints from around half a dozen residents but no arrests were made. A neighbour said: ‘It used to be a lovely and quiet area of families and old people. The noise from the parties is very intrusive – speakers are right behind our homes. You can feel the beat from the music and there is always the token screaming woman.’ Another neighbour, a pensioner, said: . ‘On the night of the last party the police said the noise was a matter . for the council and there was nothing they could do. But the council . said it would be very difficult to take action unless officers arrived . when the party was at full blast.’ Hosts: The couple are said to throw 'raucous' parties up to four times a year at their £24million property in London's Primrose Hill (stock image) Lazarro Pietragnoli, deputy mayor at Camden Council,  lives on the street behind the property. He said: ‘There’s very little we can do as a council because the parties are so sporadic. ‘It would be nice for Elisabeth and Matthew to keep their neighbours informed and take people’s concerns into account.’ The Metropolitan Police confirmed officers had been called to the couple’s GQ Awards party at 2am following a complaint. One of the couple’s staff said yesterday: ‘There was no intention to cause problems at the GQ party. I think one of the speakers in the garden overlooking the neighbouring homes had been left on late by accident.’ Mr Freud said: ‘We are genuinely sorry to hear that some of our neighbours were disturbed by guests leaving our family home on a couple of occasions earlier this year. We love Primrose Hill and would never wish to inconvenience any of our fellow residents. ‘We have a young family ourselves and these were irregular events. Our apologies go to anyone who was disturbed on those evenings.'","Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth and her husband Matthew Freud are said to hold bashes at their home in Primrose Hill up to four times a year .

'Eric Toth is every parent's worst nightmare: a serial predator who took advantage of his position as a camp counselor and a teacher to sexually exploit children in his care,' U.S. Attorney Ron Machen said in a statement. After the camera was found to contain child porn, Toth was taken off campus by security, but fled before police could apprehend him. Toth's sick fantasies were only discovered after a school camera he had been using was found to contain child pornography . He then moved across states, living in Texas and Arizona before finally settling in Nicaragua. At one point his car was found at Minnesota airport containing an apparent suicide note and a flash drive with images of child pornography on it, suggesting he kept up his sick fantasies while on the run. Toth was placed on to the FBI's Most wanted list following the death of Osama Bin Laden and the eventual publicity lead to a civilian tip-off that he was living abroad. Toth pleaded guilty to producing child pornography, identity theft and misusing a Social Security number. His attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.","Eric Justin Toth, 31, has pleaded guilty to producing child pornography .

SSP coordinates breeding and conservation of a species between AZA . accredited zoos - a joint project between U.S and Australian partners to . bring 12 new founder animals to the population in U.S. zoos. All of the birds were captive born or brought to the Australian zoos as orphaned chicks that could not be released back into the wild. It is hoped that this effort will result in a more sustainable North American population. After a few days the female bird lost her yellow feathers for tawny fur for which the species is named . Tawny frogmouths mostly live in Australian and Tasmanian forests, open woodlands and near human settlements. The bird is named for its wide frog-like mouth, which it uses to capture insects, mice and even frogs. The frogmouth is a master of disguise. It looks remarkably like a broken tree branch as it roosts in a tree during the day, before becoming active at night. After just 26 days of life the bird, born to a mating pair from Australia, is almost unrecognisable . Matt Schamberger, keeper of birds at the zoo, said: 'Our goal is to always have the parents rear their own birds, but this pair is a pair of first-time parents and often times the learning curve is pretty steep, so we try to help out the parents if we can.'","Female Tawny Frogmouth born in St Louis Zoo on November 2 .

Following a number of high-profile hacks Twitter has boosted account security on the site by introducing two-step logins. Twitter is calling the feature 'login verification' and when users log into Twitter they will now be sent six-digit code via text each time, to check they are who they say they are. This code will need to be entered onto the login screen in order for users to get access to their accounts. Scroll down for video . Twitter has launched an optional two-step login verification that can be enabled in the account settings page. Users must enter a mobile number to enable the feature. Each time they log into Twitter.com a unique six-digit code is sent via text message. This code must be entered to get access to the account . Go to Twitter.com. Click the cog icon in the top right-hand corner and go to the  account settings page. Select 'Require a verification code when I sign in.' Click the link to 'add a phone' and follow the prompts. After enabling login verification, you’ll be asked to enter a six-digit code that Twitter send to your phone via text message each time you sign in to twitter.com. To disable the feature, go back to account settings and untick the login verification box. If you get locked out of your account while two-step verification is enabled, or you lose your phone you must contact Twitter support and answer a series of security questions. The feature is optional and is not currently turned on by default. In a blog post, Jim O'Leary from Twitter's product security team said: . 'Every day, a growing number of people log in to Twitter. Usually these login attempts come from the genuine account owners, . but we occasionally hear from people whose accounts have been . compromised by email phishing schemes or a breach of password data . elsewhere on the web.

Each time a user with login verification enabled then signs in at Twitter.com, they will be sent another unique six-digit code that they must enter to get access to their account. People who share access, such as business accounts, will need to have the code sent to a shared phone or nominate a person to receive the text. Hackers have previously targeted the accounts of satire-news site The Onion, The Telegraph, Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher, BBC Weather, Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson and more. In February, 250,000 Twitter users had their passwords stolen in an attack. O'Leary added that when users try to access Twitter from apps and other devices a temporary password will need to be generated, from the applications page, to authorise the login. However, O'Leary said that existing applications will 'continue to work without disruption.'

Yet, David Emm, Senior Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab believes there are pitfalls involved with the two-step verification process: . 'Two-factor authentication makes it difficult for someone to hijack an account, and its easy to see why Twitter has chosen to use SMS as the second authentication method. Nearly everyone today has a mobile phone. 'However, there are some potential pitfalls with using SMS as an authentication method. Many people log into their Twitter account from their smartphone via the Twitter app which doesn’t require login credentials to be entered each time. This means that the same device is being used for both authentication factors and if this device is lost or stolen, whoever finds (or has stolen) it will be able to access the account. Therefore, in effect, there is no longer two-factor authentication. 'Also, it is possible that we will see the development of smartphone-based malware that is specifically designed to steal the SMS authentication code.'","Twitter's new system will send users an email or text each time they log in to their account to verify its really them .

A glow-in-the-dark cockroach, a harp-shaped carnivorous sponge and the smallest frog on Earth are among the most bizarre newly discovered species of 2012, chosen by scientists. Also slithering into this year's top ten is a snail-eating false coral snake, as well as flowering bushes from a disappearing forest in Madagascar. A green lacewing that was discovered through social media and hanging flies that perfectly mimicked ginkgo tree leaves 165 million years ago were also included by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University. The International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University has compiled a list of the ten best newly discovered species of 2012. They include a glow-in-the-dark cockroach, a green lacewing that was first discovered through Flickr, and a frog that is only 7mm big. A total of 140 species were nominated . Tiny Violet - Viola lilliputana . Found: Peru . Carnivorous sponge - Chondrocladia lyra . Found: Pacific Ocean, California . Lesula Monkey - Cercopithecus lomamiensis . Found: Democratic Republic of the Congo . Snail-eating snake - Sibon noalamina . Found: Panama . Fungus -  Ochroconis anomala . Found: France . 7mm frog - Paedophryne amanuensis . Found: New Guinea . Endangered forest plant - Eugenia petrikensis . Found: Madagascar . Glow-in-the-dark cockroach - Lucihormetica luckae . Country: Ecuador . Flickr butterfly - Semachrysa jade . Country: Malaysia . Hanging fly fossil -  Juracimbrophlebia ginkgofolia . Country: China . Rounding up the list is a new monkey with a blue backside and human-like eyes, a tiny violet and a black staining fungus that threatens rare Paleolithic cave paintings in France. The weird and wonderful creatures were all identified for the first time in 2012. They make it into a list published each year by a global committee of taxonomists, scientists responsible for species exploration and classification. Professor Quentin Wheeler, founding director of the group, said: 'We have identified only about two million of an estimated 10 to 12 million living species and that does not count most of the microbial world. 'For decades, we have averaged 18,000 species discoveries per year which seemed reasonable before the biodiversity crisis. Now, knowing that millions of species may not survive the 21st century, it is time to pick up the pace. Members made their selection from more than 140 nominated species. To be . considered, species must have been described in compliance with the . appropriate code of nomenclature, whether botanical, zoological or . microbiological, and have been officially named during 2012. Nominations for the 2014 list - for species described in 2013 - can now be made online. Previous top ten lists from the past six years are available from the Arizona State University website. This glow-in-the dark cockroach was discovered last year in Ecuador. Its official name is Lucihormetica luckae and it uses luminescence to create its glow. More than a dozen luminescent cockroaches have been discovered since 1999 and this latest addition is thought to now  be endangered, or even extinct. Only one specimen has been found . A new species of snail-eating snake was discovered in Serranía de Tabasará mountain range in Panama. The snake is nocturnal and hunts soft-bodied prey including earthworms and amphibian eggs, as well as snails and slugs. The snake is not a threat to humans and can ward off prey by mimicking the dark and light rings found on venomous coral snakes. Its name comes from the Spanish phrase 'No a la mina' or 'No to the mine.' Biologist Dr Antonio Valdecasas, of the Museum of Natural Sciences, . Madrid, said: 'Selecting the final list of new species from a wide . representation of life forms such as bacteria, fungi, plants and . animals, is difficult. 'It requires finding an equilibrium between certain criteria and the special insights revealed by selection committee members. 'We . look for organisms with unexpected features or size and those found in . rare or difficult to reach habitats. We also look for organisms that are . especially significant to humans - those that play a certain role in . human habitat or that are considered a close relative.' This carnivorous sponge, called Chondrocladia lyra was found in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. It lives in water that averages 3,339 metres deep and has large, harp- or lyre-shaped vanes, with more than 20 parallel vertical branches, often found with a balloon-like ball on the top. This unusual shape maximizes the surface area of the sponge for contact and capture of planktonic prey . This year's top ten came from Peru, the Pacific Ocean off the north east . US coast, California, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Panama, . France, New Guinea, Madagascar, Ecuador, Malaysia and China. Wheeler said: 'I don't know whether to be more astounded by . the species discovered each year, or the depths of our ignorance about . biodiversity of which we are a part. 'At the same time we search the . heavens for other earthlike planets, we should make it a high priority . to explore the biodiversity on the most earthlike planet of them all: . Earth. Discovered in the Lomami Basin of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the lesula is an Old World monkey. It is is only the second species of monkey discovered in Africa in the past 28 years. Scientists first saw the monkey as a captive juvenile in 2007. Researchers describe it as having human-like eyes. Although the forests where the monkeys live are remote, the species is hunted for bush meat and its status is vulnerable . Adult male lesula monkeys, found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is an Old World monkey well known to locals but newly known to science. Adult males have a large, bare patch of bright blue skin on the buttocks, testicles and perineum, pictured . 'With more than eight out of every ten living species awaiting . discovery, I am shocked by our ignorance of our very own planet and in . awe at the diversity, beauty and complexity of the biosphere and its . inhabitants.' Added Prof Wheeler: 'We are calling for a NASA-like mission to discover 10 million species in the next 50 years. This would lead to discovering countless options for a more sustainable future while securing evidence of the origins of the biosphere.' The announcement, now in its sixth year, coincides with the anniversary of the birth of Carolus Linnaeus - the 18th century Swedish botanist responsible for the modern system of scientific names and classifications. The world's smallest violet, pictured left, is only found in the Intermontane Plateau of the high Andes . of Peru. It is called the Lillipution violet after named after the race of . little people on the island of Lilliput in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s . Travels. The fossil shown on the right is of a hanging fly and was found along with preserved leaves of a gingko-like tree, in Middle . Jurassic deposits from China’s Inner . Mongolia.

Skylab was the United States' first space station, and orbited the Earth from 1973 to 1979 in various forms. It included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems. Three manned missions to the station, conducted between 1973 and 1974 each delivered a three-astronaut crew.

The space agency worked with Hasselblad to develop the cameras, known as 'moon cameras', even thought this particular one did not make it to the lunar surface. The Hasselblad cameras were selected by NASA because of their interchangeable lenses and magazines. Modifications were made to permit ease of use in cramped conditions while wearing spacesuits, such as the replacement of the reflex mirror with an eye-level finder.

Belching ash and spewing lava, Pavlof Volcano in Alaska has been erupting for ten days - and Nasa today released this remarkable picture of it, taken by crew on board the International Space Station. One of the region's most active volcanoes, its latest eruption has forced regional flight cancellations and dusted some nearby communities with ash. Pavlof released ash plumes as high as 22,000ft (6,700m) over the weekend, with the cloud blowing eastward and the eruption showing no signs of abating, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The lava from its 8,261ft (2,518m) peak has also created huge steam clouds on meeting the mountain's snow. Belching ash and spewing lava, Pavlof Volcano in Alaska has been erupting since May 13 - and Nasa today released this remarkable picture of it, taken by crew on board the International Space Station . While the ash plume was still too low on Monday to affect commercial airliners flying at least 30,000ft above sea level between Asia and North America, it still interfered with schedules for regional carriers serving rural fishing towns and native villages that lack outside road access. PenAir, an Anchorage-based company specialising in travel in southwestern Alaska, briefly stopped flights to four destinations to wait for ash to dissipate, said Danny Seybert, the carrier's chief executive. 'We've had about a dozen cancellations due to the volcano,' he said. PenAir's planes fly at altitudes between 15,000 and 20,000ft - exactly where they could encounter ash, depending on wind direction, according to Seybert. Among the cancellations were flights in and out of Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, the top-volume seafood port in the United States, he said. Pavlof (pictured last week) released ash plumes as high as 22,000ft (6,700m) over the weekend, with the cloud blowing eastward and the eruption showing no signs of abating, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory . While the ash plume was still too low on Monday to affect commercial airliners flying at least 30,000ft above sea level between Asia and North America, it still interfered with schedules for regional carriers serving rural fishing towns and native villages that lack outside road access . Pavlof Volcano is one of several dozen volcanoes that make up the Aleutian Arc. The arc stretches across the Alaskan Peninsula in the south-west of Alaska to north-eastern Siberia, 3,000km away. It follows the line where the pacific tectonic plate meets the North American plate. Seybert said for those flying in the region, flight disruptions are part of doing business. 'It's one of the situations that Mother Nature presents itself along our route structure,' he said. Ace Air Cargo, also based in . Anchorage, cancelled two flights and delayed others, but for the most . part, its planes are flying around any ash, said Greg Hawthorne, a . company official. The airline is closely monitoring developments, he . said. 'We're used to those volcanoes going . off in that region,' he said. 'But if the winds are wrong, you don't . want to test that pumice.' Ash plumes could go higher, as Pavlof's eruption could intensify with little warning, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said. Trace amounts of ash fell overnight on Nelson Lagoon, a tiny Aleut village of 50 residents located 48 miles (77 km) northeast of Pavlof. The volcano had earlier sprinkled ash on Sand Point, a fishing town of about 1,000 people, when the wind was blowing in a slightly different direction, according to the observatory. Ash plumes could go higher, as Pavlof's eruption could intensify with little warning, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said . Along with potential aviation . hazards, the ash poses possible health risks, said Rick Wessels, a U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist at the observatory. 'It's dangerous for the people downwind of it, because you don't really want to breathe in that fine ash that long,' Wessels said of the eruption taking place on the Alaska Peninsula, 590 miles (950km) southwest of Anchorage. Pavlof is one of Alaska's most restless volcanoes and had its last major eruption in 2007. The Alaska Volcano Observatory estimates it has erupted about two dozen times between 1901 and 2007. During the 29-day eruption six years ago, the volcano emitted mud flows and erupting lava, as well as ash clouds up to 18,000ft high.

He said Mr Cameron’s plans to limit . benefit payments to migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when controls are . lifted on January 1 are ‘an unfortunate overreaction’.Scroll down for video . Hungarian EU Commissioner Laszlo Andor accused Mr Cameron of not telling the truth about immigration and fuelling 'hysteria' by unveiling measures to curb access to benefits . In . private talks with EU chiefs on the sidelines of the Eastern . Partnership Summit, a No 10 source said: ‘[David Cameron] made it clear . to Barroso that Commissioner Andor’s behaviour is inappropriate for an . official paid for by British and other European taxpayers.’ Brussels . is facing a growing revolt over its no-borders immigration policy, with . France and Germany also suggesting they want curbs on EU migrants’ rights. Mr Cameron, who has . been criticised for refusing to give an estimate of how many Romanians . and Bulgarians will come to Britain next year, has outlined plans to . limit the rights of temporary workers to housing benefit, and a 12-month . bar on those fund begging and sleeping rough. Home Secretary Theresa May suggested . moves to cap the number of EU migrants to the UK in order to stop . British workers languishing on the dole. Writing . for the PoliticsHome website, Mrs May suggested that the Government’s . attempts to make the UK a less attractive destination - by restricting . access to welfare and introducing an annual levy for use of the NHS - . were likely to have limited effect. ‘In . all honesty, whatever the Government does in terms of reducing the pull . factors that draw people to Britain, as long as there is such an . enormous disparity between EU member states in terms of income per head, . there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer . member states to richer member states,’ she said. Summit: Mr Cameron told other leaders they must not repeat the mistakes of the past by allowing workers from new member states unfettered access to other countries . Mrs May added: ‘That . not only puts pressure on communities in countries like Britain, it . robs poorer EU member states of their most talented people. So in . future, we must put in place new arrangements to slow full access to . each other’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to . mass migration. ‘This . could, for example, be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a . certain level of income or economic output per head before full free . movement is allowed. Policy: Home Secretary Theresa May suggested capping EU migration to stop British workers languishing on the dole . ‘Is it . right that there should be unfettered access to our labour markets, even . if there is high unemployment amongst British workers?’ She . said yesterday’s immigration statistics showed the Government had made . important progress but still faced serious challenges. ‘In the year to June 2013, annual net migration stood at 182,000. This is a reduction of nearly a third since its peak in 2010, when it stood at 255,000. But it represents an unwelcome increase in net migration in the last year - and it is still too high. ‘Where the Government can control net migration - and this is limited to immigration from outside the European Union - our policies are working. Net migration from outside the EU continues to fall sharply. It is down from 218,000 since its peak in 2010, and from 172,000 last year, to 140,000 this year. ‘We have restricted economic migration from outside the EU, and economic immigration is down. We have tightened the rules for family visas, and family immigration is down - by more than one fifth. We have ended the industrial-scale abuse of the student visa system we saw under the last government, closed down hundreds of bogus colleges, and student immigration is down - by almost a third. ‘Under Labour, ‘students’ were turning up at Heathrow unable to answer basic questions in English or even give simple details about their course - those days are now gone. And the latest visa statistics - which run ahead of the net migration statistics - show these figures should continue to fall.’","David Cameron clashed angrily with Brussels over migration policy .

A senior Tory politician arrested over allegations that he raped a teenage girl will not be charged after the CPS concluded there was insufficient evidence. Alan Lewis, who owns the Crombie clothing chain, was quizzed at a London police station in September over claims he attacked a teenage student in the 1960s in a hotel. A CPS spokesman said:'The Crown Prosecution Service has carefully considered the evidence gathered by Greater Manchester Police in relation to their investigations into an allegation of rape in the Manchester area in 1967. 'A 75 year old man was arrested in September in connection with the allegation. 'The case has been reviewed by two specialist rape prosecutors in CPS North West Area in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, the CPS policy for prosecuting cases of rape and CPS legal guidance on rape and sexual offences. 'We have concluded that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in relation to the allegation and have advised Greater Manchester Police that no further action should be taken. 'The complainant has been informed of the decision and we will be meeting her to provide an explanation of the decision and to answer any questions she may have.' Mr Lewis, a key ally of David Cameron, is believed to be worth around £220million. The 75-year-old’s arrest came as the Conservative Party prepared for its annual conference in Manchester. Official: In 2010, David Cameron made Mr Evans a vice chairman of the Tory party . The allegations were brought by a married woman from Dorset who is now in her 60s. Mr Lewis, a committed Christian, was asked to attend a station in Belgravia, central London. He was then arrested on suspicion of raping the student in a Manchester hotel while on a business trip.

A mother has warned against the dangers of internet dating after being beaten up by a man weeks after meeting him online. Susan Hulbert, 31, signed up to popular website plentyoffish.com last December and was wooed by Gavin Taylor, a high-flying salesman who claimed to be a former policeman. But he went from perfect ‘gentleman’ to brutal thug when he launched a violent attack on Miss Hulbert, breaking her cheekbone, after she questioned why he was still using the dating website. Susan Hulbert thought Gavin Taylor was her prince charming when she met him online, until he let his mask slip and she met his violent side when he smashed her face against a wall and fractured her cheekbone .

After texting every day, the pair eventually met on a Sunday afternoon in February in a Solihull pub. Miss Hulbert said: ‘When we met he seemed nice. We didn’t kiss on the first date and I thought he was a gentleman for that.’ The couple started seeing each other but Miss Hulbert began to suspect that the salesman wasn’t the prince charming he appeared. ‘He would get really angry with . things, the police especially, but never with me,’ she said. ‘He plays . bowls and I went to watch him play a match and I was getting scared with . how angry he was getting.’ The couple started 'seeing' each other properly, but Susan began to feel a creeping suspicion that the salesman wasn't the prince charming he appeared . The mask finally slipped on April 21 while Miss Hulbert was staying at Taylor’s home. She quizzed him on why he was still . receiving messages from the dating website and texts from an unknown . person – and he exploded in rage. ‘He hit my head against the wall, and I slipped down and started crying,’ Miss Hulbert said. ‘He started punching me in my face. I had bruises all over my hands and . face from where I tried to protect myself.’ She ran outside but was . grabbed again by Taylor who began dragging her back to the house. A neighbour heard her screams and called the police. Miss Hulbert says she will never use a dating website again, but is worried that Gavin Taylor will simply join another and do the same thing to other women . Miss Hulbert was taken to hospital with a fractured cheekbone, large bumps to the head and bruising across her face and body.

A 3D reconstruction of a tooth: By measuring the relative amounts of barium and calcium on a tooth's growth lines, shown here in colours, scientists showed that a Neanderthal infant probably switched to a solid diet after around 14 months . Neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans, according to new research. Chemical analysis of a juvenile's tooth reveal it was reared on mother's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same period coupled with solid food. The change from breastfeeding to . plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the . distribution of barium in teeth enamel. This . enabled Dr Manish Arora and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York to discover the early life diet . of a 10-12 year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000 . years ago. Weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates. Later . weaning can have health benefits while doing it earlier leads to . shorter intervals between births which influences population growth, . evolution and success. The change from breastfeeding to . plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the . distribution of barium in teeth enamel. The researchers said our understanding of the evolution of human weaning has been limited by a lack of reliable markers to indicate the timing and nature of dietary transitions. Barium distributions in tooth enamel accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through to feeding with other food sources, the team said. Experiments on humans and macaques revealed barium rises during breastfeeding and drops abruptly on weaning. The study of a molar tooth of the Neanderthal child uncovered barium levels indicating it was breastfed exclusively for seven months followed by seven months of supplementation after which breastfeeding was ceased. Barium levels in the teeth of this Neandertal child suggest that it was partly weaned at 227 days after birth and entirely weaned at 435 days . Barium is calcium's cousin, and it goes where calcium goes in the body. Over the years, it accumulates in our bones. When a mother begins nursing, some of that barium migrates into her breast milk, and eventually, into her baby's teeth. This allowed the team to track when mothers stopped breastfeeding. Dr Arora, assistant professor of dentistry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said: 'Here we show large dietary shifts in early life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues. 'Teeth from human children and captive macaques, with prospectively recorded diet histories, demonstrate barium distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through the weaning process. 'We also document dietary transitions in a Middle Palaeolithic juvenile Neanderthal, which shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months, followed by seven months of supplementation. 'After this point barium levels in enamel returned to baseline prenatal levels, indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at 1.2 years of age.' Neanderthals lived during the last Ice Age and would have had to have coped with extremely harsh environments. While blizzards raged outside the parents would have to track down something to eat, prepare it and keep the fires going. Examination of Neanderthal burial sites and caves have led researchers to conclude they were not 'savages' but lived in small nuclear families. There was also some amount of social networking including interaction between family or neighbouring groups. And they went well beyond their capacity to fend for themselves meaning they took care of their elderly and sick - as well as their children. Patterns of barium in baby teeth reveal the duration of breast-feeding - here, the different stages are shown . They grieved at the loss of an infant or elder by burying their dead. It is also believed they were able to produce speech and may even have been responsible for some of the most ancient cave art on the planet. Dr Arora said: 'In the Neanderthal the protracted weaning process typical in primates was interrupted by unknown causes precipitating abrupt cessation of suckling. 'The period of exclusive breastfeeding in this Neanderthal is consistent with other hominoids; human hunter-gatherers and wild chimpanzees also begin to supplement milk with solid food by around 6 months of age. 'Humans and chimpanzees may wean offspring as early as 1.0 and 4.2 years, respectively, withoutserious health effects, but average 2.3-2.6 years and 5.3 years.' He said the study will help further studies into theories Neanderthal young routinely weaned at later ages than later early humans or possessed faster life histories than modern man which have important implications for models of population growth and species replacement.","Researchers analysed tooth of a 10-12 year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000 years ago .

Solving a Rubik’s Cube is an undeniably tricky endeavour – but at least you can use the privacy of your own home to shield your struggles. No such luxury with the giant illuminated Rubik’s Cube that’s recently been lit up in Austria. In the city of Linz, an entire building has been turned into a version of the classic puzzle, with lights taking the place of stickered cubes – so the whole city can see if you’re labouring to complete it. Illuminating: The puzzle was created by student Javier Lloret . The project – called Puzzle Facade - was created by Javier Lloret for his thesis in Interface Culture. The building that’s been transformed is the Ars Electronica exhibition centre – and the puzzle works thanks to some ingenious electronics wizardry and a replica of a normal-sized Rubik’s Cube. Mr Lloret said: ‘The player interacts with a specially designed interface-cube. The interface-cube holds electronic components inside that allow for it keep track of its orientation and the rotations of each side of the cube.

Control: Players change the colours on the building using an 'interface-cube' Top-seller: 350 million cubes have been sold since its invention in 1974 . 'This data is sent over Bluetooth to a computer that runs the Puzzle Facade designed software.’ What makes the puzzle even trickier than normal is the fact that players can only see two sides of it at a time. Mr Lloret added: ‘This factor increases the difficulty of solving the puzzle, but as the player is able to rotate and flip the interface-cube, it is not a blocking factor.’ Invented in 1974 and originally called the Magic Cube, by January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide making it the world's top-selling puzzle game. It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy. Since 2003, The World Cube Association, the Rubik's Cube's international governing body, has organized competitions and kept the official world records. The largest order magic cube is 17x17x17 cubes large and consists of 1,539 parts.

His cheeky smile and carefree approach to cooking won the nation over when he hit our screens 15 years ago. And it seems Jamie Oliver still has our hearts today. The Naked Chef has been voted Britain's favourite celebrity chef in a new survey, as well as the cook whose recipes we find easiest to follow at home. The survey also shows that Britons feel long time culinary queen and television staple Delia Smith is out of date, and that the famously sultry Nigella Lawson makes us fat. Jamie Oliver, 37, was picked as our number one by almost a fifth (23 per cent) of those polled - with Gordon Ramsay second (16 per cent) and Nigella Lawson third (11 per cent). The least popular was Masterchef's John Torode, picked by just one per cent of the 1,000 people polled by diet firm Forza Supplements. Surprisingly, the nation's cookery queen Delia came second bottom with just two per cent of votes. Delia, 71, was also the chef voted most out of date - chosen by more than quarter of respondents (26 per cent), as being increasingly past her sell by date. Foul mouthed dynamo Gordon Ramsay was almost deemed by respondents to be outstaying his welcome on our TV screens with 12 per cent of the vote with the Hairy Bikers coming third (10 per cent). When it comes to actually picking up the spatula and heading into the kitchen ourselves, the nation's foodies reckon that Jamie Oliver's recipes are the easiest to follow - with 57 per cent saying his were the most reliable. Delia came second for reliability (14 per cent) and Nigella Lawson third (8 per cent). Unsurprisingly Heston Blumenthal, who is famous for his complicated and intricate recipes such as snail porridge, came bottom with just one per cent of the votes. One of the most interesting findings is that people feel that if you cook Nigella Lawson's recipes you are likely to have the most fun - but also most likely to pile on the pounds. Delia, left, is deemed out of date, while Nigella, right, is voted as being the most fun - and most fattening .

Alex Mitchell, 37, of Ozone Park, NY, pulled his gasoline tanker to the side of the busy 10 lane highway after seeing a crashed SUV catch fire just after 2am. A quick search led to him finding the driver, who he pulled to safety. Drunk driver John Boisseau, 37, of Sound Beach, was taken to a local hospital to be treated for his injuries before being released later in the day to be charged with driving while intoxicated. He's a hero!: Alex Mitchell saved the life of drunk driver John Boisseau when he pulled him out from under the burning wreckage of his crashed SUV . Seeing the dire situation, Mr Mitchell knew he had to act – he immediately pulled to the side of the road and began his own search and rescue operation while emergency responders and police sped to the scene. ‘I was like, 'Is anybody there? Can anybody hear me?' he recalled to Newsday. ‘I didn’t see anyone back there so I ran around the other side because my view was being blocked by a tree,’ Mr Mitchell recalled to CBS New York. ‘Next thing, I went around and noticed he was basically lying under the vehicle with flames going and everything,’ he continued.

Engulfed in flames: This cloud of smoke still poured from the SUV even after firefighters began extinguishing the flames . The brave samaritan pulled the boozed-up Mr Boisseau out from under the burning 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe just before the flames would have gotten to him, according to CBS New York. Emergency crews soon arrived on the scene to extinguish the charred Chevy – just after two tires exploded from the flames, Mr Mitchell told Newsday . Mr Boisseau lost control of his vehicle in Brentwood (about 40 miles east of Manhattan), veered of the major east-west artery and struck a tree at about 2am, officials said. The collision ejected him from the SUV, but the mackered motorist somehow ended up beneath the smoldering vehicle, according to officials. Alcohol was involved: Mr Boisseau was charged with drunk driving after being released from a local hospital . Fully engulfed with flames and with a giant cloud of smoke towering over the highway, the crash scene was easily spotted by Mr Mitchell – who dialled 911 with one hand as he rescued the trapped man with the other, according to Newsday.

For years it was thought that the Ring Nebula -  an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other gases -  was shaped like a bagel. This was also the basis for its 'Ring' nickname. Yet in a new twist, latest images taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope of the glowing gas shroud reveal it looks more like a jelly doughnut because it's filled with 'material in the middle.' This new image shows the dramatic shape and colour of the Ring Nebula, otherwise known as Messier 57. From Earth's perspective, the nebula looks like a simple elliptical shape with a shaggy boundary. However, new observations combining existing ground-based data with new NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope data show that the nebula is shaped like a distorted doughnut . This image is a composite of the Ring Nebula. This combines new Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 data with observations of the nebula's outer halo from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona. In this image, the knotty, turbulent space around the nebula shows up dramatically, creating an almost psychedelic effect. The Large Binocular Telescope is part of the Mount Graham International Observatory in Arizona . Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee lead the research team. He said: 'The nebula is not like a bagel, but rather, it's like a jelly doughnut, because it's filled with material in the middle.' O'Dell and his team used Hubble and several ground-based telescopes to get the best view yet of the iconic nebula. The images show a more complex structure than astronomers once thought and have allowed them to construct the most precise 3D model of the nebula. O'Dell continued: 'With Hubble's detail, we see a completely different shape than what's been thought about historically for this classic nebula.' This diagram shows the geometry and structure of the Ring Nebula  as viewed side-on. This shows the nebula's wide halo, inner region, lower-density lobes of material stretching towards and away from Earth, and the prominent, glowing disc. This is composed of gas thrown off by a dying star at the centre of the nebular . 'The new Hubble observations show the nebula in much clearer detail, and we see things are not as simple as we previously thought.' The Ring Nebula is about 2,000 light-years from Earth and measures roughly 1 light-year across. Located in the constellation Lyra, the nebula is a popular target for amateur astronomers. Previous observations by several . telescopes had detected the gaseous material in the ring's central . region, but the new view by Hubble's sharp-eyed Wide Field Camera 3 . shows the nebula's structure in more detail. O'Dell's team suggests the ring wraps around a blue, football-shaped structure. Each end of the structure protrudes out of opposite sides of the ring. The nebula is tilted toward Earth so astronomers see the ring face-on. This image from the Digitized Sky Survey shows the Ring Nebula and its surroundings . In the Hubble image, the blue structure is the glow of helium. Radiation from the white dwarf star, the white dot in the centre of the ring, is causing the helium to glow. The white dwarf is the stellar remnant of a sun-like star that has used up all its hydrogen fuel and has shed its outer layers of gas. O'Dell's team was surprised at the . detailed Hubble views of the dark, irregular knots of dense gas embedded . along the inner rim of the ring, which look like spokes in a bicycle . wheel. These gaseous tentacles formed when expanding hot gas pushed into cool gas released by the doomed star. The knots are less likely to be eroded by the ultraviolet light released by the star. The Ring Nebula is about 2,000 light-years from Earth and measures roughly 1 light-year across. All of the gas found in the centre of the nebula was expelled by the central star about 4,000 years ago. The original star was several times more massive than our sun. After billions of years converting hydrogen to helium in its core, the star began to run out of fuel. It then ballooned in size, becoming a red giant. During this phase, the star shed its . outer gaseous layers into space and began to collapse as fusion . reactions began to die out. Ultraviolet light from the dying star energized the gas, making it glow. The outer rings were formed when faster-moving gas slammed into slower-moving material. The nebula is expanding at more than 43,000 miles an hour, but the centre is moving faster than the expansion of the main ring. O'Dell's team measured the nebula's expansion by comparing the new Hubble observations with Hubble studies made in 1998. The Ring Nebula will continue to expand for another 10,000 years, a short phase in the lifetime of the star. The nebula will become fainter and fainter until it merges with the interstellar medium. The Hubble images have allowed the team to match up the knots with the spikes of light around the bright, main ring, which are a shadow effect. Astronomers have found similar knots in other planetary nebulae. Studying the Ring Nebula's fate will provide insight into the sun's demise in another 6 billion years. 'When the sun becomes a white dwarf, it will heat more slowly after it ejects its outer gaseous layers.' O'Dell added: 'The material will be farther away once it becomes hot enough to illuminate the gas. This larger distance means the sun's nebula will be fainter because it is more extended.'","Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville and his team used the Hubble Space Telescope with other ground-based scopes to get the never-before-seen views of the interstellar cloud .
