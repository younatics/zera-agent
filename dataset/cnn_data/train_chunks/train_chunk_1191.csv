"The words in her son’s homework left Vicki Walker numb with shock. In a letter which began ‘Dear mum’, Wesley, 14, assured her he loved her, made a request for bright colours at his funeral, and listed who should inherit his most prized possessions. Horrified, she ran to his bedroom praying he had not taken his own life. Wesley Walker, with the emotional goodbye note, pictured with his mother Vicki . In fact, Wesley was sleeping soundly in bed – and the death note turned out to be the result of a creative writing assignment set by his teachers. Last night his parents demanded an apology from the school, furious that teachers could have set such a piece of work without informing them. But while the Discovery Academy in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, apologised, staff insist the task was justified as an exercise in ‘expressive art’ and an opportunity for pupils to tell their mothers that they love them. The school said it would ‘review how we communicate to parents in the future’. Mrs Walker, 42, and her husband Mark . described the horrifying moment they read the note at their home in . Longton, Stoke-on-Trent and thought their son might be about to commit . suicide. Mr Walker, 52, a warehouse worker, said: ‘Wesley came down . before going to bed and handed his mum this piece of paper. Creative note: Wesley Walker, 14, was asked to write a letter as if he only had a few days left to live . When Vicki read the note written by her son, pictured, she thought he was going to take his own life . ‘He said goodnight and then off he went back upstairs to bed. ‘Vicki read it – and the colour just drained from her face. She just froze stiff and handed me this paper with her hands shaking. ‘She burst into his bedroom and expected to see him hanging there – she was horrified. The poor lad almost jumped out of his skin. It really has shaken us up.’ Wesley was set the task last month in his Expressive Arts class, a subject – also offered at GCSE – which aims to ‘develop pupils’ creativity and imagination’. 'Distressing': Wesley wrote in his creative writing exercise that he was 'writing to say goodbye' Children were asked to imagine they had a terminal illness and express thanks to loved ones. Wesley said: ‘I just thought it was like any other piece of work. I just got on with it.’ In the letter, which is littered with spelling errors, he asked family and friends to wear bright colours at his funeral and apologised for being ‘a pain’ at times. ‘I don’t want you to be sad,’ it said. ‘I’m with Nan and Grandad now so I love you and goodbye.’ Pupils were then told to take the letters home but no warning was given to parents about the notes. Creative: The Discovery Academy in Stoke-on-Trent apologised for any distress caused by the exercise, but claimed many parents had seen it as 'valuable' ‘I couldn’t believe the school did not warn us they were doing such a sick exercise,’ Mr Walker said. ‘They could have written something on top of the work.’ He added that the assignment could have been harmful to vulnerable teens. ‘It could give some kids the wrong ideas,’ he said. Mrs Walker, a teaching assistant, added: ‘Wesley is a lively boy and to see this made me think there was something seriously wrong.’ Last night the school said many parents and pupils found the exercise ‘valuable’, adding that it was in line with the national curriculum. A spokesman said: ‘The purpose was to enable young people to explore their feelings and emotions and celebrate the many good things with their loved ones that are usually left unsaid.’","Wesley Walker, 14, told to write 'expressive' note in creative writing class .

"Reviled Clippers owner Donald Sterling had a public row with girlfriend V. Stiviano just moments before she defended him in an interview with Barbara Walters on Friday. Sterling reportedly yelled at a silent Stiviano as they rode an elevator at the Four Seasons hotel in Los Angeles where the interview was taped, calling her a 'media w****' 'Then he looks at her and says, ""Get off this f****** elevator! Get off this elevator and shut the f*** up!' a guest who rode in a hotel elevator with the couple told the New York Daily News. Yelled at: Donald Sterling reportedly got into a public fight with girlfriend V. Stiviano just minutes before she sat down for an interview with Barbara Walters on Friday . Upset: Another guest at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel got into an elevator with the couple when Sterling started yelling at his girlfriend, calling her a 'media w****'. Pictured above at a Clippers game in October 2010 . Stiviano then pressed a random button and got off at the 15th floor. Sterling continued to yell at a man who appeared to be his lawyer, complaining about Stiviano. 'He was yelling, ""She's f****** crazy! I can't deal with her! She's nuts""' the source reported. The witness says Sterling rode the elevator down to the lobby and then stormed out of the hotel.Twenty minutes later, Stiviano sat down for an interview with Walters, in which she said she loved Sterling and that he is a 'very generous and kind man'. The interview was the first time 31-year-old Stiviano has spoken publicly about the scandal surrounding her and Sterling. The 81-year-old Clippers owner was banned from the NBA last week after audio recordings surfaced of him making racist comments to Stiviano. In the recordings, Sterling tells Stiviano not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in photos on Instagram. Despite being chewed out by Sterling just minutes before, Stiviano spoke fondly of him saying she doesn't believe he's a racist. 'I think the things he says are not the things he feels,' she said. 'Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment.' On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver . banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5million and urged league owners . to force him to sell the team. A three-quarters vote by the NBA owners . is required to force him to sell. Decisive action: Last week, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league and called for the Board of Governors to force Sterling to sell his team. Pictured at the press conference on April 29 . Sterling's estranged wife Shelly is also in favor of the decision to force her husband out, saying she 'fully supported' Silver's action. 'As a next step, both the league and the team should work together to find some fresh, accomploished exectuive leadership for the Clippers,' she said in a statement Saturday. 'As a co-owner, I am fully committed to taking the necessary steps to make the Clippers the best team in the NBA. That has been my aspiration ever since 1981.' Mrs Sterling is still married to her husband but the two have been seperated him for several years. She was present as the Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors in a playoff game on Saturday. Estranged: Sterling's wife Shelly says she supports Silver's decision to ban her husband from the league and force him out of the Clippers.

The Clippers beat the Warriors 126-121 at Saturday's game . Mrs Sterling greets a Clippers fan at Saturday's playoff game . Stiviano told Walters that she 'absolutely' thinks Sterling should apologize for his comments, but that 'only God knows' if he will. She also said she believes Sterling's outrageous comments were, in part, a generational issue. 'I think Mr Sterling's from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe these things,' she said, before accidentally tipping Walters off that despite being a Jew, Sterling has anti-Semitic views also. 'But through his actions, he's shown that he's not a racist. Through his actions, he's shown himself to be a very generous and kind man,' she said. The racist diatribe which Sterling can be heard making on audio recorded by Stiviano herself, was prompted by people saying bad things about Sterling's relationship with Stiviano. Confidante: Stiviano told Walters that she had been with Donald Sterling before the interview and that he is 'emotionally traumatized' Saving face: Stiviano is seen emerging from her home before the interview wearing her now-customary face visor . All white: V. Stiviano stepped out in a crisp white suit hours after leaving the house in head-to-toe black . In abstract and sometimes rambling . terms, Stiviano appeared to paint herself as Sterling's savior during . his time of need - despite the fact that it is alleged she released the . recordings responsible for his downfall herself. 'I . think Mr Sterling is being tested right now, by a higher power or . being. And I'm forced to come to his rescue because he can't rescue . himself.' When pressed to . explain the relationship between herself and Sterling, Stiviano said, . 'I'm Mr Sterling's personal assistant. Like I said, I'm his right hand. I'm his wingman. What isn't there to understand?' Walters asked whether Stiviano, then, is Sterling's employee. 'He . first started paying me as an employee and then he started paying me . off the books,' she responded, no doubt referring to the million-dollar . home, four luxury cars and $240,000 'living expenses' she has reportedly . received. 'I became part of . Mr Sterling's team. I became someone who protected him, someone who . took care of him, someone who watched everything he said and did, and . people did not like that.' 'So you helped him become a better person?' asked Walters. 'In every way. In every way,' responded Stiviano. 'Silly rabbit': V. Stiviano described herself to Barbara Walters as Donald Sterling's 'everything' She wouldn't allow Sterling to take meetings with certain people, Stiviano told Walters, which angered his business peers. Social butterfly: Stiviano has been seen around town in the wake of the controversy, but Sterling, her 'father figure' has been no where to be seen . She . said that executives and board members of the Clippers who were jealous . of the free reign she had when it came to the team would call Sterling . and tell him that Stiviano had brought people 'who look a certain way' to Clippers games when she wasn't there. But . not just black people, Stiviano claimed, but people 'that didn't give . me a good look,' like 'gangsters,' 'thugs,' 'bad women.' Walters asked, 'Are you in love with Donald Sterling?' 'I love him,' Stiviano responded, smiling widely, adding that she's not in love but rather loves him 'like a father figure.' Denying she's Sterling's 'mistress' or 'whore,' she said that she's more like his friend and right hand. 'I’m Mr. Sterling’s everything. I’m his confidante, his best friend, his silly rabbit,' she said, bizarrely. Stiviano . said the pair met while she was working for Sterling's non-profit . organization, the Donald T Sterling Foundation and evolved 'to so much . more.' After the lengthy talk with Walters, Stiviano put her now-customary visor back over her face to face the waiting paparazzi. She told Walters it is a protective measure. 'I'm hurting, I'm in pain. It hurts to see someone you  care about hurting. It hurts to see people speculate, assume, say, throw darts at you when they don't know you ... It's easier to mask the pain.' Sterling was initially supposed to give . an interview to both Walters and CNN's Anderson Cooper, but dropped out . at the last minute. Walters got to continue with a solo interview of . Stiviano while Cooper came out empty-handed.","The 81-year-old Clippers owner allegedly yelled at Stiviano in an elevator at the Four Seasons hotel just 20 minutes before the interview .

"Former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko has said the use of military force against Russia should not be ruled out.

"Archeologists have unearthed a private mini-Colosseum built by the notorious Roman emperor who featured in the Oscar-winning film Gladiator. Commodus used the 2nd century ampitheatre on his estate in Genzano, southeast of Rome, to kill animals while dressed as a gladiator. The oval arena, measuring 200ft by 130ft, was discovered accidentally by a team from an American university, as they excavated thermal baths at the estate known as the Villa of Antonines. Discovery: Archeologists have unearthed a private mini-Colosseum built by the notorious Roman emperor who featured in the Oscar-winning film Gladiator, as they excavated thermal baths at the estate known as the Villa of Antonines . Vicious: Joaquin Phoenix played Commodus, the weak and depraved Roman emperor in the Oscar-winning film Gladiator. He built a mini-Colosseum on his estate  near Rome . Using radar that showed foundations underground, the images revealed an imperial box and curving walls with yellow, red and purple floors made of marble. More than 1,300 people could watch from seats around the arena as Commodus, son of Marcus Aurelius, killed wild animals. The 2000 film Gladiator which won five Oscars including best picture, featured Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix, a weak but vicious ruler. |In the movie he fought to the death in the Colosseum in Rome with fictional army general Russell Crowe . Historically, he was just 20 when he . became emperor, reigning from AD180 to 192. He ordered the masses to . worship him as a second Hercules on the ground that he had killed wild . beasts in the Colosseum. Remains: The Colosseum in Rome where historians say depraved and cruel emperor Commodus killed wild animals . Confrontation: Commodus comes face to face with fictional hero army general Russell Crowe in the movie . Such was his prowess that he once . pierced an elephant with a pole, pierced a gazelle's horn with a spear . and killed mighty beasts with a single blow. The team from Montclair State University, New Jersey, found evidence of an underground canal around the arena in which naval battles could have been staged like those at the Colosseum. A spiral staircase leading almost 10ft down to underground chambers have led to theories that lifts were used to raise scenery and possibly animals, according to the Sunday Times. Montclair's professor of classics and humanities Timothy Renner, told the paper that Commodus used his ampitheatre for 'practice' as a killer of animals and as a gladiator. He added: 'In Rome he killed dozens of animals for example bears with single javelin shots - although at least some of the time he was on a protected walkway above the arena.' It is claimed he battled 735 times in gladiatorial bouts. Commodus enraged many Romans by sitting in the theatre or amphitheatre dressed in a woman's garments. He enjoyed inflicting pain and cruelty,  ridiculing one fat man by cutting open the middle of his stomach. Outside of the arena he led a depraved life with over 300 concubines. These women were taken form the nobility and also the plebs. He was finally assassinated when his wrestling partner strangled him after poison had failed to kill him.","Oval arena with curved walls, floors made of marble, and an imperial box found on his estate near Rome .

"A man fatally shot by a Portland police officer last month had been stalking young women in a van that he converted into a 'moveable dungeon' with chains and handcuffs after one of his victims managed to escape from it in January, according to authorities. Kelly Swoboda kept handwritten surveillance notes on about 20 women, according to Grand jury transcripts released on Monday. He rated the women and marked whether they were alone. Officers confronted the 49-year-old Swoboda near a high school last month after getting reports of a suspicious van following students. He died in an exchange of gunfire, and the grand jurors met to decide whether the shooting was legally justified. They determined it was. Scroll down for video . Kelly Vern Swodoba is seen in photos taken January 21, 2014, (left) and November 6, 2013 (right). Swodoba, who was killed last month in a gunfight with Portland police, had stalked over a dozen girls, rating them by number, and prepared his van as a 'moveable dungeon' Swoboda already was wanted by police because he was the suspect in bank robberies as well as a January kidnapping at a tanning salon southeast of Portland. A 23-year-old woman was working alone at the salon when a man beat her, forced her outside to a van and bound her ankles and wrists with duct tape. The woman escaped by jumping from the moving vehicle. She suffered a fractured skull and other injuries. When investigators examined Swoboda's van after the March shooting, they discovered chains mounted to the floor in back and items used to tie a person, including ropes and zip ties. The woman who escaped had not noticed such items, leading a prosecutor to ask whether Swoboda had later converted the van into a 'moveable dungeon'. 'I'm thinking exactly that one victim got away, and he wasn't going to let the next one get away,' said Detective Mary Nunn of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office, according to the transcript. 'Our discussion at my office is that he was coming up with a better way to restrain somebody in his vehicle.'

Portland police officer John Romero was shot in the hand while exchanging fire with Kelly Swoboda . Among the surveillance notes discovered by police were ones about a brunette near the Oregon Episcopal School tennis courts that he rated an eight, and a ballerina spotted outside a Eugene dance studio. At least one young woman was in the southern Oregon city of Klamath Falls. 'Some of them have license plates, so he has seen them driving and follows them,' Portland police Detective Erik Kammerer said in response to a question from a grand juror. A prosecutor asked Kammerer what all of it meant. 'He's making notes on people that he finds — I don't want to use the word attractive — people he's interested in for the purposes of abducting them and doing whatever he's going to do to them,' Kammerer said. Investigators also said they recovered pornographic magazines and DVDs from the van that featured teenage girls and young women. The transcript runs more than 300 pages, and much of it describes the sequence of events leading to the shootout between Swoboda and Officer John Romero. Swoboda was shot three times and died at the scene. Romero, a school resource officer at Wilson High, took a bullet to the hand. Swoboda's mother Luella told KOIN6 that her son had dated when he was younger 'but when he turned 30, Kelly was gone'.

"Michelle Knight today said that she understands the decision of her son's new family not to share with the 14-year-old the identity of his birth mother. Miss Knight's son Joey was given up for adoption during her 11 years held in captivity by Ariel Castro at his Cleveland home. The 33-year-old told the Today show on Monday that she has photographs of her son that his new family had shared with her and that she was happy to see all that he had accomplished. She added that she hoped to be reunited with him one day. Scroll down for videos . Cleveland kidnapping victim Michelle Knight speaks with Savannah Guthrie on the Today show one day before the year anniversary of her escape from Ariel Castro's Cleveland home . Michelle Knight, pictured during an interview earlier this week, released a memoir on the anniversary of her escape, in which she describes the physical and mental abuse she suffered at the hands of Ariel Castro for 11 years . Miss Knight, who is now known as Lily . Rose Lee, also revealed the relentless and horrific abuse she suffered for more than a . decade at the hands of Ariel Castro but defiantly said: 'You can't break . someone that's already been been broken. You can only make them . stronger.' With the one-year . anniversary of her miraculous escape taking place on Tuesday, Miss Knight said that she wanted people to know that her life is 'awesome'. She said that she loved nothing more than waking up in the morning, making a cup of coffee, watching TV and looking at the sky. She also said that she was enjoying boxing training and singing, even recording her first song. Amazingly, Miss Knight is available to forgive Castro. She said today that when she heard the news of his suicide in prison last year, she was saddened and 'confused why he wanted to hurt his children like that'. She added: 'He was a human being... and everyone needs to be loved.' Last year, when she realized that she was finally free, Miss Knight said she turned to fellow captive Gina DeJesus to tell her: 'You won't believe . this. We are going home'. Speaking . to Today and NBC's Dateline, Miss Knight, 33, said that now, nearly 12 . months later, she sees herself as a butterfly, with the 'freedom to . fly'. Displaying all the strength and bravery that sustained her through more than a decade of torture and rape at the hands of Ariel Castro, Miss Knight said that she would comfort Gina DeJesus, telling her: 'One day we'll get out. One day we'll be free. One day we won't be voiceless.' During the amazing interview, which aired in part on Sunday night, Miss Knight said that it was thinking of her son Joey which kept her alive until her dramatic escape on May 6, 2013, along with Miss DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Miss Berry's six-year-old daughter from the Ohio home. She detailed the explicit mental torture that Castro would put her through and how her friendship with DeJesus kept her strong. In one harrowing revelation, Miss Knight told Dateline the fear that came over her each time Castro caused her to become pregnant after sexually assaulting her. Then and now: Michelle Knight (left) being interviewed almost one year ago on her escape from captivity and now (right) happier and healthier . Telling interviewer Savannah Guthrie . that she was pregnant four or five times, Miss Knight said that each . time Castro realized this he would beat her until she miscarried. Asked how she reacted to this, Miss Knight said: 'He wanted to break me.' 'You can't break someone that's already been broken. You can only make them stronger.' In one particularly harrowing tale, Miss Knight said that she tried to escape once through a door Castro had left open. However, she was just not fast enough. She . revealed that following this, Castro would play mind games with the . girls and leave doors tantalizingly ajar, to tempt the girls to run, . only to then shut them in their faces, taunting them. She . then explained the emotional moment that she realized she was free . after Amanda Berry escaped through a door left unintentionally open by . Castro and called the police. 'I hear this big loud noise, crash, boom,' said Miss Knight. 'Then, it was the police.' In an earlier interview, released to coincide with the year anniversary of her release, Miss Knight told how Castro would keep her and the other women locked in an upstairs room when guests would come to visit - blocking them in with piles of furniture. Using a model reconstruction of the Ohio home, the 33-year-old, who has changed her name to Lily Rose Lee, explained how Castro 'would take speakers, a couch, chairs and block anyone from getting up the stairs at all'. Miss Knight, who spent more than a decade locked up, also revealed that she has moved into her own apartment and started cooking classes as she dreams of becoming a chef. She told Today: 'Sometimes in life you have a dark past that makes you who you are but doesn't define who you are.' Cleveland house of horrors survivor Michelle Knight points to a reconstruction of the home where she was kept prisoner for more than a decade.

The 33-year-old is now known as Lily Rose Lee, a . name she picked after her favorite flower. She explained her decision, saying: 'I felt like every brand new start needs new beginnings.' Miss Knight said: 'There were days like he'll come in and he'll just do bad things in front of me, and I'll take her hand and I'll tell her everything's gonna be OK. One day we'll get out. One day we'll be free. One day we won't be voiceless.' The 33-year-old earlier revealed that she has cut ties with the women she was held captive with for so many dark years. She told People that the three survivors have put distance between each other as they all come to terms with the ordeal they suffered. Michelle Knight's memoir was released on the first-anniversary of her escape on May 6 . Miss Knight said: 'I love them and they love me. Hopefully we'll all get back together again.' The 33-year-old has written a memoir Finding Me which comes out on May 6, the one-year anniversary of the women's escape. In her book, she tells of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Castro, who killed himself in prison in September just weeks into his life sentence. Knight had made a brave and defiant . appearance at Castro's sentencing in August in which she told him: 'I . spent 11 years in hell, your hell is just beginning.' Ms Knight also reveals in her book the . close bond she developed with the other women, who were all snatched . off the streets of Cleveland by Castro between 2002 and 2004. Ms Knight, who is 4'11, said that her hellish ordeal has taught her to enjoy every moment of her life. She told People: 'I don't take things for granted . anymore not even the little things like looking out a . window. I went through years of torture, and now I'm back. I'm free to . fly.' Knight was . the only one of Ariel Castro's three victims to appear in person at his . trial. Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry's victim impact statements were . read by members of their family. The . 33-year-old described how the days turned into weeks, weeks into . eternity and said when she was 'dying' from the abuse she suffered, her . friendship with Gina was the only thing that kept her going. Ohio Governor John Kasich leads the applause for Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight after they received a courage award from the state in February . Boarded up and now demolished: The three women were held captive in the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro for more than a decade . Michelle Knight spoke of Castro's hypocrisy as he attended church every week and then came home to torture them. 'I remember all the times you came home talking about what everyone else was doing wrong when you were doing the same thing,' she said. 'I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day.' Speaking of her 'teammate' Gina, she said: 'She never let me fall, I never let her fall. She nursed me back to health when I was dying from her abuse. My friendship with her is the only good thing to come out of this situation. 'I will overcome all this that happened. I will live on, you will die a little every day,' she said to him. 'I will forgive you, but I will never forget.'

"Covered: Female teachers at Al-Madinah School, pictured, have been ordered to cover their heads with Islamic scarves during school hours even if they are not Muslim . Inspectors are to be sent ‘within days’ to a Muslim free school where girls are segregated from boys and non-Muslim female staff forced to wear hijabs. Michael Gove has ordered Ofsted to immediately investigate Al-Madinah School amid reports lessons are being replaced by prayers. The Derby school, which opened last year, was due to have its first inspection later this term but the quality of teaching and leadership will now be scrutinised as a matter of urgency. Possible outcomes include it being given the lowest possible rating of ‘inadequate’ and placed in special measures. The Secretary of State acted as critics warned similar practices could spread to other free schools, which are state funded but operate outside local authority control. The revelations have been embarrassing for Mr Gove, who introduced the schools in 2010 to raise the standard of education. Insiders at Al-Madinah School say it has become increasingly religious since opening. Teachers claim this has led to children’s education suffering. Girls allegedly have to sit at the back of the class and give up their place at the front of queues to boys. Stringed instruments, singing, reading fairy tales and even using the word ‘pig’ are banned, according to staff, who say they are also obliged to wear headscarves. Former headteacher Andrew Cutts-McKay resigned last month, two months after his deputy, Suzanne Southerland. Sources claimed they had been ‘bullied’ out of their jobs over concerns about hardline policies. The school denies the claims. Pressure groups and education experts said failure to take action would promote segregation – and encourage other Islamic free schools to follow Al-Madinah’s extreme model. They also warned that the way female pupils were being treated could end up damaging their sense of self-worth. Margaret Morrissey, from pressure group Parents Outloud, said: ‘This is going to make life extremely difficult for female pupils. ‘All the time they are being told they are second-class citizens. It is promoting a segregated society. ‘Children have to understand how to live in our society. If they’re not getting that at school then they’re not getting it anywhere.’ Chris McGovern, from the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘This is a very difficult situation. We live in a multicultural society and a consequence of that is you have multicultural practices. But the buck stops with Michael Gove.’ Investigation: Michael Gove has ordered inspectors to visit Al-Madinah School 'within days' Under scrutiny: The nation's first Muslim free school has caused controversy with its hard-line rules . And Alasdair Smith, national secretary of the Anti Academies Alliance, said: ‘I can’t understand why there has been the argument that deregulation [of free schools] is a good idea. ‘Some regulation is important because otherwise you get extremism in schools.’ He added: ‘We are creating an education system that is separating sections of society. ‘For the last 40 or 50 years people were brought together by being educated side by side. Now Mr Gove is allowing space for confusion and bigotry.’ A message posted on the school’s website by interim principal Stuart Wilson said: ‘There are a number of rumours circulating that are worrying parents. The school is not going to shut down.’ But a Department for Education spokesman said: ‘These allegations are very worrying. The DfE will not hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to prevent religious intolerance or any breaking of the rules for free schools.’","Ofsted investigating claims Al-Madinah School in Derby has replaced lessons with prayers .

"The cause of death of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been confirmed by a medical examiner - but is being kept secret at the request of investigators, it today emerged. Miss Graham, 18, went missing in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving a bar at 2am on September 13. She was last seen with Jesse Matthew Jr, who has been charged with her abduction. The sophomore's remains were discovered buried in a shallow grave in a densely wooded area of Albemarle County, eight miles from Charlottesville, in mid-October following a month-long search. Now, more than a month on, the cause and manner of her death have been confirmed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Virginia, it has been revealed. Scroll down for video . Tragic: The cause of death of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham (pictured) has been confirmed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Virginia - but is being kept secret at the request of investigators . 'Abducted': Miss Graham (left), 18, went missing in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving a bar on September 13. She was last seen with Jesse Matthew Jr (right), who has been charged with her abduction . However, the details will not yet be disclosed to the public after a police officer investigating the high-profile incident asked for the information to remain secret, according to CBS News. The medical examiner’s office said the Charlottesville officer had requested the cause and manner of Miss Graham's death to be 'withheld' for the time being, but refused to say anything further. Strangely, Charlottesville Police department is not leading the investigation into the case - Albemarle County Police is in charge. Neither police department, nor Albemarle Commonwealth's attorney, Denise Lunsford, would comment on the revelations, according to the Richmond Times Dispatch. Last weekend, hundreds of people gathered at West Potomac High School to pay tribute to Miss Graham, whose disappearance in September made headlines across the world. Friends described her as 'smart and sassy', while teacher Nicole Borghard said members of staff would often scan their rosters, hoping for an opportunity to teach the 'witty' student. The victim's classmates Rachel and Campbell and Hannah O'Neil spoke of how they previously made smores over a campfire with Miss Graham, who had a buoyant personality and a droll British wit.

Memorial: Last weekend, hundreds of students, teachers and parents gathered at West Potomac High School (pictured) to pay tribute to Miss Graham, whose disappearance in September made headlines globally . Tribute: Friends described her as 'smart and sassy', while teacher Nicole Borghard said members of staff would often scan their rosters, hoping for an opportunity to teach the student. Above, a tribute to Miss Graham . In front of 1,000 attendees, they recalled how their friend insisted on 'bringing her own British chocolate [to the campfire] because Hershey's was not up to her standards.' Meanwhile, teacher Allison Satterwhite told of how Graham relished the opportunity to correct her teachers in a way that still managed to be endearing. She recalled a hallway encounter in which the teacher was lecturing a group of students for causing a commotion in the hallway, prompting Graham to tell her that 'disruptional' was not a word. Special service: This photos shows the front of the order of service for Miss Graham's memorial . 'She had a great wit - it could be snarky at times but that's what we loved about her,' said her band teacher, Steve Rice, who shared stories about Graham's love of Elvis songs and the saxophone. Miss Graham's parents, John and Sue Graham, thanked the community for their support, particularly those who turned out to help police in the 35-day search for their daughter. 'Hannah was always able to steal the show,' Mr Graham said. 'We think she would have made important contributions to society in the years ahead.' It comes just days after 32-year-old Matthew, from Virginia, pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and abduction in connection with an unrelated case. The suspect made his first in-person court appearance in Fairfax County, Virginia, last Friday morning following the alleged attack on a 26-year-old woman in September 2005. The victim had  been walking home from a grocery store when she was reportedly dragged into a wooden area and sexually assaulted. Her attacker ran away after being startled by a passerby. Donning a green jail jumpsuit and with his dreadlocks tied back, Matthew bowed his head as he entered a not guilty plea in the nine-year-old case. The judge set a trial date for March 9, 2015. Matthew was arrested and charged two months ago with abducting Miss Graham. Authorities claim DNA evidence links Matthew to the 2005 assault in Fairfax, as well as the 2009 disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, according to NBC 4. In court: It comes just days after 32-year-old Matthew (pictured in his first court appearance), from Virginia, pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and abduction in connection with an unrelated case . Speaking with an attorney: The suspect (pictured, right) made his first in-person court appearance in Fairfax County, Virginia, last Friday morning following the alleged attack on a 26-year-old woman in September 2005 . As news of Miss Graham's disappearance hit the headlines earlier this year, reports emerged that the suspect had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus. The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped. His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported. Entering the courtroom: Authorities claim Matthew (left) is linked to both the abduction of Miss Graham as well as the disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington (right) in October 2009 . Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University, where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003. Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved. Last month, Matthew made his first court appearance in the 2005 case via videolink in Charlottesville. Earlier this week, he was transferred to Fairfax Jail ahead of his in-person appearance. He will now be returned to Charlottesville for a preliminary hearing on December 5 in relation to the alleged abduction of Miss Graham with the intent to defile. He is not yet facing murder charges. Albemarle County Police and Charlottesville Police were not immediately available for comment when contacted by MailOnline.","Hannah Graham went missing in Charlottesville at 2am on September 13 .

Uribe shed tears during the ceremony and embraced his then-38-year-old bride for a 'first dance' but didn't indulge in wedding cake. 'He didn't break his diet,' Uribe's mother said.

"Schools are being urged to fly the Union Jack and sing the national anthem at every assembly as part of a campaign to foster patriotism among the young. The campaign in Bolton was launched by a Tory councillor whose grandfather was the town’s first Indian immigrant. It was approved this week despite a Labour councillor questioning whether schools with tight budgets could afford flags and poles. Schools in Bolton are being urged to fly the Union Flag and sing the National Anthem . Schools in the area will also be asked to fly the St George’s cross on April 23, St George’s Day, and the Commonwealth flag in March. Mudasir Dean said he wanted to seize the Union Flag back from the Far Right and show children it was a symbol people from all backgrounds could celebrate. ‘My grandfather came to Bolton in the 1920s from India,’ he said. ‘He lived here all his life and he was the first Asian to settle in Bolton. ‘Growing up in Bolton, I’ve seen less and less of the Union Flag. It’s been hijacked by the Far Right and it’s time we take that symbol back into mainstream British, Bolton life.’ Councillor Dean said complaints that new immigrants couldn’t settle in Britain was sometimes ‘our own fault’. ‘If we were more patriotic – if we sang our national anthem and flew our flag – and instilled it in our younger generations, they would do,’ he added. It is hoped raising the flag will boost patriotism in school children (file picture) Speaking before Wednesday’s vote, Labour councillor and school governor Chris Peacock questioned the plan on practical grounds. ‘Who will pay for these new flag poles and flags?’ he asked. ‘Schools’ budgets are already stretched. Raising the Union flag won’t raise standards – that should be our priority.’ However the Labour-controlled authority backed the motion, carried with 34 members in favour, four against and 11 abstentions. The council will now write to all schools in the area and ask them to consider flying the flag and incorporating a performance of God Save the Queen into the school day. But Mr Peacock said he remained opposed, telling the BBC: ‘If you want to inspire patriotism amongst our young people, show the clips from the Olympics again.’","Schools in Bolton are being urged to fly the Union Jack and sing the national anthem .

"Leanings: Catholics are more likely to vote Labour while Church of England worshippers most consistently back the Conservatives, according to new research . Catholics are more likely to vote Labour while Church of England worshippers most consistently back the Conservatives, according to new research. Think tank Theos said they have carried out the first in-depth analysis into the relationship between religion and politics in Britain. Catholics were found to be the most left-wing of Christian groups and more pro-welfare than Anglicans, who were said to be more authoritarian in their political values. Non-religious people are most . consistently libertarian, taking a strong line against censorship and . are sceptical about management and the fair distribution of wealth. Nick . Spencer, Theos’s research director and co-author of the report, said . that while there are clear alignments between religious views and . voting, 'block votes' do not exist in Britain. 'Every five years or so, someone claims that this or that religious (or non-religious group) might swing the election,' he said. 'Politics . isn’t like that, however, and this report shows that religious block . votes do not exist in Britain as many claim they do in America. 'It does show, however, that there . are clear and significant alignments between various religious and . political camps, of which politicians should be aware. 'At . a time when mass party membership, political ideology and party . tribalism are at a low ebb, we should pay attention to the big political . values that shape our voting behaviour.' The report ‘Voting and Values in Britain: Does religion count?’ was based on data from the latest 2010 census. Researches said non-Christian groups were harder to analyse because of small samples. Findings: Nick Spencer, Theos¿s research director and co-author of the report, said that while there are clear alignments between religious views and voting, 'block votes' do not exist in Britain . However, in 2010 Muslims tended to strongly vote Labour, as did Hindus and Sikhs to a lesser extent. By contrast, the Jewish vote was more likely to go to the Conservatives and Buddhist to the Liberal Democrats. All groups, irrespective of religion, rated the economy, immigration, the budget deficit and unemployment as their most important issues.","Research shows Catholics are more likely to vote Labour .

"A mother who is dying from cancer begged her council to let both her sons attend the same primary school - but had her request denied because she lives 100ft outside of the catchment area. Michelle Amey, who was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2008 which has since spread all over her body, fears her family will struggle to cope with the strain of doing two school runs every day. Her eldest son, nine-year-old Charlie, already attends Mudeford Junior School in Christchurch, Dorset. 'Extremely close': Charlie, nine (left), and George, six (right), currently both attend Mudeford primary school in Christchurch, Devon . Refused: Michelle Amey, right, was told that her two sons cannot go to school together. She is pictured with her husband Stuart . Her younger son George, six, currently attends the attached infants' school, but despite appeals to Dorset County Council he will not be allowed to move. Instead he will be forced to attend Somerford Primary School, which is even further away from the family's home in the town. Mrs Amey and her husband Stuart, who are both 37, faced a gruelling appeals process from the council, who asked invasive questions about her cancer treatment and made Mr Amey feel as if he were 'on trial' for questioning their decision. Mrs Amey fears the boys' 'extremely close' relationship will be but under strain if the two are separated. She said: 'George and Charlie support each other, they’re there for each other a lot. 'They’re aware of my illness and symptoms and are very sensitive at the moment. I can’t face putting George in another school. He would be devastated.' Split apart: The strain of taking George, left, and Charlie, right, on separate school runs could put serious strain on the family, Mrs Amey fears . Mrs Amey claims the council’s ‘rules are rules’ attitude forced her to struggle on buses and on foot to do two separate school runs as her health deteriorated. She fell ill shortly after George was born in 2008 and doctors confirmed a mole on her leg was malignant melanoma. The deadly skin cancer spread to her groin and she required surgery and radiotherapy to bring the disease under control. But the cancer has now spread to her brain, kidneys, lungs, liver and lymph nodes and since falling ill she has had four brain tumours removed, which means she cannot drive. An appeal hearing with an independent panel dashed Mrs Amey’s hopes of her ‘extremely close’ boys being able to attend the same junior school. She said: 'They made Stuart feel like he was under investigation, they were asking a lot about my health. 'When Stuart told them I’d received treatment for brain tumours, they would ask: ""well what treatment exactly are you talking about?"". 'They were extremely intrusive. He felt a bit like he was on trial - their attitude was really awful and it was basically rules are rules. It was like talking to a brick wall.’ Mr and Mrs Amey plan to write to Education Secretary Michael Gove, whom they will ask to intervene and allow their sons to attend school together. Mrs Amey said: 'We’re hoping we can get the decision overturned. George is constantly asking whether we’ve got him a place at the junior school. 'His friends have had trial days and he’s missed out and with this on top of my illness, he’s very tearful. 'It’s just very, very difficult. I am fighting for my life but I am determined to fight for the boys to be together. Together: Both boys wish to attend Mudeford junior school, where Charlie currently is. But George's appeal has been rejected . 'Sometimes I can’t walk, I have severe joint pain and nausea - the symptoms are similar to chemotherapy. 'I don’t know when they are going to strike so the boys are like my little carers. They’ve had to grow up a bit quickly which is quite sad.' Mr Amey used to work in investment banking, but gave his job up after his wife’s diagnosis. He now works for The Honeypot Children’s Charity, allowing him more flexible hours to help take care of his wife and children. Mrs Amey said: ‘Stuart is brilliant. He carries all the weight on his shoulders and tries to be strong all the time but it does get to him. 'The whole thing is so unnecessary, it’s just extra stress and pressure.' A spokesman for Dorset County Council said: 'While we are unable to comment on individual cases, we can confirm that there was a recent appeals committee which reviewed several cases. 'The county council presented its case that Mudeford Junior School cannot take more than 33 children in each of its Year 3 classes entering in September 2014. 'Each family at the appeal presented their case for exceptional circumstances. 'The panel reviewed and made the decision that this particular case has been dealt with by Dorset County Council appropriately. 'We have been very sympathetic to this case. Those involved have gone beyond what is required to assist and support the family and we will continue to work with them.'

"Embarrassment: Home Secretary Theresa May has admitted employing a foreign worker . The Tories faced fresh embarrassment over immigration last night when it emerged that Home Secretary Theresa May uses a Brazilian-born cleaner. A day after Immigration Minister James Brokenshire condemned the ‘wealthy metropolitan elite’ for using cheap labour from migrants, his boss confirmed that she employs a female home help who was born abroad. The cleaner has obtained British citizenship and aides denied that Mrs May played any role in assisting her quest for a passport. But the revelation came as Downing Street admitted that Samantha Cameron helped the Prime Minister’s Nepalese nanny get British citizenship. Mrs Cameron was named on Gita Lima’s application for British citizenship in 2010 as the Nepalese nanny’s employer. In that role she would have been expected to support her claim for citizenship. A No10 spokesman said: ‘Mr and Mrs Cameron’s nanny became a British citizen in late 2010. Mr and Mrs Cameron did not write a letter supporting their nanny’s application for British citizenship. The normal application process was  followed throughout.’ A spokesman for Mrs May said: ‘Theresa May’s cleaner is a British citizen but she was born in Brazil. Theresa had no role at all in her cleaner’s application for citizenship.’ But the fresh revelations will fuel the view of many voters that Cabinet ministers are part of the ‘wealthy metropolitan elite’ criticised by Tory Mr Brokenshire. And the details are likely to spark cries of hypocrisy among those who employ cleaners and nannies at the way ministers are prepared to  criticise people who hire immigrant workers while doing exactly the same themselves. Criticism: Immigration minister James Brokenshire has hit out at the 'wealthy metropolitan elite' In a speech on Thursday, Mr Brokenshire said: ‘For too long, the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country.’ The issue is particularly acute since Mr Brokenshire’s predecessor Mark Harper was forced to resign after it emerged that he had employed a cleaner who was working in Britain illegally. A Downing Street spokesman made clear that the Camerons employed Miss Lima not because she was cheap but because she was the best person for the job. The candour of Mrs May and the Camerons was not matched by all in the Cabinet. The Daily Mail yesterday asked 20 of its members if they employed foreign workers as cleaners, nannies, builders and home helps. However, the majority of those questioned failed to provide a substantive response. Labour MP John Mann said they should come clean, adding: ‘They should be seeking out British staff. We need every Cabinet minister to declare what staff they have employed from abroad.’ David Cameron: He and his wife have had an Australian nanny and now have one from Nepal who became a British citizen in 2010. Nick Clegg: ‘I have a lady who has a Belgian passport who helps us.’ George Osborne: The Chancellor’s spokesman had no comment, but Treasury sources indicated he has no foreign staff. Theresa May: Home Secretary’s cleaner is a British citizen who was born in Brazil. Patrick McLoughlin: The Transport Secretary doesn’t employ foreign workers ‘at the moment’. William Hague: Foreign Secretary’s aide responded with ‘not to my knowledge’. Chris Grayling: The Justice Secretary ‘doesn’t employ any foreign folk’. Justine Greening: The International Development Secretary ‘does not have a home help, cleaner, nanny or a builder’. There was no response from aides for the following: Michael Gove, Education Secretary; Iain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary; Owen Paterson, Environment Secretary; Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary; Francis Maude, Cabinet Office  Minister; Philip Hammond, Defence Secretary; Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary; Maria Miller, Culture Secretary; Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury; Vince Cable, Business Secretary; Alistair Carmichael, Scottish Secretary; Ed Davey, Energy Secretary.","James Brokenshire blamed the 'wealthy metropolitan elite' for rising immigration because they hire foreign workers at home .

'The tragedy of Ebola is that we know how . to tackle the disease, but the governments in West Africa are in dire . need of more resources and solutions,' Allen said in a statement. 'The developed world needs to step up now . with resources and solutions.' Allen said the donation from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation will help CDC establish emergency operations centers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed about 2,300 people and shows no sign of slowing six months after it began. U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress for $88 million in new Ebola funding, including $25 million for CDC, but this week congressional leaders said they would provide no more than $40 million. Allen said his foundation's gift would help CDC establish and equip emergency operations centers in the three most-affected countries, focusing on public health, not patient care. The centers will use 'data management and communication systems for disease and patient contact tracing, to detect and stop the disease from spreading,' Allen said. They will also expand lab testing to identify new outbreaks, and disseminate information about the epidemic to the public. 'A winnable battle should never be lost,' Allen said. Health workers in West Africa use protective gear while dealing with patients infected with the Ebola virus . This map from the World Health Organization shows the countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak . Health aid workers remove a victim of the fatal Ebola virus while wearing protective gear to avoid spreading the disease . CDC has just more than 100 public health experts in the Ebola zone, and plans to send more. 'Ebola is raging through parts of West Africa like an out-of-control forest fire but it can be controlled if the world comes together,' CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement. The CDC Foundation, which was established by Congress in 1994 to raise funding to augment what CDC gets from Congress, recently committed $1 million to the Ebola response, including money for computers, personal protective equipment and thermal scanning thermometers for airport screeners, and training for healthcare workers. Since resigning from Microsoft in 1983, Allen has become a prominent philanthropist, supporting scientific research through the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. He also owns the Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team. The donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will also support emergency response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa — and represents the charity's largest donation to a humanitarian effort. 'It became clear to us over the last seven to 10 days that the pace and scope of the epidemic was increasing significantly,' said Chris Elias, president of global development for the world's largest charitable foundation. Workers . wearing protective clothing stand next to a mother holding her child . inside the contaminated area at the Elwa Hospital run by Doctors Without . Borders in Monrovia . Currently . the virus can only be transmitted through contact with a victim's . bodily fluids, including blood, vomit, diarrhea and other secretions . The Seattle-based foundation said the money will go to the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CDC and international organizations involved in fighting transmission of the virus. The money will be used to purchase supplies and to develop vaccines, therapies and better diagnostic tools. 'By fighting Ebola now, we can make sure it doesn't become an endemic in [West] Africa,' Gates tweeted on Wednesday. The foundation wants to help stop the outbreak as well as accelerate development of treatments and improve prevention. Elias said foundation officials have been talking to its partners around the world to assess the best use of its dollars and could not say yet how much would be spent on the emergency response and how much on research and development. 'One of our key advantages is flexibility,' he said. Back in the day: Paul Allen and Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975 and rose to prominence as the personal computer gained a mass following beginning in the '80s . Melinda Gates (left) and husband Bill pledged $50 million to fight the Ebola outbreak . Global health and development dominate the work of the foundation, which has given away $30 billion since 1997.

"Schools are producing a generation of ‘amoral’ children because staff are too busy chasing exam results to teach pupils the difference between right and wrong, it is claimed today. A private school head will claim that teachers - mainly in state schools - are under so much pressure to meet exam targets they are failing to equip pupils with basic values. Richard Walden, chairman of the Independent Schools Association, will say that private schools, in contrast, are turning out ‘well-rounded’ pupils with ‘moral understanding’. Richard Walden, a private school headmaster, has said state school teachers are so busy getting children to pass exams they don't have time to teach right from wrong . In provocative remarks, Mr Walden will claim that many state school teachers ‘operate in a climate of fear’. He will suggest that the Government’s regime of testing and league tables is the modern-day equivalent of the birch, which was used to cane pupils until corporal punishment was outlawed in 1986. But parents are increasingly ‘buying in’ to the idea that only exam scores matter and are demanding ‘quick-fix results’. Mr Walden, head of £6,867-a-year Castle House School in Shropshire, which caters for two to 11-year-olds, will make the claims in a keynote speech to fellow heads at the association’s annual conference in Warwickshire. Too many teachers in state schools are ‘overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve results’ and devote too much time to ‘teaching the basics’, he will argue. ‘Schools are turning out too many amoral children because teachers cannot find the time to teach the difference between right and wrong,’ he says. ‘It seems that the only results that matter are those which have created added value in terms of raising a pupil’s statistical level from one stage to the next, and parents are increasingly buying in to this notion. ‘This focus on league tables and attainment levels distracts teachers and effectively disables them from providing children with a more rounded and enriching education - one that will give them the moral compass they need for life.’ Mr Walden will say that the ‘formation of character is fundamental in education’ and done ‘so well’ in independent schools, which offer a broad curriculum and range of lunchtime and after-school activities. Mr Walden will dismiss the idea that privately educated children do better because they are from privileged backgrounds and argue their success is based on a rich education . He will dismiss the argument that privately-educated only succeed in life because they are from ‘elitist or privileged’ backgrounds. ‘They do well because they have received a value-rich education, provided with love in our independent schools.’ Learning values allows pupils to ‘distinguish the good from the bad and the true from the false’, Mr Walden says. ‘The very nature of our schools, with their respect for discipline and academic seriousness, sport and culture, citizenship and community, service, environmental awareness, spiritual life and personal responsibility, sends out into the world young people with emotional intelligence, developed moral understanding and a willingness to make a contribution to society,’ he says. These qualities cannot be measured by ‘inspectors’ tick-charts’. Mr Walden goes on to say: ‘We cannot measure the growth of maturity in a young person grade by grade. ‘It takes time, but if we hold our nerve as educators and as schools - and that may mean resisting the demands of parents who want quick-fix results, or the pressures of external statistical grading systems, not to mention the difficult financial situations that we can face - if we hold our nerve, we will continue to turn out well-rounded individuals who make a difference to society, as we have for many years.’ He will say it is important to discuss ‘values’ since education ‘does not seem to be enough’. He will refer to a Muslim scientist who held extremist views while studying at Cambridge, before renouncing them in the wake of the 2005 London bombings. ‘Education is the mark of a civilised society; we believe it should prevent barbarism. But it does not seem to be enough. Indeed often it is the educated who perpetrate wicked acts.’ Pupils need to learn how to ‘think for oneself and choose wisely’ to help them grapple with ethical issues in future, Mr Walden will say. He adds: ‘We are gaining the potential to improve the human gene pool, for a good end, the eradication of many diseases - but at what cost?’","Richard Walden, private school headmaster, argues state schools create amoral children because they don't have time to teach right from wrong .

"It is the scourge of schoolchildren up and down the country. Classes can often be heard letting out a collective groan when the teacher mentions homework,  ruining plans for a night watching films or playing out with friends. However, this will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk -  because it has decided to ban all homework. Good news: Homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk -  because it has decided to ban it. This picture is posed by models . Instead, the 1100 children who will attend the Jane Austen Academy in Norwich will do longer days at school. The mixed free school for 11-18-year-olds - which will specialise in English and the humanities - is set to open in September 2014. The school yesterday unveiled its prospective principal, Claire Heald, who said that city children would do extra study at school as part of the extended day, which could last until about 5pm. She said: 'Rather than setting homework that pupils could go home and struggle with at home, and where there may be limited access to computers, they will do that as independent study in the day. 'We are saying that when they go home they should enjoy quality family time. 'There will not be any traditional homework - and that has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time.' New approach: The 1100 students who will attend the Jane Austen Academy will do longer days at school. The school's prospective principal, Claire Heald, is pictured . But Ms Heald said the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of crucial exams. She's ready to create a new dramatic template in the UK after French president Francois Hollande called for the end of homework in primary schools last October. The French leader insisted independent learning at school would enhance equality because kids who get help with homework from parents have a huge head start. Since their introduction by the Coalition, dozens of free schools have opened - with many others in the pipeline. But they have proved controversial, with many providing alternative methods of teaching and education. At the Tiger Primary School in Maidstone, pupils have all-singing and all-dancing curriculum. Pupils have specialist teachers for Mandarin, music, gym, dance and games lessons. They also have access to a school farm and ecology woodland. Pupils at the Greenwich Free School in London spend a third more time learning than most school children. The school day lasts from 8am to 5.30pm. There are only 100 pupils in each year, which the school says means teachers get to know each pupil as an individual. The exciting initiative has already sparked keen interest from other headteachers in Norfolk. Peter Devonish, headteacher of Neatherd High School in Dereham, said: 'My initial thought is that it's really compelling. 'It sounds like a really good idea. 'Having the children on site a bit longer to consolidate their learning is a really good idea. 'The children can finish work and they can have their time with the family.' But he warned: 'I have got two stumbling blocks. 'One is our rurality and getting children home at that time, and the other is changing staff contracts so they can be here until 5.30pm. 'If you are a free school you do not have to conform in the same way.' Mr Devonish said they set pupils project-based homework, such as looking at an energy efficient house, which allowed them to combine independent study with working with their parents. Craig Morrison, principal of King's Lynn Academy, agreed that the whole prickly issue of homework should be looked at. Mr Morrison said: 'I can understand why people want to experiment with this because it is one I would not say anybody can say they have got definitively right over the years. 'And if they are starting a new school then it gives them the chance to try out new things.' He added: 'A large problem with homework, which we have tackled, has been that not enough is done with it. 'With homework, a lot of effort can go into it, so it's about celebrating what children do rather than processing it in terms of marking it and handing it back.'","Pupils at the Jane Austen Academy in Norwich will do longer days at school .

"A violent sword battle broke out at Sikhism's holiest temple today during a special prayer ceremony to mark the government massacre that took place there 30 years ago. At least eleven people were injured as dozens of Sikh radicals clashed with supporters of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) at the revered Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab. It is understood the scuffle erupted over who would speak first at the service, held to remember victims of military offensive Operation Blue Star that left hundreds dead on June 6, 1984, when soldiers stormed the compound in a bid to flush out separatist insurgents holed up in the temple. Scroll down for video . Violent scuffle: At least 11 people were injured as dozens of Sikh radicals clashed with supporters of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee at the Golden Temple, in Amritsar . Swords at dawn: Footage showed men running down temple steps, shouting battle cries and lashing out with their swords as the violence grew . Deadly ramifications: As a result of the storming of the Golden Temple, the Prime . Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards . Footage appeared to show the two groups of men, sporting blue and saffron turbans, chasing each other down the temple's marble steps, yelling battle cries and lashing out with their swords as the violence grew out of control, soon spilling inside the temple's walls. 'Today we were supposed to have a solemn . remembrance for the martyrs of 1984, so what has happened is very sad,' Prem Singh Chandumajra, a spokesman for Punjab's ruling party . Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), told reporters. 'The Temple has once again been dishonoured today,' he added. Angry: Operation Blue Star saw the Indian Army storm the Golden Temple to flush out Sikh separatists and arrest Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale a Sikh leader and his followers who had initiated a movement for a separate Sikh state .

'The . violent clashes will be investigated and action will be taken against . those who are accused,' said Giani Gurbachan Singh, a leader of the SGPC, the . elected body that manages Sikh temples. Operation Blue Star was one of the most contentious episodes in India's battle against Sikh separatists in the 1980s. Remembering a bloodbath: It is understood the scuffle erupted over who would speak first at the service, held to remember victims of government offensive Operation Blue Star that left hundreds dead on June 6, 1984 . Divided in remembrance: On Friday, Hundreds had gathered at the shrine to remember those killed in the June 6 raid 30 years ago, but the ceremony soon erupted into chaos . The 1984 Indian army operation to establish control over the Golden Temple, ordered by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was one of the most contentious episodes in India's battle against Sikh separatists in the 1980s. Sikh militants had holed up in the temple for months. The Indian army botched an attempt to clear them from the holy site, badly underestimating the resistance at first before being drawn into a three-day assault. The attack outraged Sikhs and led to a catastrophic breakdown in communal relations. When Mrs Gandhi was killed by her Sikh guards in a revenge attack a few months later, the country erupted. Mobs overran trains and went house to house across northern India, beating and killing thousands of Sikhs, hacking many to death and burning others alive. The insurgency was stamped out in the late 1980s. The three-day siege saw the Indian Army storm the Golden Temple to flush out Sikh separatists and arrest Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale a Sikh leader and his followers who had initiated a movement for a separate Sikh state. As a result, Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards following the bloodbath. Nearly 3,000 people . were subsequently killed in retaliatory riots against the Sikhs. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak . Committee is an organisation in India responsible for the upkeep of . gurdwaras, Sikh places of worship, in three states of Punjab, Haryana . and Himachal Pradesh. It is also responsible for the administration, upkeep and security of the Golden Temple, known as Harmandir Sahib. Earlier today, hundreds had gathered at the temple to mark the massacre's anniversary. But proceedings took an ugly turn when Simranjeet Singh Mann, the local head of Sikh political party Shiromani Akali Dal, and his supporters forcibly tried to deliver a speech from the temple's rostrum. But guards from the SGPC attempted to stop him, resulting in a fracas that grew into a violent stand off. The situation was made worse by the fact that police personnel are not permitted inside the Golden Temple. During the melee, many panic-striken devotees ran for safety, sources said. The . CNN-IBN television channel said police detained nearly 50 people, and . that many shops closed because of the tension in Amritsar city. Meanwhile, . 1,500 personnel of anti-riot police were deployed in several places in . Amritsar in the wake of a bandh call given by hardline outfit Dal . Khalsa. India has suffered . an upsurge of violence in many forms since a general election last month . won by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya . Janata Party (BJP).

"A mother has been left furious after being forced to home school her four-year-old daughter who was was rejected from nine schools in her local area. Estelle Perrons should have started term last September but now faces an uncertain future because no school in her catchment area has enough space to take her. Her mother Emily Perrons, 26, had set her sights on St Mary’s Primary School, the same primary school her other two daughters Elizabeth, ten, and Eve, eight, go to. Emily Perrons, 26, has been forced to home school her four-year-old daughter Estelle after nine schools said they did not have enough room for the toddler to attend . However, after being told there was no room, the single mum was forced to look elsewhere. The search has continued without success for the past eight months. Miss Perrons, who doesn’t drive, said Nottingham City Council told her the nearest school that will take her daughter is six miles away in Clifton. But as the mum-of-three has to walk her other children the two miles to their school she is being forced to home school Estelle as it is 'physically impossible to be in two places at once.' Yesterday Miss Perrons, from Sherwood, in Nottingham, fumed: 'It is ridiculous, I am now facing the option that my daughter might not go to any school. 'She is going to nursery for three mornings a week but she is the oldest there as she is nearly five and the nursery is saying they can’t cater for her much longer. 'Now I just want her in any school I can physically get to. I have appealed all nine schools’ decisions but it is looking unlikely. 'It would have been nice for her to be with her sisters as I don’t want them split up but that doesn’t seem like an option. Estelle was supposed to start school last September and was hoping to attend a nearby primary with her two sisters, but was turned down for a place (file pic) 'I was working at Argos before I had children and I just want any job now. 'If I can’t get Estelle into school I won’t be able to get a job and the government will make me go on Job Seeker’s Allowance. 'I don’t want to claim benefits, I want to work. It is not my fault there are not enough school places. 'We are already walking four miles a day and if we do get the bus a family ticket is £9. To get to Clifton as well would mean spending nearly £20 a day just on bus fares. 'All I want is for Estelle to be in school and get an education. 'I have started looking to see if we can move because I think that will have to be the last resort.' Geraldine Kelly, head teacher at St Mary’s, in the Sherwood area of Nottingham said they faced a difficult task at having to turn down places for children. She said: 'We are popular because we get results and are rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. It is difficult but we have to turn down some parents.' Councillor David Mellen, portfolio holder for children’s services for Nottingham City Council, has pledged that a place will be found at every school. He said: 'We are working very hard to offer every child a place as quickly as possible.'","Estelle Perrons, four, supposed to start primary school last September .

"In all the 30 years I have been working in Asian elephant conservation, I thought I had seen it all – blatant corruption, the rape and total disregard of our beautiful planet and sickening wildlife atrocities, to name but a few. All due to the most dangerous animal of all: homo sapiens. Not much shocks me any more, but something happened in recent weeks that shook me to the core when the charity Elephant Family and the Ecologist Film Unit set out to document the environmental genocide that is out of control on the island of Sumatra,  Indonesia. Sumatra is special to me because I spent a lot of time there on expeditions when I was younger. It was a paradise – vast pristine forests, intact coral reefs and abundant wildlife. Scroll down for video . Raja is a male baby elephant found in north Aceh, villagers found him roaming community plantation and held him captive . All this has changed now and their elephants are the most endangered on the planet. In a single generation, the population has been cut in half, with countless other animals disappearing at breakneck speed. During the filming, a helpless, emaciated baby male elephant called Raja, who was barely a year old, was found in a village, shackled with heavy chains to a tree. He had been taken hostage by the villagers, who were demanding compensation from the Sumatran  government for the damage his family had done to their crops. Can you believe that we are now  living in a world where people are actually holding baby elephants to ransom? It is almost unthinkable. But just look at the photographs – look at Raja, as he strains against his chains, waving his little trunk for food and reassurance. He is bellowing in desperation for his mother. Can you believe that we are now  living in a world where people are actually holding baby elephants to ransom? He strains against his chains, waving his little trunk for food and reassurance. He is bellowing in desperation for his mother. I have heard that sound of distressed calves many times in my life. It never fails to haunt me. But it is his eyes that haunt me more than anything – pleading for help – innocent, desperate and helpless. A war is being waged across Asia. In the face of relentless deforestation, elephants are being forced out of their natural habitats and they have no choice but to share their living space with humans. As the elephants’ forest home is destroyed, stressed and starving herds flee from the chainsaws straight into villages. They demolish everything in sight, . trampling crops, flattening houses and often killing people. Frankly, . you really cannot blame the villagers for taking such drastic steps in . the sheer desperation to survive and feed their own families. Capturing . a baby elephant and holding it to ransom is grisly and depressing, but . it is reality as humans and elephants fight for space. People need to know why this is  happening. They need to understand what is driving this madness. Mark Shand was shocked when he heard of the destruction of Sumatra's elephant population . The cause is an innocently named product called palm oil. It’s a constituent part of almost everything that we use and consume – biscuits, margarine, ice cream, soap, shampoo. The list is endless. And the blame lies firmly with the greed of the large corporations in the East that produce it as a cash crop to fuel the insatiable consumerism of the Western world. The thirst for palm oil is apparently unquenchable and its cultivation is  ripping out the last great rainforests. Although forest destruction and its lethal impact on endangered species are plain to see, palm oil is practically an invisible ingredient, listed under the generic term ‘vegetable oil’. April, Duta Palma, Sinar Mas and Sime . Darby may not be household names, but these are just some of  the . companies producing palm oil in Indonesia and selling it on to the . market for about £500 per ton. L’Occitane, . Ferrero, Cadbury, Ginster’s pasties, Clover margarine, Pringles, . Kellogg’s, Haribo, Nestlé and Mars are just a few of the more familiar . names of those that use palm oil.

The thirst for palm oil is apparently unquenchable and its cultivation is  ripping out the last great rainforests . All . the major supermarkets use palm oil in their own-brand products. Some . are better than others in getting palm oil from responsible sources, but . the point is that it is everywhere and in everything. It is a silent . assassin. Not until 2014 will there be a legal requirement for . manufacturers to label palm oil on their products. And, . to make matters worse, the only certification body to monitor the . production of so-called ‘sustainable’ palm oil is immensely flawed. Consumer industries are hiding behind a fallacy. The verdant rainforest of Aceh in . North Sumatra is one of the largest left in South-East Asia. It is the . only place in the world where elephants, tigers, orang-utans and rhinos . all still live together – a real life Jungle Book. But, . right now, the Aceh government is close to adopting a plan that would . see hundreds of thousands of hectares of this forest opened up for the . cultivation of palm oil. This ironically titled ‘Spatial Plan’ is . nothing more than a deforestation plan – an extinction plan, seeking to . legitimise the illegal felling that is already happening. Environmentalists agree that we need . to protect about 65 per cent of Aceh’s forest if we are to save its . biodiversity. The government plan would allow for only 45 per cent to be . protected – that’s a difference of way over a million hectares, or more . than a million football pitches. The result would be a death blow for . wildlife. Ecosystems are cleared for oil palm plantations in  Aceh Tamiang. This area is where the habitat was for Sumatran elephants, tigers and orangutans. Not only will . these iconic species be pushed to extinction, the local communities . that rely on this forest will be even more exposed to natural disasters. Devastating landslides have already washed away buildings, including . entire schools. They will become unrelenting and vast areas of land will flood. Wildlife will be forced into ever greater conflict with people, and elephants like Raja won’t stand a chance. Sadly . for him, it is too late. He died alone, still chained to that tree, . though Elephant Family worked tirelessly for a week to negotiate his . release. Already we’ve . discovered that another calf, this one just a month old, has been . captured and held to ransom by local farmers. Everyone is working around . the clock to make sure that this little calf survives. I am doubtful. But in the grander scheme of things there is hope. If there wasn’t hope, I would have packed up my bags a long time ago. If . we can protect these forests and stop the new plan in Aceh from going . ahead, then we’re taking a giant step in the right direction. Hundreds . of supporters have already written to the Aceh government  urging them . to stop destroying their forests. But we need help. We need everyone to . write. Increased knowledge . of palm oil and compulsory labelling will finally allow shoppers to make . informed choices about what they buy. We need to push food . manufacturers and retailers to support a transformation of the industry . towards genuine sustainable palm oil, and we need to do it quickly.

More than 600 guests are attending in support. I know I should be excited about the ball. In many ways I am, because of the great opportunity it presents for conservation, but on the night I know that I will not be able to get Raja and others like him out of my mind.

We are close to losing one of the most enigmatic, iconic and ecologically vital species on the planet. The clock is ticking.

"A barrister made a hoax call to the former Defence Secretary claiming to have intelligence about terrorist bomb attacks on the London Olympics and the assassination of the Queen, a court heard. Michael Shrimpton, 57, telephoned MP Philip Hammond to tell him that a bomb stolen from a sunken Russian submarine had been smuggled into the country and could be used to blow up the opening ceremony of the London Olympics and kill the Queen, a jury was told. Southwark Crown Court heard how Shrimpton had said he had picked up information from 'credible European sources' that intelligence was being blocked by official channels about the terror threat and left a message for Mr Hammond, in which he dropped the names of several MPs. Barrister Michael Shrimpton is accused of making a hoax call to the former Defence Secretary claiming to have intelligence about terrorist bomb attacks on the London Olympics and the assassination of the Queen . He told police who arrested him the following day that hauling him in for questioning was 'a colossal c**k-up worthy of an apology, damages and lunch on the MI5.' Shrimpton, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, who is representing himself, denies two counts of making bomb hoaxes relating to the London 2012 Games. Opening the case prosecutor Alan Blake said: 'This is a 57-year-old barrister with a fascination for politics the military and intelligence. 'In April 2012, he passed on information about a threat of nuclear attack. That information was extraordinary and dramatic.' Shrimpton called Mr Hammond's office on April 19, 2012, and left a message warning that the nuclear weapon had been stolen from the sunken Russian submarine, the Kursk. He said it had been smuggled into the UK and stored near a London hospital in preparation for the attack. Mr Blake said: 'You will remember the degree of tension about potential terrorists and it would have been brave and foolish to ignore threats, especially from a professional man.' The court heard that Shrimpton, a self proclaimed intelligence expert on national security, also telephoned Sarah Sproat, of the Conservation Association in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, the following day and told her about the bomb threats. Barry Burton, who was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Defence Secretary at the time, told the court he spoke to Shrimpton on the telephone on April 19, 2012. Shrimpton, 57, telephoned MP Philip Hammond to tell him that a bomb stolen from a sunken Russian submarine had been smuggled into the country, Southwark Crown Court was told . 'He said he had concerns about threats to the London Games and to the Queen,' said Mr Burton. 'He said a mass nuclear weapon had entered the UK. He said four other weapons were removed from the submarine Kursk when it sank and he explained one had been obtained by the German terrorist organisation DVD. 'He said one of the weapons caused the tsunami disaster in Japan.' Mr Burton said Shrimpton spoke in a calm manner and told him he knew William Hague and former Defence Secretary, Liam Fox, but Mr Burton said he had not heard Mr Fox mention Shrimpton. He told the court: 'He said he was a lawyer with an involvement in national security and he was a Conservative.' Mr Burton believed he was a hoax caller but told the Olympic Security Authority and the cabinet office. Under cross-examination, Shrimpton told Mr Burton, who has worked for the Ministry of Defence for 36 years, that he had said there was a possibility a nuclear warhead had been smuggled into London. Mr Burton replied: 'What I heard from the caller was that a weapon had been moved to the UK.' Shrimpton asked Mr Burton if an E3 plane is capable of carrying detectors which can pick up nuclear warheads but Mr Burton replied: 'I don't know.' Shrimpton said: 'Someone at the Cabinet Office grounded the E3's'.' Mr Burton replied: I don't know.' When Shrimpton asked Mr Burton if he accepted that a number of nuclear weapons had gone missing over recent years, Mr Burton replied: 'I have no knowledge of that' - prompting Judge McCreath to sharply reprimand him. The judge said: 'I have no idea where this is going. You have been a barrister for a number of years and you cannot use witnesses as part of your speeches. They are here to answer questions. 'I will not have conspiracy theories bandied around the court unless they are genuinely real. Shrimpton said he had picked up information from 'credible European sources' that intelligence was being blocked by official channels about the terror threat and left a message for Mr Hammond, it is claimed . 'You must control yourself. 'The guillotine is very close to your neck.' Shrimpton was arrested on April 20, 2012 and told police he was an intelligence and national security specialist with hundreds of contacts. He said the German Defence Service, DVD, was responsible for sabotaging the Kursk and stated the service now controls Al Qaeda and has penetrated MI5 and MI6. Shrimpton refused to reveal his sources but said they included 'someone in Munch who lunches with the Pope.' He called his arrest a colossal c**k-up worthy of an apology, damages and lunch on the MI5, and claimed the weapon had been taken back out of the UK while he had been in custody by the Royal Navy, which moved it to Germany, and it could be used against New York. Mr Blake said: 'Mr Shrimpton communicated the threat using vocabulary and the persona of an intelligence insider at a time of national heightened tension. Despite his protestations, he knew or believed the information had no real foundations and was false and misleading. 'Michael Shrimpton is an unrelenting networker desperate to associate himself with people with real power and influence. 'His persona as an intelligence specialist is founded on flimsy foundations. He sought to above all bolster his credibility.' Shrimpton, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, denies two counts of making bomb hoaxes relating to the London 2012 Games. The trial continues.

"A seriously ill baby was forced to wait in an Accident and Emergency ward for more than 12 hours because there were no suitable beds available anywhere in the UK. The shocking case emerged as specialists yesterday warned the Department of Health about a national shortage of intensive care beds for children this winter. The Paediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS) says all 29 units in Britain have been running close to capacity in recent weeks because of a surge in cases of a nasty respiratory virus and that there are several examples of children having to wait for appropriate care. Shocking: A baby was forced to wait in A&E for 12 hours because there were no suitable beds (file picture) In the latest case, the three-month-old infant had been taken to casualty in Birmingham with a serious chest condition. A medical team immediately stabilised the child’s breathing. The child needed a bed on a paediatric intensive care (PICU) ward because of the severity of its condition, but despite staff ringing each of the 29 units, all of the 320 beds were already occupied by sick children. A bed was eventually found nearly 100 miles away in Sheffield later that day. The baby has since made a recovery and has been discharged, but the incident highlights the huge pressure on the limited number of PICU beds at this time of year when there is a much higher rate of chest infections. Children in need: The case has highlighted the pressure on the limited number of beds at this time of year . The case earlier this month emerged in an internet blog written by Mark Newbold, chief executive of Heart of England NHS Trust. Mr Newbold wrote: ‘An ITU [intensive treatment unit] bed is needed, but across the country there aren’t any. They had hoped for one in Cardiff, but just been told it had gone.’ This year there have been increasing numbers of occasions where there are no spare beds – a situation which could put young patients at serious risk. Yesterday specialist bodies including PICS, the Intensive Care Society and the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists, put together a statement for the Government warning of the situation. It says ‘significant numbers of children .  .  . may need to have their intensive care delivered in  district general hospitals or  general intensive care units –  even if some of these hospitals do not currently provide other paediatric services’. It recommends a ‘rapid mobilisation of resources’, including making more staff available and freeing-up adult intensive care beds for children. Paediatric intensive care specialist Dr Peter Wilson, honorary secretary of PICS, said: ‘There have been several cases of  children waiting, although fortunately there have not been any critical incidents.’ The warning has been passed to Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS. He said: ‘In recent weeks demand has been high but well managed by paediatricians and intensive-care staff who worked hard to ensure all children received the care they needed. ‘Despite the high demand, last week 15 per cent of paediatric intensive care beds and nearly  30 per cent of neonatal intensive care beds were available and able to take patients.’","Staff rang 29 units but all 320 beds were already occupied by sick children .

"Confused: Damon Tobias Exum, 37, who is said to have crashed into a police patrol car - then handed its driver a beer after he was stopped . A drunk driver spent the weekend in jail after crashing into a police car then handing its driver a beer when he was pulled over, police said. Confused Damon Tobias Exum is said to have crashed into the patrol car while he was driving in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. He apparently didn't notice the mistake and continued along the highway, but the officer inside gave chase until Exum pulled over. Officer Alvin Rodriguez reported that he asked Exum for his licence, but the 'heavily intoxicated' driver instead handed him a can of lager. Exum was arrested on eight misdemeanour charges, including driving under the influence and reckless driving, WSB-TV Atlanta reported. Sergeant Fidel Espinoza told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Exum had been driving westbound on I-285 near North Peachtree Road in Dunwoody when he collided with Officer Rodriguez's patrol car. Officer Rodrguez was not hurt in the smash and his car was in good enough shape to pursue Exum until he eventually pulled over. Thirty-seven-year-old Exum, of Dunwoody, was 'heavily intoxicated' and 'totally unaware that he had collided with the officer's patrol car', said Sergeant Espinoza. Going through the motions then on what would appear to have been an already clear-cut case of drink driving, Officer Rodriguez asked for Exum's licence - and got something to drink instead. Exum was thrown into DeKalb County Jail in lieu of $3,270 bail. Police said it was his third DUI arrest.","Damon Tobias Exum has spent the weekend in jail after his mistake .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned on Wednesday that the Islamic State is far more dangerous than previous terrorist groups, including the one that led the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. 'It’s a serious threat because this is the best-funded, most professional, expansionist jihadist military force that we have ever seen,' Clinton told the Economic Club of Chicago, according to the Washington Post. 'This is far more advanced and far richer than al Qaeda ever was,' Clinton declared. The former U.S. official's claim follows an admission from President Barack Obama last week that intelligence officials 'underestimated' ISIS' rapid accession in Iraq and 'overestimated' the Middle Eastern country's ability to fight off the extremist group. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks at the Economic Club of Chicago  on Wednesday. Clinton told attendees the Islamic State is far more dangerous than previous terrorist groups, . Just last January the president himself blew the terrorist group off as 'jayvee' level threat. 'I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian,' he asserted. Nine months later, ISIS has taken key areas of Iraq, and large portions of Syria. It has also beheaded two Americans and threatened to kill more if the U.S. continues to intervene in Iraq. The extremist group has stepped up its efforts to assume control of Syria in recent days, making a crippling assault on the city of Kobani. A spokesman for the Pentagon admitted to reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. airstrikes 'are not going to save' the Syrian city from succumbing to the terrorist group. 'We've been very honest about the limits of air power here. The ground forces that matter the most are indigenous ground forces, and we don't have a willing, capable, effective partner on the ground inside Syria right now -- it's just a fact,' Rear Adm. John Kirby proclaimed, according to CNN. Both Kirby and current Secretary of State John Kerry argued on Wednesday that protecting Kobani isn't critical to the United States' long term goal of weakening and ultimately causing the collapse of ISIS. Clinton, left, speaks as moderator J.B. Pritzker looks on. The presumed 2016 candidate warned that ISIS 'will attempt to launch attacks against Western targets if it has the ability to do so.' Meanwhile, Obama administration officials sought to quell concerns this week that ISIS may be in the midst of taking its fight to a third country: the United States. California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services, told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren this week that he has knowledge that 'at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.' 'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.' The Department of Homeland Security rushed to discredit the Republican congressman's claims on Wednesday. 'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement. Homeland Security head Jeh Johnson has said multiple times, including in testimony before Congress, that no ISIS affiliates have been detained while trying to infiltrate the U.S. through it's border with Mexico. In the agency's statement on Wednesday, it reassured Americans that 'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.' Top government officials have not denied that the Islamic State could attempt an attack on the U.S. While acknowledging that the U.S. has no intelligence that ISIS is involved in 'specific plotting against our homeland,' President Obama suggested last month that Americans abroad who have ties to ISIS could try to return and attack the homeland. 'I know many Americans are concerned about these threats,' he said. 'I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve.' On Wednesday the New York Times reported that the Justice Department had taken into custody 10 individuals this year attempting to leave the country to join ISIS ranks. If allowed to depart, the detainees could potentially return to the U.S. one day and commit acts of jihad, government officials have said. Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she believes ISIS 'will attempt to launch attacks against Western targets if it has the ability to do so.' The presumed 2016 presidential candidate forecast 'some kind of legislative action' from Congress when it returns from recess that would give President Obama the necessary authorization to engage ISIS militarily. Congress excused itself last month for an extended break ahead of the midterm elections. It's not scheduled to reconvene until the second week in November.","'This is the best-funded, most professional, expansionist jihadist military force that we have ever seen,' Clinton told the Economic Club of Chicago .

"A new kitten has taken up residence at Sir Winston Churchill's former country home in honour of one of the wartime prime minister's dying requests. Jock IV is the latest in a line of marmalade toms to live at Chartwell in Kent after the first was given to Churchill in 1962 by one of his private secretaries. He enjoys eating tuna, taking afternoon naps and lounging on Persian rugs - but is not so keen on bright lights, being left alone or listening to opera. A new home: Jock VI inspects a Churchill statue at Chartwell, left, and gives close-up pose, right. His arrival honours Churchill's wish that a marmalade cat with a white bib and socks should always live at the estate . On the prowl: Jock VI investigates the gardens around Sir Winston Churchill's former country estate in Kent . Sir John 'Jock' Colville gifted the first marmalade tom to Churchill on his 88th birthday - and the great man named him after his friend and took assiduous care of the animal. It was rumoured that meals would not start at Chartwell until Jock was at the table - and the cat is even reported to have been on the wartime prime minister's bed when he died at his residence in London in January 1965. The beloved animal passed away nine years later and is now buried in the pet cemetery at Chartwell. Following Churchill's instructions after his death, his family asked that there should always be a marmalade cat named Jock with a white bib and four white socks living at the estate . Great man: Sir John 'Jock' Colville gifted the first marmalade ca tto Winston Churchill (pictured) in 1962 . Des res: Jock VI now has the whole of the Chartwell grounds to roam, after Jock V moved to Scotland . Furry friend: Jock VI (right) was rescued by Croydon Animal Samaritans. He has now been adopted by Chartwell’s house and collections manager, Katherine Barnett (pictured, left, with the marmalade kitten) The . National Trust, which was left the property by the Churchill family in . 1966, has always honoured the request and this month welcomed Jock VI, a . seven-month-old rescue kitten. Jock VI, or Malley as he was . previously known, was rescued by Croydon Animal Samaritans before being . adopted by Chartwell’s house and collections manager, Katherine Barnett. The primary role of a Chartwell cat is to interact with visitors and roam the estate's extensive grounds, according to the National Trust. The trust says the 'job' involves: . And the role would suit cats that are: . Trust officials said he takes . afternoon naps, eats tuna and lounges on Persian rugs at Chartwell, . which has a green cat-flap approved by an historic buildings inspector. However, the cute kitten shies away from bright lights - and has an unusual dislike of opera music. Today, Ms Barnett described Jock's arrival at Chartwell as 'a modern-day rags-to-riches story'. 'Jock . VI has had a difficult start to his life, but as the saying goes, a cat . will always land on its feet. I’m delighted with Jock,' she said. 'He’s . a very caring, loving cat and I think our visitors will get lots of . enjoyment from seeing him around the property for many years to come.' Churchill's affection and patience for cats was clearly visible to those around him during his time at Chartwell, according to Fred Glueckstein, writing for The Churchill Centre. Speaking at the 1987 International Churchill conference, his secretary Grace Hamblin said: 'He loved cats. He always had a cat, if not two.' Ms Hamblin recalled that the politician had once greeted one of the house's cats with 'Good morning' - before shooing the animal away with some papers when the cat remained silent and still. He later asked her to put a card in the window saying 'if Cat cares to come home, all is forgiven'. She added: 'Cat did come home several days later with a wire round his neck. Given cream and the best salmon and so on.' Churchill adopted a number of cats during his reign - two of which were a large tabby named Mickey and a marmalade tom called Tango. Family: Churchill is pictured at the Kent-based estate with his son Randolph (left) and daughter Diana (centre) During one amusing incident, the prime . minister was reportedly speaking on the telephone to the Lord . Chancellor when Mickey started playing with the telephone cord.

"Angry congressional Republicans have commanded Secretary John Kerry to testify in a May 21 hearing about why the State Department hid documents showing how the aftermath of the deadly 2012 terror attack in Benghazi unfolded. They are also launching a new investigative . committee to dig further into the scandal, which erupted just weeks . before President Obama's re-election. He insisted at the time that . al-Qaeda was 'on the run,' but documents now confirm that the State Department knew immediately that it was a terror attack carried out by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group. Two emails have emerged in the past 24 hours that suggest Obama administration officials knew immediately that the group, Ansar al-Shariah, laid waste to U.S. diplomatic facilities in the Eastern Libyan city. But the president, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice and other officials told the public that the deadly attack was the result of a spontaneous anti-America protest sparked by an anti-Islam video. The State Department had concealed both documents from the public. GOP Rep. Darrell Issa subpoenaed Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday, demanding answers to questions about how the Obama administration hid documents from the public that show the involvement of an al-Qaeda affiliate in the Benghazi attack was recognized immediately . Four Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya died on September 11, 2012 after Islamist militants launched military-style assaults on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, LIbya . 'Compliance with a subpoena for documents is not a game,' Issa wrote Kerry (pictured) -- reacting to the release of emails that the State Department has hidden from public view for 19 months . One showed Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes setting up a conference call to coach Rice on emphasizing the video during TV interviews. That email was only made public on Wednesday because of a lawsuit from the center-right group Judicial Watch. Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz released the other email Thursday night. Former CBS investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson first reported that it showed Assistant Secretary of State Beth Jones writing to senior officials within hours of the Benghazi attack to explain that she had told Libya's U.S. ambassador 'the group that conducted the attacks – Ansar Al Sharia – is affiliated with Islamic extremists.' 'If the video was a cause' of the Benghazi attack,' Chaffetz asked Attkisson, . 'why did Beth Jones of the State Department tell the Libyan Ambassador . that Ansar al-Shariah was responsible for the attack?' Another . State Department email in the same chain, sent while the attacks were still underway, noted that 'the extremist group . Ansar Al Sharia has taken credit for the attack in Benghazi,' and that . the U.S. had asked Libya's president and prime minister 'to pursue Ansar al Sharia.' Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attacks. President . Obama, who appeared in a joint press conference on Friday with German . Chancellor Angela Merkel, was not asked about Benghazi. He answered . questions about cyber-snooping, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and the . death penalty. Republicans have ratcheted up the pressure on the Obama administration in recent weeks. 'My instincts tell me that this story is never going to go away as long as they keep lying,' South Carolina Republican Rep. Lindsey Graham told Fox News on Friday. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote to Kerry on Friday to demand his testimony, saying that the State Department has 'shown a disturbing disregard' for its 'legal obligations' to comply with congressional demands. 'Compliance with a subpoena for documents is not a game,' Issa wrote. Assistant Secretary of State Beth Jones acknowledged in an email just hours after the deadly attack on U.S. diplomatic buildings in Benghazi that it was the work of Ansar al-Shariah, an al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group . The email from Jones, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, was withheld from public view . 'The . fact that these documents were withheld from Congress for more than 19 . months is alarming. The Department is not entitled to delay responsive . materials because it is embarrassing or implicates the roles and actions . of senior officials.' South . Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy will reportedly chair the special 'select' committee, a bipartisan panel that will have broad subpoena power and . the ability to interrogate witnesses at length. A Gowdy spokeswoman wouldn't confirm his selection on Friday, referring questions to House Speaker John Boehner's office. Ordinary congressional committees typically allow members five minutes each for questions, a short enough time for witnesses to stall for time. Boehner said Friday that the House will vote to establish the committee, a formality since his Republican conference is the controlling majority. 'Americans learned this week that the Obama Administration is so intent on obstructing the truth about Benghazi that it is even willing to defy subpoenas issued by the standing committees of the People's House,' Boehner said in a statement. Speaker of the House Rep. John Boehner said Friday that a House vote will establish a 'select' committee to investigate the Benghazi debacle . South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy's name is being floated as a likely chairman of the new committee . 'The . administration's withholding of documents – emails showing greater White . House involvement in misleading the American people – is a flagrant . violation of trust and undermines the basic principles of oversight upon . which our system of government is built.  And it forces us to ask the . question, what else about Benghazi is the Obama administration still . hiding from the American people?' The . select committee will take over the work previously done by the Ways . & Means and Oversight committees, and will likely count among its . members many of those committees' members. 'Four Americans died at the hands of terrorists nearly 20 months ago, and we are still missing answers, accountability, and justice,' Boehner said. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that 'the American people want and deserve to know why the Obama White House and Democrats decided their political press strategy was more important than providing honest answers to the American people.' 'After a federal court forced the White House to turn over emails about Benghazi, it became clear that the administration attempted to mislead the American people. When confronted with this evidence, they continue to offer denials, non-answers, and lies. At this point, they’re lying about their lies.'","House Oversight Committee demands to hear from Secretary of State Kerry about why Benghazi emails were kept from Congress and the public .

"A Muslim group has been banned from a university after segregating men and women during a debate. Visitors to the event at University College London were told to use men’s or women’s entrances. Organisers Islamic Education and Research Academy (iERA) told women to sit at the back, while men and couples were sent to the front. Three people who objected were ordered to leave. Scroll down for video: . Action: University College London has banned one Muslim group after it found one group had demanded gender segregation . The segregation was halted only when one speaker, US scientist Lawrence Krauss, stormed out. Ignoring audience jeering, he told an organiser: ‘Either you quit the segregation or I’m not interested.’ He returned when staff allowed men and women to mix. The public debate on Saturday was on the subject ‘Islam or Atheism: Which Makes More Sense?’ Atheist Mr Krauss was joined by another guest, Greek Islamic convert Hamza Andreas Tzortzis. Audience member Dana Sondergaard wrote on her Facebook page: ‘After watching three people be kicked out of the auditorium . . . Dr Krauss bravely defended his beliefs of gender equality.’ Theoretical physicist and professor of physics Lawrence Krauss threatened to leave if men and women continued to be segregated . iERA spokesman Saleem Chagtai insisted men and women ‘naturally’ separate in ‘normal Islamic events’. He said: ‘There were a number of ladies who used their free will and didn’t want to sit with the opposite sex.’ UCL issued a statement saying iERA would never be allowed to hold events on its grounds again. Yesterday, Mr Chagtai told MailOnline: 'In all normal Islamic events people . will naturally often separate themselves: men with men and women with . women.

"Google has overtaken rival technology firm Apple as the world's top brand in terms of value, global market research agency Millward Brown said today. Google's brand value shot up 40 per cent in a year to $158.84 billion (£92.24 billion), Millward Brown said in its 2014 100 Top BrandZ report. This is apparently due to its investments in new concepts, gadgets and initiatives. Google is now the world's biggest brand, overtaking rival Apple, after a growth of 40 per cent in 2014 according to Millward Brown. They say this was due to investments in emerging technologies like Google Glass and driver-less cars . 'Google has been extremely innovative . this year with Google Glass, investments in artificial intelligence and a . range of partnerships,' said Benoit Tranzer, the head of Millward Brown . France. Google Glass is Internet-linked eyewear for which the firm has joined hands with Luxottica, a frame giant behind Ray-Ban and other high-end brands, to sell the new product in the United States. 1.

Amazon ($64.3bn/£38.1bn) 'All these activities send a very strong signal to consumers about the essence of Google,' Tranzer said. Apple, which dominated the top position for three straight years, saw its brand value fall by 20 per cent to $147.88 billion (£87.74 billion). The top 10 of the 100 slots were dominated by US firms. IBM was in third place at $107.54 billion (£63.8 billion), a fall of 4 per cent, followed by Microsoft at $90.19 billion (£53.51 billion) - a 29 per cent rise. Fast food chain McDonald's ranked next at $85.71 billion (£50.85 billion), followed by Coca Cola at $80.68 billion (£47.87 billion), it said. China led in the insurance sector with Ping An valued at $12.4 billion (£735.7m) and China Life ($12 billion/£710.5m). French luxury goods manufacturer Louis Vuitton ranked 30th overall but was the top luxury brand with a value of more than $25 billion (£14.8 billion). Brand value iss calculated on the basis of the firms' financial performance and their standing among consumers.

"A Florida man has been arrested in connection with a road rage incident late last month in which a woman was dragged and then run over by a man in a pick-up truck. Michael James Deely, 48, was taken into custody after detectives identified him as a suspect based on surveillance video from a parking garage. Deely has been charged with aggravated battery in the April 24 incident in St Petersburg. Road rage: Police say Michael Deely dragged a woman while driving at 25 miles an hour before dropping her and running her over . According to police, Deely was initially behind a woman, 39, on Second Avenue South and Second Street at around 10pm. He honked his horn repeatedly before overtaking and pulling in front of her, slamming on his brakes without warning. The woman stopped behind Deeley at a red light at Fourth Avenue South and Fourth Street, got out of her car and approached his window to talk to him. That's when police say Deely grabbed the woman by the arm and drove through the red light with the woman in tow for about 50 feet, before dropping her and running her over. The woman's arm was badly injured. Deely told police that he honked his horn because the woman was texting on her phone and hadn't noticed the lights had  changed. Terrifying ordeal: The woman was dragged and run over after stopping to speak to Deely, who was honking at her and deliberately slamming on his brakes . The woman approached his window and began yelling at him, he said, and denied grabbing her, saying she held onto his door and held on. He didn't realize he'd run her over, he told police. A witness told ABC Action News that the woman's version of events backs up what he saw. 'They were driving, he was speeding up and slowing down, slamming on the brakes, just to make her mad,' Trudeau said. 'She got out of the car, went to say something and it looked like she tried pushing him or something,' Trudeau said. He added the truck was traveling about 25 mph while the woman was being dragged. The woman's arm was bleeding heavily, said Trudeau, who went to her aid. 'She hit the ground pretty hard,' Trudeau said. Police said they identified Deely from video taken of his 2002 Silver Toyota Tacoma from parking garage footage taken of the car just before the incident. His car has been impounded and he was booked into Pinellas County Jail for aggravated battery.","Michael James Deely, 48, was arrested for allegedly grabbing a woman through his car window and dragging her 50 feet .

"School sport is in decline despite a pledge to use the Olympics to encourage more children to take part, figures have shown. Teachers are spending 60 per cent less time organising competitions and after-school clubs since the Coalition cut funding for school sports. The figures are sensitive for the Government since a key pledge that helped win the Olympics for London was a promise to 'inspire young people around the world to choose sport'. Drop: Teachers are spending 60 per cent less time organising competitions and after-school clubs since the Coalition cut funding for school sports . Figures uncovered by Labour under the Freedom of Information Act suggest a decline in the amount of sport being organised in all English regions following the overhaul. They show a 60 per cent decrease in days worked per week by PE teachers on release compared with sports co-ordinators working under the old scheme in 2009/10. Clive Efford, shadow minister for sport, said: 'It is incredible that David Cameron can complain that too many of our top sports people come from private schools when he is damaging the structure of sport in our state education system.' A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We're spending £65million over the academic years 2011/12 and 2012/13 to release a secondary PE teacher in every school for one day a week so that opportunities in competitive sport are increased.' Issue: Education Secretary Michael Gove drew a storm of criticism from athletes and head teachers two years ago .

"Meningitis B affects nearly 2,000 people in the UK each year, many of them children, and results in death for one in 10 sufferers . The first vaccine to offer broad protection against meningitis B is to be licensed for use in the UK, drastically reducing the number of children killed by the disease. There are 1,870 cases of meningitis B in the UK on average each year, resulting in up to 200 deaths – half of which occur in the under-fives. As many as 400 children a year are also left with serious lifelong complications such as limb amputations, blindness, deafness and brain damage. Although vaccination programmes have been successfully introduced to combat other strains of meningitis, no vaccine against the B strain currently exists in this country. Meningococcal B is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in Britain, one of the most deadly, and the one that poses the toughest challenge to develop a vaccine for because there are so many variations to target. Bexsero is the first vaccine providing broad protection against 800 deadly meningococcal B strains which, in some cases, can kill within hours. The European Medicines Agency, a drug regulatory body which covers the UK, issued a 'positive opinion' on Bexsero yesterday, which means it is safe and effective. This is the first step in an approval process that should result in the jab, developed by Novartis, being licensed within three months. But the critical decision on whether it will become part of the routine NHS immunisation programme for babies and children lies with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the Government. It will consider factors such as price, cost-effectiveness and compatibility with other childhood vaccines. The last major vaccine against meningitis – the pneumococcal vaccine – took five years to be introduced into the immunisation schedule. Steve Dayman, founder of the Meningitis UK charity who lost his baby Spencer to meningitis and meningococcal septicaemia in 1982, said: 'This is a landmark moment in the fight against meningitis. I have waited three decades to hear this along with many other families who have supported the cause. The approval of the new 4CMenB vaccine has been hailed as the 'biggest leap forward in the field in the three decades' 'It is vital that the vaccine is introduced in the UK immunisation schedule as soon as possible. 'It will save countless lives and prevent many people enduring the suffering caused by this devastating disease. We will be campaigning hard to make the Government introduce it.' Andrin Oswald, of Novartis, said the company was already in discussions with the Government and warned: 'Every year of delay in a country like Britain costs the lives of dozens more children who do not have to die – a sense of urgency is appropriate.' In trials involving 7,500 children, adolescents and adults, the vaccine, which can be used for babies aged two months and older, produced antibodies against 77 per cent of strains. Sue Davie, chief executive of the Meningitis Trust charity, said: 'We see the devastation that meningitis continues to cause to victims and their families, tearing lives apart in a matter of hours. 'This vaccine could save many lives every year, but it could also save the long-term suffering that many survivors face after the disease.' But she warned that people must not become complacent as, even if Bexsero is introduced, people are still not protected from all types of meningitis. She said: 'It's vital that everyone makes themselves aware of the signs and symptoms and remains vigilant.' Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said: 'The independent expert group on vaccines that advises the Government is currently looking at use of this vaccine and will provide advice in due course.'","Meningitis B, the most common and deadliest .

"They are Britain’s most sought-after schools, where parents would be delighted for their children to have  a place. But few parents would themselves make the grade in the exam that pupils must pass to be admitted to a grammar or public school. Just 12 per cent of parents – about one in eight – who attempted a test modelled on the 11-Plus scored more than 80 per cent – the approximate pass mark. Only 12 per cent of parents - about one in eight - passed a test modelled on the 11-plus after scoring more than 80 per cent - the approximate pass mark (file picture) Some scored as low as one out of 20 in the test, devised by The Mail on Sunday. Education experts say while a mark of about 80 per cent would typically gain admission to the top schools,  in some areas where selective establishments see 12 or more pupils apply for each place, pupils may need to achieve closer to 100 per cent. A survey among the parents – a  representative sample from a range of backgrounds – also found overwhelming support for grammar schools, with 72 per cent saying they supported their existence in the UK. In total, 500 parents were asked to complete a briefer set of challenging 11-Plus-style questions taken from the popular Bond Ten-Minute Test books, the study guides many of their children use to hone their exam skills. Parent David Bennetts, of Wigan, scored five out of 20 on the English test. The 53-year-old, a mature student at the Open University studying health and social sciences, said: ‘I expected to do better but I found the questions a little confusing. ‘It was quite difficult. It is a long time since I did an exam.’ Another, who preferred not to be named, scored just three out of ten in the verbal reasoning paper. He said: ‘It was a bit embarrassing.  I haven’t come across that type of question before.’ Overall, two per cent got full marks on the test, while five per cent scored above 90 per cent. Just 12 per cent got more than 80 per cent correct and almost a quarter – 24 per cent – got 75 per cent of the questions right. Robert McCartney, chairman of the National Grammar School Association, said pupils taking the 11-Plus in the UK would normally need to achieve a pass mark of between 75 per cent and 90 per cent. But he said that while some regions such as Northern Ireland, where nearly a quarter of pupils win grammar places, were still well provided with academically selective state schools, the required pass rate shoots up in areas such as parts of Kent, where a few schools are so oversubscribed that most of their successful applicants score 100 per cent. He added: ‘Adults, however, are unlikely to do as well as their children in such tests, because they are not familiar with them or so practised in taking such tests.’ He added that large swathes of the country have no grammar schools, and the results of our survey showing they remained very popular – despite the decision of successive Governments not to reintroduce academic selection in secondary schools – shows politicians need to rethink the issue. Overall last year, 30,000 pupils in England took the 11-Plus for places in just 164 grammar schools. There is also huge pressure on places at independent selective schools that use similar entrance tests – especially day schools in the South East. Though comprehensive state schools are no longer allowed to select by academic ability, a number do use such tests for a proportion of their applicants, either because they have retained historic rights to do so or because they promote an area of excellence such as languages. In our experiment, carried out by polling company Survation, the 500 parents were split into four groups, each answering 10-minute English, maths, verbal reasoning or non-verbal reasoning papers, the last two of which are widely used IQ-style tests. The maths test proved the easiest, with 11 per cent scoring more than  90 per cent, while the English test was the hardest, with nobody achieving above 90 per cent. Mr McCartney said this reflected the fact that adults tended to retain their mathematical ability better than other skills. A spokesman for Bond books said: ‘Bond not only provides the relevant content and skills resources that grammar schools are looking for, but also the exam techniques and question styles associated with the 11-Plus test to best help your child to succeed.’","Only 12 per cent of parents - about one in eight - passed challenging test modelled on the 11-plus examination .

"Intelligence officials in Canada are closely monitoring 80 known extremists after they picked up 'chatter' among would-be terrorists plotting ISIS inspired 'knife and gun' attacks against American targets and citizens. US and Canadian officials have admitted they fear a public beheading or frenzied knife attack and have trained their sights on tracking potential ISIS imitators in Canada targeting the American embassy in Ottawa and an as-yet unspecified shopping mall. Canadian officials are to increase security at public buildings over the coming days as anxiety grows behind the scenes that a lone wolf terrorist or group will unleash an attack until police arrive to shoot and 'martyr' them. Scroll down for video . Terror fears: Canada's Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney (C) arrives with Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) director Michel Coulombe (L) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Bob Paulson to testify before the Commons public safety and national security committee on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday . Officials who have spoken to NBC News said that while the terror chatter online has raised the likelihood of attacks on US citizens inside Canada, there is no suggestion yet that ISIS inspired jihadists have crossed south into America. They also stressed to NBC News that any possible attacks were currently only being discussed and were at the 'aspirational' stage. US and Canadian authorities believe that the possibility of an ISIS-style outrage inside the country has been raised by Tuesday's vote in Canada's parliament to join the coalition carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State in Iraq. 'If left unchecked this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly. They have already voiced their local and international terrorist intentions and identified Canada as a potential target,' said Prime Minster Stephen Harper. Terror threat: Officials are considering raising the security at the US embassy in Ottawa after chatter revealed that ISIS inspired jihadists may try to attack the compound . ISIS in Iraq: The terror group has established an Islamic caliphate across huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria . The head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Michael Coulombe, said that even though there is no sign of an imminent terror attack inside the country, his agency is taking no chances and that is why they are closely monitoring the 80 or so individuals. Pressed on the issue, Coulombe said that no charges have been filed because agents are still trying to put together evidence against them, but he stressed, the CSIS 'knows where they are'. 'It does pose a real threat, but like I mentioned, we have no information indicating an imminent attack,' Coulombe told MPs at a House public safety committee in Ottawa on Wednesday. 'We don't want to sound alarmist. We're telling people that they should go about their daily life, but we have to be vigilant,' he said. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner, Bob Paulson, told the same committee that 63 active national security investigations are in progress against 80 or so individuals. US citizens: Journalist's James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded by ISIS in retaliation for US airstrikes on their forces in Syria and Iraq . 'The pace and tempo of operations is quite brisk,' he said. 'It’s nothing that I think that Canadians need to be alarmed about.' And, on Tuesday, the SITE Intelligence Group, a private firm that tracks the online activities of Islamic jihadists said it had uncovered a Twitter post that called for attacks on Canada. The security firm said that it was posted by a known ISIS fighter who they identified as Abu Khalid Al-Kanadi. When asked if they would be screening people leaving the country, Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney told the committee that they would not. 'Let me be very clear: We are really not contemplating exit controls; we'll leave it to totalitarian states,' Blaney said . He added that Canada and the US currently exchange 'entry' information, which means in other words, entry into one country confirms the exit from the other.","Security in Canada to be increased at US Embassy in Ottawa .

"More than 80 state schools in England have no white British pupils, Government figures show. The number of such schools appears to have more than doubled over the past five years, and the findings will fuel concerns that some parts of the country are becoming increasingly segregated. The new figures follow research showing that white Britons are retreating from areas dominated by ethnic minorities, to be replaced by immigrants and other ethnic minorities. An Education: More than 80 state schools have no white British pupils, compared to 31 schools in 2008, Department for Education figures have revealed (file picture) Critics said that the previous Labour . Government’s ‘open-door’ immigration policy had created ‘huge’ problems . for integration, which was now threatening the country’s social . cohesion. The Department for Education figures, revealed in a Freedom of Information request, show that 84 schools recorded last year that no pupils on their rolls were white British. Of those, 67 are primaries, eight secondaries and the remainder special or pupil referral units. The statistics, derived from the annual school census, found that the highest concentration is in Birmingham, with 22 such schools, followed by Oldham with eight, Leicester with seven and the London borough of Tower Hamlets with six. Other local authority areas in which there are at least two schools with no white British pupils include Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford, Lancashire, Rochdale, Surrey, Walsall and Worcester, as well as the London boroughs of Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, and Southwark. The schools, which were not named, are likely to include England’s 11 state Muslim schools, three state Sikh schools and one state Hindu school. One school that is understood to have no white British pupils is Gladstone Primary in Peterborough, which is dominated by students from the Punjab, with smaller groups from Afghanistan and Lithuania. None of its 440 pupils has English as a first language. Learning exercise: The findings will fuel concern that parts of the country are becoming increasingly segregated (file picture) In 2008, the Department of Education said there were 31 state schools that had recorded no white children on their rolls – including children of white migrants. MigrationWatch’s Sir Andrew Green said: ‘This is yet another indication of the huge impact of Labour mass migration policies on our society. ‘The result of three million immigrants in ten years has created a huge problem for integration of the newcomers. Obviously, if there are no children of the host community in a school, the prospects of integration are close to zero. ‘In the longer term, this is bound to effect the cohesion of our society as a whole.’ The new figures follow a study published earlier this month by the Left-leaning think tank Demos which showed white Britons are moving out of areas where they are in a minority at the same time as the ethnic minority population was growing. The study said that 45 per cent of ethnic minorities in England and Wales, about four million people, live in areas where less than half the population is white British. Demos director David Goodhart said the number of schools with no white British pupils was ‘depressingly high’ because it suggested there must be many others where the proportion of such pupils was tiny.","Number of such schools has more than doubled from 31 in 2008 .

"Cutting back on fry ups could cut your risk of dementia, according to new research. A ‘compelling’ study has linked compounds found in fried meat and eggs with one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Bacon is particularly problematic and the suspect chemicals are also found in many cakes, biscuits and pastries. Warning: Frying bacon and eggs causes fat and sugars to react in a way that could be gravely damaging . The researchers said that reducing intake could help prevent the crippling condition – and may even help restore memory that has been lost. British experts said that with drug cures for Alzheimer’s still many years away, attempts to prevent the disease are of extreme importance. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect some 800,000 Britons and the number is predicted to double in a generation as the population ages. Existing medicines are of limited use and several highly-promising pills and potions have failed to live up to their promise. The research, from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, focused on compounds called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs. They are formed when fat, protein and sugar react on being heated and are found in particularly high levels in bacon, sausages, pizzas and burgers. Frying and grilling is particularly bad, while boiling does not lead to them being made. Alternative: Scientists advise people to poach their eggs instead. They insist we do not have to turn to raw food . Recommended: Carrots and boiled brown rice are also healthy options better for our brains, the study found . The researchers tracked the progress of a group of mice fed food containing levels of AGEs proportional to those in a Western diet and another group fed half the amount of the compound. Their calorie intake was the same but only the mice on the AGE-rich diet suffered problems with memory, learning and co-ordination as they get older. They also made less of an anti-ageing protein and their brains contained beta-amyloid, a sticky protein considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Results of experiments on people were similarly striking. Tests on healthy pensioners showed that only those who had high amounts of AGEs they had in their diet became more forgetful over the coming months. Steps: Professors accept this is not a cure but a small step as they move towards developing drugs . More work is needed but the researchers said cutting back on the compounds might help improve mental sharpness and ‘combat the epidemic’ of Alzheimer’s disease. Diabetes might also be helped, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Researcher Professor Helen Vlassara, who also wants to test a drug that mops up excess AGES, advises that people steam and boil food rather than grill or fry it. She suggests that fans of a fried breakfast ditch the bacon all together and poach their eggs. The professor said: ‘One should sue some inventiveness. One does not have to eat raw or tasteless food.’ Tom Dening, professor of dementia research at Nottingham University, said that the studies needed to prove that cutting back on AGEs helps prevent Alzheimer’s would be lengthy. He said: ‘In the meantime, crunch those carrots and reach for the brown rice.’ Professor Derek Hill, of University College London, said: ‘These results are compelling.  Because cures for Alzheimer’s disease remain a distant hope, efforts to prevent it are extremely important.’ Professor Simon Lovestone, of Oxford University, said that the solution will not be as simple as cutting back on one type of food and eating more of another. Instead, he hopes that learning more about what goes wrong in the body and brain will lead to new drugs. Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘This research is at an early stage, and continued investment in research is crucial to understand the significance of results like this. ‘The diseases that cause dementia are complex, and our risk of the condition is likely to be affected by a number of genetic and environmental factors that are not yet fully understood. ‘In the meantime, the best evidence suggests that a balanced diet can help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s, as part of a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, not smoking, and keeping blood pressure and weight in check.’","Fats and sugars stunt short-term memory and stop brain developing .

"Adrian Peterson, 29, turned himself in on Saturday after police issued an arrest warrant . Adrian Peterson has spoken out for the first time since his arrest for severely whipping his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch - apologizing, but also defending his actions. The statement come as the Minnesota Vikings reinstated him today today after he missed just one game following child abuse charges this weekend. 'I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser. I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury,' Peterson said. 'No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day.' Peterson, the Vikings' highest-paid player and biggest star, was booted from the team's roster for Sunday's 30-7 loss against the New England Patriots. However, he is back on the practice field today and will play next week against the New Orleans Saints. 'To be clear, we take very seriously any matter that involves the welfare of a child,' Vikings owners Zygi and Mark Wilf said in a statement. 'At this time, however, we believe this is a matter of due process and we should allow the legal system to proceed so we can come to the most effective conclusions and then determine the appropriate course of action.' Peterson turned himself into police in his hometown of Spring, Texas, on Saturday after detectives issued an arrest warrant for the May beating. The boy had wounds on his thighs, backside and even his genitals following the beating. Peterson has admitted to whipping his son, but his attorney said he was only using the discipline he himself had received as a child growing up in East Texas. In his statement, he defended the motivation behind the severe discipline he meted out, saying: 'Deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives. Brutal: Police released these images of the wounds Peterson allegedly left on his son's body after beating the four-year-old with a switch . Back on the field: Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings' biggest star, was reinstated by the team after being kicked off the roster on Saturday. He will play next week against the New Orleans Saints . 'I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man.' However, Peterson said he has seen a psychologist, who told him that there are usually better ways to discipline children than hitting them. He said he has had to 'reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward.' The Vikings owners, the Wilf brothers, said they decided to bring Peterson back on the team after 'significant thought, discussion and consideration. 'As evidenced by our decision to deactivate Adrian from yesterday’s game, this is clearly a very important issue. On Friday, we felt it was in the best interests of the organization to step back, evaluate the situation, and not rush to judgment given the seriousness of this matter. 'My attorney has asked me not to discuss the facts of my pending case. I hope you can respect that request and help me honor it. I very much want the public to hear from me but I understand that it is not appropriate to talk about the facts in detail at this time. Nevertheless, I want everyone to understand how sorry I feel about the hurt I have brought to my child. 'I never wanted to be a distraction to the Vikings organization, the Minnesota community or to my teammates. I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son. 'I voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had. Before my grand jury appearance, I was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney. In each of these interviews I have said the same thing, and that is that I never ever intended to harm my son. I will say the same thing once I have my day in court. 'I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen. I know that many people disagree with the way I disciplined my child. I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate. 'I have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward. But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives. I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man. I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make. 'I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser. I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury. No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day. 'I accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct. Regardless of what others think, however, I love my son very much and I will continue to try to become a better father and person.' 'At that time, we made the decision that we felt was best for the Vikings and all parties involved.' Peterson's importance to the Vikings is hard to overstate. He is a former MVP who hold several NFL records for rushing. His six-year, $86million contract makes him by far the highest-paid player on the team. His 1,266 rushing yards last season accounted for nearly a quarter of the entire team's offense. He scored ten of the team's 45 touchdowns. Hours after the arrest, the Vikings decided not to play Peterson against the Patriots, moving swiftly after a week in which the NFL came under heavy scrutiny for its handling of a domestic violence case involving former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. But unlike a previous case involving former cornerback Chris Cook, the Vikings have decided to allow Peterson to return to the field while the legal process unfolds. In 2011, the Vikings suspended cornerback Chris Cook with pay after he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend and barred him from all team activities while his trial played out. Cook wound up missing 10 games and was eventually acquitted. He never faced discipline from the NFL and played two more seasons with the Vikings before signing with the 49ers. The NFL is looking into Peterson's case, and if convicted he could face a minimum six-game suspension under the league's new tougher domestic abuse policy that was implemented after Commissioner Roger Goodell admitted he botched Rice's initial punishment.

"Universities were under pressure tonight to crack down on Islamic extremists who spout hatred on campuses. An investigation has been launched into claims that a series of radical speakers were invited to events and distributed leaflets to students at the University where both killers are thought to have studied. The probe will consider whether Greenwich University’s Islamic society had any role in radicalising Michael Adebolajo, 28 and Michael Adebowale, 22. Theresa May, appearing on BBC's Andrew Marr Show, criticised universities for being 'complacent' in tackling the risk of radicalisation . Claims have been made that a pamphlet written by a preacher who was banned from entering Britain by the Home Secretary was distributed during a freshers' fair at Greenwich University . Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday pledged to look at introducing new powers to tackle Al Qaeda sympathisers who try to recruit impressionable students at colleges. She has criticised universities for being ‘complacent’ in tackling the risk of radicalisation. One of Drummer Lee Rigby’s killers, Michael Adebolajo, 28, converted to Islam in 2003 at the same time that he studied at the University of Greenwich. He was radicalised by the banned group Al-Muhajiroun. His accomplice in the gruesome murder outside Woolwich Barracks, Michael Adebowale, 22, is also said to have been an undergraduate there and studied on a business course. The announcement of the investigation came amid claims that a pamphlet written by a preacher who was banned from entering Britain by the Home Secretary in 2010 was distributed during a freshers’ fair at Greenwich University in 2011. Dr Zakir Naik, the author, said in the booklet: 'Every Muslim should be a terrorist,’ it was alleged. Michael Adebolajo, 28 (centre) converted to Islam in 2003 at the same time that he studied at the University of Greenwich. Adebolajo studied there for two years but was thrown out because of poor academic progress . Dr Naik had been banned from entering Britain the previous year by Theresa May after she ruled that his presence was 'not conducive to the public good'. Other figures known for their extreme views are said to have appeared in person at the university, including Dr Khalid Fikry, who has supported convicted terrorists. The society has also promoted videos by another radical preacher, Abu Usamah, on its Facebook page. Abu Usamah, a Birmingham based imam, featured on the Channel 4 Dispatches programme Undercover Mosque in which he expressed support for Osama bin Laden and said homosexuals were 'perverted, filthy dogs who should be murdered'. He has been banned from several academic institutions for his extreme views. Professor David Maguire, vice-chancellor of the university, confirmed that Adebolajo had been a student there for two years but had been thrown out because his ‘academic progress was unsatisfactory’. This picture, believed to be of Micahel Adebowale at a Muslims Against Crusaders rally, shows the radical six years ago. The now-banned group became famous after members set fire to poppies on Remembrance Day and chanted 'British soldiers burn in hell' He said: ‘The university takes its responsibilities very seriously in terms of preventing extremism. ‘We are committed to ensuring that the university is a safe and secure place of study and debate within the confines of the law. 'We have diverse communities on campus and these include a range of different faiths. ‘Given the seriousness of issues raised, the university is setting up an investigation into the association of these two individuals with the university, to assess whether there is any evidence of extremism in the university (past or present) and whether we need to update our policies and practices.’ Professor Maguire said the university had ‘no record’ of Adebowale being a student at Greenwich. Mrs May is determined to stop extremist clerics using schools, colleges and universities - as well as prisons and mosques - to spread their ‘poison’. She said: ‘We need to look across institutions like universities, whether there is more work we can be doing in prisons.’ Universities UK, which represents higher education institutions, is drawing up guidelines on how to handle preachers who have a track record of inciting hatred. It has launched a new campaign to show students, unions and academics what they can do to constrain controversial preachers. The last Labour government introduced its Prevent strategy in a bid to stop young people becoming involved with extremist groups but ministers acknowledged this has stalled. Rupert Sutton, from Student Rights, an organisation aimed at preventing extremism at universities, said he hoped chancellors would draw up lists of speakers liable to preach hatred or violence. He said: ‘There is a problem with Prevent at many universities, partly because it comes from government and partly because it is seen as anti-Muslim. 'It needs to be refocused much more clearly as being opposed to extremism of both right and left.’ In January it was revealed that Islamic extremists preached at more than 200 university events last year raising fresh fears over radicalisation on campus. Calls for a crackdown on radicalising forces come after the killing of Lee Rigby last Wednesday. Theresa May said extremist clerics must be stopped from using schools, colleges and universities to spread their message . A dozen events featured speakers with links to the fanatical group Hizb ut Tahrir – a controversial organisation banned by the National Union of Students. A study by Student Rights warned Islamic extremists were using social networking sites to radicalise students. Videos of armed insurgents and hate-filled speeches from Al Qaeda figures had been posted on websites linked to Islamic societies at several leading universities. In 2011, Mrs May said universities were not taking the issue of radicalisation seriously enough and that it was too easy for Muslim extremists to form groups on campuses ‘without anyone knowing’.","Investigation launched into Greenwich University .

"A private sixth form is set to move lessons to start at 1.30pm every day because the school's teacher thinks his teenage pupils will study better after a morning lie in. Instead of rising early for a 9am start, pupils at the £15,000-a-year Hampton Court House, in East Molesey, Surrey, will get to enjoy a lie in and work from 1.30pm until 7pm. Head teacher Guy Holloway says the move for all sixth form pupils, set to kick in from September, has been made in light of research by neuroscientists. Lie in: Pupils Ava MacGregor (left) and Gabriel Purcell-Davis (centre) will be among the students at Hampton Court House set to benefit from head teacher Guy Holloway's (right) plan to start sixth form lessons at 1.30pm . He predicts that not only will his students aged 16 and upwards get a quality night's sleep, but their cognition and productivity will also be improved. The co-educational school will have the latest start time in the UK, and will be the only one to begin lessons in the afternoon. Experts say young people are biologically programmed to get up later, and that rather than this being down to laziness it is simply a shift in their body clocks. In 2007 the Hugh Christie Technology College in Tonbridge, Kent, introduced an 11.30am start three days a week start for all students aged 14 and above. Backing: Mr Holloway says the move for all sixth form pupils, set to kick in from September, has been made in light of research by neuroscientists . And in 2010 Monkseaton High School, North Tyneside, moved its 9am start to 10am.. Both schools say the later start has boosted their student’s levels of concentration and exam performance. However, Hampton Court House has gone further with its 'no mornings' regime. 'There are 168 hours in a week and how productive they are depends on how they choose to use those hours,' said Mr Holloway. 'At Hampton Court House we don’t think we have the answer for everybody, it’s about what works in our community. 'We want to get them into an environment where they can get quality sleep and their bodies are functioning well.' Late start: Instead of rising early for a 9am start pupils at the £15,000-a-year school in East Molesey, Surrey, will get to enjoy a lie in and work from 1.30pm until 7pm . He said pupils would also benefit from reduced journey times as they travel to and from school after rush hour. Year 10 student Gabriel Purcell-Davis will be one of the first of 30 A-level students to start at the later time. 'I want to wake up in my bed, not in my maths lesson,' said the 15-year-old. Lessons for all other pupils at the school will still begin at 9am as usual. The move is based on research by Russell Foster, who said teenagers have a biological predisposition to go to bed later and get up later. Neuroscientists have also linked better sleep in teenage years with improved mental health. Research . associate Paul Kelley, who is working with Dr Foster on his latest . sleep research at Oxford University, said moving sleeping patterns later . benefited health and that teenagers performed better after a good . night’s rest. 'You can’t train your system to get up at a practical time,' he said. 'It’s . biological, just as your heartbeat, your liver function and a bunch of . other things that all sync to natural biological time and that is not in . your control. Students: The co-educational school will have the latest start time in the UK, and will be the only one to begin lessons in the afternoon . 'Anything you do to change the rhythmic systems of your body means your organs become desynchronised with each other and this is where people get ill and there is no fixing it by giving someone an alarm clock. 'Your body is not watching your wristwatch.' The move has been met with scepticism from other school heads in the area. Lesley Kirby, head of nearby Richmond Park Academy, said they had considered a slightly later start, but it would inconvenience teaching staff too much. She added: 'It is also important for the main school to see sixth formers as successful role models who are carrying on their education and that is not present if they see them for a very short period of the day. 'Then what are these students going to do when they have a 9am lecture at university, or start work? They won't be able to go in during the afternoon. 'School is about training people in living effective lives and I don't think this is effective as it would be quite difficult to make the change back. I would also wonder how robust the science is.'","Pupils at £15,000-a-year Hampton Court House will work from 1.30 to 7pm .

"Contrast: Innate differences between the sexes mean they will always be drawn to certain subjects and careers . Attempts to encourage more girls to study the sciences ‘completely deny human biology and nature’, an academic has claimed. Schools should stop trying to close education gender gaps because innate differences between the sexes mean they will always be drawn to certain subjects and careers, according to a Glasgow University psychologist. Dr Gijsbert Stoet argued that Britain ‘probably needed to give up on the idea that we will get many female engineers or male nurses’. Efforts to tackle gender inequalities were wasted because pupils with an aptitude for subjects such as physics, computing and engineering would choose them anyway, he claimed. But his remarks, which fly in the face of campaigns by the Government and academic societies, drew a storm of controversy yesterday. The Institute of Physics attacked his position as ‘ridiculous’ and said it denied the strong influences of society and upbringing on women’s study choices. Dr Stoet said it was ‘really hard’ to attract girls to subjects such as computing, telling the British Education Studies Association in Glasgow: ‘Girls will say, “Well, that’s boring, I’m just not interested in it”. ‘We need to have a national debate on why we find it so important to have equal numbers. ‘Do we really care that only 5 per cent of the programmers are women? … I don’t care who programs my computers. A wealthy, democratic society can afford to let people do what they want. ‘What is better? To have 50 per cent of female engineers who do not really like their work but say, “Yeah, well, I did it for the feminist cause”. Or do you want 3 per cent of female engineers who say “I really like my job”?’ His remarks were reported in the TES teachers’ journal. Dr Stoet went on to question the national focus given to girls’ struggles in subjects such as maths, when boys generally performed worse at school. ‘Nobody seems to be that interested that boys have problems. We have, as human beings, a natural tendency to see women as vulnerable and needing help. But if it’s a boy who needs help, he’s responsible for himself,’ he said. Dr Stoet’s comments follow the launch of the Government’s Opening Doors campaign to ‘stamp out gender bias’ in schools, which it said is putting girls off taking maths and science A-levels. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss warned that England’s school system was affected by ‘science deserts’, where too few pupils – particularly girls – are taking subjects such as chemistry and physics. At half of mixed state schools, not a single girl is taking physics A-level, she said. Natural progression: Dr Gijsbert Stoet argued efforts to tackle gender inequalities were wasted because pupils with an aptitude for subjects such as physics, computing and engineering would choose them anyway . In a report last December, the Institute of Physics suggested 49 per cent of state schools were ‘reinforcing gender stereotypes’ in the advice given to pupils about A-levels. The institute’s Clare Thomson said Dr Stoet was implying differences in male and female brains drove subject choices. But evidence suggests that difference within the sexes are bigger than differences between them, she said. ‘Broadly you can say women are more interested in this and men are more interested in that but there’s a huge amount of crossover,’ she added. ‘Just to say, “We should give up on this because that is the way it is”, is ridiculous. It also denies the influences of society and upbringing which we know are incredibly strong. ‘Young people make choices based on the information they have and the advice they have taken.’","Dr Gijsbert Stoet says schools should stop trying to tackle gender gap .

"Fatal: Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging was flying Red 4 when his aircraft ran into difficulty . The horrified wife of a Red Arrows pilot was watching as he crashed his plane into a river and died yesterday. Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging’s Hawk . T1 jet plummeted to the ground as it and eight other Red Arrows left . Bournemouth Air Festival to stage an afternoon fly-past over . Christchurch. His wife Emma, 32, a museums consultant, was in the crowd watching the . display. She said: ‘Jon was the best friend and husband I . could ever have wished for. There was nothing bad about Jon. I loved everything about him.’ Flt Lieut Egging, 33, fought to . manoeuvre his plane away from the village of Throop, crashing into a . field before plunging into the River Stour. Chief Inspector Steve White, of Dorset Police, said: 'On approach to the airport one aircraft crashed into a field near Throop Mill, Bournemouth. 'The aircraft came to rest on the banks of the River Stour, and the emergency services including police, fire, ambulance, coastguard search and rescue and a Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance attended. 'Sadly the pilot, who had been thrown from the aircraft, was pronounced dead at the scene.' He said the emergency services responded as soon as they received information of the crash, and added that he did not know whether the pilot ejected from the aircraft. It is understood that a Mayday call was . issued just before the jet went out of control. A BBC camera crew was . ordered to stop filming the display as soon as the call was received. But officials refused to speculate on what may have called the crash, . confirming only that an investigation will be conducted. Happy: Jon, who always aspired to be a pilot, shares a special moment with his proud wife, Emma . In a statement, the Ministry of . Defence said: 'It is with sadness that the MOD must confirm the death of . Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging of the Royal Air Force Aerobatics Team The . Red Arrows. 'Flight . Lieutenant Egging was killed when his Hawk T1 aircraft – Red 4 – crashed . around 1km South East of Bournemouth Airport at 1350 on Saturday 20 . August 2011. 'A full . Service Inquiry into the details of the crash has been initiated. It . would be inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident at . this time.' The Red Arrows were performing at the Bournemouth Air Festival when the accident happened. Eyewitnesses describe a dramatic rescue . attempt by dog walkers, who jumped into the water. In trouble: Amateur footage shows one of the Red Arrows peeling away from the rest of the team . Emergency: The plane then began to disappear from view, having issued a Mayday call . Out of sight: The plane disappeared from view, leaving a vapour trail behind. The crowd was left in a state of disbelief by the accident . Downed: A rescuer is seen at the site of the crash, just south of Bournemouth Airport . Pub manager Wayne Kent, 30, said: . ‘Somehow he managed to avoid houses. Customers told me it bounced . several times in the field and then headed towards the river.’ Witness Shaun Spencer-Perkins added: . ‘I heard a whoosh behind me and turned to see a Red Arrow flying below . the tree line. It hit the bank on the other side of the river and burst . into pieces.’ It is understood that Flt Lieut Egging tried to eject. Peter Male, whose brother owns the . land where the jet crashed, said: ‘The parachute was in the river and . two men jumped in to try to save the pilot. ‘But when they pulled the parachute out, nothing was attached to it. Ten minutes later, they found the body along the bank.’ Radio enthusiast Malcolm MacIntyre, 37,  told the Bournemouth Echo that he'd listened in on radio communications between the team and the control tower, just before the crash. He said that just after the Red Arrows called to land by the tower, one of the pilots said: 'Are you aware of the Mayday?' The reply was: 'Yes, we are, somebody is dealing with that.' Mr MacIntyre added: 'I am completely shocked.' One eyewitness, Laura Goodwin, told Sky News that the accident happened just after the team had completed its display. She said: 'One plane went one way, one went the other and didn't come back. A lot of people are in disbelief about what happened.' Another witness said that dog walkers pulled the pilot from a river, near the village of Throop. The crash location was confirmed by Shaun Spencer-Perkins, who witnessed the crash from Throop Mill. Crash site: Emergency services are in attendance near the village of Throop, where the aircraft came down . He told the BBC: 'I heard a rushing sound and I saw a plane about 50ft above the ground racing across the fields. It impacted and bounced across the field, made it across the river. 'Members of the public jumped into the water to search for the cockpit. 'We waved down the helicopter, I took off my son's orange jacket and my wife's red jumper to get the attention of the helicopter.' He added that there was no sign of the pilot and he didn't see a parachute. Wayne Kent, 30, the assistant manager of the Broadway Pub, said some of his customers had seen the incident. He said: 'I heard that the plane went down in the fields near Throop and it bounced three or four times. The pilot then steered it towards the river.' Mr Kent said the pilot guided the plane away from houses in the village and from people walking near the riverbank. Bournemouth Airport released a statement about the incident on its website. It read: 'A spokesperson for Bournemouth Airport has confirmed that an incident involving a Red Arrows aircraft took place approximately one mile away from the airport this afternoon.' The Air Festival, meanwhile, which has drawn crowds of over 200,000, is continuing to run. Since 1979, the Red Arrows have used the dual control BAE Systems Hawk T1 aircraft. According to the aerobatic team's website, the planes' Rolls Royce engines produce 5,200lbs of thrust and give a top speed of Mach 1.2. They have been based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire since 2001. Gifted: Flight Lieutenant Egging, pictured last month, had been with the Red Arrows for less than a year . Flight  Lieutenant Egging joined the RAF in 2000. He qualified as a Harrier pilot and served in Afghanistan before returning to the UK as a Squadron Qualified Flying Instructor. He lived in the village of Morcott, Rutland, with his wife Emma. On joining the Red Arrows, he said:  ‘Emma is a driving force behind my career and she is as proud as Punch of me.’ A profile of the dead pilot on the Red Arrows website reads: 'Jon became interested in flying at an early age, inspired by his airline pilot father who used to take him down route, allowing him into the cockpit for take off and landing. 'Jon attended Southam School in Warwickshire gaining A-Levels in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. He was a member of 2028 (Southam) Sqn Air Training Corps from age 13. 'During the sixth form he was awarded . a Royal Air Force Flying Scholarship and had his first solo flight in a . Cessna 152 flying from Wellesbourne Mountford Aerodrome. Following a . gap year spent working in the UK and travelling around Australia, Jon . went on to read a BSc in Environmental Science at Southampton . University. 'He joined Southampton University Air Squadron and was awarded a Royal Air Force Bursary in his second year.' Still reeling from the tragic death, colleagues tonight paid tribute to the crack pilot. Group . Captain Simon Blake, the Commandant of the RAF’s Central Flying School, . said: 'Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, known as Eggman, joined the Team . as Red 4 in the Autumn of 2010. 'A . gifted aviator, he was chosen to fly in the Red 4 slot, on the right . hand outside of the famous Diamond Nine formation - an accolade in . itself being the most demanding position allocated to a first year . pilot. 'Throughout his winter training and the display season to date, his professionalism, skill and humility have shone through.' 'A true team player, his good nature and constant smile will be sorely missed by all.  In such a close knit team, this tragedy will be keenly felt by his fellow team members, the Reds and all of the engineering and support staff, the Blues.' Air Vice Marshal Mark Green, Air Officer Commanding 22 (Training) Group, added: 'I first met Flt Lt Jon Egging in 2003 when I became his Station Commander. Even at that early stage in his career, Jon's professionalism, competence and ever present smile made him stand out from the crowd. Hence, his eventual selection for duties with the Red Arrows came as no surprise. 'His time with the Team was typified by the characteristics that were Jon's trademark: professionalism, enthusiasm for life and a willingness to help others that transcended all boundaries. Jon will be sorely missed by all those that had the privilege to know him; our thoughts and prayers are with Jon's family and friends at this tragic time.'","33-year old Jon Egging pronounced dead at scene .

"The First World War would not be fought today, according to Jeremy Paxman, because the younger generation are more concerned with their iPhones than any sense of ‘duty’. The BBC Newsnight host and historian said modern society is too ‘self-obsessed’ and ‘hedonistic’. Speaking at a literature festival in Dubai, he said the idea of ‘duty’ had now diminished in favour of ‘personal freedom’, adding: ‘What would [the younger] generation fight for? The right to use your iPhone? What are the great noble causes?’ Jeremy Paxman believes a conflict like the First World War would not happen today because society is too 'self-obsessed' and 'hedonistic' He added: ‘Ideas of duty, clearly strongly felt by many people, have diminished as the international significance of the country has diminished. ‘We live in such a relativistic society now, and materialist, self-obsessed and hedonistic; it’s hard to imagine circumstances under which people would say that “it is worth it, I am willing to risk my life and well-being for this.”’ Mr Paxman, 63, said he had ‘no doubt whatsoever’ that the war would not be fought today but that in his opinion, ‘some things are worth fighting for.’ Paxman also claims that a conflict like the Great War would not happen because of the persuasive presence of social media, which he claims has changed what people are willing to put up with . 'Over the top' during the Battle of the Somme. Paxman believes nothing like this war would ever happen again because the young men and women of today have no motivation to fight . ‘We have grown up in an environment in which the greatest premium is put on personal freedom,’ he said. ‘Great value, we are told living in a western democracy, is that you can do as you please. ‘It’s a much more difficult challenge to manage that sort of society than the generation that grew up during the First World War.’ He said today’s influence of social media would also hinder any war effort as it has changed what ‘people are prepared to put up with’, adding: ‘I suspect that there would have been so many tweets...and photos of trench digging that public opinion would have caused an end to the business. The trench would never be dug.’ He also argued that there was a great misunderstanding in the way the First World War was viewed, partly as a result of war poetry such as that by Wilfred Owen and Seigfried Sassoon. Jeremy Paxman hopes his new show 'Britain's Great War' will change the perception of how much of an impact the conflict had on the U.K, but says he is naive to think he could do it alone . He told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Forget the poems, forget Oh! What a Lovely War, forget Blackadder. Engage with the lives of those who took part in it and think, “What would I have done?” ‘The events now are so built upon by writers and attitudes and propaganda that the actual events seem submerged. University Challenge host Mr Paxman is currently presenting the BBC One series Britain’s Great War, and accompaniment to his book Great Britain’s Great War’, which looks at the impact the 1914-1918 conflict had on the country. Michael Gove started a political row when he argued that contrary to the views of academics, the conflict was a 'just war' to combat aggression by a German elite bent on domination . He said he hopes to be able to change perceptions but admits he would be a ‘fool’ if he thought he could do so alone. He added: ‘So what I wanted to do was re-engage with the events themselves. How did they seem to people at the time? He said that a ‘difficulty’ of modern education is that so much of what we know about the Great War is taught only as poetry and not history. ‘I think the reason [poetry] is of interest is that it confirms with your prejudices to see the whole thing as a terrible, pointless sacrifice, sure, and the story it was fought for democracy and so on I don’t think it stacks up. ‘But I think that the idea that the whole thing was a conspiracy to throw away young lives is perpetuated by the poets and actually there is much more to it than that. In January, Education Secretary Michael Gove started a political row when he said television shows like Blackadder peddled ‘left-wing myths’ that the Great War was a ‘misbegotten shambles’. He argued that contrary to the views of left-wing academics, the conflict was a ‘just war’ to combat aggression by a German elite bent on domination. He said: ‘The war was, of course, an unspeakable tragedy, which robbed this nation of our bravest and best. ‘But it’s important that we don’t succumb to some of the myths which have grown up about the conflict in the last 70 or so years. ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder as a misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite.’","Paxman doesn't believe conflict like the Great War would happen today .

"Pupils are worried about living expenses and not being able to earn while studying . Two-thirds of children are worried about the cost of going to university even though they think it will help them ‘get on in life’, a new survey has revealed. They are concerned about living expenses and not being able to earn while they study while those from middle-class backgrounds are most troubled by £9,000-a-year tuition fees. The Ipsos MORI poll for the Sutton Trust surveyed 2,595 11 to 16-year-olds. It classified them as being in families of high, medium or low affluence based on questions about their households. It found that students from the least affluent families (23 per cent) were more likely to cite cost as the biggest consideration when deciding whether to go onto higher education than their richer counterparts (14 per cent). However, middle-class youngsters - who miss out on means tested maintenance grants - are most affected by tuition fees (30 per cent) when worrying about all the costs. This compared to 28 per cent of rich students and 26 per cent of poorer ones who agreed that fees were the ‘biggest concern’. Overall, 65 per cent of students surveyed were worried about university finances - 28 per cent cited tuition fees; 19 per cent, the cost of living and 18 per cent, not earning while studying. Only seven per cent said they were not troubled by the cost of going to university. Thirty eight per cent of young people said they were ‘very likely’ to go to university and 43 per cent ‘fairly likely’. A higher proportion of black and minority ethnic students (49 per cent) said they were likely to go to university than white students (35 per cent). Of those who were unlikely to go into higher education, 57 per cent cited financial considerations and 49 per cent said they would prefer to do something more practical. However 86 per cent said going to university was important in ‘helping people do well and get on in life’, with 43 per cent rating it ‘very important’. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust and the Education Endowment Foundation, said: ‘It is clear from this poll that many young people remain worried about the cost of higher education. Two-thirds of children are worried about the cost of going to university even though they think it will help them 'get on in life' according to a new survey . ‘Graduates face debts of over £40,000 with the higher fees and many will be paying for their university studies into their fifties. ‘We are urging the Government to means test university fees, as used to be the case, so that those from low and middle income families pay less for tuition.’ Means-testing ended in 2006 when variable fees of up to £3,000-a-year were introduced. Those with household incomes below £42,611 can currently apply for means-tested maintenance grants. Michael MacNeil, head of higher education at the University and College Union (UCU), said: ‘We need our brightest young people aspiring to university and the courses best suited to their talents. Worryingly the biggest barrier is the increased cost of a degree. ‘Ministers need to move on from looking at how to squeeze more money out of students and look at the damage the increased cost of going to university is already having.’","The Ipsos MORI poll surveyed 2,595 11 to 16-year-olds .

"Pupils in Scotland could be swapping the real football pitch for a virtual one during PE classes, under proposals put forward at an education conference. Plans to introduce popular sport-related video games, such as Football Manager and Just Dance as part of PE lessons, were discussed during a meeting of the Scottish Association of Teachers of Physical Education. Key speaker at the meeting Len Almond, former foundation director of the British Heart Foundation National Centre, suggested the games could be used to encourage more youngsters into sport. Proposals to introduce popular video games such as Football Manager (pictured) to PE classes were discussed during a meeting of the Scottish Association of Teachers of Physical Education . 'When you look at video gaming, the theory behind them has a lot to offer teachers in schools,' he told MailOnline. 'I'm not suggesting (pupils) just sit watch more video games. But we can learn an awful lot in how we attract young people to learning and we motivate them in that. 'If a teacher felt it was appropriate to use video games for children's work- maybe part of examination subject- I'd have no problem with that. It's the learning potential that is the important criteria. 'In effect, what we are saying is, they have found a way of exciting young children, they have found a way of self-corrected learning, internal motivation, and ensured they become part of the story.' Mr Almond said video games could never fully replace traditional physical education, but suggested games such as Football Manager could be a useful tool in encouraging more children into football. 'There is one way of using video gaming, where you're managing football teams which is an interesting thing you could do with young people,' he added. The plans aim at to boost the popularity of sport and PE classes- and already seems to be going down well judging from a tweet by the company behind the game . 'You're planning, directing and making decisions and if that helps a young person understand the game, that is very good. 'It shouldn't replace getting out into the countryside and participating in much more physical activities. 'But video games might have a role for some children. 'The important thing is, we have got to attract young people to sport and physical education.' Aberdeen Grammar School, where PE Iain Stanger has computer game have the potential to enhance learning . Association president and PE teacher at Aberdeen Grammar School, Iain Stanger, agreed and said other games, such as Wii Fit and Minecraft, could also have the potential to enhance learning for pupils in the city. Mr Stanger told the Evening Express: 'I know some schools using fantasy role games and others such as Minecraft which have the potential to enhance people's learning. Games such as Just Dance and Wii Fit also have the potential to do this.' Mr Almond said: 'Games such as Football Manager are a very good way to get people to understand football and the role it has in our society.' The Scottish Association of Teachers of Physical Education, which has more than 300 members, aims to come up with ways of producing 'high quality, structured and progressive physical education'.","Sport related video games could be used alongside traditional PE lessons .

"A man has been charged with aggravated murder and robbery after four men were found beaten to death in separate homes in a small Ohio town. The multiple homicides have shocked the small 12,000-strong community of Bucyrus, Ohio, with residents fearing it could be related to the town's drug problems. Friends and relatives said at least some of the victims knew each other as well as a man taken into custody - Donald Hoffman - who had entered the police station to give information which led to the discovery of two bodies. Donald Hoffman, 41, has been held in custody and charged with aggravated murder and robbery . Police cordon off a home in Bucyrus, Ohio, where a body of a man beaten to death was found on Monday . Shocked locals look on as police work at one of the four crime scenes across the city . While police have not yet confirmed the charges, jail records showed Hoffman had been charged with four counts of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The bodies of Billy Jack Chatman, 55, and Freelin Hensley, 67, were found Monday, while Darrell Lewis and Gerald Lee Smith, both 65, were found the following day. Crawford County Coroner Michael Johnson said the cause of death hadn't yet been determined, but a preliminary autopsy report would soon be available. He said authorities believed the slayings were related 'because of the sequence and time, and appearance of the scene.' A forensics officer works at the scene of one of the crimes . Bucyrus police Chief Dave Koepke said each of the four men suffered trauma above the shoulders. He said: 'All the victims suffered.' Crawford County Sheriff Scott Kent said yesterday that a man - believed to be Hoffman - walked into the local police station to give information as to why the killings occurred. However, he would not release the details of what was said. He said: 'One (slaying) can be complicated. Four is overwhelming.' Last night prosecutor Matthew Crall's office said 41-year old Hoffman, of Bucyrus, was in custody and described him as a person of interest in the slayings. The office said in a news release that Hoffman was being held on a probation violation and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for him on this morning. It wasn't immediately clear whether Hoffman had an attorney. Calls to the Crawford County Jail on Wednesday night went to an automated answering service. The town of 12,000 is unaccustomed to violent crime but is battling a heroin problem. Some residents said after the slayings that they were worried about their safety. Neighbors of some of the victims said they were reluctant to talk publicly about the men because they worried the case is somehow connected to the city's drug problems and feared potential retribution.

"New findings: Women diagnosed with breast cancer who drank three and a half small glasses of wine a week were 10% more likely to survive than non drinkers . A glass of wine a day boosts the survival chances of women with breast cancer by up to a fifth, scientists have found. Those who drink in moderation are more likely to recover from the illness than those who abstain. But the findings are somewhat unexpected because drinking alcohol is considered to be one of the leading causes of breast cancer among healthy women. One explanation is that the chemicals in alcohol which damage healthy cells also have the same effect on cancerous cells. There are currently no specific guidelines for breast cancer patients on alcohol consumption, but healthy women are advised to drink no more than 14 units a week. Many women with cancer stop drinking in the hope it will boost the success of their treatment. Researchers from the University of Cambridge looked at 13,525 women with breast cancer for an average of seven years, making it the largest study of its kind. They recorded the average weekly alcohol intake for each patient as well as their body mass index. Women who drank seven units a week – three and a half small glasses of wine – were 10 per cent more likely to survive than those who had nothing. The odds increased to 20 per cent if women drank 14 units a week. Dr Paul Pharoah, of the university’s Department of Oncology, said: ‘What our study says is that it is reasonable, if you’re diagnosed with breast cancer, to enjoy the occasional drink of alcohol.’ Although drinking alcohol seems to make a big difference to women’s survival odds, the scientists pointed out that the overall change was small. This was because there were many other factors affecting the success of treatment including how early the illness was diagnosed, the woman’s age and the particular type of breast cancer. Experts commenting on the study also pointed out that alcohol was only beneficial once a woman had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Raising the odds: Those who drank seven small glasses of wine a week were 20 per cent more likely survive breast cancer than those who abstained from drinking alcohol .","University of Cambridge researchers looked at 13,525 women with breast cancer for an average of seven years .

After agreeing to allow their son's organs to be donated, they then learned that his liver had already saved the life of another child in need of a transplant . Organ donations are not widespread as many Chinese believe they will be reincarnated after death and therefore feel the need to keep a complete body. But the country has introduced a new donation system where around 1,500 people donated organs in 2014, more than the total for the previous four years. An estimated 300,000 patients are put on a waiting list every year in China for organ transplants but only around one in 30 will ultimately receive a new organ.","Huang Zihan, aged 15 months, was injured in a car crash with his parents .

"English is not the first language for the majority of children in more than one in nine schools, it emerged today. There are a total of 1,755 primary and secondary schools in England where more than half of the pupils speak another language, according to official figures. More than 200 schools have an even more extreme situation, with 90 per cent of children having to learn English as a second language. Diverse: There are more than 200 schools English is not the first language of nine in 10 pupils (file photo) Some pupils are arriving at school aged five without having ever used English at all, with others knowing only basic phrases and unable to recognise English writing. The number of pupils who have English as their second language is reported to have risen by a fifth to almost 1.1million in the past five years. The huge number of schools where native English speakers are in the minority was revealed by the Daily Telegraph, in an analysis of data provided by schools to the Department for Education. London has the highest proportion of residents born outside Britain of any region, but the capital does not dominate the list of schools with the most non pupils speaking English as a second language. At the Sacred Heart Primary School in Sandwell, West Midlands, 99 per cent of pupils do not speak English at home. Difficulties: But many schools with a large proportion of non-native English speakers are well regarded (file photo) Of the rest of the top 10 schools, just two are in London, with the others located such as Luton, Rochdale and West Yorkshire.

"A British artist has created a series of incredibly lifelike images using the contents of his tool box. With only a hammer and nails to hand, David Foster, 52, has conjured up beautiful images of nature as well as portraits of icons including The Beatles and The Queen. The artist, who works from his home studio in Warrington, Cheshire, uses up to 30,000 nails in each piece. A portrait of Queen Elizabeth holding Prince Andrew, created with nails by artist David Foster (left) and zoomed-in (right) A closer look at David Foster's portrait of Queen Elizabeth holding Prince Andrew, created with nails . The artwork, which can each take up to three weeks of careful hammering to complete, sell for between £2,000 and £4,000 in galleries across the UK. David says: 'The whole process thrills me, taking just a hammer and a box of nails and arranging them into a piece of art. 'My work is based initially on a photograph, which I painstakingly reproduce. It is very tactile art and the viewer will find it hard not to touch the work.' A portrait of Marilyn Monroe, created with different coloured nails . The Beatles given the nail treatment (left) and up-close with John Lennon (right) Work in progress: Artists David Foster in his studio, hammering away at The Queen . David’s ability to create his intricate artwork stemmed from a 20-year career in architecture, where he was required to produce precise drawings for each project. After falling ill and suffering a prolapse disc problem and nerve damage in the lower back, David was forced to retire. Due to risk of paralysis, surgeons chose not to operate, and although David has partially recovered, he still suffers from muscle wastage in his left leg and back pain. David Bowie looking hammered (left) and close-up (right) David says, 'When I was well enough to draw again I realised that at my age, 49 at the time, I would have to do something different to get noticed in the art world.' 'My technique has evolved and developed over time, I now use tiny nails which enable the viewer to see and interpret the work more closely and in detail. 'I currently have over half a million nails in my studio waiting to be hammered. Two icons: Portrait of Mick Jagger (left) and Nelson Mandela (right) created with extraordinary precision . The Statue of Liberty in progress in David's studio . 'My first piece of nail art was the elephant, titled ‘Elephant on a Bed of Nails’. My first inkling that it worked was when I was half way through it and we had a chap round fixing our boiler. 'He was a distance away from it and thought I was doing a charcoal sketch! He was amazed as he got closer and saw it was made from nails.' To help create an impact, David creates his artwork on a large scale - usually 1-metre high.

"As LeBron James enjoys a family holiday following a gruelling NBA season, his old team Cleveland Cavaliers are one of the teams looking to tempt the free-agent into a move away from Miami. Cavaliers officials met with James' agent, Rich Paul, this week about the free-agent superstar's possible return to the team who drafted him with the No 1 overall pick in the 2003 draft. The sides met as James continued his family holiday, a person with knowledge of the details told Associated Press on Thursday. ESPN have also reported that Paul met with representatives for the Phoenix Suns, Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks. James recently opted out of the final two years of his contract in Miami. The two-time NBA champion has gone to four straight finals with the Heat. However, after the team was smashed by San Antonio Spurs 4-1 in this year's NBA Finals, James said he would weigh his options this summer. Vacation: LeBron James shared this picture of him on a family holiday . Getaway: James is on holiday with his NBA future also up in the air at the moment . Message: James said on Instagram: 'No other way to spend my free time then with my family! #JamesVacation' One of them could be re-signing with the Cavs, the team he spent seven seasons with before leaving in 2010 to join forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in South Florida. Wade and Bosh also opted out of their deals with Heat, raising speculation the 'Big Three' could be headed in different directions. James' decision to leave Cleveland prompted owner Dan Gilbert to condemn him in a scathing letter to Cavaliers fans. The Cavs have waited patiently for their chance to try and convince the man from Akron, Ohio to come home. In the past few weeks, Cleveland have hired new coach David Blatt, selected Kansas' Andrew Wiggins with the No 1 overall pick in the NBA Draft and signed All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving to a five-year, $90 million contract extension. Relaxing: James and his Miami Heat team were beaten 4-1 in the NBA Finals by San Antonio Spurs . Away from home: James opted out of the final two years of his Miami Heat contract to become a free agent . Now, they're working on bringing back James, who has never ruled out the possibility of a return. Two years ago, James was asked if he could ever see himself playing for the Cavs again. 'It would be great,' he said. 'It would be fun to play in front of these fans again. I had a lot fun times in my seven years here. You can't predict the future and hopefully I continue to stay healthy. I'm here as a Miami Heat player, and I'm happy where I am now, but I don't rule that out in no sense. 'And if I decide to come back, hopefully the fans will accept me.' Coming home? A return to Cleveland for the man from Akron, Ohio is being discussed . Striking a pose: James' agent has also met with representatives from three other NBA teams . Champion: James has won two NBA titles with Miami, but could leave in a quest for more glory .

"As many as 100,000 foreign students a year are thought to be staying on in Britain illegally after completing academic courses here. The students – believed to be mostly from the Indian sub-continent – come to Britain to attend universities and colleges, according to official immigration figures. But the Government’s tracking system has failed to find evidence that they ever left the country. Missing: Some 177,000 people moved to Britain for long-term study last year, down from 246,000 in 2011. But there is now growing evidence that many of the students who came into the country in recent years never left . The missing thousands have been detected at a time when numbers of student visas and student entrants to the country from outside Europe have been scaled down steeply as part of the Coalition’s drive to reduce immigration to 1990s levels. Some 177,000 people moved to Britain for long-term study last year, down from 246,000 in 2011. But there is now growing evidence that many of the students who came into the country in recent years never left. The MigrationWatch think-tank called on  ministers to set up an inquiry  into what has happened to the missing students and to trace  those still living in the country as illegal immigrants. Office for National Statistics records show that last year 50,000 people from outside the EU who came to Britain to study returned home, but the numbers leaving fall far short of those arriving as students. According to the ONS breakdown 145,000 non-EU students came to Britain in 2012; 185,000 in 2011; 186,000 in 2010; and 167,000 in 2009. Most came from India and other south Asian countries. Numbers of students from China are thought to have grown to be the largest national contingent last year. Focus: The arrival and departure of students from outside the EU is now under the control of Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) The student gap has opened up at a time when the focus of immigration concerns has switched largely to migrants from Europe, and the probability of a new wave of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria – whose citizens won the right to work freely in Britain at the start of the year. Some of the growing attention to immigration and its effects is now likely to switch to arrivals from outside the EU and the numbers of students, whose arrival and departure is under the control of Home Secretary Theresa May. Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch said: ‘It is very significant  that the number of non-EU students recorded as departing last year  was only 50,000, compared to an average inflow over the last five years of 155,000. ‘This suggests that students staying on legally or otherwise comprise a major part of net migration.  This issue of the missing students  is one that absolutely must now be tackled. ‘The education industry is in denial. Whatever the benefits of genuine students, which we all accept, it is absolutely absurd to accept near to 200,000 a year with no effective checks on their departure.’ In The National Audit Office is  to investigate claims that private universities are giving taxpayer-funded loans to thousands of students who don’t go to class. Students have allegedly been claiming money without proper proof of UK residence following government reforms which allow private college students to claim maintenance loans and grants of up to £11,000 a year. Colleges can receive £6,000 in tuition fees for each student enrolled.","Government tracking system cannot find evidence students ever left UK .

"A swinging couple sprayed a can of bear repellent into the face of a man after a weekend sex session arranged on the internet went wrong. Stephen Barclay, 36, and his lover Leanne Reid, 31, had spent a drug-fuelled weekend with total stranger Owen Greenan at their home. The couple had arranged for him to stay at their isolated property for the orgy after they contacted each other online. Swingers: Steven Barclay, left, and Leanne Reid, right, (both pictured outside court) are jointly accused of assault by spraying bear mace at Owen Greenan when their consensual sex session turned nasty . The pair, of Glespin, Lanarkshire, had picked Mr Greenan up and taken him back to their secluded cottage on the Friday evening and he was supposed to spend the weekend with the couple. However in the early hours of Sunday morning the romp turned ugly when Mr Greenan refused to let Barclay take a picture of him on his mobile phone. Reid handed her partner a can of Sabre Wild Max Bear Attack deterrent spray and he released the chemical into Mr Greenan's face. He fled the house in agony and was found running down a road by a lorry driver and the police were called. Officers later arrested Reid and Barclay and charged them with a string of offences. A hearing at Lanark Sheriff Court heard Barclay and Reid both admit assaulting Mr Greenan on March 27 last year. Isolated: The couple invited Mr Greenan to their cottage in Glespin, Lanarkshire, for the weekend for sex after meeting him online . Prosecutor Gary Dow told the court that the weekend 'had gone well' before matters escalated. He said Mr Greenan had been woken up on the couch at 4am by Reid who invited him into the couple's bedroom for a smoke. But on arriving there he found Barclay sitting in a hot tub drinking a can of beer. Bear repellant is similar to the pepper spray sold as 'mace' in the United States, used for fending off attackers. Sabre Wild Max – one of the most popular Canadian brands – uses hot pepper plants as an ingredient and is extremely powerful. The manufacturers warn that it is not for use on humans, as it can cause intense pain if sprayed into the eyes. A normal canister is designed to spray a heavy fog up to 40 yards away – so if it is fired too close  to a human eyeball, the force of the  discharge can cause pressure injuries. The spray itself also works by irritating the mucous membranes of the eyes, causing pain and the production of tears. It also causes coughing and sneezing. The only treatment is to  seek fresh air immediately and blink repeatedly to cleanse the eye. Mr Dow said: 'The complainer sat on the toilet seat and Mr Barclay held a phone out to take a photo. 'He told the complainer, ""smile for the camera."" 'He went to get up and Leanne Reid said ""f****** smile"". She also had said that she was going to get a knife to stab him. 'Mr Barclay then said to the complainer, ""Do you think you can come here all weekend, **** my wife and nothing will happen?"".' Barclay then instructed Reid to give him the repellent, which he told police he had bought in Canada, before he sprayed it on his victim. Mr Dow added: 'The complainer then ran out of the house leaving his belongings.' Mr Greenan was later taken to Wishaw General Hospital where he was treated for his injuries and held in a contamination room before being released. Representing Barclay, defence agent Neil McShane told the court that drugs had played a part in the weekend's events. He said: 'This occurred at a time when parties had been taking ketamine. 'Mr Barclay had been up with very little sleep from Friday to Sunday.' Archie Hill, who represented Reid, described the attack as 'an unfortunate turn of events'. Sheriff Nikola Stewart deferred sentence on the pair until next month for a full range of reports. She said: 'I'm intrigued to what's going on. 'It's a concern that I see people taking advantage of someone that was a guest in their remote home.' Barclay and Reid admitted assaulting Mr Greenan by ordering him to sit on a toilet seat, threatening to stab him, ordering him to remove his hands from his face and discharging the bear repellent in his face. Barclay also pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of cannabis worth up to £7,650 and the canister of the Sabre Wild Max Bear Attack deterrent. Reid's not guilty plea to a charge that she had wasted police time by alleging that Mr Greenan had raped her was accepted by prosecutors and the charge was dropped. Charges that Barclay and Reid had possessed and supplied amphetamine and ketamine on the same date were also dropped. Both refused to comment as they left court.

"An assistant head teacher, who was accused of assaulting a 15-year-old pupil, has been cleared. William Stuart, 47, was today found not guilty of assaulting the girl at Graham School in Scarborough following a two-day trial. After the verdict was read out the court erupted into cheers largely from dozens of Mr Stuart's supporters from the local community. It's over: Teacher William Stuart, seen with wife Sarah, has been cleared of assaulting a 15-year-old pupil . The teacher's wife, Sarah, who had been anxiously sitting in court, burst into tears at the news. Mr Stuart, who has 23 years of . unblemished experience, was charged after the girl, who cannot be named, . claimed the science teacher shoved her to the ground and against some . coat pegs. It was alleged that Mr Stuart had become angry and 'out of control' after the pupil . ignored his instructions to stay behind when food was smeared on the . wall of the school canteen. But chairman of the bench Paul Osborne . said the girl's evidence was inconsistent and did not tally with that . of two other pupils who gave evidence for the prosecution. Ian Glen QC, defending, had earlier told the court 19 incidents . were detailed in the school’s bad behaviour log from September 2009 to . July 2011 about the girl’s poor attitude in class and on school grounds. The girl accused Mr Stuart of shoving her to the ground and against some coat pegs at Graham School in Scarborough (pictured) where Mr Stuart is assistant head teacher . The court also heard the girl has already been excluded this term after . assaulting another pupil. Mr . Osborne said her terrible school record did nothing for her . credibility, especially as she tried to tell the court she was a good . pupil. He said: 'Mr Stuart's evidence was credible and convincing. 'He has a 23-year unblemished teaching record across several schools.' Speaking after the hearing, Anne . Swift, from the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said the strain of the . case has had an 'enormous impact' on Mr Stuart's family. She said teachers accused in this way should be granted anonymity until they are convicted by a court. Mrs Swift said: 'He (Mr Stuart) was made to feel a criminal before anything was found. 'It's . too easy for youngsters and their families to make false accusations. There should be consequences for those who make false allegations.' Mrs Swift said both his children went to the school where he teaches and, because of the accusation, he was not able to see his daughter's final concert before she left. Asked how she would describe Mr Stuart, she said: 'An excellent teacher. A man of a good character. A pillar of the community.' Mrs Swift said she also believed a matter like this should never have . involved the police at all and should have been dealt with internally. Asked whether Mr Stuart would return to his job, she said: 'It would be a great loss to his profession to have an experienced teacher decide they can't face it any more.'","William Stuart's wife Sarah burst into tears at verdict while supporters cheered .

"Cleveland Cavaliers co-owner Usher says he is happy to pick up the phone and convince LeBron James back to the team. James has become a free agent after leaving Miami Heat at the end of last season and the Cavs are intent on luring the Akron, Ohio, native back to Cleveland. And singer and actor Usher, who is part of a group who own the team, told 103.5 KISS FM in Chicago: 'I will say that I’m not too prideful to pick up a phone and make a call.' Many happy returns? LeBron James could move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat . This comes . just days after the Cavs removed the scathing letter on their website . written by the team's owner to fans after their star player chose Miami . as a free agent four years ago. Hours . after James went on a nationally televised special to reveal his . controversial decision to join the star-studded Miami Heat rather than . re-sign with his home-state Cavaliers, Gilbert lashed out in anger. The angry letter described the move by James as 'selfish,' 'heartless,' 'callous,' and a 'cowardly betrayal' - and vowed that a curse would deny him the championships he craved in Miami and that the Cavaliers would win a title without him. The NBA fined Gilbert $100,000 for the comments. James went on to lead Miami to four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals and two titles while Cleveland finished last in their five-team division three years in a row before a third-place finish last season. Cleveland's struggles, however, may have set the Cavaliers up as an attractive team for a James homecoming as the high draft picks they garnered as a result allowed them to amass a core of talented young players. Make the call: Usher said he would be happy to call LeBron James to convince him to come back to the Cleveland Cavaliers . Scathing attack: Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert was not impressed when LeBron James decided to leave . Dumped: A poster of LeBron James ends up in the bin after hearing that he was leaving . VIDEO James opts out of Miami contract . Cleveland recently reached agreement with premier point guard Kyrie Irving, the 2011 number one overall draft pick, to a five-year extension worth about $90 million, and they used the top pick last month on high-leaping forward Andrew Wiggins. With James retaining a home in the Akron area and strong family ties in the area, the Heat have been hard-pressed under the tight NBA salary cap to retool a team that were humbled in last month's NBA Finals by the San Antonio Spurs. His ultimate decision could put the NBA's balance of power at stake and make whatever team he chooses an instant contender. Hot picks: Cleveland Cavaliers have built a team of talented youngsters including Kyrie Irving (C) Heat president Pat Riley, who is expected to meet soon with James, said on Monday that agreements are in place to sign free agent power forward Josh McRoberts and small forward Danny Granger as part of their push for the four-time league most valuable player. The slick passing McRoberts, 27, averaged 8.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game last season with the Charlotte Hornets. Granger, a former All-Star who has a career scoring average of 17.4 points over nine seasons, split last season between the Indiana Pacers and the Los Angeles Clippers and averaged 8.2 points and 3.2 rebounds.","Cleveland Cavaliers have stepped up their bid for LeBron James to return .

"Several former intelligence officials are accusing the White House of failing to act in the case of a Paksitani doctor who faces 33 years behind bars despite leading the U.S. to Osama bin Laden. Outcry has erupted against the Obama administration since Dr Shakil Afridi's sentence on Tuesday, which was seen as punishment for humiliating Pakistan for apparently not knowing the al-Qaeda leader was living comfortably within its boundaries. Dr Afridi was arrested days after the Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden’s compound. Treason: Dr Shakil Afridi, left, was jailed for 33 years in Islamabad for helping the U.S. find bin Laden, a move that was seen as a major humiliation for the country . Peter Brookes, a former intelligence analyst and adviser, said the U.S. should have had a plan in place to get him out of Pakistan before his arrest. Mr Brookes told FoxNews.com: 'You probably wouldn't want to have tipped him off ahead of time, but maybe the day right afterward you would have wanted to have helped him leave Pakistan - and the same with anybody else who was working with us.' While the State Department claims it is in talks with Pakistan in the Afridi case, another ex-intelligence official says they’re not doing enough, if anything. Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer told Fox News: 'From what I'm hearing, we did pretty much nothing.' Accusations: Peter Brookes, left, and Lt Col Tony Shaffer, right, say the White House has not done enough to secure Dr Afridi's freedom . 'We did nothing diplomatically at all, didn't raise a finger. ... From what my sources tell me, we did nothing to try and help this guy.' On Wednesday, Rep Peter King, the New York congressman who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, pointed to the White House for 'outing' Dr Afridi to Pakistani authorities. 'They put him out there,' Mr King said in light of the doctor's prison sentence for treason by the Pakistani government. 'This has been handled very poorly right from the time of the raid,' Mr King told Fox News. 'They disclosed his identity.' Pointing the finger: Representative Peter King says that the Obama administration revealed the doctor's identity, effectively leading the Pakistani authorities to him . The sentence is viewed by Western officials as punishment for humiliating the nation which claimed not to know it was  harbouring the Al Qaeda leader. Meanwhile, a Senate panel expressed its outrage Thursday over Pakistan's conviction of Dr Afridi by cutting aid to Islamabad by $33million - $1million for every year of the physician's 33-year sentence for high treason. The punitive move came on top of deep reductions the Appropriations Committee already had made to President Obama's budget request for Pakistan, a reflection of the growing congressional anger over its cooperation in combatting terrorism. The overall foreign aid budget for next year had slashed more than half of the proposed assistance and threatened further reductions if Islamabad failed to open overland supply routes to U.S.-led NATO forces in Afghanistan. Pushing aside any diplomatic talk, Republicans and Democrats criticised Pakistan a day after Dr Afridi’s conviction. The doctor ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA and verify bin Laden's presence at the compound in Abbottabad where U.S. commandos found and killed the al-Qaeda leader in May 2011. The United States has called for Dr Afridi's release, arguing that he was acting in the interest of the U.S. and Pakistan. 'We need Pakistan, Pakistan needs us, but we don't need Pakistan double-dealing and not seeing the justice in bringing Osama bin Laden to an end,' said Sen Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, who pushed for the additional cut in aid. He accused Pakistan of 'schizophrenic ally' helping the U.S. at one turn, but then aiding the Haqqani network which has claimed responsibility for several attacks on Americans. The group also has ties to al-Qaeda and the Taliban. 'It's Alice in Wonderland at best,' said Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont. 'If this is cooperation, I'd hate like hell to see opposition.' Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces . One of the most forceful statements came from Sen Dianne Feinstein of California, who also serves as the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. She pointed out that Pakistan has suffered at the hands of terrorists yet misconstrued what is treason in convicting Afridi. She also insisted that Afridi was not a spy. 'This conviction says to me that al-Qaeda is viewed by the court to be Pakistan,' said Feinstein, who said it made her rethink U.S. assistance. The committee approved Sen Graham's amendment to cut the assistance by $33million on a 30-0 vote.In crafting the overall legislation, the committee reduced Obama's request to aid Pakistan by 58 per cent as resentment and doubts linger on Capitol Hill, a year after bin Laden was killed deep inside Pakistan. Tensions between Washington and Islamabad have increased as Pakistan closed overland supply routes to Afghanistan after a U.S. attack on the Pakistani side of the border killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in November. Dr Afridi helped the CIA by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the DNA of Bin Laden’s children from the family compound in Abbottabad. Tense: The moment President Obama and his team watched the mission to find and kill Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House on May 1, 2011 . Sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by U.S. Navy SEALS last May. It sparked a major rift between the US and Pakistani leaders who were embarrassed that Bin Laden had been living in a major military hub close to the capital. A furious Pakistan felt the covert operation was a violation of its sovereignty and implied the US was unable to trust its key partner in the war on terror. Dr Afridi was arrested shortly after the bin Laden raid, for conspiring against the state of Pakistan, his house was sealed and all assets frozen. A commission recommended a charge of conspiracy against Pakistan and high treason. U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta confirmed in January that Dr Afridi collected DNA in an effort to help locate Bin Laden but added he 'was not in any way treasonous towards Pakistan. For them to take this kind of action against somebody who was helping to go after terrorism is a real mistake.' Dr Afridi had no right to  legal representation, to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses. He must also pay a $3,600 fine or serve a further three-and-a-half years in jail. U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton has called for his release.

"A teacher has been instructed by her school to lose her northern accent and sound ‘more southern’. The woman, who works at a secondary school in West Berkshire, was told to focus on ‘sounding less Cumbrian’ as one of her official performance targets by her bosses. The order apparently came after an Ofsted inspector made a comment about her accent. 'Bizarre': The woman, who works at an unidentified secondary school in Berkshire, has been told 'sounding less Cumbrian' is now one of her official targets, after a comment made by an Ofsted inspector (file picture) It is unclear whether the comment was simply an off-the-cuff remark or an official observation.

"A heartbroken husband queued for 44 hours to buy the new iPhone 6 in a bid to win back his wife after she kicked him out - because of his obsession with gadgets. Darius Wlodarski, 41, started queuing outside the Apple store in Cabot Circus, Bristol at midday on Wednesday to make sure he would definitely be able to get one of the handsets. His wife Joanna called an end to the 20 year marriage after she accused him of valuing material possessions over his family. Scroll down for video . Darius Wlodarski queued for 44 hours outside the Apple store in Bristol to buy the new iPhone 6 for his wife . But Mr Wlodarski, who was born in Poland but now lives in Swindon, Wiltshire, decided to make the peace and spend £800 on a new iPhone for her – despite being out of work. He was determined to keep a promise he made to her before their marriage hit the rocks and paid for the device on a credit card. Mr Wlodarski has admitted the break-up was his fault: ‘I wasn’t the best husband and father unfortunately. I didn’t know how important family was to me. ‘I did so many things wrong and I want to say sorry to my wife and daughter that I wasn’t as good as I could.’ He split from his wife of 20 years Joanna last month and admitted he 'wasn't the best husband and father' To make up for his mistakes Mr Wlodarski made sure he was the first person in the queue, arriving a whole day before anyone else. ‘Lots of people in the queue were very happy but it was different for me because of the circumstances. ‘It took me a while to realise what really mattered - and that is my family. ‘My wife said to me I should remember that it is now “things” that matter, that I was worrying too much about saving for things, and she was right. ‘I know an iPhone is another ""thing"", but I told her I would get her one and I wanted to keep my promise.’ She wanted new iPhone and he was determined to get her one as a gift and was the first person to join the queue outside the Bristol store, where he was welcomed by staff yesterday (pictured) Mr Wlodarski met his 41-year-old wife on the doorstep of a house party in their native Poland more than 20 years ago and he said it was ‘love at first sight’. It took him three years to convince her to go on a date with him, but after a year together they got married in February 1995. They moved to England ten years ago with their daughter Daria, 14, but they split up a month ago. ‘I got the new iPhone for her because she wanted it. The first iPhone I bought for her, she was so happy, I was telling her for a year that she would be happy but she didn’t believe me and eventually when she got it she was happy,’ he said. ‘Now she wants the bigger screen so I got her the bigger one.’ Mr Wlodarski (left) doesn't expect the new iPhone (right) will win her back but hopes it will make her happy . He added: ‘I want to say that “maybe one day you will realise that I could be…good again and maybe you’ll trust me again”, I don’t know. Sorry. ‘I just wanted to make sure that I get what she wanted. 44 hours in total – I was the first, nobody was here for another day but I did it to make sure that I got what she wanted.’ Mr Wlodarski does not expect that the gift will win her back but hopes it will bring her happiness. The iPhone 6 went on sale across the world yesterday and thousands of eager Apple fans who camped out overnight finally got their hands on the new handsets. Hundreds of people queued for hours outside the Apple store in Covent Garden in London on Friday . These people were the first to enter the Eaton Centre Apple store in Toronto and get the new handset . Children drink bottles of water as they wait for the Apple store in Singapore to open and get the new device .

"John Redwood, who produced the figures, says cutting the rate further would produce another surge in revenue helping to ease the deficit . The amount of tax paid by the best-off has soared since George Osborne slashed the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, according to a new analysis. New figures from HM Revenue & Customs show the total income tax collected on earnings over £150,000 has shot up from £40 billion last year to £49 billion this year. Former Conservative Cabinet minister John Redwood, who produced the figures, said it appeared the Chancellor’s tax cut was having dramatic results in what would be a ‘shock to many of the conventional pundits’ who criticised the measure. He said the boost in income tax take suggested the Chancellor should go further, and make the 45p rate ‘more competitive’. ‘Total income tax collected from people earning more than £150,000 has surged from £40bn to £49bn this year compared to last. 'It has more than made up for the loss of tax revenue from lower earners following the big increase in tax thresholds,’ Mr Redwood said. He said the 50p rate introduced by Labour in its final weeks in power was clearly ‘costly’. Britain lost high earners overseas, and saw the richest use tax loopholes to declare less income when the rate was high. ‘The rareified group of people earning more than £2m declared income of £12.2bn in 2012-13, but paid tax on £26bn of income the following year with the lower rate. ‘This small group of people alone more than paid for the rise in threshold to take many lower earners out of tax altogether. ‘The top one per cent of earners now earn 13 per cent of the income but pay 28 per cent of the total income tax. The top five per cent earn one quarter of the income but pay around half the total income tax. ‘This progressive structure works as long as the government does not get too greedy, setting a higher rate which means the rich pay less because they either go or they earn and declare less. ‘I wonder how much more revenue the Treasury would enjoy if the top rate were set at a more competitive rate? 'I suspect that too would see a further surge in revenue, money the state clearly needs to end the deficit.’ George Osborne cut the 50p top rate of tax to 45p in his 2012 budget, saying it raised 'next to nothing' A Tory spokesman said: ‘The Government is clear that in clearing up Labour’s economic mess those with broadest shoulders should bear the biggest burden.’ David Cameron will today hail the Government’s tax changes taking effect this week as the most radical for two decades. On Tuesday, corporation tax came down to 21 per cent, the tax-free annual investment allowance for businesses was doubled, business rates were capped at two per cent and fuel duty was frozen. From Sunday, over one million businesses will benefit from up to £2,000 ‘cashback’ on their National Insurance contributions. The Prime Minister is to visit three businesses who are announcing a combined total of nearly 10,000 new jobs, including Accenture, which is taking on 500 new employees; Birmingham Airport, which is extending its runway leading to 4,000 jobs in the airport and an additional 4,000 jobs in the supply chain; and Vodafone is taking on an extra 1,400 staff. Mr Cameron said: ‘A key part of our long-term economic plan is to create jobs and to cut taxes. So I am delighted that in the week where we are cutting tax for 26 million hard-working people – and now taking three million out of tax altogether – I can announce nearly 10,000 more jobs which will give people financial security for the future.’ The personal income tax allowance will be raised this weekend from £9,440 to £10,000, cutting tax for the typical basic rate taxpayer by £705 this year.","Labour increased top rate to 50p before general election .

"Richard Harman will lambast the hypocrisy of critics who ‘lecture’ top fee-paying schools even though they benefited from a private education themselves or chose one for their children . Scroll down for video . Private schools are under attack from the ‘politics of envy’ and ‘class war dinosaurs’, a leading headmaster warns today. Richard Harman will lambast the hypocrisy of critics who ‘lecture’ top fee-paying schools even though they benefited from a private education themselves or chose one for their children. In a keynote speech, he will claim that private schools are being made ‘scapegoats’ for society’s problems instead of recognised for the ‘general good’ they do. He will argue that many of those in power are ‘embarrassed’ to be seen talking to independent school heads, preferring to threaten them with more state control or the loss of their historic charitable status. Mr Harman, head of £32,850-a-year Uppingham School and chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, representing 260 top private schools, will use his speech today to respond to attacks on private education. It follows claims from Ofsted head Sir Michael Wilshaw that private schools are ‘bastions of privilege’ which should do more to justify their charitable status and tax breaks. Addressing HMC’s annual conference in South Wales, Mr Harman will tell critics: ‘It is time to stop scapegoating and start celebrating our schools and their contribution. Stop using them as lazy shorthand for the social ills of our country.’ He will say that making school type ‘a proxy for advantage’ does little apart from stirring up ‘the politics of envy’. Referring to the fact that many of those in power were privately educated, he will say: ‘Don’t lecture us... especially when many of you who do so, have yourselves benefited from or use the service we provide. Hypocrisy is out of tune with the times.’ Around 7 per cent of the UK population is privately educated but in Westminster this figure is much higher. A 2010 study showed 54 per cent of Tory MPs went to a fee paying school, as well as 40 per cent of Lib Dems and 15 per cent of Labour MPs. Independent schools have ‘centuries of expertise to offer’, Mr Harman will say but ‘too often those in power are embarrassed to be seen talking with us, preferring instead to threaten us with the loss of charitable status or more state control. ‘Contrary to what some dinosaurs from the class war era would have you believe, we are not a drain on national resources; we add significant value to UK plc.’ Mr Harman will also point out that private schools are now more ethnically diverse than state schools and have forged many links with the state sector. ‘When it comes to social mobility we are part of the solution, not the root of the problem,’ he will say. n Mixed-sex schools are the best way for children to be taught, according to Sir Michael Wilshaw. He said that a mixed-school setting is far more ‘congenial’ and prepares children for work: ‘Girls and boys mix socially in the workplace. They should be educated together too.’","Uppingham Head Richard Harman will defend private schools today .

"Parents and independent schools should stop being ‘sniffy’ about vocational qualifications and assuming university is the automatic route after A-levels, a leading headteacher has said. Hilary French, the headmistress of Central Newcastle High School, said employers were increasingly demanding skills that were of genuine use in the work place. The cost of taking a degree and the introduction of low-cost online higher education courses added to the need to consider ‘alternative avenues’. The comments will surprise many parents who can spend tens of thousands a year sending their children to private schools in the hope they will go on to win a place at a top university. Different route: Parents and teachers should not assume that university is the best route after A-levels, a leading headteacher has said (library image) But Mrs French, the president of the Girls’ Schools Association, told delegates at the organisation’s annual conference: ‘I predict that we’re going to see the focus shift away from university as the automatic first choice next step for those who are in the fortunate position of being able to weigh up the pros and cons of alternative pathways after sixth form and a move instead to employment skills and training while working.’ She added: ‘Increasingly, we - teachers, parents and girls - will need to be open-minded about what further and higher education looks like. ‘I believe and hope that the link between schools and employers will strengthen over the coming years and that there will be an increasing focus on developing employment skills. Hands on: Hilary French said that independent schools must embrace alternative routes to employment - such as apprenticeships (library image) ‘I’d like to challenge independent schools heads to embrace these alternative avenues. Parents too. ‘There is a huge potential in employer training courses and the new types of apprenticeships which are emerging. We must not be sniffy about them.’ The number of higher apprenticeships - designed for people with good A-level or equivalent qualifications - has soared, going up 147 per cent between 2009 and 2012. At the same time the proportion of school leavers entering higher education has gone up, to a record 49 per cent in 2011-2012. Business Secretary Vince Cable last week criticised the ‘qualification inflation’ that meant degrees had become a minimum entry requirement in many jobs, including nursing and accountancy. The government was trying to persuade professional associations to ‘relax their qualifications’, he said. Mrs French also used her speech in Newcastle-upon-Tyne yesterday to attack successive governments’ obsession with curriculum and exam reforms in state schools, saying they were not the way to bring about social change. Schools were being turned into ‘exam factories’, she warned, leaving children ‘dehumanised’. ‘Soft skills’ such as resilience, leadership, integrity, compassion and adaptability also needed to be taught, as well as the ability to ‘filter ideas’ as children are now ‘bombarded’ with so much information and data. Outspoken: Business Secretary Vince Cable, pictured, criticised the 'qualification inflation' that meant degrees had become an entry requirement to many jobs . In a further attack on the maintained system, she said healthy pursuits such as outdoor play, school allotments and taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme were seen as ‘extra-curricular’ activities that had become ‘largely the preserve of independent schools’. ‘Many students graduate without any integrated sense of the unity of things,’ Mrs French said. ‘Independent schools, however, have the advantage of being just that - independent - and have always been good at educating what they call “the whole person”.’","Hilary French, headmistress of .

"A Tory MP criticised the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary yesterday after he announced new green energy projects that will lead to higher bills. Ed Davey said the five new offshore wind farms and three wood-burning plants would supply 2million homes, create 8,500 jobs and attract £12billion of private investment. But he was accused of exploiting the crisis in Ukraine, which he said highlighted the need to develop home-grown power, as a ‘cover’ for expensive projects. The government announced eight new renewable energy projects,m including four offshore wind sites (file picture) Investors get a guaranteed price for . the electricity they produce – around double the wholesale cost – some . of which is added on to consumer electricity bills. Mr . Davey said the average bill increase would be £11 a year by 2020 – a 2 . per cent rise – but insisted green energy would make power more . affordable in the long term. However, . the Renewable Energy Foundation think-tank and a source at one of the . major electricity suppliers calculated the rise in bills from these . projects would be around £20. Britain . sources less than 1 per cent of its gas directly from Russia but, at . peak times, gas of Russian origin is imported from countries such as . Germany. Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted prices would be higher without investment in green projects . It comes to Europe via a pipeline through Ukraine. The eight projects, which will power more than three million homes by producing 4.5GW of electricity, are: . Mr Davey has accused Russia of ‘holding the West to ransom’ by threatening to increase its gas prices, and warned that Britain has to produce its own supply. Peter Lilley, a . Tory member of the Energy and Climate Change Committee, suggested the . comments provided ‘a bit of collateral cover’ for putting up prices. The former trade minister said the rise was unacceptable for a single round of new contracts. He . said: ‘If you just add 2 per cent to bills, and the next batch adds 2 . per cent, and so on, it soon adds up to what Labour might call a . cost-of-living crisis. ‘Clearly . Europe as whole needs to become less dependent on Russian gas, but we . need more of our own capacity, which will bring down costs. The way to . do this is perhaps to go ahead with fracking.’ In . an embarrassment for the Energy Secretary, the Drax power station in . North Yorkshire, where one of the new projects is based, has announced . plans to sue his department. Only . one of the two plants that it anticipated would be converted from coal . to wood-chip was announced, and the firm’s shares fell by 13 per cent. A . spokesman said it would make a legal challenge. Energy . tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Even in the face of price hikes, shrewd consumers can take advantage of . this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to . ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will . save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If you are one of the millions of . people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original . supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly . as much as £300 a year. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live.

"A man on trial in Canada for an alleged plot to derail a passenger train wanted to trigger a catastrophic natural disaster by blowing up Yellowstone Park, his trial heard. Tunisian student Chiheb Esseghaier spoke of the 'death and destruction' an eruption of the massive supervolcano beneath the national park would cause in the US, the court heard. 'Wouldn't it be great if my enemies' worst national disaster could happen?' an undercover FBI agent reported Essaghaier, 30, as saying, according to the The Canadian Press. Suspects: Chiheb Esseghaier, left, allegedly plotted to cause a global catastrophe by triggering an eruption of the Yellowstone Park supervolcano. He is on trial with Raed Jaser, right, for an alleged plot to derail a train . Dastardly plan: An eruption from Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park. The park's geysers are heated by a massive reservoir of magma that the Canadian terror suspect allegedly plotted to blow up . Yellowstone Park, which straddles Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, sits atop a swelling reservoir of magma 55 miles across and 30 miles wide. In parts it reaches depths of nine miles. It is this subterranean lake of molten rock that heats the park's famous geysers, but it has also been the cause of eruptions in the past that were so massive it has been dubbed a supervolcano. Experts are divided on the impact an eruption of the supervolcano may have, but most say one would be catastrophic for the entire world. In his third week of testimony, the undercover FBI agent said Essaghaier was 'very passionate' about the idea of triggering the Yellowstone volcano. But in the end the doctoral student at the Université du Québec is said to have decided the idea was hopeless. 'No. We cannot do anything to make the volcano erupt. It's very deep. I don't have any access,' Essaghaier is alleged to have told the agent. The court also heard that Essaghaier and his co-accused, Palestinian national Raed Jaser, considered a plot to poison soldiers and another to kill world leaders with a sniper rifle. Studies have suggested that previous eruptions of Yellowstone Park's supervolcano, which has lain dormant for 70,000 years, were a thousand times more powerful than the one in Mount St Helens in 1980. When the super volcano last erupted about 640,000 years ago a cloud of ash covered the whole of North America and affected the global climate with an effect similar to a nuclear winter. If it were to explode today, some say, the Yellowstone volcano would cover cities as far as 1,000 miles away with a layer of ash up to 10ft deep, killing all wildlife and making as much as two thirds of the U.S. uninhabitable. A thermal pool at Yellowstone: An undercover FBI agent told a court Chiheb Essaghaier was 'very passionate' about the idea of triggering the Yellowstone volcano, but eventually realised the plan was futile . However last year a study by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) poured cold water on the apocalyptic vision, concluding that such a scenario would not come to pass. USGS said computer modelling suggested that cities up to 300 miles from the park would be covered by up to three feet of ash and cities further afield in the Midwest would be covered by a few inches. Coastal cities such as New York and California would get only a fraction of an inch, USGS claimed. However, the study did say that an eruption would shut down electronic communication and air travel throughout the country, as well as cause a year-long winter. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Pacific produced an ash cloud tens of miles across caused 'a year without a summer' across the globe with snowfall in the North Eastern United States in June. Areas covered in feet of ash would see buildings at risk of collapse and sewer and water lines blocked, and winds would form large dunes of ash that would cover roads and buildings. Farming in the Midwest would be devastated by the cloud of ash, and highways across the country would become slippy and treacherous. There have been claims that a super-eruption will occur every 700,000 years at Yellowstone, making the next one imminent. But critics say this prediction is based on only three known eruptions: 2.1 million years ago, 1.3 million years ago and 640,000 years ago. The last volcanic activity at Yellowstone was a lava flow in its south about 70,000 years ago. Jaser and Essaghaier deny the charges against them. The trial continues.","FBI agent says Chiheb Esseghaier told him of the dastardly eruption plan .

"Breastfeeding can halve the risk of children being obese by the age of eight, a study says. The risk of children being overweight is also cut by around 15 per cent in those breastfed for six months, compared with those fed formula milk. Only a small number of women in the UK breastfeed for long periods, with less than two per cent of babies being breastfed exclusively for six months. Benefits: The risk of children being overweight is cut by around 15 per cent in those breastfed . A new study from Japan says breastfeeding should be encouraged 'even in developed countries' because of the long-term impact on weight gain among children. Previous research shows breast milk protects babies against stomach bugs, chest infections, asthma, and allergies, and confers health advantages in later life, with some studies suggesting a small cut in the risk of obesity. But only a small number of women in the UK breastfeed their babies for long periods and the number of new mums starting in 2011 fell slightly to 73.9 per cent. Less than two per cent of babies are breastfed exclusively for six months. Researchers carried out a study involving 43,000 Japanese children where they had information about their feeding during infancy around 2001. They measured for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity at 7 and 8 years of age defined by using international cut-off points of body mass index by sex and age. Around 20 per cent of children in the study were exclusively breastfed for six months. The study found exclusive breastfeeding for the first six or seven months of life compared with formula feeding led to a reduced risk of overweight and obesity among school children. Encouragement: Researchers say women should breastfeed for longer, even though it is less fashionable than it once was . At the age of seven, breastfed children were 15 per cent less likely to be overweight and 45 per cent less at risk of obesity. The reduction in risk of becoming overweight was similar at the age of eight, but the chances of being obese were even lower with a cut in risk of 55 per cent. The study took account of factors affecting children such as sex, television viewing time, and computer game playing time and maternal factors including educational attainment, smoking status, and working status. The study led by Michiyo Yamakawa, of the Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama City, was published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. Dr Yamakawa said 'Breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk of overweight and obesity among school children in Japan. 'Therefore, it would be better to encourage breastfeeding even in developed countries.' Breastfeeding is known to be associated with slower weight gain which appears to establish healthier eating patterns - while it is thought infant formula increases the production of fat cells, fuelling weight gain throughout childhood. Latest figures for England show one in 10 children was obese when they started school in 2011. The proportion doubled to almost 20 per cent among children going to senior school at the ages of 10 and 11 in the same year. Later problems: Breastfeeding can ease difficulties with overweight children . Overall Clare Byam Cook, former nurse and midwife and independent breast feeding counsellor, said mothers who can breastfeed their babies easily are giving them a great start in life. She said 'But most women who give up find it too difficult to continue. 'They are not unaware of the benefits to the baby, they have been brainwashed into thinking if they don't their baby will miss out and it can be a very worrying time. 'But many find it too difficult to continue and they don't get long-term support.' The UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe, with almost one in four new mothers never attempting to breastfeed compared with two per cent in Sweden. By four months old, 75 per cent of babies in Britain drink formula rather than breast milk.","Exclusive breastfeeding for first .

"The former 'First Bloke' of Australia Tim Mathieson has hit out at Margie Abbott, claiming she isn't doing enough charity work. Julia Gillard's partner claims that Tony Abbott's wife, who manages a child-care centre part time and regularly attends community events, isn't properly fulfilling her duties as a Prime Minister's spouse. 'What is she doing? Because I did 60 charity events. She has not contributed to any of them,' Mr Mathieson told the Sunday Herald Sun. Julia Gillard's partner Tim Mathieson claims Prime Minister Tony Abbot's wife Margie isn't doing enough for charity . While in the role of 'First Bloke' he travelled extensively with Ms Gillard to attend functions and charity events. 'The spouse of every prime minister since [Edmund] Barton has done charity work,' he claimed. A spokeswoman from the Prime Minister's office responded to the claims, saying Mrs Abbott has been involved in a whole host of charity, community, health and education events. 'This community involvement has been part of her life as she has worked part-time at a local Sydney childcare centre and, along with Tony, raised their three daughters,' the spokeswoman said. A spokesperson for Mrs Abbott, pictured here with Krystal Barter at the launch of her book, said she participates in many community events . She also said the Prime Minister's wife has been a long supporter of many causes including Girl Guides and Royal Blind Society, and that those close to Mrs Abbott know she doesn't make a fuss of the work she does. Mr Mathieson supports many organisations himself as a patron for the Australia Men's Sheds Association, an ambassador for Kidney Health Australia, while also being involved with mental health group beyondblue and an indigenous diabetes association. He also took on the role as one of the former government's Men's Health Ambassadors, though did get himself into hot water over a joke he made to the West Indies cricket team while talking about prostate cancer.

"Top English students reach university believing Charles Dickens is ‘just as old’ as William Shakespeare, an academic has warned. Even those with three As at A-level including English can’t put books in historical context, according to Professor Helen Fulton, head of English and related literature at the University of York. They fear being stretched, stick to easy works studied in sixth form and choose short or computer-based texts over those with plot, character and clear narrative structure, she said. Top English students do not know that William Shakespeare, left, and Charles Dickens, right, were born 250 years apart, according to Professor Helen Fulton of York University . Professor Fulton spoke out at a . Westminster Education Forum seminar, where critics described the . Coalition’s new English curriculum as ‘impoverished’ and based on ‘dead . white males’. The Government has scrapped a list of . suggested authors at Key Stages Three (ages 11 to 14) and Four (14 to . 16). At Key Stage Four, pupils must study two Shakespeare plays; . Romantic poetry; a 19th-century novel; First World War poetry; British . fiction, poetry or drama since 1918 and world literature written in . English. The Government says they should ‘read . for understanding’, for example ‘distinguishing between main and . subsidiary themes and summarising texts’. Professor Fulton said the change ‘seems to emphasise skills rather than knowledge’. She said: ‘I would have thought it should be the other way round at Key Stage Four. Professor Fulton criticised the curriculum saying it emphasises 'skills rather than knowledge' ‘By then, you would expect the skills to be there and you want to start broadening knowledge. ‘Many come [here] thinking Dickens is . as old as Shakespeare because they’re all in the past. Getting a sense . of chronology is something we have to work at.’ Professor Fulton said her department was ‘very high performing’, with eight applicants for every place. Professor Helen Fulton was speaking at a Westminster Education Forum seminar . The medieval literature expert added . she relies on ‘good A-level preparation’, and while ‘by and large, we’re . not disappointed’, some students are slow to try unusual texts from . different periods offered at university. She said: ‘We have some worries about . the tendency towards a retreat from difficulty, for example students . feeling slightly reluctant to be stretched...because they’re afraid they . won’t be able to write on something they’re not familiar with.’ Some students believe it takes too . long to learn and is ‘much  easier to dash something off on  a . Shakespeare play they’ve  already studied for A-level’, she said. She . added: ‘We’re also  very aware of the impending death of narrative. ‘Students are consuming texts that are . not narratives in the classic realist sense of having a beginning, a . middle and end and a bit of plot development and character development. ‘They’re consuming short texts, video games, computer-based texts. ‘Again, that’s something we’re trying to manage. I’m sure it’s the same in A-level classes.’ Professor Fulton said students should know modern works, such as the Booker prize winners. Dr Simon Gibbons, chairman of the . National Association for the Teaching of English, told the seminar the . new secondary curriculum is too limited and old-fashioned. He called the Government’s plan a . ‘pretty impoverished version of what English is’, with a narrow range . drawn from a canon of ‘dead white males’.","Professor Helen Fulton said students cannot put works in historical context .

"The word 'jolly' has long been a byword word for 'plump' - hijacked by experts in the back handed compliment. But scientists believe there could be genetic evidence which explains why fat people are often happier than their skinny friends. It comes after Strictly favourite Lisa Riley has been flying the flag for larger women insisting she is a 'big, happy girl', more than . comfortable with her size. Scientists have linked the 'fat gene' with the 'happy gene'. Strictly star Lisa Riley has recently said she is a 'big, really happy girl who is lucky enough to be confident in her own skin' The breakthrough could be an explanation for why obese characters, such as The Laughing Policeman and Father Christmas, are often portrayed as jovial and kindly . Scientists from McMaster University in Canada found the so called 'fat gene' FTO is also a 'happy gene' too. FTO is the major genetic contributor to obesity. But it is also associated with an eight per cent reduction in the risk of depression. The gene in question is FTO, which may also lower the risk of depression by eight per cent . Researchers at McMaster University in Canada had been investigating whether there was a link between obesity and depression. But when they investigated the genetic and psychiatric status of . patients enrolled in the EpiDREAM study, led by the Population Health . Research Institute, they found the opposite was true. The study analysed 17,200 DNA samples from participants . in 21 countries. Results showed those with the the previously identified FTO gene - the fat gene -showed significantly less signs of depression. The study finding was confirmed by analysing the genetic status of patients in three additional international studies. Professor David Meyre, of McMaster University in Canada, said: 'We set out to follow a different path, starting from the hypothesis that both depression and obesity deal with brain activity. 'We hypothesised that obesity genes may be linked to depression. 'The difference of eight per cent is modest and it won't make a big difference in the day-to-day care of patients. 'But, we have discovered a novel molecular basis for depression. 'It is the first evidence that an FTO obesity gene is associated with protection against major depression, independent of its effect on body mass index.' In a recent interview Strictly favourite Lisa Riley said she was more than comfortable with her size. She said she is ‘a big, really happy girl who is lucky enough to be confident in her own skin’, and added: 'Many would give their left arm to be thinner.

"A Spanish ebola victim’s pet dog was put down last night over fears it could transmit the disease, prompting outrage from animal lovers who chanted ‘murderers’ outside the woman’s home. Fury erupted after a government health spokesman confirmed that Teresa Romero Ramos’s dog, Excalibur, had been destroyed. The official explained: ‘Unfortunately we had no other choice.’ The animal was put to sleep inside Mrs Romero Ramos’s home, which was disinfected before the animal’s body was taken away in a white van to a nearby incinerator.

Demonstrators who mounted a vigil outside to try to stop the move shouted ‘murderers’ and several threw themselves on the ground as the vehicle left. Some 300,000 people had already signed a petition urging authorities to spare Excalibur. Twitter was awash with photographs of dogs, cats and birds which were posted alongside the hashtag ‘SalvemosAExcalibur’ – Spanish for ‘Let’s save Excalibur’. Mrs Romero Ramos, 44, from Galicia in north-west Spain, who is one of the medical team that treated two repatriated Spanish priests who died from ebola, has been in quarantine since it was confirmed she was carrying the virus.

Nobody ever told me to my face, “Teresa you’ve got ebola”.’ She went on to say that she had been given only 20 minutes’ training in how to put on and take off her protective suit. Javier Limon Romero (pictured with Excalibur) had called for the dog to be saved and even tried to get ownership of his beloved bed temporarily passed over to a friend and veterinary nurse while he is in quarantine .

"This monster pumpkin could smash the UK record after growing to the weight of a small car. Farmer Mark Baggs has spent countless hours nurturing the giant squash after planting it in a 500ft polytunnel six months ago. He estimates it currently weighs 1,500lbs, the same as a Smart Car, but he hopes it will break the UK record of 1,504lbs - or 107 stone. This giant pumpkin could break the UK record after it has grown to be the same weight as a small car. Pictured is Jack Baggs, four, and his sister Ellie-Mae, two, sat on the pumpkin . The pumpkin boasts a 15ft circumference and its roots span the entire length of the polytunnel. It is so heavy it has to be lifted onto a trailer using a forklift truck. But there is some way to go until Mr Baggs, from Wareham, Dorset, smashes the world record - a pumpkin grown in the US last year weighed in at 2,009lbs. The father-of-two will find out if his pumpkin has broken the UK record at a ‘weigh off’ at a pumpkin festival in Southampton tomorrow. If it is declared the UK’s heaviest he will scoop a £1,000 reward from sponsors Thompson and Morgan. But he is up against rival growers Ian and Stuart Paton from Lymington, Hampshire, who set the current British record in 2010. The pumpkin is so heavy it has to be lifted onto a trailer using a forklift truck . In 2007 Mr Baggs grew the world’s biggest marrow, which weighed in at 9st 10lbs. The 30-year-old said: 'I think the pumpkin has done so well because it’s been grown from a good genetic seed. 'It’s been a nice summer after a very . cold spring. The real test will be seeing how dense it is and whether . there are any holes in the bottom which could ruin my chances. 'I won’t know exactly how much it weighs until I get it on the scales but I have a weight estimation table that indicates it’s around 1,500lbs. 'I’ve been growing these things since 2005 and you really have to know what you’re doing. 'They only grow for one season, so you only get one shot at the record each year.' Pumpkins belong to the squash family and are thought to have originated in North America between 7,000 and 5500 BC. Their name originates from the word ‘pepon’, Greek for ‘large melon’.","Farmer Mark Baggs estimates pumpkin weighs the same as a Smart Car .

"A sunken vessel in the Java Sea has been confirmed as the wreck of the USS Houston, a cruiser sunk by the Japanese during a ferocious Second World War battle. It serves as the final resting place for about 700 sailors and Marines. The wreck has long been a popular recreational diving site, but has been confirmed by US and Indonesian Navy divers as being the remains of the Houston, nicknamed The Galloping Ghost Of The Java Coast. Scroll down for video . Wreck identified: U.S and Indonesian Navy divers have confirmed that a sunken vessel in the Java Sea is the crusier USS Houston (pictured), destroyed by the Japanese in 1942 . The wreck has been popular with recreational divers for a while - but it was only recently that the wreck was confirmed as that of USS Houston . The Houston's commanding officer, Captain Albert H Rooks, posthumously received the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism . The ship carried 1,068 crewmen, of which only 291 survived both the attack and being prisoners of war . The Japanese sank the Houston during the Battle of Sunda Strait on February 28, 1942. The ship carried 1,068 crewmen, but only 291 sailors and Marines survived both the attack and being prisoners of war. The Houston's commanding officer, Captain Albert H Rooks, posthumously received the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism. Firepower: President Franklin Roosevelt under the big guns of the USS Houston in 1938 . Poignant: Navy officials pass a wreath to sailors from the Mobile Diving Salvage Unit, who studied the wreck of the Houston . Far from home: The wreck of the USS Houston lies in the Java Sea . USS Houston was launched in 1929 and in the Second World War was one of the U.S Navy's most powerful ships. Classed as a heavy cruiser, she was deployed to the Java Sea in 1942 to engage a formidable Japanese force, along with ships from the British, Australian and Dutch navies. In the Battle of Java Sea in 1942 Houston and 14 allied ships took the fight to 17 Japanese war ships. At the time it was the biggest sea battle since the Battle of Jutland in the First World War. Five allied ships were lost and the Houston retreated to Banten Bay. Its only means of escape was through the Sunda Strait - and that was blocked by several Japanese destroyers. She was hit by several torpedoes, with Japanese ships also raking the decks with machine gun fire. The original crew comprised 1,061 men and of those 368 survived. U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Harry Harris said on Monday that divers have documented evidence the watery gravesite has been disturbed. Assessments conducted in June to determine the condition of the Houston found that hull rivets, a metal plate and unexploded ordnance were removed from the ship. There is also oil actively seeping from the hull. Officials are working on measures to keep the site from further disturbance. 'In my discussions with our Indonesian navy partners, they share our sense of obligation to protect this and other gravesites,' Harris said in a statement. 'Surveying the site, of course was only the first step in partnering to respect those sailors who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the freedoms and security that we richly enjoy today.' The Navy History and Heritage Command concluded that all of the recorded data is consistent with the identification of the former USS Houston. Resting off the west coast of Java, Indonesia, the ship remains sovereign property of the United States. The Navy estimates there are more than 17,000 sunken ships and aircraft resting on the ocean floor worldwide.

"Exam standards have dropped because boards are competing to offer the easiest papers, a damning year-long inquiry has found. An influential committee of MPs concluded that the current system allows boards to 'strip out' content from GCSEs and A-levels so they can boast to schools that their exams are 'more accessible'. The public has been forced to endure years of denials that grade inflation exists even though they can see it 'with their own eyes', they said. Testing times: Exam standards have dropped because boards are competing to offer the easiest papers, a damning year-long inquiry has found . The verdict is a vindication for Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has demanded curbs on competition between exam boards to stamp out grade inflation. At present, up to six boards set exams in each subject and schools choose which one they wish to use. In an attempt to tackle a culture of 'competitive dumbing-down', Mr Gove is proposing to allow only one board to design an exam in each subject. The Commons education select committee today backed the thrust of the reforms but suggested instead devising a single national syllabus for each subject and allowing boards to set question papers against it. This would remove incentives to dumb down courses and 'race to the bottom' while still allowing the benefits of competition, it was claimed.Committee chairman Graham Stuart said a system of single national syllabuses would prevent exam boards 'making out their syllabus is more accessible than someone else's'. in the firing line.jpg . He added: 'It would get rid of the perverse incentive to strip out content from a syllabus, to strip out the richness of learning from a course in order to make the course supposedly more accessible, in truth to make it easier.' He highlighted embarrassing undercover filming last year which showed a senior geography examiner for the Edexcel board telling a reporter, posing as a teacher, that 'you don't have to teach a lot' and there was 'a lot less' for pupils to learn than with rival exam boards. Steph Warren admitted she did not know 'how we got it through' the official regulation system that is supposed to ensure high standards. Mr Stuart said: 'We conclude that competition between exam boards creates significant pressure to drive down standards in exams, and that the time is right for fundamental reform. 'We have got to stop the dumbing down of the courses young people sit and stop exam boards competing on how accessible their syllabuses are. 'There has been grade inflation. There has been a denial it's going on while the public can see with their own eyes that it's happening. 'If you have people denying obvious truths they see in their own lives they will lose confidence in those who are vouching for that system.' Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that Mr Gove was planning to scrap dumbed-down GCSEs and bring back rigorous O-levels. Leaked documents showed he has drawn up a blueprint which would tear up the current exam system as well as abolishing the National Curriculum. Evidence: The news is a vindication for Education Secretary Michael Gove . Michael Gove warned  yesterday that hundreds of thousands of teenagers were being steered  towards dubious vocational courses 'which do not  benefit them'. The Education Secretary spoke out as he unveiled funding reforms aimed at spelling the end of pointless courses and getting many more 16-year-olds to train to be plumbers, chefs and electricians. The overhaul of school and college funding for 16 to 19-year-olds is expected to lead to the decline of courses such as the Certificate in Introduction to Cabin Crew, nicknamed the course in becoming a 'trolley dolly'. The City and Guilds course, which is taken by around 2,300 a year, involves 150 hours of teaching, but it  does not 'require or prove occupational competence' and fails to meet airline requirements. Schools and colleges will also be encouraged to offer 'substantial' vocational qualifications, which are recognised by employers. These might include a City and Guilds Diploma in Professional Cooking, which takes two years and includes plenty of practical work or a BTEC in Children's Care, Learning and Development, which also combines theory with practical training. The Department for Education reported that the number of pupils taking courses in construction trades had halved in a year, between 2008/09 and 2009/10. Yet a third of vacancies for tradesmen such as plumbers and electricians had been attributed to shortages of workers with these skills. The shake-up follows a devastating review of vocational qualifications by Professor Alison Wolf, of King's College London, which condemned many as 'dead-end'. Mr Gove said: 'Around 1.6million 16 to 19-year-olds are in education each year, but as Professor Wolf stated in her review, as many as 350,000 are on courses which do not benefit them. Reform is vital.' The Education Secretary is not withdrawing the lesser-quality courses but he is removing cash incentives for schools and colleges to offer them. This could lead to the institutions withdrawing the courses.In addition, for the first time, teenagers who fail to achieve a C in GCSE English and maths will be required to continue studying the subjects until the age of 18. The move is designed to answer concerns from employers who complain that school-leavers too often lack mastery of basic skills.","MP committee finds current system strips out content from GCSEs and A-levels .

"Andrew Davies, head of the high-flying Beechen Cliff secondary school in Bath, asked parents to make monthly donations . A high-flying state school head who wrote to parents asking them to make voluntary contributions of up to £30 a month has said sorry after being accused of pressurising struggling families. Andrew Davies said opportunities at Beechen Cliff School in Bath were similar to some private schools charging fees of up to £10,000 a year, but said the school's efforts to improve were hampered by a lack of government funds. So he asked all parents to make voluntary contributions of £10, £20 or £30 a month, by standing order, which he said was not 'a great sum to contribute towards a child’s education'. The head, who has been in the post since 2005, then had to apologise after parents said they already paid for the boys' school through taxes and criticised him for  'undermining the state school system'. The school has been running a voluntary contribution scheme for 10 years and already receives around £20,000 a year as a result from some parents of the 830 boys at the school, but Mr Davies' letter was an attempt to encourage more to take part. Mr Davies has since apologised for the ‘unhelpful’ wording of the letter, which he sent earlier this month. In it, he wrote: 'Independent school fees are normally over £10,000 a year per pupil. 'At Beechen Cliff education is free but, if parents are willing to give a fraction of that money, we could achieve so much more. 'We are asking all families for a voluntary contribution of £30, £20 or £10 per month to the new top-up scheme. 'We believe that this isn’t a great sum to contribute towards a child’s education. 'Of course we appreciate that some parents do not have the resources to contribute.  Thankfully there are some generous parents who are already contributing significantly. 'If you are already supporting then we are of course most grateful, but please review your contribution.' Beechen Cliff boys' school is judged Ofsted 'outstanding' and already receives £20,000 a year in donations . Mr Davies succeeded the former head, Roy Ludlow, at the 830-boy secondary school in 2005 . His suggestion was criticised by mother Jane Middleton, whose son attends Beechen Cliff, judged 'outstanding' by Ofsted. Writing on a parents' online forum, she accused the school of 'attempting to blur the lines' between state and independent schools and of 'putting pressure on parents'. In her post on Local Schools Network, Mrs Middleton added: 'It introduces the idea of parents contributing financially to state schools on a regular basis with the aim of it becoming the norm. 'This undermines our state school system.  It is putting financial and moral pressure on parents at a time when many are struggling. 'It ignores the fact that we already pay for state schooling through our taxes. Mr Davies wrote a second letter to parents apologising for using 'unhelpful' wording in his letter to them . 'His - and our - time would be better spent campaigning for increased state funding than supporting schemes that erode the principle of free education and lead to greater inequality.' Mr Davies claimed that voluntary contribution schemes were widely used by schools in Bath, and said that pupils were not asked to pay for after-school clubs unless external coaches were involved. 'We have an incredible range of activities and we try to make sure that no one is disadvantaged by the lack of money,' he added. Last month parents of children at Prince Henry's Grammar School in Otley complained after the school proposed that they would pay for each Key Stage 3 pupil to buy an iPad at a cost to parents of £360 over three years. The school said the scheme would boost pupil attainment levels but parents questioned the merits of the scheme and the cost. State schools asking parents for voluntary contributions for the benefit of school or school activities is increasingly common. Some schools ask for donations in the form of monthly standing orders, as at Beechen Cliff, while others appeal for parental help when they need to fund a . specific purchase, for example a new sports pitch. The Department for Education guidance says there is nothing in schools legislation to prevent a school governing body or local authority from asking for voluntary contributions. However schools may not ask parents to set up a direct debit, and parents must not be made to feel pressurised into paying. The guidance also states that if the activity the funds are being raised for cannot be funded without voluntary contributions, the governing body or head teacher should make this clear to parents at the outset. The governing body or head teacher must also make it clear to parents that there is no obligation to make any contribution.","Head of Beechen Cliff school in Bath wrote to all parents asking for money .

"A full-time Loch Ness monster hunter who's spent nearly quarter of a century looking for the elusive beast says it showed up on the one day he didn't have his camera on him. Steve Feltham, 51, left his job fitting security cameras and his home in Dorset to move to the banks of Loch Ness in Inverness-shire and devote his time to searching for the legendary monster in 1991. After two years of patiently scanning the loch, Mr Feltham says he finally caught a glimpse of Nessie, as the monster is known... but he didn't have his camera to hand. Since then, he has kept a careful watch on the waters of the loch, but she has not shown herself again. Steve Feltham, 51, says he's seen the Loch Ness Monster once in 23 years - but didn't have his camera on him . Elusive sight: This picture, taken by Dr Kenneth Wilson in 1934, is said to show the Loch Ness Monster . Mr Feltham says a childhood holiday to Loch Ness started his fascination with spotting the legendary monster . Mr Feltham, who said he became obsessed with the legend of Nessie after a family holiday to the Highlands when he was seven, said he spotted the monster in 1993. He said: 'I was sitting on the shore near the Fort Augustus end of the loch when something went past the bay, through the water. 'It was like a torpedo shot and it had some weight behind it, hitting through the waves. 'Nothing in Loch Ness could create a disturbance like that, apart from Nessie.  I just sat there in amazement. 'It was the moment I had always been waiting for, and I am kicking myself for not taking a photo.  Since then, I have been by the loch with my camera poised every day, come rain or shine. 'Gutted is an understatement - I won't let an opportunity like that pass me by again.' Mr Feltham's fascination with the Loch Ness Monster dates back to a childhood holiday to the Scottish Highlands in 1970. He said: 'I remember standing on the banks of Loch Ness with my family and watching a big expedition of Nessie hunters set up a platform with a huge, metre-long camera. Home for the monster-hunter is a converted mobile library which is parked in a pub car park near the loch . Mr Feltham makes money by creating models of the Loch Ness Monster, right, and selling them to tourists . 'I remember being fascinated by the mystery of the monster, and I was hooked from there.' As a teenager, he would spent two weeks at a time camping in a tent on the shores of the loch, but by the time he was 27, the passion had become all-consuming, so Mr Feltham decided to leave his home in Wimborne and move to Scotland. He bought an old mobile library for £1,500, parked it in the car park of a pub called the Dores Inn, and has lived there ever since. A bachelor, he spends his days studying the waters of the loch and making models of the monster which he sells to tourists to fund his simple lifestyle.said: 'This is my passion and exactly what I want to do with my life.' Good spot: Mr Feltham sells his monster models from his converted mobile library on the shores of the loch . Mr Feltham, who is from Dorset, says he is happy leading a simple life beside the loch in Inverness-shire . The bachelor says he has kept his camera close at hand ever since the moment in 1991 when he saw Nessie . He insists he's not lonely, preferring his own company and quiet contemplation, and he hasn't given up hope of seeing the monster a second time. Mr Feltham said: 'I am hopeful I will see Nessie again, and I will be here ready with my camera every day until that day comes. 'I have been here for more than 20 years now, and this is my way of life.' He also dismissed suggestions that the monster might be nothing more than a myth, saying: 'The loch is such a huge and mysterious body of water, containing more fresh water than the lakes of England and Wales combined, so it is the perfect place for a unknown sea creature to dwell.' The legend of the Loch Ness Monster . has been around since the sixth century, when an Irish monk called Saint . Columba witnessed locals burying a man who had been attacked by a 'water . beast.' One of the first . famous sightings was in 1933, when George . Spicer and his wife claimed they saw 'a most extraordinary form of . animal' which was 4ft high and 25ft long crossing the road near the . loch. The following year, Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson took a picture, in main story above, which is now the most famous picture of the monster, although it was later revealed to be a hoax made with a toy from Woolworth's. Hunter Marmaduke Wetherell, centre, was said to have faked footprints which he said were the 'monster's' And in 1935, renowned big game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell found a footprint he said was the monster's.  It was later revealed to have been made by him using a dried hippo's foot of the type used as umbrella stands at the time. Despite many recording sightings over the years, most have been revealed to be hoaxes and scientists do not give credence to the suggestion that a monster lives in the loch.","Steve Feltham, 51, visited Loch Ness as a child and saw monster-hunters .

"Angry parents have launched a protest over a primary school's plans to make their children sing songs in Lithuanian and Polish. A third of pupils at the Peckover Primary School in Wisbech - a Cambridgeshire town popular with eastern European families - are from migrant backgrounds, but some parents claim their children came home in floods of tears because they did not understand the words to the songs. Children were being taught the lyrics for an upcoming international singing festival, but mother Clare Eve, 48, who has launched a petition in protest, said: 'The whole school is getting taken over by these cultures and I don't think it's right.' Anger: Parents including Clare Eve, left, and Tamara Meldrum, right, are protesting against their children being made to sing a song in Lithuanian at their primary school in Wisbech . 'Multi-cultural': A third of the students at the Peckover School, which is in a town popular with eastern Europeans, are from migrant families . A total of 23 parents have signed Ms Eve's petition protesting at the content of the 'inclusive' festival, due to take place next week at Peckover's new theatre. The parents backing the campaign insist their objections to the foreign lyrics are not racist, and say they have a right to complain if their children are upset. 'It's being forced on our children,' Ms Eve said. 'They're only eight-years-old - it's a struggle to learn their own language let alone goodness knows what else. 'When I saw the song list I could not believe it. My son brought the song list home when he wasn't supposed to,' she claimed. 'The school hadn't actually told anybody the true meaning of what the children were doing. 'Children don't know what they are singing about but if we complain we are accused of being racist, and yet this isn't the case,' said Ms Eve, who said she was 'all for' children learning languages. 'My little girl goes to German club,' she said. 'If your child is upset then surely you have the right for freedom of speech to voice your opinion. 'It's happening all the time - at Christmas a nearby infants' school had their nativity play in a foreign language. The parents said it was like being in another country. 'We don't want that here . 'I wouldn't have objected if all the Lithuanian kids had sung a Lithuanian song and all the Polish kids sung a Polish song. That would have been different,' said the 48-year-old, who has two children, Alfie, nine, and Libby, eight. Tamara Meldrum, who also has a . child at the primary school, said: 'They’re not even teaching them what it . means, at least that would make some sense, but as it stands the . children have no idea why they are being forced to do it.' Complaints: Tamara's son Adam Meldrum, seen left with his friend Alfie Wakefield, holds up a copy of the Lithuanian song lyrics . Peckover sent a letter home to parents inviting them to the festival, which will also see children don the national dress of countries including Germany and Greece, on July 15. The headteacher last week asked for parents’ support at the 'pioneering' International Singing Festival. 'Not right': Clare Eve said the school was being 'taken over' by other cultures . The letter read: 'We are all very excited to hold this event, which has been made possible by a grant from the Cambridge Culture Project Funding, for which we had managed to secure the funds. 'It will be a wonderful occasion, enabling the children to perform the songs that they have enjoyed learning and singing in English and other languages, representative of children at our school. 'We really hope you will support us in this pioneering event,' it said. Today the school said pupils had been taught the meaning of the Lithuanian song and that children would not be forced to take part if parents objected. A spokesperson said: 'The children have spent time learning the words and understanding what they mean with the help of our excellent teaching staff and language and music specialists. 'We have made sure that children understand what they are singing about and that they learn to appreciate other cultures. 'Children have been keen and enthusiastic to take part in this inclusive community event. 'We have made alternative arrangements for pupils of parents not wishing their child to take part in the concert to remain at Peckover Primary school, for the hour during which the concert takes place.' Inclusive: The primary school said the festival had been organised as part of teaching children to appreciate other cultures . Show Racism the Red Card, an anti-racism educational charity, backed the singing festival. A spokesman said: 'We believe that there is tremendous value in celebrating multiculturalism and diversity in schools. 'We accept that the Lithuanian language may present a challenge to some young people; however we are sure that the focus of the teachers is to encourage participation rather than linguistic accuracy.' English will be represented at the singing festival by the song Do Re Mi from The Sound of Music.","Pupils at a Wisbech primary school taught song for a singing festival .

"GCSE grades should be scrapped and replaced with points scores, according to the influential organisation that operates Cambridge University’s three exam boards. The current system needs to be replaced because it creates ‘arbitrary’ categories that conceal the true level of a pupil’s achievement, said Cambridge Assessment. Candidates can have quite different marks but end up with the same grade, while others with similar marks are awarded different grades. GCSE boards say the current system needs to be replaced because it creates 'arbitrary' categories that conceal the true level of a pupil¿s achievement . Schools also end up focusing on the grade C boundary to improve their standing in league tables.Cambridge Assessment, a research arm of the university which operates OCR, Cambridge . International Examinations and Cambridge English Language Assessment, said the system should be based on a numerical scale. It ruled out using a ‘narrow’ system based on a percentage in favour of a more accurate scale which ‘could range from 600 to 900 points’. ‘Grades are arbitrary categories imposed on an underlying continuum of achievement,’ said Tim Oates, director of assessment research and development. ‘Scale scores... could reduce some of the undesirable effects in schools of extra effort being concentrated on pupils around the grade C boundary. This would lead to better teaching and learning.’ Tim Oates, Cambridge University's director of assessment research and development . The Campaign for Real Education welcomed the proposal yesterday but had reservations about an ‘over-complex’ system that parents and employers would struggle to understand. Chairman Chris McGovern said: ‘Their instincts are correct but we need a simple score like a percentage that is precise but simple enough for everyone to understand.’ However, education expert Professor Alan Smithers, from the University of Buckingham, warned exact scores were meaningless as exams are not a precise form of measuring academic ability. He added: ‘The other reason [to keep grades] is everybody is used to As, Bs and Cs, so there is no real point in changing the currency unless there is a compelling reason to do so.’ The Cambridge Assessment proposal involves adding up marks from each paper in a GCSE subject and converting them into a points score. To understand the final score, examples could be provided of the types of questions pupils are able to answer, based on their performance. Alternatively, the scores could be compared to the grade system it had replaced, the report said. But Mr McGovern said: ‘If you try linking it with the previous exam you muddy the waters. ‘We need a clean break from the current GCSEs which are discredited because of grade inflation.’ A spokesman for exam regulator Ofqual said: ‘We will be consulting soon on proposals for the regulatory arrangements for the new GCSEs and this will include considerations of how they should be graded. ‘We welcome all contributions to the debates of these important aspects of the qualifications.’ A spokesman for the AQA exam board said: ‘This is an important debate. At a time of major changes to qualifications it is right that we consider how best to present the results of students’ hard work so that they can be understood and used in the wider world.’","Cambridge University's three exam boards are urging changes .

"A 19-year-old college student announced for the first time Thursday that she was an undocumented immigrant while addressing Hillary Clinton at an event in New York City. Nova Bajamonti was picked to ask the former Secretary of State a question at a 'No Ceilings' event at the Lower Eastside Girls Club on Thursday. 'For the first time publicly, I want to say that I am an undocumented immigrant,' Ms Bajamonti said before tearing up. Hiding no more: 19-year-old college student Nova Bajamonti came out Thursday as an undocumented immigrant at an event with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, moderated by actress America Ferrera . Her own glass ceiling: The 19-year-old says she moved to the country when she was just five years old from Split, Serbia and that her citizenship status has made it impossible to get a job or even a loan to attend her dream college. Pictured above in a photo posted on her Facebook . The unexpected announcement took many in the audience by surprise, but the brave teen was quickly showered in applause. She went on to explain that she moved to the United States when she was just 5 years old from Split, Serbia and that her status as an illegal immigrant keeps her from achieving many of her dreams. 'I don't have the documentation I need to get a job, to vote, which is essential to women's representation, to buy an apartment, to take out a loan to go to college, so I couldn't even go to my dream college because of that,' she said. According to her Facebook profile, Ms Bajamonti attends Brooklyn College. That's when she turned the conversation towards Clinton, asking her what can be done to help her situation. 'What do we need to do to put this in priority when it comes to Congress, because this is an extreme glass ceiling to me that I can't even control?' Ms Bajamonti asked. Fighter: linton commended Ms Bajamonti for her bravery in making the announcement and went on to say she would continue to fight for immigration reform .

Clinton's daughter Chelsea was at the event moderated by actress America Ferrera as well, and Bajamonti's announcement came just before Chelsea shared shocking news of her own: that she's pregnant. At the end of the event, Chelsea said that she and husband Marc are expecting their first child later this year. 'And I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in a world full of so many strong, young female leaders,' Chelsea said. 'So thank you for inspiring me and thank you for inspiring future generations.'","Brooklyn College student Nova Bajamonti announced that she was an illegal immigrant at an event in New York City today .

"Tony Little, the headmaster of the Eton College, claims the demise of grammar schools has reduced social mobility in Britain . The headmaster of Eton College claims the demise of grammar schools has reduced social mobility in Britain. Tony Little took over at the helm of the £32,000-a-year boarding school, attended by 20 former Prime Ministers and most male members of the Royal family, seven years ago. The son of a security guard and a secretary, Mr Little attended Eton College himself on a music scholarship and was 'the first male in my family to be educated over the age of 14.' But asked whether social mobility is 'flat-lining' or even reversing, as former minister Alan Milburn warned at the launch of a government report on the subject last year, he said: 'That is possible'. In an interview with the New Statesman magazine, he said he was 'personally not a fan' of the 11-plus examination which was which widespread until grammar schools were largely abolished in the 1970s. But Mr Little, 59, who used to teach at a grammar school that is now a fee-paying school in Brentwood in Essex before moving to Eton, added: 'But there is no doubt that the demise of the grammar schools has brought a reduction in social mobility.' Until the 1960s there were some 1,200 grammar schools in the UK, but most were axed in the 1970s and their number is now capped by law at 164. They educate some 160,000 pupils. They routinely top the GCSE and A-level league tables, and in recent years they have produced more than half the total number of A grade A-levels in difficult subjects such as maths and physics. On the dominance of Eton-educated men in the government including David Cameron, Boris Johnson, and several of the Prime Minister's closest advisors, he said: 'I think this is one of those moments in history that won't be repeated'. He said he was pleased the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and actors such as Homeland's Damian Lewis and Dominic West 'who have a rather different take on the world' were also alumni. 'That reflects the Eton I live in', he said. 'The exciting thing about being in a place like this is having bright, young, aspirational people who see the world in very different ways. 'I came from a background that was so alien to any kind of educational experience. My father was a security guy at Heathrow and my mother was a secretary at the local hospital. 'I came in on a scholarship. Not to be romantic about it, but that is a reason why I do the job: I feel an obligation to pay back.' Mr Little said when his aunt, from Newcastle, was told he had been offered a place at Cambridge University, 'she had heard of Eton, Oxford and all these places, but only by name, so when she heard I was going to Cambridge she assumed I had messed up so badly at Eton I had to be sent to one of the others.' He cautiously welcomed the government's education reforms which will create a wave of new free schools and academies. But Mr Little said there was a 'huge amount of reform, maybe too much', going on, but 'no joined up plan. He said: 'I think most of the people I work with can't see the big picture we are aiming for.' Mr Little attended Eton College in Berkshire himself on a music scholarship . Eton College takes 250 boys a year but he said a third of those who finished in the top 100 in the entrance examination were not offered places because they needed to show they could 'thrive in a boarding school environment.' He said: 'We are not just about academic results, and boys need something else they can bring to the party. I don't really mind what it is – playing the clarinet, football, jiu-jitsu, something that excites and enthuses the boy. From all my experience, if you have that, it translates into other areas and you create a kind of language that is positive.' Eton itself is sponsoring a free school – Holyport College – which will open next September, a non-selective boarding school seven miles from Eton in Berkshire, where many of the pupils aged 11 to 18 will come from local authority care or at risk groups.","Tony Little says it is possible  social mobility is 'flat-lining' or even reversing .

"The number of students starting university has slumped by around 30,000 following the imposition of £9,000-a-year tuition fees. The disclosure will fuel claims that the Coalition Government’s steep rise in maximum fees from £3,375 a year is deterring many youngsters from taking degree courses. The shortfall of 28,634 students on last year is also set to cost universities hundreds of millions of pounds in lost fees and force the closure of struggling courses. Slumped: The number of students starting undergraduate courses at university has fallen by 30,000 this year following the tuition fees hike . If overseas students from outside the European Union were stripped out of the data, the decline would be even sharper. Demand for UK university places from home undergraduates and students from the EU – many of whom faced a near-tripling in tuition fees – has plummeted by 50,000. Universities offset this to some extent by boosting their intake of students from outside the EU, whose fee levels are largely unchanged on last year. The Universities UK group said more institutions had attempted to attract students through the post A-level results ‘clearing’ service than ever before. ‘Although there was much anticipation and trepidation in the run up to clearing this year, it has proved a real success,’ it said. ‘More institutions have entered clearing than in any other year.’ Figures from the UCAS university admissions service, cited by UUK, show that the number of students accepted through clearing rose by around 2,500. Many elite universities used the system for the first time in years, partly due to an unexpected drop in the number of top grades at A-level this summer. Reports also emerged of lower-ranking universities enrolling teenagers onto courses with as little as two E grades at A-level, prompting claims that ill-prepared youngsters were being ‘set up to fail’. The UCAS figures also show that more than 187,000 candidates who made initial university applications ended up without places. Admissions tutors say that many of these students - who were officially eligible for clearing - simply never materialised. It is thought many fired off applications and only then began to fully understand the costs involved and failed to take the process forward. Of the 187,000, 16,000 formally withdrew their applications, giving an increase in withdrawals of nearly 1,800 on last year. Worth the cost? The decline in acceptances . prompted a leading headmaster to warn that British universities were . seeing a 'brain drain' to U.S. institutions . The data will prompt universities to carefully consider their fee levels for future years. Controversial Coalition reforms allowed them to raise maximum annual charges this year from £3,375 to £9,000, although no money has to be paid upfront. While headline fees for 2013/14 have already been decided, universities may be tempted to offer more generous bursaries or fee discounts. In its analysis, UUK, which represents the executive heads of the country’s universities, said the reasons for the decline in acceptances this year - which amounts to about 6 per cent of last year’s 486,917 crop of students - were ‘complex’. Researchers said the trend was partly driven by youngsters who applied for degree courses last year cancelling plans for gap years to avoid being liable for higher fees due to kick in this autumn. There had also been a fall in the population of 18-year-olds following a dip in the birth rate. But higher fees are still estimated to have put off an estimated 15,000 18-year-olds, and unknown numbers of older students. ‘UUK will continue to monitor closely how the picture evolves and the impact on institutions,’ it said. In the final few hours of UCAS vacancy listings yesterday, more than 20,000 courses across UK universities and colleges still had available places. These included several top universities such as York, Lancaster and Leicester. Some universities, mainly former polytechnics, still had vacancies on 200 or more courses. While the course vacancy search has now closed, would-be freshers still have until October 22 to contact universities directly if they wish to inquire about available places. The decline in acceptances prompted a leading headmaster to warn that British universities were seeing a worsening ‘brain drain’ to U.S. institutions. Dr Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College, said: ‘There is a real sense of dissatisfaction with UK universities: those of us in schools are very aware of that. ‘We are seeing the end of the inexorable rise in numbers going to universities in the UK. ‘A number of factors - financial, educational, cultural - have come together to persuade some of the great talents of this generation to seek their fortune in the U.S. ‘As numbers fall here all but the most selective UK universities will lower their offers as they seek to fill places. The consequences are predictable.’","Some desperate universities admitting candidates with two Es at A-level .

"David Cameron and the Foreign Secretary William Hague today vowed not to send any troops to Iraq - despite the country descending into bloody anarchy. Downing Street dismissed any notion of a military intervention. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: 'We have been clear that we won't be getting involved in putting boots on the ground militarily in this situation.' Foreign Secretary William Hague added: 'We are not planning a British military intervention.' David Cameron and William Hague today both insisted there would be no British military involvement in Iraq . The intervention came after the US President Barack Obama refused to rule out ordering a bombing campaign - but said: 'We will not be sending US troops back into combat in Iraq.' Mr Hague said Britain might help the wobbling Iraqi Government with counter-terrorism expertise. Speaking after talks on Iraq with US Secretary of State John Kerry in London, the Foreign Secretary added that a team from the Department for International Development was now on the ground in northern Iraq to see what humanitarian help the UK could give. Mr Hague said: 'We are looking urgently at ways to help - for example with counter-terrorism expertise. 'Work is under way on that now and we will continue to liaise closely with our United States allies in particular on that. 'We will also continue to work urgently within the UN Security Council to help concert the wider international response.' The Prime Minister meanwhile this morning held talks with the secretary general of Nato, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, about the crisis. Militants from the al Qaida-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant who earlier this week seized large areas of Iraq's Sunni heartland, including the cities of Mosul and Tikrit, have now captured two towns north-east of the capital Baghdad, local officials said. Mr Hague said that the situation was 'extremely serious, but added that, while fighting continues, 'attacks have thankfully slowed in recent hours'. He said that Britain had three priorities in Iraq: 'First of all to stabilise the situation. This is primarily the responsibility of the Iraqi security forces, working in co-operation with their civilian authorities, including the Kurdistan regional government. 'Secondly for Iraq's leaders to come together in a united response this brutal aggression against their country. That requires their leaders to find ways immediately to put aside their differences, however strongly felt, and act together against the terrorism which threatens them all. 'Third, the half a million or more displaced people in the north who have been forced to flee Mosul and the surrounding areas need urgent support so that the humanitarian situation does not deteriorate further.' President Barack Obama rejected the prospect of boots on the ground at a speech from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington today . His remarks came before President Obama ended speculation that the US could send troops back into the country to halt the jihadists' advance. He said he was considering a 'range of other options' - but not boots on the ground. The President said: 'We will not be sending US troops back into combat in Iraq, but I have asked my national security team to prepare a range of other options that could help support Iraq’s security forces and I will be reviewing those options in the days ahead. 'I do want to be clear, though: this is not solely, or even primarily, a military challenge. Over the past decade, American troops have made extraordinary sacrifices to give Iraqis an opportunity to claim their own future. 'Unfortunately Iraq’s leaders have been unable to overcome too often the mistrust and sectarian differences that have long been simmering there and that’s created vulnerabilities within the Iraqi government as well as their security forces. 'So any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability and account for the legitimate interests of all of Iraq’s communities and to continue to build the capacity of an effective security force. We can’t do it for them.'","Prime Minister says he will not order 'boots on the ground' in Iraq .

"Boasting a private tasting room, a cinema and an on-call personal trainer, this lavish London penthouse is more like a top hotel than a home - and it comes with a price tag to match. The lavish Marylebone apartment has gone on sale for £25 million and comes complete with a local in the shape of top celebrity hangout, the Chiltern Firehouse which sits next door. Part of a new development called The Chilterns, the four-bedroom property also has David Bailey artworks, a sauna and an in-house chef. This slice of uber luxury is the most expensive ever to come on sale in London's Marylebone . The £25 million property, which is being sold off-plan has a roof terrace, which at 2,519 sqft is the largest private terrace in the West End . Other perks include an on-site gym and a 24-hour hotel-style concierge which will take care of everything from travel arrangements and theatre tickets to dry cleaning and shopping. However, the property, which covers two floors and has a 2,519 square foot roof terrace, isn't yet complete and has to be bought off-plan. For those who can't afford the lavish price tag, the neighbouring penthouse - which offers similar perks - is currently on sale for a relatively modest £12.6m. Despite the hefty fee, top independent property expert, David Williams, says the apartment is likely to be purchased by a foreign buyer. The penthouses have been designed by top architect firm Squire & Partners and interior designer Rabih Hage . The lobby will contain photographs taken by David Bailey of nearby Regent’s Park . 'It's Chinese and Russians who have been fuelling London's top prime property market for the last few years,' he explains. Mr Williams also says the artworks are unlikely to impress potential buyers. 'I don’t think David Bailey’s favourite picture hanging on the wall is going to make a big difference to how much this will sell for,' he says. 'In my experience, if you've got £25million to spend, it's not by accident - you've done something smart to accrue it. 'So buyers will be looking at the capital growth of the property - but of course they'll want something fully serviced and well appointed.' The master bedroom suite, which is the same size as an average one-bed flat, has a bedroom with a living area opening onto two private terraces . The walk-in dressing room is lined with bespoke built in cupboards . Is it his or hers? The master suite has two ensuite bathrooms, both decked in marble . The penthouses have been designed by top architects Squire & Partners, while the chic interiors are the work of designer, Rabih Hage.

Folding glass walls open onto three private rooftop terraces - the first, a vast outside reception room and garden, the second, an outside dining room and the third, a sun deck for loungers. On the other floor is a large family kitchen and breakfast room, a sitting room with feature fireplace and a 16-seater formal dining room opening onto another private terrace. The 775 sqft private cinema can seat up to 10 people with an interior designed in the style of the luxurious Electric Cinema in Notting Hill . The development has a gym (gym reception pictured above), sauna, 24-hour hotel-style concierge (to take care of travel arrangements and theatre tickets to dry cleaning and shopping) and valet parking . The master bedroom, which at 200 square foot is the same size as the average one-bedroom flat, has a separate living area opening onto two private terraces, a walk-in dressing room lined with bespoke built-in cupboards and his and hers ensuite bathrooms. As well as three further bedroom suites, the duplex also features a studio flat with bedroom, kitchenette, living area and bathroom, which the agent suggests is suitable for staff - or teenagers. The two floors of the duplex are linked by a private glass lift  but there's also a staircase for those happy to make the hike. In all, there are 44 residences behind the contemporary seven-storey glass and stone façade. From the outside, the building also has a striking stepped roofline  and glass-fronted balconies. There may be a chef on site but that doesn't mean you'll have to do without a kitchen . The second of the penthouse's lounges looks over the dining room and has a cosy feel and stylish fireplace .

"When scuba diver Will Hood zipped up his wetsuit and secured his mask for a dive off the coast of Cornwall, he was perhaps hoping to see crabs scuttling on the sea bed. What the 6ft 3in teenager did not expect was to find himself overshadowed by a vast, white, barrel jellyfish with a violet fringe and lace-like trailing tendrils. Will’s father, Charles Hood, who took this photo of his son with the giant near St Michael’s Mount, Penzance, said they had seen an unprecedented number of jellyfish this summer. Scroll down for video . Will Hood, who stands at 6ft 3in tall, swims next to a giant barrel jellyfish off the coast of Cornwall . ‘We usually get perhaps a dozen sightings a year, but at the moment they are everywhere.’ It’s not the first time this year that barrel jellyfish have made the headlines. In May, wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella found a rubbery mound on a gravel beach in Portland, Dorset, while out for a walk. It became clear that the glistening, gelatinous mass, which measured about 20in across, was an extremely large barrel jellyfish or Rhizostoma Pulmo, one of the largest species to be found in British waters. Also known as ‘dustbin-lid jellyfish’ due to their size, the creatures can reach up to 35in in diameter and weigh up to 6st. Rarely do they stray close to land. However, Mr Trewhella says he has now counted five of the bizarre creatures — which are distinguished by their large size and thick, rubbery skin — on Portland’s beaches. So what has caused this astonishing rise in the number of barrel jellyfish in British waters? And have we anything to fear from this eerie, underwater invasion? Wildlife experts believe they have been brought close to shore by a combination of strong winds and rising sea temperatures. When the creatures appear in very large numbers it is known as a ‘jellyfish bloom’. This occurs when strong ocean currents force large numbers of them into swarms, carrying them in the same direction. These ‘blooms’ can include hundreds, or even thousands, of jellyfish. Barrel jellyfish, sometimes known as bin-lid jellyfish because of their size, can measure up to 35 inches in diameter and weigh up to six stone . Because they don’t have a central nervous system, jellyfish have limited control over their movements, meaning they are carried from place to place — and even stranded on beaches — by the movement of the currents. Scientists believe blooms like the one off the Cornish coast are becoming much more common. Though there are few records of past jellyfish populations, recent surveys suggest their numbers are increasing dramatically. One theory to explain this is that over-fishing has reduced the number of sea creatures, such as sardines and anchovies, competing for the same foods, mostly plankton. It has also meant there are fewer fish such as herring in the ocean, which feed on jellyfish eggs before they mature. So tenacious are jellyfish that some experts warn of an apocalyptic future when they will dominate the seas completely. Within 40 or 50 years, British marine biologist Professor Callum Roberts has theorised, other species will have died out and the oceans will be home only to slimy algae and jellyfish. Certainly, there seem to be a lot of them around Britain’s coastline. Suzanne Sheldon, 48, stumbled upon a three-foot barrel jellyfish when she was walking her dog on a beach in Dorset in May. Earlier that month, more than 50 barrel jellyfish washed up on a beach in Maenporth, Cornwall and a further 12 were glimpsed in Weymouth Harbour, Dorset. In December, it was claimed that jellyfish sightings in Ireland had reached their highest level in 25 years. And while the barrel jellyfish is harmless to humans, the same can’t be said of every specimen in British waters. Last August, several red and orange ‘Lion’s Mane’ jellyfish were spotted off the west coast of Scotland. With tentacles more than 100ft long, they are sea monsters. The largest on record, spotted in 1870, had 120ft tentacles and a diameter of 7ft. Their sting can cause severe blisters and muscle cramp and can be deadly to those with heart problems. This time last year, swimmers were warned to keep their wits about them after several Portuguese Man o’ War jellyfish were sighted in Cornwall. They deliver a severe sting by affixing their tentacles to human skin. Even after the sting has been pulled from the flesh, still more venom can be released if the skin is rubbed, causing large red welts, nausea, convulsions — or even, in rare instances, death. In 2012, Roland Singh, a 58-year-old grandfather, died after suffering severe anaphylactic shock when he was stung by a Portuguese Man o’ War near Cape Town. In the Philippines, up to 40 people die each year from jellyfish stings. Among the most venomous are the Pacific-dwelling box jellyfish, which have 24 eyes and grow to 10ft. Several Portuguese Man o' War jellyfish were spotted in waters Cornwall last year. Their tentacles can affix to human skin, delivering a severe sting which become worse if rubbed . The minuscule Irukandji jellyfish, on the other hand, rarely grow to a width of more than 25mm, but can still cause almost instant death by anaphylaxis — a severe constriction of the airways. Given their deadly powers, it’s little wonder that jellyfish inspire such fear and fascination. And few creatures boast such a colourful history. They have been drifting around the oceans, largely untouched by evolution, for at least 500 million years. Their name, which came into use in the 18th century, is deceptive. Jellyfish aren’t real ‘fish’. They have no vertebrae and no specialised digestive, respiratory or central nervous system. Instead, they absorb oxygen though their extremely thin skin. Nutrients are taken in through a stalk-like tube hanging down from the underside of their body, which has a mouth at its tip. Typically, they feed on plankton, crustaceans and fish eggs — though some species, such as the Lion’s Mane, are cannibals, feasting on other jellyfish. ‘They are really quite remarkable,’ says Dr Peter Richardson, director of the Marine Conservation Society’s biodiversity programme. ‘They are such a simple creature — but that’s one reason they are so successful.’ ‘And, unlike other creatures, jellyfish do quite well in water where oxygen levels are low, so they thrive even in severe pollution.’ While other sea animals have faded into extinction, jellyfish have thrived, and there are more than 3,000 species, range in size from 1mm to just under 7ft in diameter. But what does the current influx mean for beach-goers? In Europe, swarms have closed entire resorts, ruining holidays for thousands and putting local firms out of business. A horde even forced the shutdown of a nuclear power plant in Sweden last year after they clogged the cooling system, while fishing boats in Japan have been capsized by refrigerator-sized jellyfish caught in nets. If the jellyfish boom continues, coastal areas may find themselves forced to take extreme measures to repel gelatinous visitors. With this fear in mind, scientists in Korea have developed so-called ‘jellyfish terminator’ robots that can patrol the coastline. Irukandji jellyfish rarely grow larger than 25mm across, but can still kill thanks to anaphylaxis . The machines float along the surface of water and use on-board cameras to detect jellyfish. They then suck them up in nets and shred them into pieces. Thankfully, Dr Richardson says there’s no need for such a drastic response yet along the coasts of Britain. But, despite the barrel jelly’s harmless nature, he recommends keeping your distance if you see one. Unless you are very sure of its identification, it could be a more harmful species. For those who do get stung by a jellyfish, treatments vary according to the nature of the sting and which type of jellyfish is responsible. ‘The most important thing to remember is that when you are stung,’ says Dr Richardson, ‘the jellyfish usually leaves its tentacle on you, so you should wash the wound and add ice.’ Taking antihistamines, scraping the skin with a (not-too-sharp) knife edge and applying iced water to the injured area are just three methods used to soothe injuries. There’s no ‘miracle cure’ for a jellyfish sting. Urinating on the wound does not help — although it is widely believed that it does. But if you are stung by a box jellyfish overseas — or even a Lion’s Mane here in Britain — you must seek medical attention. While the jellyfish bloom might be bad news for swimmers, there are some people who are celebrating. ‘From a natural history point of view, it’s exciting,’ says photographer Steve Trewhella. ‘We should embrace the chance to get to look at them.’ Fine, but you first, Steve . . .","Barrel jellyfish spotted this week by diver off the coast of Cornwall .

Beauty spot: The area where the rave took place is part of the Peak District National Park . The 'witch is dead' event was organised through social media, with news of the event spreading through text messages. Large numbers of youngsters made their way to the outdoor music event from Buxton railway station. Police said they left a trail of destruction at the usually scenic spot. Police monitored the event, which began late on Saturday night and continued until Sunday lunchtime. But now local council officials have been left with a major clean-up operation. Vandalism: Police said around 2,000 people attended the rave. This picture shows some of the damage caused by the ravers . Frustrating: As well as damaging signs, the ravers also vandalised trees and rock surfaces . The area is part of the Peak District National Park. A national park spokesman said: 'We have so far collected 45 bin bags full of rubbish including cans, bottles and food wrappers. 'There was also graffiti on signs that had to be cleaned.' Popular: The event was organised through social media, with news spreading through text messages . Unpleasant: Nitrous Oxide canisters - also known as laughing gas - littered a car park following the rave . Mess: Thousands of ravers decended on the national beauty spot of the Goyt Valley in the Peak District. However, they left a trail of damage and more than 45 bin bags of litter . Saying goodbye: On Wednesday, more than 2,300 people from 170 countries attended the former Conservative prime minister's funeral . A spokesman for the organisers of the . rave, Gash Collective, said: 'We bagged up four vans worth of litter . and apologise for any that we missed. 'We have arranged for a team to continue cleaning up this weekend.' One party-goer wrote on Twitter: 'Thanks buxton for one of the best parties ever !! Sorry about the mess.' On Wednesday, more than 2,300 people from 170 countries attended the former Conservative prime minister's funeral . Hundreds of  thousands lined the streets of London to salute Baroness Thatcher as she made her final journey towards St Paul's Cathedral. Many threw white roses in the path of the gun carriage that carried her. Inside the packed cathedral, David Cameron said the Iron Lady's 'difficult decisions, led to less division, less strife at the end of it' Lady Thatcher's only granddaughter Amanda also delivered a reading after flying in from America with her brother. Chancellor George Osborne was seen sobbing as the service went on, while other high-profile figures were also moved.","Ravers left behind 45 bags full of rubbish .

"The thieves struck in broad daylight, seemingly undaunted by the fact that they were surrounded by dozens of members of the public. Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police announced that between 8am and 3pm last Thursday — peak visiting hours — a rare species of water lily, the nymphaea thermarum, had been stolen from the Princess of Wales Conservatory at London’s Kew Gardens. They believe the specimen of the smallest water lily in the world, with flowers smaller than a pound coin, was wrenched or dug up from its shallow pond before being smuggled out. The smallest waterlily in the world was stolen from Kew Gardens this week during peak visiting hours, Metropolitan Police have announced . The plant — discovered in south-west Rwanda not quite three decades ago by German botanist Professor Eberhard Fischer — is now extinct in the wild. There are only a few cultivated samples at Kew and in Germany. Kew’s specimen has been described as of ‘enormous scientific importance’. ‘It’s difficult to put a value on it,’ says Richard Barley, Kew’s director of horticulture. ‘They’re incredibly hard to cultivate and we have only a small number. It has been known in just one location in the wild.’ But if he is devastated, he isn’t surprised. ‘There are people who act this way. The trade in stolen plants is a global issue.’ Of course, plant cuttings have been taken surreptitiously by keen gardeners for centuries. Records from the Old Bailey in the 18th century refer to thieves ‘plucking up, digging up, breaking, spoiling and carrying away’ flowers, shrubs and trees. Indeed, Kew is no stranger to such crime; the Kew Gardens Constabulary was introduced in 1847. At first a small band of former soldiers who doubled as gardeners, these days there are eight constables dealing with everything from lost property to plant rustling. Officials at Kew say there have been cases of women spiriting away plants in their handbags. But last week’s incident was something different: there is every indication the water lily was the target of a pre-planned operation by an experienced professional. The rare, tiny flower that was originally found in Rwanda is now extinct in the wild . ‘To reach where it was growing . required several steps across a wet garden — it’s not just someone . taking advantage or being opportunistic,’ says Barley. ‘They had their . eye on that particular species.’ The . corner of the conservatory from which it was stolen is one of a few . areas not monitored by CCTV cameras — suggesting the thief may have . scouted out the crime scene. It may sound far-fetched, but organised plant theft is an increasingly common occurrence. In 2012, a clump of rare arum maculatum — known as lords-and-ladies or cuckoo-pint — was stolen from a beauty spot in Dovedale, Derbyshire. The stubby green plant with a flower resembling a lily is believed to have been taken by those seeking to profit from its rumoured medicinal benefits. Some practitioners of alternative medicine mistakenly believe it can cure cancer. In 2011, a rare 100-year-old filmy fern vanished from the National Trust-run Nymans estate near Haywards Heath, West Sussex. The estate is a designated Site of Scientific Interest — damaging such an area is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, punishable by a fine of up to £20,000. Horticulturalist Carlos Magdalena inspects the flower . And, in 2010, a lady’s slipper orchid growing on the Silverdale golf course in Lancashire was given police protection, including patrols and CCTV. The measures were taken to avoid a repeat of the 2004 incident that saw a lady’s slipper dug up and stolen from the course overnight.  Private collectors are prepared to pay up to £5,000 for a specimen. A new breed of plant thieves are targeting ordinary back gardens, too. According to one recent survey, more than a fifth of households have had a plant stolen from their garden. Exotic species, such as lilies, olive trees, bonsais and magnolia trees, are the most popular targets. So, just who are the criminals and how do they operate? One theory is that the crime is perpetrated by professional thieves stealing to order for wealthy private collectors. Anastasiya Timoshyna, of Traffic, a non-governmental organisation that monitors the black market in plants and wildlife, says: ‘We know there are very rich people who will pay up to £10,000 to get their hands on a rare orchid, cactus or lily.’ There is a thriving international black market for rare species, stretching across Europe to the Far East, where many rare plants are valued for medicinal benefits. Of the 799 illegal plant seizures reported by EU border police in 2012, 42 per cent were packaged as alternative remedies. Given the sums for which they can swap hands, it’s not surprising that criminal gangs, more accustomed to dealing in drugs or the proceeds of robberies, are turning their attention to plant rustling. Would-be thieves even advertise on the internet, offering to steal the rarest plants. Police officers in Scotland have expressed alarm at ‘work parties’ of illegal immigrants being used to steal sphagnum moss (used to line hanging baskets), primroses and snowdrops to sell to nurseries across Britain, with the proceeds being used to fund other criminal activity. The law on such matters is clear. It is an offence to uproot a wild plant without the permission of the landowner. In the case of rare species, it is also an offence to pick the plants or sell them. Where plants have been cultivated by a botanical garden, they are private property. Staff at Kew Gardens said the incident was not isolated, and that there have been other instances of theft in the past . The Metropolitan Police has a dedicated Wildlife Crime Unit and 178 countries have signed the CITES agreement pledging not to trade in stolen plants, but enforcing these laws is extremely difficult. Conviction rates for plant-related crime are extremely low. Such is the difficulty in tracing stolen plants that East Devon District Council recently took to attaching microchips to council-owned flowers. Back at Kew, they are stepping up security following the theft of the water lily and appealing to members of the public to be vigilant when visiting the gardens. Of course, the only way to ensure the safety of plants of such scientific importance would be to remove them from public view — something that Kew says it will have to consider if stocks dwindle. That would be a terrible shame. As Richard Barley puts it: ‘Putting plants under lock and key would take the joy out of visits here. And it would let the thieves win.’","The world's smallest waterlily was stolen from Kew Gardens last week .

"Many of the world's most important crop-producing countries will be fully saturated with pests by the middle of the century if current trends continue, a study has found. More than one-in-ten pest types can already be found in around half the countries that grow their host crops. And if this spread advances at its current rate, scientists fear that a significant proportion of global crop-producing countries will be overwhelmed by pests within the next 30 years. Research from the University of Exeter says a warming Earth is influencing the distribution of crop pests. The scientists claim that many crop-producing countries could be saturated by pests by 2050, posing  'a grave threat to global food security'. Pictured is the root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) on a tomato plant . The research from the University of Exeter was published in the journal Global Ecology and Biogeography. Experiments by British academics have found that GM insects could be used to wipe out fruit fly pests that damage crops such as oranges, peaches, apples and pears. Genetically modified versions of the Mediterranean fruit fly were created earlier this year using controversial technology developed by the UK bioscience company Oxitec. Millions of male GM flies have been created in the laboratory to include a gene which means that when they mate with wild females, any resulting female larvae die before reaching maturity. The resulting fall in the number of female fruit flies should, in theory, lead to a collapse in the total population which will mean less damage is caused to food crops. Oxitec has promoted the technology as an alternative to the use of harsh chemical pesticides to protect food crops and so boost yields and has held talks with UK government agencies to run trials in this country. It describes the patterns and trends in the spread of crop pests, using global databases to investigate the factors that influence the number of countries reached by pests and the number of pests in each country. Crop pests include fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, nematodes, viroids and oomycetes. 'If crop pests continue to spread at current rates, many of the world's biggest crop producing nations will be inundated by the middle of the century, posing a grave threat to global food security,' said Dr Dan Bebber of the Biosciences department at the University of Exeter. The study identifies the pests likely to be the most invasive in coming years, which includes three species of tropical root knot nematode whose larvae infect the roots of thousands of different plant species. Another, Blumeria graminis, is a fungus that causes powdery mildew on wheat and other cereals. And the Citrus tristeza virus (given its name meaning 'sadness' in Portuguese and Spanish by farmers in the 1930s) is also a threat, having reached 105 of 145 countries growing citrus by the year 2000. Fungi lead the worldwide invasion of crops and are the most widely dispersed group, despite having the narrowest range of hosts. Crop pests include fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, nematodes, viroids and oomycetes. This map shows the global distribution of the Citrus tristeza virus, compiled by the Plantwise Knowledge Bank based on published reports in scientific literature, which reached 105 of 145 countries growing citrus by the year 2000 . The study looked at the current distributions of 1,901 crop pests and pathogens and historical observations of a further 424 species. Significant use was made of historical CABI (Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International) records, which document crop pests and diseases around the world from 1822 to the present day. 'By unlocking the potential to understand the distribution of crop pests and diseases, we're moving one step closer to protecting our ability to feed a growing global population,' said Dr Timothy Holmes, Head of Technical Solutions at CABI's Plantwise Knowledge Bank. 'The hope is to turn data into positive action.' It supports the view of previous studies that climate change is likely to significantly affect pest pressure on agriculture, with the warming Earth having a clear influence on the distribution of crop pests. The authors also describe the global game of cat-and-mouse as crops are introduced to pest free regions and briefly thrive, before their pursuers catch up with them. Professor Sarah Gurr of Biosciences the University of Exeter added: 'New, virulent variants of pests are constantly evolving. 'Their emergence is favoured by increased pest population sizes and their rapid life-cycles, which force diversified selection and heralds the appearance of new aggressive genotypes. 'There is hope if robust plant protection strategies and biosecurity measures are implemented, particularly in the developing world where knowledge is scant. 'Whether such precautions can slow or stop this process remains to be seen.'","Research from the University of Exeter says a warming Earth is influencing the distribution of crop pests .

"Cervical cancer could be prevented by a commonly-used HIV drug, scientists say. The medicine has been shown to kill-off the human papilloma virus (HPV) that leads to cervical cancer. A husband and wife team from the University of Manchester treated women with lopinavir and found that it wiped out pre-cancerous cells in 90 per cent of trial participants with no side effects. Scroll down for video . A commonly-used HIV drug has been shown to kill-off the human papilloma virus (HPV) that leads to cervical cancer. HPV (pictured) is more than five times more prevalent in East Africa than the UK . Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name for a group of viruses that affect women's skin in their cervix, mouth and throat. Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the virus. HPV is often spread during sex. There are more than 100 different types of HPV, many of which are harmless. However, some types of HPV can disrupt the normal functioning of the cells of the cervix and can eventually trigger the onset of cancer. Two strains of the HPV virus called HPV 16 and HPV 18 are known to be responsible for 70 per cent of all cases of cervical cancer. These types of HPV infection have no symptoms, so many women will not realise they have the infection. Since 2008, a HPV vaccine has been routinely offered to girls between the ages of 12 and 13. Source: NHS Choices . The findings, which will be presented at two conferences later this month, have been welcomed by scientists who think that in the future, women could be prescribed a drug to use at home, instead of enduring a biopsy or surgery to investigate any cervical abnormalities. The trial took place at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) in Nairobi, Kenya. Ian and Lynne Hampson, from the University of Manchester, joined Dr Innocent Orora Maranga at KNH, to examine 40 women with low-grade and high-grade stage pre-cancerous disease of the cervix. The antiviral drug lopinavir is used orally to treat HIV but it was applied directly to the cervix as a pessary in the trial. The women were treated with one capsule of the antiviral drug twice a day for two weeks. Repeat cervical smears showed a marked improvement within one month of the treatment and after three months, there was a ‘definite response’. Out of 23 women initially diagnosed with high-grade disease, 19 returned to normal and overall there was a positive response in 91 per cent of patients. Photographic images of the cervix before and after treatment showed clear regression of the cervical lesions and no adverse reactions were reported. Current HPV vaccines (pictured) are aimed at preventing the disease rather than curing or treating symptoms. Other than surgery, as yet there is no effective treatment for the HPV infection, which is why the results of the trial have excited scientists . ‘For an early stage clinical trial the results have exceeded our expectations. We have seen women with high-grade disease revert to a normal healthy cervix within a comparatively short period of time,' Dr Ian Hampson said. ‘We are convinced that further optimisation of the dose and treatment period will improve the efficacy still further. ‘It is our hope that this treatment has the potential to revolutionise the management of this disease most particularly in developing nations such as Kenya.’ Cervical cancer is caused by infection with (HPV) and is more than five times more prevalent in East Africa than the UK. In many developing countries, HPV-related cervical cancer is still one of the most common women’s cancers accounting for approximately 290,000 deaths per year worldwide. The same virus also causes a significant proportion of cancers of the mouth and throat in both men and women and this disease is showing an large increase in developed countries, such as the UK, where it is now more than twice as common as cervical cancer. Dr Lynne Hampson said: ‘Current HPV Vaccines are prophylactics aimed at preventing the disease rather than curing or treating symptoms. ‘Other than surgery, as yet there is no effective treatment for either HPV infection or the pre-cancerous lesion it causes, which is why these results are so exciting. A husband and wife team from the University of Manchester treated women with HIV antiviral drug lopinavir (a molecular model is pictured) and found that it wiped out pre-cancerous cells in 90 per cent of trial participants with no side effects . ‘Further work is needed but it looks as though this might be a potential treatment to stop early stage cervical cancer caused by HPV.’ Vaccination programmes against HPV in the developed world are well underway but they are no use to women already infected with the virus. The current vaccines do not protect against all types of HPV and they are also expensive, which can limit their use in countries with low resources. The researchers believe their findings offer a potentially cheap and self-administered treatment that could eliminate early-stage HPV infections before they have developed into cancers. Approximately 300,000 women die from cervical cancer every year, which works out as 800 per day or one every two minutes. Around 40,000 British women are found to have abnormalities in the cervix every year and cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35 in the UK, with nearly 1,000 dying as a result of the disease every year. Dr Ian Hampson explained that the trial could not be carried out in the UK die to associated costs and ‘red tape’. ‘We have full ethical approval in Kenya and chose to conduct the trial there because of the extreme need for a self-applied treatment for early stage cervical cancer,’ he said.","HIV drug lopinavir has been shown to kill-off the human papilloma virus (HPV) that leads to cervical cancer .

"Some venerate it as the burial cloth of Christ. To others, the Turin Shroud is nothing more than a medieval hoax. Now, science has come down on the side of the believers. Researchers have dated a sample of the 14ft linen sheet to anything between 300BC to 400AD. Separated at birth: Split screen showing the likeness  between the Turin Shroud and a portrait by Leonardo da Vinci . They used forensic tests to compare . fibres from the shroud with a range of ancient fabric samples. And they . discovered that the material could have been made in Jesus’s lifetime. Their results contradict a landmark . 1988 study, spearheaded by the British Museum, which used carbon dating . to examine the cloth. It said the shroud, which has an . imprint of a bearded man with wounds consistent to being nailed to a . cross, was actually made in the Middle Ages – more than 1,000 years . after the Crucifixion. But scientists at Padua University believe the original results could have been skewed by centuries of water and fire damage. The shroud, which is one of . Catholicism’s most controversial relics, was once described by Pope John . Paul II as ‘an icon of suffering in every age’. The findings are in a new book called Il Mistero della Sindone (The Mystery of the Shroud) which is published on Good Friday. The . authors, Professor Giulio Fanti, an expert in mechanical and thermal . measurement at the University of Padua’s Engineering Faculty and . journalist Saverio Gaeta, examined fibres from the Shroud and compared . them to samples of cloth dating back to between 3000BC and up to the . modern era to contrast them and see if it is a Medieval forgery. Has Turin Shroud mystery been solved? 14ft-long linen cloth, pictured above left in 1934, bears the faint image of the front and back of a tall, long-haired, bearded man and appears to be stained by blood from wounds in his feet, wrists and sides that match those suffered by Christ at his Crucifixion . Key . to the findings are three new tests, two chemical ones and one . mechanical, the first two were carried out using infra-red light, and . the other using Raman spectroscopy - which measures radiation through . wavelengths and is commonly used in forensic science. The . results dated the fibres from the cloth to a period between 300BC to . 400AD, which covers the years of Christ's life. Debate has raged whether . the image is that of Christ or a fake from the Middle Ages. But what is . certain is that experts have never really been able to explain how the . image was made. Carbon 14 tests were conducted on the cloth in 1988 and these findings suggested it dated from between 1260 and 1390. However, . some scientists have since claimed that contamination over the ages . from water damage and fire, were not taken sufficiently into account and . could have distorted the results. Since . then, there have been several requests for fresh tests but Church . chiefs have always refused - and this is why Professor Fanti and his . team had to rely on fibres that were used in the 1988 tests. Before . he retired last month pope Emeritus Benedict XVI gave permission for . the Shroud to go on display as a 'last gift’ to the millions of . Catholics before he retired from public office. Thirteen years ago when he was plain cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Benedict wrote that the shroud was a ‘truly mysterious image, which no human artistry was capable of producing. In some inexplicable it appeared imprinted upon cloth...’ Italian state TV will broadcast footage of the Shroud but it is not thought that general public access will be allowed until 2025, the date of the next scheduled display. As part of the TV broadcast, a new app called Sindone 2.0 has been developed, showing a series of HD images of the shroud which highlight details of the cloth not visible to the naked eye. The linen cloth, believed by some to have wrapped the body of Jesus Christ, has captivated the imagination of historians, church chiefs, sceptics and Catholics for more than 500 years. There are no definite historical records concerning the shroud prior to the 14th century. Although there are numerous reports of Jesus' burial shroud, or an image of his head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the 14th century. But there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at Turin Cathedral. A burial cloth, which some historians maintain was the Shroud, was owned by the Byzantine emperors but disappeared during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed in the small town of Lirey around the years 1353 to 1357. It was in the possession of a French Knight, Geoffroi de Charny, who died at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. However the correspondence of this shroud with the shroud in Turin, and its very origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors, with claims of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart. Some contend that the Lirey shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer. The history of the shroud from the 15th century is well recorded. In 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of Chambéry, capital of the Savoy region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy ordered the cloth to be brought from Chambéry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since. The shroud has had many notorious admirers. It even obsessed Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who wanted to steal it so he could use it in a black magic ceremony. In May 2010, five years after he became Pope, Benedict authorised a public viewing of the Shroud - the first since 2000 and also 15 years ahead of its next scheduled public display.","Infra red tests dated the cloth to some time between 300BC and 400AD .

"The American photojournalist infected with Ebola has landed in the U.S. after returning on a specially-contained medical flight from Liberia. Ashoka Mukpo, a freelancer from Providence, Rhode Island, was working as a cameraman for NBC when he fell ill last Wednesday. He left Liberia around 5.30pm (ET) and stopped for a brief refueling in Bangor, Maine on Monday morning before continuing to Omaha, Nebraska. Mr Mukpo is the fifth American flown home to be treated for the deadly virus and the second patient taken to Nebraska Medical Center's Biocontainment Unit. Scroll down for video . Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance journalist from Rhode Island, was working as a cameraman for NBC in Liberia. His jet landed on Monday in Maine for refueling before continuing to Nebraska where he will be treated in a specialized bio-containment unit . A plane with a special medical unit carrying American Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo arrived in Bangor, Maine for refueling on Monday (pictured) before continuing on its journey to Omaha, Nebraska . The 33-year-old flew out on a jet equipped with an isolation pod that separates him from his caregivers during the flight. Mukpo's mother, father and English girlfriend Helen all planned to make the trip to Nebraska to support him. In an NBC interview aired  on Monday, Mr Mukpo's mother, Lady Diana Judith Mukpo, said she was heartened by the fact her son was about to receive excellent medical care. The cameraman's father, Dr Mitchell Levy, said his son had told him on the phone that he was just trying to get through each day before returning to the U.S. Dr Levy earlier told the Providence Journal: 'My heart sunk. He said, ''Dad pick up your phone. Answer the phone. I think I'm in trouble.''' He added: 'He still has the fever. But his spirits are very good, I have to say. I think he's continually sustained by the fact that he knows he's coming home.' When he arrives at the Nebraska hospital on Monday morning, a team of more than 40 medical staff members - include registered nurses, respiratory therapists, patient-care technicians - will be on hand to support his needs. Mr Mukpo's father Dr Mitchell Levy and his mother Lady Diana Judith Mukpo said their son's prognosis remains good and they were relieved he had returned to the U.S. Mr Mukpo is the fifth American with Ebola brought back to America for treatment in a specially-modified Gulfstream jet (pictured) Mr Mukpo took off in a specially-designed jet that includes 'an isopod' - a plastic enclosure with a filtration system - that allows safe transport of highly infectious patients. The hospital's biocontainment unit was created in 2005 specifically to handle illnesses like this, said Dr. Phil Smith, who oversees the unit. 'We are ready, willing and able to care for this patient,' Smith said. 'We consider it our duty to give these American citizens the best possible care we can.' Doctors at the isolation unit - the largest of four nationwide - would evaluate Mr Mukpo when he arrives before determining how to treat him. They said they will apply the lessons learned while treating American aid worker Dr Rick Sacra in September. Dr Sacra was successfully treated in the Nebraska unit and was allowed to return to his home in Massachusetts after three weeks, on September 25. 'Truly, focusing on symptom management is key with these patients,' Dr. Rosanna Morris said Friday. Mr Mukpo has been involved in securing workers' rights in the West African countries and was a former advocate for an NGO . Dr Sacra received an experimental Tekmira Pharmaceuticals drug called TKM-Ebola, as well as two blood transfusions from another American aid worker who recovered from Ebola at an Atlanta hospital. The transfusions are believed to help a patient fight off the virus because the survivor's blood carries antibodies for the disease. Dr Sacra also received supportive care, including IV fluids and aggressive electrolyte management. Mr Mukpo's family won't be allowed to embrace or touch but will communicate and see each other via camera. 'It will be the equivalent of Skype, to be honest. But that's OK. He'll know we're there. He'll see us on a monitor.' Levy has said that doctors are optimistic about his son's prognosis. Mukpo was hired last Tuesday to be the second cameraman in Liberia for NBC's chief medical editor and correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman. Speaking on NBC's Today show on Friday, Mr Mukpo's mother Diana, a British aristocrat, spoke of her concern for her son. 'I think the enormous anxiety that I have as a mother or that we share as parents is the delay between now and him leaving on Sunday,' she said. Dr Snyderman and her team also were returning to the U.S. and being placed in quarantine for 21 days 'in an abundance of caution,' NBC News President Deborah Turness said on Thursday. In a phone interview with Today on Friday, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles. She believes she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant.' Mukpo has been working in Liberia for three years for Vice News and other media outlets. Before the Ebola outbreak, he had been doing nonprofit development work in Liberia. In a phone interview with Today on Friday, NBC News' Dr Nancy Snyderman, right, said she had her team had been 'hyper-vigilant' after news that cameraman Mukpo, left, was diagnosed with Ebola .","Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman from Rhode Island, landed back in the US on Monday .

"The higher a country's chocolate consumption, the more Nobel laureates it spawns, new research suggests . Does eating chocolate make you clever? It seems that might well be the case after scientists in New York found the higher a country's chocolate consumption, the more Nobel laureates it spawns. The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is tongue-in-cheek, admits the lead author Dr. Franz Messerli. But nonetheless, the results did show a surprisingly powerful scientific correlation between the amount of chocolate consumed in each country and the number of Nobel laureates it produced, he wrote in the journal. The Swiss, naturally, take the lead, . with the Swedes and Danes following closely behind. The UK was above . average in the table (see below). Dr Messerli, a Swiss doctor now working at Columbia University in New York, told Reuters Health: ‘I started plotting this in a hotel room, because I had nothing else to do, and I could not believe my eyes. 'All the countries lined up neatly on a graph, with higher chocolate intake tied to more laureates.' It’s thought that eating chocolate might improve our ability to think as it is high in antioxidants known as flavonoids, which are also found in cocoa, green tea, red wine and some fruits. Studies have suggested that flavonoids may improve thinking and reduce the risk of dementia by increasing the blood flow to the brain. Dr Messerli wrote in the journal: ‘Since . chocolate consumption has been documented to improve cognitive . function, it seems most likely that in a dose-dependent way, chocolate . intake provides the abundant fertile ground needed for the sprouting of . Nobel laureates.’ The Swiss, naturally, take the lead, with the Swedes and Danes following closely behind. The UK was above average in the table . When it comes to chocolate, several . other researchers have suggested dark varieties might benefit the brain, the . heart and even help cut excess pounds. But to produce just one more laureate, the nation would have to up its cocoa intake by a whopping 275 million pounds a year, Dr Messerli added. He estimates that every citizen would have to eat 400 grams of chocolate a year to increase the number of Nobel laureates in a given country by one per million inhabitants, if the correlation holds true. And in the 'conflict of interest section' of his article, Dr Messerli does admit to daily chocolate consumption. Despite the tongue-in-cheek tone of the research, he added that he does believe chocolate has real health effects, although he warns people to stay away from the sweeter varieties and opt for dark.","US research suggests the higher a country's chocolate consumption, the more Nobel laureates it spawns .

"Monday started out jubilantly for father-and-son running team Dick and Rick Hoyt as they posed for pictures with a life-sized bronze statue unveiled to commemorate their 31st Boston Marathon. But, as for many runners, the happy day turned to terror at the 25-mile mark, and the inspirational pair were left confused, scared and unable to complete the race as they worried about loved ones who were waiting for them at the finish line. 'As we got closer, things didn't look right,' said Dick, 72, who has completed a total of 1,091 races while pushing his disabled son Rick, 51, in a special running chair. Scroll Down for Video . Brave: Dick Hoyt, foreground left, pushes his son Rick on the Boston Marathon course on Monday but the pair were unable to finish their 31st event . Dick told Today.com that police were swarming the final stretch of the prestigious route so he asked an officer what was going on. 'He told me two bombs had detonated at the finish line,' the father said. Those bombs, exploding around 12 seconds apart some 550 feet away from each other, claimed the lives of three spectators and injured 183, some gravely. 'That's when I got really worried. I knew my son and his wife and my two grandsons were waiting for us at the finish line,' Dick added. Thankfully, their family escaped injury. But the chaos left the concerned Holland, Massachusetts, man wondering how to get Rick back to their hotel. Happy moment: The pair started Monday posing with a statue honoring them near the start of the Boston Marathon . Runners continue to race towards the finishing line at Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts on the sidewalk . A police officer suggested they take a taxi but Rick's running chair is too big to fit in a cab. That's . when a a good Samaritan in a Jeep offered to give them a lift and, . according to Today.com, managed to navigate their way through the . blocked streets and frantic crowds to the entrance of the Sheraton. Once Dick had carried his son to their room the magnitude of what happened began to sink in, he said. 'The thing about the Boston Marathon is that it's always such a joyful day,' Dick told the website. 'Everybody's so happy and it's such a positive attitude. And then to have this happen?... 'What kind of a world are we living in nowadays?' Supporters of Team Hoyt have encouraged Dick and Rick, who has severe cerebral palsy and is unable to walk or talk, to run the final mile in the coming weeks, in commemoration of the bombing victims. Long time: The father and son team have competed in more than 1000 races since the 1970s . Dick could never stop running with his son when . Rick told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not . handicapped.' But Dick believes that might be too soon. 'This . isn't about us,' he said. 'If anything, we want to run the marathon . next year to honor those people who were killed or injured this year. ... We're hoping we can do that next year — we're getting old and all of . that — but that's my feeling about it. We're just praying for those . families right now.' One thing is for sure. Dick is not . going to let the tragedy prevent his family and friends supporting and . enjoying their beloved Boston Marathon in future. 'We just have to move forward,' he said. 'We can't let something like this stop us.' The . truly special bond between the heroic father and his courageous son was . honored with the statue after the inspirational pair finished 1,091 events, including . 252 triathlons, 70 marathons, 94 half marathons and 155 five-kilometer . races. Rick Hoyt (left) and his father Dick are preparing to compete in their 31st Boston Marathon - which will edge them closer to 1,100 endurance events as a father-son team . A life-size bronze statue of Dick and Rick Hoyt will be unveiled April 8 at 10:30 a.m. in front of the Center Elementary School, near the starting point of the Boston Marathon . Despite being unable to complete Monday's race, the father-and-son team still maintained their proud . record of never having finished last as thousands of other runners were also prevented from crossing the line. Rick was born with cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic, the result of oxygen deprivation at birth. At . his birth, doctors were blunt. 'They said, 'Forget Rick, put him away, . put him in an institution, he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of . his life,' said Dick told the Today Show earlier this month. 'Today . he's 51-years old and we still haven't figured out what kind of . vegetable he is - and guess what? That vegetable has been turned into a . bronze statue.' The . statue was unveiled outside Boston's Center Elementary School to honor . Team Hoyts' racing record, which began in the mid 70s. The statue by Texas artist Mike Tabor marks Dick and Rick Hoyt, who have competed in more than 1,000 races ¿ including 30 editions of the Boston Marathon . Never even thinking for a second to institutionalize their son, the Hoyt's decided to raise him like his two brothers. They took him camping, cross-country skiing and swimming at the beach and enrolled him into school - where he learned to spell words with his eyes - one at a time. He graduated from high school and also from Boston University and now lives on his own with personal care attendants. It was while at school he told his father he would like to participate in a five-mile charity run for a Lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident. 'Rick came home from that basketball game and he said, ""Dad, I have to do something for him. I want to let him know that life goes on even though he's paralyzed. I want to run in the race,"" said Dick Hoyt. Dick agreed to push his son in his wheelchair and they completed the run together. Later that night, Rick told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not handicapped.' Rick Hoyt graduated from Boston University and discovered his passion for racing along with his father while he was at school in the 1970s . That sparked the creation of Team Hoyt, an astonishing feat of love and courage that has seen the father and son compete in more than 1,000 races, including marathons, triathlons and Ironman competitions. During triathlons, Dick pulls his son in a boat from a cord attached to his waist during the swim, the pair ride a special two-seater bicycle for the bike section and Dick pushes Rick in a custom-made running chair for the final stage. The incredible pair set up the Hoyt Foundation in 1989, which aims to include disabled young Americans into daily life, especially through sports, in school and in the workplace. In 2009, they completed their 1,000th . race together at the Boston Marathon, which is why the event holds such a . special place in their hearts. The two had a special wheelchair . designed for them and Dick recalled how people didn't understand what . they were trying to do together. Heroes: Rick has cerebral palsy after being deprived of oxygen during his birth, but that has not stopped him taking part in more than 1,000 races . 'I used to get letters and phone . calls saying, 'What are you doing dragging your son to all these races? Are you just looking for glory for yourself?' Dick Hoyt recalled. 'What . they didn’t realize was that he was dragging me to all these races!' When . asked the one thing he would like to give his father, Rick said: 'The . thing I'd most like is for my dad to sit in the chair and I would push . him for once.' Both men now give talks across the U.S., as well as continuing to compete in events together in a bid to encourage other disabled young people to challenge themselves. They have been competing as a team for more than 30 years, and their website says they have no plans on retiring. Their schedule for 2013 includes 25 other races and for more information, visit www.teamhoyt.com .

"A keen artist, Prince Charles knows that a person can be portrayed in many different ways. So when he saw two less than flattering drawings of himself yesterday, he was able to see the funny side. The Prince was visiting an arts facility he set up 14 years ago which has been renamed the Royal Drawing School after being granted the title by the Queen. Prince Charles visited the arts facility in Shoreditch, East London, that he set up 14 years ago to reveal it has been renamed the Royal Drawing School after being granted permission for the prestigious title by the Queen . During his visit, Prince Charles was sketched by a number of artists before being shown the drawings (above) Claire Price, 24, a former student, and Josie Deighton, 23, in her first year at the school, quickly sketched the Prince as he viewed the drawings on display. Charles told them: 'Well, I've been mostly facing the wrong way for you.' Miss Price replied: 'Yes, we've got a lot of good ones from the back of your head. It's been the drawing school paparazzi.' The Prince went to look at Miss Price's picture but on catching a glimpse of it from behind her, said 'Oh, maybe I had better not.' Miss Price met Charles at Windsor Castle last year and at Dumfries House over the summer. When the Prince last met her, he chose some of her pictures to take with him. Miss Deighton said she was too nervous to show her drawing to the Prince because of his reaction to Miss Price's. She told him: 'Your expressions are entrenched into your face.' He went on to ask her where she had studied and she told him she completed an art degree in Birmingham. Prince Charles set up the Prince's Drawing School in London 14 years ago with artist Catherine Goodman . She added: 'He's very pleasant - he's very quick to smile. I noticed as well he has the art of giving a speech without having to learn it so he can look around at people.' The Prince also spoke to Lilias Buchanan, another alumnus. He has two of her paintings in his house and told her: 'They're lovely and I have got them framed, they're hanging up.' He told Miss Buchanan that he was planning a Physic Garden for behind Holyrood House in Edinburgh. He said: 'Do you know of anyone in Edinburgh that can help with that?' Miss Buchanan said the plan was to have something like the Chelsea Physic Garden in London. Charles set up the Prince's Drawing School 14 years ago with artist Catherine Goodman. It teaches more than 1,000 students each week in its studios around London. It is the first arts education institution to be permitted use of the prestigious title 'royal' since the Royal Ballet School in 1956. The Prince, who visited its main campus in Shoreditch, East London, to make the announcement, said: 'Drawing is one of the most direct ways of engaging with the world and, like music and dance, needs to be taught and practised throughout an artist's life.' 'I am determined that the Royal Drawing School will continue to grow as an educational resource open to all, regardless of background or circumstance.' The Prince paints and sketches whenever he has the time, but his passion lies with using watercolours . The Prince (pictured in 1998) has used watercolours since the 1970s when artist Edward Seago taught him . Addressing the audience, Charles said: 'It's lovely to see so many of you here this afternoon. Judging by the noise, I feel awkward about interrupting you and your jolly conversation.' He also spoke of the origin of the school and said: 'It was our hope that we could provide a space in which expert teachers could help our students to see the world through clarity and sensitivity whether that vision was ultimately expressed through painting, sculpture, illustration, drawing, animation or design.' The school is following in the footsteps of the Royal Academy, which took its name in 1768, the Royal College of Music in 1882, the Royal College of Art in 1896, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1920. Miss Goodman, artistic director of the school, said it was unique within Europe. She said: ''I feel very proud that we have come this far since we began in 2000, because I'm more and more persuaded of the need for a drawing school as a permanent part of the UK's educational resources,' she said. The Prince, a keen artist, said: 'Drawing is one of the most direct ways of engaging with the world' The Royal Drawing School (pictured) said the new title recognised its academic and artistic excellence . 'There isn't another one in Europe, and we are being sought out by students from all over the world.' The school - an independent educational charity - said the new title recognised its academic and artistic excellence and served to reinforce its position as a respected and integral part of the art education landscape. The Prince paints and sketches whenever he has the time, but his passion lies with using watercolours. He has used them since the 1970s when artist Edward Seago gave him a lesson. The Prince usually depicts landscapes - from the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire to the mountain resort of Klosters - taking his inspiration from nature.","Prince Charles sketched by artists during visit to Drawing School, London .

"Police have arrested three suspected members of Al Qaeda in Spain who had amassed enough explosives to blow up a bus. The trio - two of whom had practiced flying light aircraft - may have been plotting attacks in Spain or elsewhere in Europe according to Spain's interior minister. The three - a Russian, a Russian of Chechen descent, and a Turk, were arrested after being watched by Spanish authorities for 'some time'. In custody: Three unnamed suspected members of Al Qaeda, pictured, have been arrested in Spain . Police operation: Vehicles and personnel from the Spanish Police are seen outside an apartment at los Junquillos district in La Linea de la Concepcion, Cadiz, Southern Spain . Pictures of the suspects were released . by Spanish authorities but they were identified only by their initials: . C.Y. for the Turk and A.A.A. and M.A. for the other two. The mug shots showed three men who appeared to be in their 30s, two with crew cuts and one with hair down to his shoulders. The Turk was arrested in the southern city of La Linea bordering the British colony of Gibraltar, while the other two were picked up near the central city of Ciudad Real as they traveled toward a northern Spanish town near the border with France. Spanish Minister of Interior Jorge Fernandez Diaz, pictured, said enough explosives were found to blow up a bus . Enough explosive material was found in the house in La Linea where the Turk lived to blow up a bus,  Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said. He added that investigators found no indications that the three were targeting Gibraltar but added that 'there are clear indications they could have been planning an attack in Spain and/or another country'. He continued: 'This is one of the most important operations carried out against Al Qaeda' before calling one of those arrested as a 'very important member'. He said the operation involved close collaboration with intelligence services from 'Spain's allies' without identifying any of the countries. The arrests came as the Summer Olympics were being held in Britain under tight security against possible terrorist attacks, including military aircraft and ground-to-air missiles. Spanish authorities had been watching the suspects for 'some time' and the minister added the decision to arrest them was made after the Russian and the Russian of Chechen descent took a bus towards France. The two arrested in the bus were traveling from southern Cadiz to the northern town of Irun, possibly intending to cross into France, the minister said. The pair had been in Spain for about two months. Cadiz is near the large U.S. military base in Rota alongside the Mediterranean. 'Police moved to arrest them when it became known that they planned to leave Spain' he said. Fernandez Diaz did not disclose the suspects' names, but said two were suspected Al Qaeda operatives while the Turk was a facilitator. Lethal: Police found enough explosives to blow up a bus at the property in La Linea de la Concepcion, Cadiz, Southern Spain . Target: It is not known if the trio were attempting to target the Olympics in London . The minister described one operative as a key member of the terror network and said both operatives had practiced flying in light aircraft. One was also an expert in explosives and poisonous substances, said Fernandez Diaz. Spanish police have arrested dozens of Al Qaeda suspects since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, and more after the 2004 train bombings in Madrid. Most Islamic-based terror arrests in Spain over the last several years have been of lower-level players and people trying to recruit jihadists, but the detention of the Russians and the Turk was significant because of their apparent high level of training and capability, said Magnus Ranstorp, a terror expert at the Swedish National Defence College. On alert: Police have arrested dozens of Al Qaeda suspects following the Madrid train bombings captured in CCTV footage above . 'What jumps out is that they have had aircraft training,' he said. 'It's always a worry that someone could get a hold of a private plane and try to do a (terror) operation against an event,' Ranstorp said. But getting to Britain during the Olympics probably would have been a challenge for the three, even if they had not been under surveillance. Passport-free ground travel in much of the 27-nation European Union meant they could have gone to countries on the continent without facing document checks, but getting to Britain is more difficult because passport checks for visitors are mandatory. Britain 'has the tougher border control. They are almost like the United States in some sense. They triple check your name in databases,' Ranstorp said. The three will appear soon before an investigating magistrate at the National Court in Madrid and remain under detention while a judge studies the case and decides on possible charges.","Authorities had been watching the three men - none of whom have been named - for some time .

"Lord Steel yesterday continued to insist he had heard nothing to suggest Cyril Smith had been involved in any offending while a Liberal MP. The peer, who led the Liberals between 1976 and 1988, admitted he had been informed in 1979 that Smith had been investigated by police for child abuse when he was a Labour councillor. However, he maintained that ‘no complaint or even rumour’ reached his office that Smith had been accused of paedophile activities during the 1970s when he was Liberal MP for Rochdale and Steel was his Westminster colleague. Scroll down for video . Colleagues : Cyril Smith and David Steel at their party conference in 1983 . That is despite the fact allegations of Smith’s law breaking were swirling around Parliament well into the 1980s. Speaking at length for the first time about claims he ignored rumours about the 28-stone monster, Lord Steel said he was happy to be interviewed as part of any police probe into whether there was a cover-up of Smith’s crimes. He recommended Smith be given a knighthood in 1988 – despite claims that senior figures in both the political and security establishment knew of allegations against him. Last night Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP whose book revealed the full extent of Smith’s abuse, accused Lord Steel of being disingenuous. From the Mail: April 12 . Yesterday's Mail . ‘Is he really telling the public that no one ever mentioned these allegations to him?’ he asked. ‘We are talking about what was an exceptionally small political party. ‘It seems incredible that Steel hadn’t heard of any of these allegations after 1979.’ On Thursday, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg urged police to investigate whether there had been an establishment cover-up of Smith’s activities. He died in 2010 without facing justice. In a statement yesterday to the Daily Telegraph, Lord Steel said he would co-operate with any police inquiry. ‘I agree that there should be a fresh inquiry and am happy to be interviewed, having known nothing beyond the 1979 published report of police investigations when Cyril Smith was a Labour councillor in the Sixties,’ he said. Liberal MP Cyril Smith, pictured in his robes as Vice Chancellor of Lancaster University, died in 2010 without facing justice for his abuse . ‘No complaint, nor even rumour, of his alleged misbehaviour as an MP ever reached us, and indeed stories only came to light after his death.’ Mr Danczuk said he was disappointed that Lord Steel seemed to be highlighting Smith’s earlier Labour links: ‘Most members of the public, and certainly me, do not care which party Smith belonged to. ‘This is a case of a senior politician using his power to abuse boys, and Steel should be thinking more about the victims and less about party politics. ‘Lord Steel is being disingenuous – muddying the waters rather than clearing them. He now needs to come clean to the public on when he challenged Smith, what he said to him and what Smith said back. ‘We know for a fact that Liberal MPs, Liberal parliamentary candidates and Liberal councillors throughout the decades knew about these allegations.’ Claims about Smith’s paedophilia were printed in the May 1979 issue of the tiny Rochdale Alternative Press, and the report was brought to the attention of Lord Steel. His spokesman responded at the time: ‘It’s not a very friendly  gesture, publishing that. All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms’. But it has been claimed that the Liberal leadership was so worried the allegations would gain wider circulation that they called in Harold Wilson’s hugely influential legal fixer, Lord Arnold Goodman, to hush them up. Dominic Carman said his barrister father George Carman QC, who was then representing former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe as he prepared to stand trial for conspiracy to murder, feared that reports of Smith’s abuse in national newspapers could have seriously damaged his defence. He added: ‘My understanding both from the time and afterwards was that Lord Goodman may well have been involved. It appears that he did a very good job of stopping the story from being repeated.’ Despite overwhelming evidence that rumours of Cyril Smith’s appalling behaviour were widely known at Westminster, Lord Steel maintains he knew – or heard – nothing save for the allegations in 1979 that the MP had abused young boys. As Labour MP Simon Danczuk’s explosive book revealed in the Mail last week, Smith’s serial sexual abuse of vulnerable youngsters was repeatedly covered up by the Establishment. And in the years following the original allegations, printed in the Rochdale Alternative Press and repeated in the satirical magazine Private Eye, Smith’s sordid activities continued. Despite overwhelming evidence rumours of Cyril Smith¿s behaviour were widely known at Westminster, Lord Steel maintains he knew - or heard - nothing save for the allegations in 1979 that the MP had abused young boys . Was Lord Steel, who nominated the predatory paedophile for a knighthood in 1988, totally ignorant of rumours of the MP’s depraved conduct? Here the Mail details the incidents he claims he knew nothing about: .","Lord Steel says 'no complaint or rumour' reached his office that Smith had been accused of paedophile activities during the 1970s .
But admitted he was informed in 1979 that Smith was being investigated .
Simon Danczuk MP today accused Lord Steal of being disingenuous .
In the 1980s Smith’s car was pulled over on the motorway near Northampton and traffic officers discovered child porn in the boot. Local police wanted to press charges but a phone call was made from London and the MP was released without charge.
One young Liberal activist was sexually assaulted in Smith’s office in the House of Commons in the 1980s as other MPs, including Labour leader Michael Foot, walked by.
Smith’s alleged abuse of boys was publicly raised during the 1987 general election by his Labour opponent David Williams. ‘Everyone in Rochdale heard rumours about him, and I believed they should be properly investigated,’ he said. ‘Perhaps it was dirty politics on my behalf , But Cyril Smith was a dirty politician, so I decided to do it.’
A former campaigner for the Social Democratic Party, then in an alliance with the Liberal Party, said senior party officials panicked during the 1983 election through fear that Smith would be exposed as a child abuser. Charles Baker, an SDP activist in Hertfordshire, said: ‘There was a kind of an alert, an alarm that one of the other parties had got hold of the fact that Cyril Smith had interfered with boys yet again.’
Smith was a visitor to the notorious Elm Guest house in south-west London, now the focus of a Scotland Yard investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring in the 1980s."
"Row after row, this astonishing array of solar panels has completely engulfed an enormous 30-acre field in the heart of the countryside. As this aerial photograph reveals, acres of beautiful Hampshire countryside have been blighted as a result, by 18,000 solar panels. The solar farm covers a staggering 30 acres of land creating a massive eyesore in the centre of an otherwise picturesque view. The solar farm, Cadland Estate at Fawley in Hampshire, covers a staggering 30 acres of land creating a massive eyesore in the centre of an otherwise picturesque view . Photographer Tim Woodcock, 54, captured the image from a helicopter while flying more than 1,000ft above the solar array near Fawley. The energy saving farm on the Cadland Estate uses photo-voltaic panels to produce five megawatts of power. It creates enough natural energy to supply 1,000 homes each day. Mr Woodcock boarded his friend’s Jetranger helicopter to capture the farm which was installed last June with his Nikon camera fitted with a 24-120 Nikon zoom lens. Photographer Tim Woodcock captured these images from a helicopter, flying more than 1,000ft above the solar array . He said: ‘We were in the air for just over an hour and being at 1,000 feet is not really a problem. ‘By the time you have reached that altitude you have settled down. ‘The strangest sensation is just as you take off and you have an idea of how far off the ground you are. ‘I was able to open a window on the aircraft and take pictures through that.’ Mr Woodcock, a professional photographer from Fawley, feels that there is a lot of interest in alternative forms of energy. Solar farms like this one have sprung up in recent years as farmers collect up to £50,000 a year in green subsidies - this site is made up of 18,000 solar PV panels, mounted on nine kilometres of frames using 5,000 ground screws . ‘Many of these alternative energy sources are manufactured abroad, in China, for example. ‘It is very easy to say that a system is ‘green’ when all the energy and environmental damage and cost is made elsewhere.’ He added: ‘Obviously there is a lot of interest in alternative forms of energy. But the question remains how many of these will actually provide a real alternative to fossil fuels - so far, very few. ‘No one seems to have the courage to tell the truth about energy alternatives.’ The solar panel farm, which is the size of 18 football pitches, is one of the largest of its kind in Britain and took just four weeks to construct. It is made of 18,000 solar PV panels, mounted on nine kilometres of frames using 5,000 ground screws. Locals claim it is less of a blot on the landscape than wind farms, because the panels are completely surrounded by trees and greenery. Energy efficiency solutions company Anesco designed and manages the farm on the land rented from the Cadland Estate. The Estate is also used for farming wheat, maize and livestock. It is best known for supplying potato to leading food manufacturers such as Walkers crisps. Some locals claim the solar panels are less of a blot on the landscape than wind farms, because the panels are completely surrounded by trees and greenery . Energy generated by the solar PV system is fed back into the national grid under the Government’s Feed in Tariff (FiT) scheme which makes payments for energy produced through renewable sources. Dozens of large-scale solar farms like this have sprung up in recent years as farmers put up acres of them to rake in up to £50,000 a year in the green subsidies. More than 100 new planning applications are currently in the system and work on a large-scale installation in Wiltshire began last month. Another energy firm Kronos Solar has set out plans to build Britain’s largest solar farm, on agricultural land in Houghton, Hampshire. Under the proposals, 225,456 panels would be laid out across an area the size of 100 football pitches. The scheme is intended to produce enough electricity for 31,500 people. However, it will soon be far more difficult to set up a solar farm on greenfield land or areas of outstanding natural beauty it was revealed last month. New planning guidance to be issued to local councils will state that ‘care should be taken to preserve heritage assets, including the impact of planning proposals on views important to their setting’. More than 100 new planning applications are currently in the system and work on a large-scale installation in Wiltshire began last month . This will not affect small scale solar installations which families can install on their roofs or farmhouses, or can be put up on industrial land. Energy minister Greg Barker has insisted that although solar has a bright future in the UK it should not be in any place or at any price. He said last month: ‘I want UK solar targeted on industrial roofs, homes and on brownfield sites not on our beautiful countryside.’ Campaigners near solar farms in rural beauty spots say they have become a sea of silicon slabs, which are allowed by councils to meet their renewable energy targets. People who set up their own solar panels benefit from the feed-in tariff. This has been slashed by around two-thirds over the past year after the Government set the level far too high. However people who signed up in the early days in 2010-11 have their fee fixed for 25 years and continue to benefit.","The area in Hampshire would cover 18 football pitches and was set up in just four weeks .

"Eating a Mediterranean diet is good for the mind as well as the body and improves a person's quality of life, according to researchers. The study found that the consumption of oil-rich Mediterranean foods, such as fish and seafood, helps to improve overall well-being. For years the region's diet has been associated with superior physical health. Tuck in: Eating a Mediterranean diet is good for the mind as well as the body and improves a person's quality of life, according to researchers . But scientists have now linked its consumption to improved mental and physical health too. A Mediterranean diet, which is characterised by a regular intake of fruit, vegetables, pulses, fish, olive oil and nuts, has been proven to lessen the chances of chronic illness. Regions where people subside on it also have a lower mortality rate. However, it was not yet clear how the . diet impacts on mental and physical health and quality of life. So scientists devised a food . pyramid, which states main meals should never lack cereals and fruit and . veg - and a daily intake of two litres of water. Olive oil is the main source of fat . for nutritional quality and moderate consumption of wine is recommended, . as well as fish, lean meat and eggs - all are found in Mediterranean . diets. At the top of the pyramid are sugar, . sweets, cakes, pastries and sweet drinks, which should only be consumed . occasionally and in small amounts. The researchers, from the University of Las . Palmas de Gran Canaria and the University of Navarra in Spai, conducted a four-year study of the eating habits of more than 11,000 university . students. Dietary intake data was taken at the . beginning of the study and self-perceived quality of life was measured . after the four year period. To determine whether the Mediterranean . diet was followed, consumption of vegetables, pulses, fruit, nuts, . cereals and fish were positively rated on a questionnaire and meat, . dairy products and alcohol were negatively valued. Results showed those who stuck more to . the Mediterranean diet scored higher on the quality of life . questionnaire in terms of physical and mental well-being, with the link . to physical well-being even stronger. Lead researcher Patricia Henrmquez Sanchez said: 'The progressive ageing of the population in developed countries makes it even more interesting to find out those factors that can increase quality of life and the health of the population. 'The Mediterranean diet is an important factor associated with better quality of life and can be considered as a healthy food model.' The study is published in the European Journal of . Clinical Nutrition.","Consumption of oil-rich Mediterranean foods, such as fish and seafood, helps to improve overall well-being .
Of the 11,000 students surveyed over a four-year period, scientists found those who stuck to the diet scored far higher on quality of life questionnaire ."
"Blamed: Then-chancellor Gordon Brown holds the box containing his first Labour budget in 1997, when he took away pension fund tax relief . The devastating impact of Labour’s infamous raid on pensions can be laid bare today. Official figures reveal that the tax grab has saved the Treasury – and cost workers – £118billion since 1997. In one of his first decisions as chancellor, Gordon Brown scrapped tax relief on pension firms’ dividends. The move is blamed for wrecking a once thriving industry and fuelling the closure of many final salary schemes. Analysis by the Office for Budget Responsibility shows it has saved the Treasury almost £7billion a year – £2billion more than Mr Brown had expected. The annual gain is expected to top £9.7billion this year with £117.9billion saved between 1997 and 2014. The OBR quietly published the figures on its website this week. Ros Altmann, a former Downing Street pension adviser, said Labour’s move marked ‘the beginning of the end of the gold standard pension that British workers could rely on from their boss’. She added: ‘This is money that has come out of people’s pensions. It paved the way for the end of final salary schemes because it made them so much more expensive. They were suddenly unaffordable.’ Since 1997, the number of private sector workers with a defined benefit pension has collapsed from 5million to 1.7million. In 1997, 34 per cent of staff at private sector firms were in a final salary – or defined benefit – scheme. By 2012, this had slumped to just 8 per cent – just one in 12. Asda scrapped its scheme in 2010 and Sainsbury’s shut its scheme to new members eight years earlier. Laith Khalaf, of investment advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘It was a stealth raid which had a devastating effect on the UK pensions landscape. It sank many final salary schemes and dented the returns earned by people who had done the sensible thing and saved for their retirement.’ The loss of the tax break also cost workers with defined contribution pensions, which are not linked to final salaries. David Robbins, a senior consultant at pension advisers Towers Watson, said: ‘It was a classic stealth tax. Any money taken out of defined contribution pensions is the saver’s problem, not the employer’s. It means people will be retiring with smaller pension pots.’ Before 1997, a pension fund could receive £80 in investment dividends after tax and receive an additional £20 credit from the Treasury. But this top-up was abolished by Mr Brown in his Budget day speech of July 1997. He told the Commons: ‘Many pension funds are in substantial surplus and at present many companies are enjoying pension holidays, so this is the right time to undertake a long-needed reform.’ Ros Altmann with pension protesters in Manchester: The former Downing Street adviser said Labour's move marked 'the beginning of the end of the gold standard pension that British workers could rely on' Final salary schemes took a further blow with the introduction that year of a new rule forcing bosses to increase payouts to retired workers. Although apparently a boon for workers, it put firms under extra financial pressure and encouraged them to close defined benefit schemes. While he was shadow chancellor, George Osborne used his speech at the Conservative party conference in 2009 to promise to ‘reverse the effects of Gordon Brown’s pensions tax raid.’ He pledged: ‘It is an ambition that may well take more than one parliament to achieve. Gordon Brown’s disastrous tax raid on pensions heralded the start of the age of irresponsibility. So today I say we will reverse the effects of  Gordon Brown’s pensions tax raid and get our country saving again.’ Despite these promises, no change has been made. The coalition Government claims it is working to improve pension saving in Britain with a series of moves. For the first time, bosses are being forced to pay money into a pension for their workers. More than three million extra people are now saving into a nest egg. From next April, pensioners will not have to buy an annuity and will be able to spend their pension pot as they choose. ANALYSIS by JAMES CONEY, Money Mail Editor . It amounted to just three short sentences in Gordon Brown’s first budget as chancellor on July 2, 1997 – but it became one of his most notorious deeds in office. Under the guise of introducing structural reforms to encourage investment, he abolished tax credits paid to pension funds and companies. It was a devastating move that has all but killed off private sector final salary schemes and devastated the bank balances of millions of retirees. Mr Brown explains his spending plans to the Commons: Before 1997, all pension funds were able to boost the amount of money they held for savers by claiming back tax on dividends - a crucial boost to their coffers . At the time few realised the impact of this complicated change. Before the 1997 budget, all pension funds were able to boost the amount of money they held for savers by claiming back tax on dividends. These regular payouts to shareholders in a company are typically paid out after tax has been deducted. The going rate was 20 per cent, which means that when a fund received £80 of dividends £20 in tax had already been taken away. But the law allowed the pension funds to reclaim this £20 from the Treasury. Abolishing the right to reclaim this tax relief meant the pension funds lost a vital perk and source of income. Back in 1997, pension funds were in surplus and had more than enough money to pay the incomes of retirees. That excess cash was an easy target for the Treasury. But if Mr Brown genuinely believed what he said on that day – that his move was to encourage investment – then it was a chronic miscalculation. He gave no warning about the damage it could cause. It was only a decade later that it emerged that he was alerted before the budget that pension funds could lose £50billion overnight. As the new figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show, abolishing pension fund dividend tax relief has cost them £117.9billion between 1997 and 2014. Crucially, this figure relates only to the Treasury’s savings. The impact on pension savers is far more devastating. Money worries: Before 1997 there were more than 5million workers saving into a private sector  final salary scheme. Today there are fewer than 1.7million. (Stock image, picture posed by model) Each year the dividend payments that pension funds were stripped of would have been reinvested and grown. With even a modest rate of compound growth, the £2.3billion the Treasury saved in 1997 thanks to Mr Brown would now be worth around £5.5billion. Using the same logic, one financial expert calculates that the total amount stripped from the nation’s pensions could amount to as much as £260billion. With less money in their coffers and with pensioners living longer and needing money for longer, pension funds soon ran into major difficulties. Thousands of companies closed their lucrative final salary schemes, which promised to pay a retirement income based on an employee’s length of service and pay. These schemes found they could no longer afford the promises they made. Many shut. Before 1997 there were more than 5million workers saving into a private sector  final salary scheme. Today there are fewer than 1.7million. Gordon Brown’s tax raid may have boosted the Treasury’s coffers, but it devastated the pension promises made to a generation of workers and changed the way we save for our retirement forever.","Gordon Brown scrapped tax relief on pension firms' dividends in 1997 .

"A Muslim primary school has been heavily crictised by Oftsed because the library is said to contain books which advocate 'fundamentalist Islamic beliefs' and punishments under Sharia law, including stoning women. An inspection at Olive Tree Primary school in Luton, Bedfordshire, was abandoned last week after parents reacted angrily to inspectors quizzing their children about homosexuality. Now an unpublished report by the school's watchdog has condemned the school for promoting Salafi ideology and suggested it does not prepare its pupils 'for life in modern Britain, as opposed to life in a Muslim state.' Oftsed inspectors said books in the library at Olive Tree Primary School in Luton, Bedfordshire, contained books which advocated punishment under Sharia law, including the stoning of women . Muslims involved in the Salafi movement promote Sharia law, the Islamisation of society and those who practice the ideology advocate jihad against civilians. According to The Guardian, the report said some of the content of the books were set 'firmly within a Saudi Arabian socio-religious context'. It reads: 'Some of the views promoted by these books, for example stoning women, have no place in British society.' Ofsted inspectors abandoned a review of the school last week after parents complained their children were being asked about homosexuality . Staff from the school denied the allegations, describing them as a 'complete fabrication', and said there were no books in the library that advocated extremist beliefs. Farasat Latif, the school's chair of govenors told the paper: 'We have a large number of books about different faiths, which inspectors failed to to notice, including The Diary of Ann Frank.' An Ofsted spokesperson said, 'We have shared a draft copy of the inspection report in confidence with the school for factual accuracy checking as is our standard practice. 'The final report will be published shortly.' Last week, parents were said to be concerned that the Ofsted staff were discussing sex with the children, without their consent. A scheduled meeting between parents and . inspectors saw the appropriateness of the questioning raised and after . discussions the inspectors withdrew from the school a day early.

"Manchester city centre was torn apart by looters as young as nine in the worst riots in the city for 30 years. Hundreds of youths and ‘feral’ children stormed through the streets . smashing windows and stealing clothing, mobile phones and jewellery. Shops and bins were set on fire as police struggled to keep up with marauding gangs in a cat-and-mouse chase across the city. Yesterday police chiefs admitted they had been ‘overwhelmed’ by the . scale of the disturbances and had to call on neighbouring forces to . assist. On the run: A youngster barely over 10 . years old, left, clutches a bottle of wine looted from a Sainsbury's Local . store in Manchester city centre, and right, two other thieves run away from the same shop with three bottles of strong vodka . They came from outlying towns and districts to the city centre with only one thing on their mind – a night of lawless mayhem. The young Manchester thugs’ brazen attitude and belief they will face no punishment has stunned police. One 15-year-old masked looter said: ‘They can’t touch me. I’m still a kid. ‘The police can’t hit us, they can’t injure us and when they arrest us they have to let us go so we don’t care what we do on the streets. ‘I’ve got phones and clothes from the raids and what is the worst they can do? Give me a caution or a curfew I won’t obey.’ Another boy said: ‘I’ll keep doing this every day until I get caught. When I get home, I might get shouted at, but that’s it. This’ll be my first offence. ‘The prisons are overcrowded – what are they going to do, give me an Asbo? I’ll live with that.’ A teenage girl who raided a mobile phone store and smashed a BlackBerry on the pavement said: ‘It don’t mean nothing, this. We’re not in it for the stuff, we’re in it for the laugh.’ And a girl who claimed she left school at 13 said: ‘All these rich businesses for rich people are getting a bit of payback and it’s about time the ordinary poor person had a say in this country.’ Primary school age: Two youngsters pull the hoods from their baggy sweaters over their heads as they stand outside the looted store. The child who stole a bottle of wine is seen behind them returning with a bottle of Coke . Free for all: Hooded youths spill out of the damaged store in Manchester after filling their pockets with cigarettes and bottles of alcohol . A police station was firebombed and more than 90 people arrested as rioting blighted Nottingham. Canning Circus police station was attacked by a group of up to 40 men at around 10pm on Tuesday but no injuries were reported. Meadows police station was also attacked by a gang of 15 to 20 men and a police car was set alight.Police said it was one of ten force cars that were damaged across the area on a second night of disturbances. The violence followed the arrest of ten youths after a small group got on to the roof of one of the buildings at fee-paying Nottingham High School. Groups of youths using masks and hoods to hide their identities congregated around parts of the city setting light to cars and attacking businesses, pubs and community centres. Nottinghamshire Police said hundreds of officers were deployed to contain numerous incidents of criminal activity and of ‘gratuitous violence’. A spokesman said from 6pm until just before midnight, the force had dealt with more than 1,000 incidents. Elsewhere in the East Midlands, Leicestershire Police said 13 people were arrested after disturbances in Leicester city centre. In a night of mayhem which caused millions of pounds of damage, the . rioters used social networking sites, mobile phones and texts to . exchange information. Then, huge gangs of masked youths slipped through the back streets, . avoiding police lines to strike at the next store in what appeared to be . co-ordinated manoeuvres. Around 1,000 riot police, officers on horseback and dog handlers . desperately tried to flush them out – but the gangs worked with . lightning speed and were able to swarm through a store and empty it of . all valuable goods in just minutes. Officers would arrive to discover . places ransacked before receiving another emergency call to the next . store. The trouble flared in the Tuesday evening rush hour when two youths used . a stone slab to smash the front door of Foot Asylum in the Arndale . Centre. They were followed into the store by more than 50 others. A mob broke into Bang & Olufsen, cleaning it out of its luxury . electrical items, while Miss Selfridge was set alight. An 18-year-old . was arrested on suspicion of arson. Youth out of control: Young masked looters carry boxes of . expensive electrical gadgets out of a home cinema shop in central . Birmingham . Manchester: Hooded looters with arm fulls of clothes run from a Manchester shopping centre . Former Oasis star Liam Gallagher’s recently-opened fashion boutique – . Pretty Green – also fell victim. For more than an hour St Ann’s Square – . a busy shopping district – was under mob rule with a dozen stores being . raided or smashed up. Children as young as nine were believed to be on the street during the height of the disturbances. One witness said: ‘I asked one child how old he was and he said he was . nearly ten. I was disgusted. 'He claimed he was shopping with his brother . but I later saw them both tearing down Market Street with a pack of . masked teenagers.’ In nearby Salford youths fought a running battle with riot police, . smashing shop windows and bus shelters and using bricks and rubble to . pelt officers. Two cars, one a BBC radio vehicle, lay overturned and . burnt out. Firemen came under attack from missile-throwing yobs as they attended incidents at a Lidl supermarket and several shop fires. Although Britain’s major cities bore the brunt of the violence, the menace spread almost as far as the lush hills and valleys of the Cotswolds. The cathedral city of Gloucester was  targeted late on Tuesday as scores of hoodie-wearing youths clashed with police, attacked shops and set fire to buildings.Intent on demonstrating that they too could sink to the levels of behaviour they had seen on television, they struck at Argos, HMV, Primark, betting shops and a convenience store. Police, including mounted officers drafted in from other forces, were pelted with rocks and bottles. Eight fire crews tackled a blaze at a former Gloucester College of Art and  Technology building, which has been empty since 2007. In total 200 police officers were  involved in the operation, which continued into the early hours of yesterday. None was injured. By the evening there had been 14 arrests. Deputy Chief Constable Mick Matthews said the rioters were local youths, adding: ‘What we have seen in Gloucester have been copycat incidents which do not appear to have been co-ordinated in any way.’ The Very Rev Stephen Lake, Dean of Gloucester, added: ‘These things just don’t happen here. That shows what happened was opportunism and copycat rioting.’ City by city, the violence erupted: In Birmingham, left, a suspected looter is pinned to the ground near New Street railway station on Tuesday; Liverpool, middle, sees fires burn as youths go on the rampage during clashes in Toxteth; In Nottingham, right, a police station in Canning Circus is firebombed and a policewoman stands guard . Police made 113 arrests as more than 100 . premises were attacked across Greater Manchester. A police source said: . ‘We have information that children of primary school age were out on . the streets. 'Charges of neglect could be brought against any parent if . their young children are found on the streets in the midst of a civil . disturbance.’ Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan described the rioting as ‘senseless criminality on a scale unprecedented in my career’. He added: ‘These people have nothing to . protest against – no sense of injustice or any spark led to this. We . were overwhelmed. We had to draw resources from all over the North West . to be able to ensure that we could protect life and property.’ Graham Stringer, Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton, said police had questions to answer. ‘This was predicted,’ he added. ‘The police knew it was coming. It was co-ordinated by well-known criminals and gangsters. It wasn’t spontaneous.’ Chief Constable Peter Fahy issued 17 . CCTV photos of suspected looters. He said one had handed himself in . after seeing his own picture on the force’s Facebook page. Armies of volunteers with brooms joined dozens of glaziers to begin the clear up yesterday. Last night police were stopping and . searching teenagers and taking pictures of them as they made their way . into the city, then ordering them home. The rioting was the worst in the city . since the 1981 Moss Side riot, in which a 1,000-strong mob besieged a . police station and an officer was shot in the leg with a crossbow. An officer was injured as his police station came under attack from youths in Washington, County Durham. The six rioters also set a patrol car alight. The officer was treated in hospital after he was hit by shards of flying glass when the yobs threw a brick through the station window at 3am yesterday. Two youths aged 17 and 19 were arrested in connection with the arson attack.Northumbria Police had sent several of their riot officers to London to help tackle the worst of the violence, but insisted this had not affected policing in the area. On Tuesday night, trouble also spilled over into West Yorkshire as ‘copycat’ mobs smashed their way into a supermarket, shops and a doctors’ surgery in Huddersfield. Five men aged between 17 and 20 were arrested after ‘pockets’ of violence broke out. One gang broke into a medical centre and a working men’s club where they stole cash machines. Fire crew were also lured to a bus shelter, which had been set alight, where young men pelted them with stones and bottles. A mob also managed to break into Asda but were forced to abandon five televisions in the car park after they triggered the alarms. A 19-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of encouraging  violent disorder after posting an invitation to a riot in Wakefield on Facebook. And in Harehills, Leeds, a group also set fire to a van and attempted to stop vehicles from passing.","'Feral' children run wild in the streets of UK cities .

"Eating less meat is 'essential' to ensure future demand for food can be met and 'dangerous' climate change avoided, experts have warned. A study by leading university researchers in Cambridge and Aberdeen found food production alone could exceed targets for greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 if current trends continue. Population growth and the global shift towards 'meat-heavy Western diets' has meant increasing agricultural yields will not meet projected food demands for an expected 9.6 billion world population in 30 years, according to the researchers. Researchers in Cambridge and Aberdeen say food production could cause targets for greenhouse gas emissions to be exceeded in 2050. Meat-heavy diets mean that project food demands will not be met for an expected 9.6 billion world population in 30 years . Increased deforestation, fertiliser use and livestock methane emissions are likely to cause greenhouse gas emissions from food production to rise by almost 80 per cent, experts  from the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen found. A report released earlier this year came to similar conclusions, that emissions from agriculture threaten to keep increasing as global meat and dairy consumption increases. If agricultural emissions are not addressed, nitrous oxide from fields and methane from livestock may double by 2070. This alone would make meeting the climate target essentially impossible. 'We have shown that reducing meat and dairy consumption is key to bringing agricultural climate pollution down to safe levels,' said Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. 'Broad dietary change can take a long time. We should already be thinking about how we can make our food more climate friendly.' By 2050, estimates indicate that beef and lamb will account for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, while only contributing three per cent of human calorie intake. Cheese and other dairy products will account for about one quarter of total agricultural climate pollution. Lead researcher Bojana Bajzelj, from the University of Cambridge's department of engineering, said: 'Agricultural practices are not necessarily at fault here - but our choice of food is. 'It is imperative to find ways to achieve global food security without expanding crop or pastureland. 'Food production is a main driver of biodiversity loss and a large contributor to climate change and pollution, so our food choices matter.' He added: 'Cutting food waste and moderating meat consumption in more balanced diets, are the essential 'no-regrets' options.' According to the study in Nature Climate Change, current trends in food production will mean that by 2050 cropland will have expanded by 42 per cent and fertiliser use increased by 45 per cent over 2009 levels. A further tenth of the world's pristine tropical forests would disappear over the next 35 years, it said. Increased deforestation, fertiliser use and livestock methane will raise emissions by up to 80 per cent. The experts say better global food security without using more land is needed to mitigate global warming . The study's authors tested a scenario where all countries were assumed to have an 'average' balanced diet - without excessive consumption of sugars, fats, and meat products. The average balanced diet used in the study was a 'relatively achievable goal', the researchers said, which included two 85-gram (0.2 pounds) portions of red meat and five eggs per week, as well as a portion of poultry a day. 'This significantly reduced the pressures on the environment even further,' they said. Co-author Professor Pete Smith, from the University of Aberdeen, said: 'Unless we make some serious changes in food consumption trends, we would have to completely de-carbonise the energy and industry sectors to stay within emissions budgets that avoid dangerous climate change. 'That is practically impossible - so, as well as encouraging sustainable agriculture, we need to re-think what we eat.' Cambridge co-author Prof Keith Richards said: 'This is not a radical vegetarian argument; it is an argument about eating meat in sensible amounts as part of healthy, balanced diets. 'Managing the demand better, for example by focusing on health education, would bring double benefits - maintaining healthy populations, and greatly reducing critical pressures on the environment.'","Researchers in Cambridge and Aberdeen say food production could cause targets for greenhouse gas emissions to be exceeded in 2050 .

"Despite some experts claiming it can’t be done, the race is on to build a robot with the same kind of consciousness as the human brain. Google, Apple and IBM are just some of the tech giants developing systems designed to be more autonomous and intelligent than what’s come before. But according to one analyst, there is a clear leader; a firm that will reach the pivotal milestone before anyone else - and that's Google. An analyst believes Google is in the best position to create the first ever conscious machine and already has related projects in the place. It recently bought a number of robotics firm, such as Meka pictured, for example. The analyst claims conscious machines could be developed within the next 20 years . Machine consciousness differs from machine intelligence. There . are already intelligent machines that can learn from their mistakes and . fix errors, but many of these are programmed to do so. For example, world chess Grandmaster, Gary Kasparov, was defeated by IBM’s ‘Deep Blue’ supercomputer in 1997. Another IBM-developed computer, called . Watson, won the TV game show, Jeopardy, in 2011 by answering general . knowledge questions posed in natural language. It has more recently been . used as a customer call centre agent. Apple Siri, Google Photo Search and Google’s . self-driving cars are further examples of machines that exhibit . behaviour similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans. To become conscious, Sheehy said systems would need to be able to look at the rules the humans had programmed, to identify . inconsistencies or gaps and report back. Alternatively, they would be able to discover errors in algorithms and consciously fix them without being asked. ‘We can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in existing Google products like Google Now, the search function that forms part of Google+ Photos and Google’s self-driving car project,’ explained Andrew Sheehy from Generator Research. ‘A string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence, along with the recent hiring of Ray Kurzweil as a director of engineering shows that Google is by no means done with machine learning: it is clear that the company is just getting started. ‘Taking into account the present scale of Google’s computer network, the size of its user base and its capital reserves, Google is well placed to take on something as ambitious as machine consciousness.’ Machine consciousness differs from machine intelligence.

Apple Siri, Google Photo Search and Google’s self-driving cars are further examples of machines that exhibit behaviour similar to that exhibited by intelligent humans. Google Now, in particular, uses predictive analysis to make educated guesses about what phone owners need - from traffic information, diary appointments and weather reports. The comments were made by Andrew Sheehy, pictured, who is chief analyst at Generator Research . ‘If we define an intelligent machine as something that exhibits useful behaviour that is understandable, predictable and controllable, then a conscious machine is not just intelligent but it can autonomously adapt and optimise within its own environment,’ continued Sheehy. ‘IBM’s Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov using a ’brute force’ approach, which involved running through millions of possible outcomes for each move. Deep Blue’s ‘intelligence’ arose from its ability to apply a set of human-defined rules. Within this narrow sphere, Deep Blue exhibited signs of intelligence, but it was not conscious.’ To become conscious, Sheehy said systems would need to be able to look at the rules the humans had programmed, to identify . inconsistencies or gaps, and report back. Alternatively, they would need to be able to discover errors in algorithms and consciously fix them without being asked. Intel, IBM and Qualcomm are each already working on neuromorphic computing, which uses new physical structures to replicate others. The Geneva-based Human Brain Project, meanwhile, has attracted €1.5 billion of EU money to deliver an electronic-software model of the human brain in 10 years. Although several years behind Europe’s Human Brain Project, the U.S. government has also committed initial funding to the BRAIN initiative, which is working to ‘revolutionize our understanding of the human brain’. Earlier this month, researchers from Stanford University created the Neurogrid, pictured - a computer chip based on the human brain that is 9,000 times faster than current computers. The $40,000 (£23,600) circuit board mimics the brain on the power it takes to run a tablet computer . In 2011 IBM's Watson computer competed against Jeopardy's two most successful contestants, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. During the practice match Watson was given the same questions as the other contestants and could virtually press the buzzer to answer. In the majority of cases Watson beat both contestants . Earlier this month, researchers from Stanford University created the Neurogrid - a computer chip based on the human brain that is 9,000 times faster than current computers. Last week, a mathematician announced robots will never have feelings and never develop consciousness. This is because a mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness proves it is impossible to build an emotional machine. Professor Phil Maguire, from the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, said computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling. This is because the mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Professor Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, states the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness. ‘Many people, including highly respected people in the tech world – like Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, believe that we will never be able to create a conscious machine,’ added Sheehy. ‘I used to think that way, too, but I no longer do. 'Instead, I now believe that the question is not whether artificial machine consciousness will arrive, but when it will arrive and what form it will take.’ Even ‘partially conscious’ machines, according to Sheehy, would transform the world when combined with their ability to process vast amounts of information almost in real time. He added that although the thinking behind machine consciousness can create issues with the belief of humankind and spirituality, he sees it as ‘just another phase in the evolution of the human species.’ The consensus among supporters on when machine consciousness will be achieved is between 10 and 20 years. ‘While that is a long time, it should be remembered that this is shorter than the age of the mobile communications industry and, certainly at 10 years, is close enough for this technology to have an effect on the valuations of companies, including Google,’ continued Sheehy. The stage on from machine consciousness, is machine self awareness. Andrew Sheehy from Generator Research said: 'We can already see evidence of machine learning and machine intelligence in Google's self-driving car project,' pictured. He added few companies have such a track record in investing in visionary technologies as Google . Sheehy added: 'A string of recent acquisitions in the field of robotics and machine intelligence, along with the recent hiring of Ray Kurzweil as a director of engineering shows that Google is by no means done with machine learning: it is clear that the company is just getting started.' Kurzweil is pictured . Sheehy defines a self-aware machine as one that is ‘intelligent, conscious and can also take autonomous action to increase its own intelligence or consciousness.' ‘If there ever was a Holy Grail in tech, then it would have to be machine consciousness. ‘Google’s development path strongly indicates that this company will be the first to find the Grail and see what’s inside – at which point everything changes.’ 'Whoever reaches consciousness first will be able to race ahead of the competition: the victor will be able use their conscious machine to accelerate its own rate of progress. 'The further ahead the leader gets, the faster he is able to run. Eventually, competitors are left so far behind that they cannot catch up.'","Analyst believes Google is in the best position to create the first machine .

"Three people in their 80s were found dead in two homes on a suburban street in New Jersey after a man shot his wife, brother-in-law and himself, authorities said. It's not clear what led to the shootings early Wednesday in Hasbrouck Heights, a suburb about 10 miles from New York City. The victims lived just a few homes away from each other and there was no known animosity between them, although authorities said the gunman, Angelo Talignani had shown signs of depression in the past. Murder-suicide: Police block off a street near a home in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2014, where they say Angelo Talignani shot and killed his brother-in-law, before killing his wife and then himself . The victims lived just a few homes away from each other and there was no known animosity between them, although authorities said Angelo Talignani had shown signs of depression in the past . Talignani went to Anthony Gentile's home around 7:30 a.m., took two guns legally owned by Gentile and shot him in his bedroom, Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said. 'We don't know if there was any type of scuffle or argument,' Molinelli said during a news conference. It appears, he said, that Talignani had gone to Gentile's home to get the guns, but it was not known whether he intended to shoot him there. After Gentile was killed, Talignani went back home and shot his wife, Antoinette, as she lay in bed, Molinelli said. Talignani then killed himself. A home health aide who had just recently moved in with the Talignanis heard the shots and called police from a neighbor's home.

'It's a tragedy; these people were all elderly who had known each other for a long time,' Molinelli said. 'These were longtime residents of Hasbrouck Heights, good families. You really never know why people do this.' Gentile lived alone, Molinelli said. Gentile's deceased wife was Antoinette Talignani's sister. The elderly Talignanis fell earlier this year, veteran Iganzio Valente told NJ.com. NorthJersey.com reported that Talignani and Gentile were Korean War veterans and members of the same VFW chapter. Neighbor and fellow veteran Salvatore Altomare told the website '[Talignani] didn't have a full deck. 'You didn't know how he was going to turn, you didn't know what he was going to do.'","Angelo Talignani went to Anthony Gentile's home around 7:30 a.m., took two guns legally owned by Gentile and shot him in his bedroom, Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said .
He said after Gentile was killed, Talignani went back home and shot his wife, Antoinette, as she lay in bed before killing himself .
Gentile's deceased wife was Antoinette's sister .
A home health aide who had just recently moved in with the Talignanis heard the shots and called police from a neighbor's home .
The victims lived just a few homes away from each other and there was no known animosity between them, although authorities said Talignani had shown signs of depression in the past .

"Ticket touts have been accused of ‘disgusting’ behaviour after cashing in on a concert to raise money for charity. Seats for The Cure’s London concerts in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust sold out within hours of being released - only to appear for resale for more than five times their face value. At 9.30am today, all 10,000 tickets for the band’s two scheduled performances, on 28 and 29 March, were released for sale on the Royal Albert Hall website as well as Ticketmaster.co.uk, Gigsandtours.com and Seetickets.com. All 10,000 tickets for The Cure, pictured, who are playing a concert in aid of The Teenager Cancer Trust, were sold within hours. Many were immediately put on secondary ticket selling sites for five times their value . The cheapest standing tickets were available for £27.50 with the most expensive box seats going for £137.50. Snapped . up in fewer than five hours, they immediately reappeared for sale on . so-called ‘secondary ticketing sites’, including Viagogo, Seatwave, . Stubhub (the ticketing arm of eBay), and Getmein – which itself is owned . by Ticketmaster. These . sites allow those who have bought tickets to sell them second-hand at a . price of their choice. The Cure tickets were on sale for between £149 . and £330. Roger Daltrey, who . curated the concerts on behalf of the Teenage Cancer Trust, condemned . the touts and called for their behaviour to be made illegal. In . a statement to the Mail, the Who frontman said: ‘This is a major . concern for the live performance arena and it becomes doubly painful . when the shows concerned are for charity. The people who do this have to . live with their consciences, knowing that the profit they have made . could have gone to teenagers with cancer. ‘ . He . added: ‘We as a charity do an enormous amount of work to stop this . happening. We work directly with the bands’ fan clubs to try and ensure . that the real fans acquire the tickets. But until it is illegal to . transfer tickets for extra money, there really isn’t much more we can . do.’ Meanwhile, fans took to Twitter to express their rage. David Woosley from Liverpool branded the touts’ behaviour ‘disgusting’. Touts who are attempting to resell the tickets for the gig at the Royal Albert Hall (pictured) have today been branded 'disgusting' Siobhan . Dunn, Chief Executive of Teenage Cancer Trust said: ‘It is wrong for . individuals to hijack these efforts and personally profit by selling . tickets on the secondary market. ‘We believe the only people entitled to profit from our event are young people with cancer.’ It is not the first time the behaviour of touts using the secondary sites has attracted criticism. In . November, there was outcry after all 20,000 tickets for Monty Python’s . reunion performance sold out in three-quarters of a minute, only to . reappear on the secondary market at more than 15 times their face value. Ticketing . expert Reg Walker, of the Iridium Consultancy, believes the only way . the tickets could have sold out so quickly, only to reappear minutes . later, is with the help of illegal, ticket-harvesting ‘botnet’ technology - computer programmes which work by inundating ticket . providers with thousands of electronic requests at the same time, to buy . tickets en masse. ‘It is . highly likely that some of the methods used to harvest these tickets are . illegal. The Teenage Cancer Trust event is targeted every year.’ Some . MPs have accused the secondary sites of turning a blind eye to illegal . behaviour. In December, Labour MP Sharon Hodgson and Conservative MP . Mike Weatherley launched the All Party Ticketing Abuse Group to examine . the issue. They were due to have their first meeting this week, however all four major ticketing sites declined to send a representative. Commenting . on The Cure concert last night, Sharon Hodgson said: ‘Ticket touting . goes on week in, week out, but it’s particularly sickening to see the . goodwill of an artist and the fundraising efforts of a charity exploited . for personal profit. ‘Fans, . the live event industry and even the Police have all called on the . Government to intervene in this shady and parasitical market. It’s high . time Ministers finally listened, and took action to put fans first.’ The . Cure’s gigs are part of a week-long series of performances at the Royal . Albert Hall, curated by Daltrey. As well as The Cure, Suede, Ed . Sheeran, Paolo Nutini and OneRepublic will all be appearing between . March 24 and 30. Since their launch in 2000, the Teenage Cancer Trust gigs have raised more than £17 million.","Tickets for The Cure's Royal Albert Hall concert sold out in five hours .

"The Queen warned last night that focusing too much attention on the Ebola outbreak could lead to an upsurge in other deadly diseases such as malaria. At an event alongside world leaders in the science of infectious diseases yesterday, she asked ‘piercing’ questions about how the disease ought to be controlled. And the monarch said she worried that Ebola, which has claimed 5,000 lives already, risked overshadowing the risk from other deadlier diseases like malaria, which kills the same number every week. The Queen warned last night that focusing too much attention on the Ebola outbreak could lead to an upsurge in other deadly diseases such as malaria. She was speaking at an event at London’s Chatham House . Speaking to one of the world’s top epidemiologists, Professor David Heymann, she told him she worried that those with feverish symptoms which could be malaria are being turned away from hospitals because they were too busy dealing with Ebola patients. Professor Heymann said he was impressed at her at her level of knowledge on the subject and described her as ‘very perceptive.’ He said: ‘She felt very strongly about it. ‘She was very interested in Ebola because she said her doctor told her that there are more people dying from malaria every week than are dying from Ebola - and he was right. ‘Ebola is getting all the attention and malaria is not. ‘She is afraid that malaria will have a comeback because people are not paying enough attention to it.’ Professor Heymann is a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and was the former assistant director-general for infectious diseases at the World Health Organisation. He investigated the first Ebola outbreak in 1976 and has worked on three subsequent outbreaks since then. The monarch said she worried that Ebola, which has claimed 5,000 lives already, risked overshadowing the risk from other deadlier diseases like malaria, which kills the same number every week . After meeting the Queen at the event at London’s Chatham House, he added he believed that she was absolutely right in her concerns. He added: ‘There is a great fear that there will be an increase in deaths from common childhood diseases like malaria and diarrhoeal diseases. ‘She is very perceptive. Unfortunately this should not detract attention from Ebola, which must be stopped. It is a terrible disease. Queen Elizabeth II and Dr Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, remove the first brick in a new extension, during a visit to launch The Queen Elizabeth II Academy for Leadership in International Affairs at Chatham House in London . ‘What the Queen has done is call attention to other infectious diseases which are with us every day and cause much greater misery, but not in such a spectacular way. ‘She asked a very piercing and important question which means at she has analysed clearly the world situation of disease and she’s come to this conclusion which is the right conclusion.’ Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen was visiting foreign affairs think tank Chatham House to launch a new leadership academy. The Queen Elizabeth II Academy for Leadership in International Affairs will offer leaders the chance to develop skills to deal with major policy challenges and the critical issues facing the world. During her visit, she removed a brick from the wall between Chatham House - the Royal Institute of International Affairs - and neighbouring Ames House to symbolise the expansion next door, where the leadership academy will be based.","Queen has asked ‘piercing’ questions about how the disease control .

"HRT can protect women against Alzheimer's – providing it is taken at the menopause, according to  researchers. A study showed women who began taking hormone replacement therapy within five years of the menopause cut their risk of the disease by a third. But the findings suggest that if HRT is started in later life, it could give women a greater risk of developing the condition, leading some experts to believe there is a 'window of opportunity' when the benefits are maximised. The study found that women who began HRT within five years of menopause had a 30 per cent lower risk of Alzheimer¿s dementia than those who had not used HRT . The researchers at Johns Hopkins . University, in Baltimore, followed 1,768 women aged 65 and over for 11 . years, recording a history of their HRT use and the date their menopause . began. A total of 1,105 women had used some form of hormone therapy, the report in journal Neurology noted. During the study, 176 women developed . Alzheimer's disease, including 87 of the women who had taken hormone . therapy compared with 89 of the 663 who had not. The study found that women who began . HRT within five years of the menopause had a 30 per cent lower risk of . Alzheimer's dementia than those who had not used HRT. Many people with dementia are not dying in the place they want to, says Alzheimer’s Society research. Although two out of three people want to die in their own homes, in 2010 only six per cent of people with dementia did. This is compared to 21 per cent of the general population, says a report, My Life Until The End: Dying Well With Dementia. It found in many cases people with . dementia had not discussed their wishes around death and dying so no-one . was able to put services in place to make them a reality. The high needs of people with dementia . also mean it is difficult for carers to cope at home and there are . difficulties in coordinating care. The report said people with dementia are often not treated with dignity at the end of their lives. One man had a dislocated shoulder for 11 days until his death despite his family raising concerns with numerous doctors. The risk was unchanged among other . hormone users who began treatment more than five years after the . menopause. And the protective effect was even larger in women using HRT . for ten years or more. But the risk of dementia among women . who had started HRT when they were at least 65, which, depending on the . individual, can be more than a decade after the menopause, was almost . doubled. The protective effect from HRT may . come from boosting supplies of the hormone oestrogen, which is thought . to play a key role in keeping the brain healthy, or the improvement in . heart risk factors linked to HRT. Earlier this month a study found HRT can reduce the risk of heart attacks and heart failure. In the United Kingdom, women in their 50s are told to use HRT drugs short-term and for no longer than  five years. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at . Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'Previous research into HRT has shown . mixed results, but this useful study suggests the timing of hormone use . may be critical for either raising or reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. 'More work is needed to understand . this link and help women make informed decisions about whether to start . HRT, but these findings could be important for guiding future research.'","Scientists found 'critical window' near menopause where hormone therapy could be beneficial .

"Being a world leader is a tiring and demanding job. So it's no surprise that having to travel around the globe on a regular basis, heads of state like to enjoy a bit of luxury on their 'down time'. Brisbane, Australia, is the host city for this weekend's G20, with US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and Russian Premier Vladimir Putin, among others, all staying in the Queensland city. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama will be staying at the Marriott Hotel in Brisbane for the G20 summit . Obama's £1,370-a-night suite should help relax the US president after his meetings . Obama might well be hoping he gets chance to relax in the pool at the Marriott . And it is Obama who has set the bar with his hotel booking this year. The US President will base himself at the £1,370 (AUS$2,500) a night Marriott Hotel on Queen Street. The building comprises of 28 floors of 263 rooms, four of which are suites. There are also 10 meeting rooms, 7,750 sq ft of total meeting space. A buffet breakfast will set you back £19 (AUS$35). But for the same price Obama might want to feel 'more at home' and opt for the full American breakfast. His room, rather aptly, is the presidential suite on the top floor, with a king size bed and 131 square metres of room to play with.

However, his room may not appear quite the same as that described in the hotel brochure. Ahead of his visit, US security officials stripped down an entire floor surrounding the presidential suite to ensure Obama was not being spied upon. Mirrors and beds were removed from these rooms, and the suite itself was combed and verified as being safe for Obama to engage in private phone calls. The award-winning Dome Spa Retreat delivers an unrivalled spa experience. Also onsite are Motion Bar & Grill, a modern restaurant with an open kitchen plan and outdoor seating, and M Bar, a high-style bar. Obama's room also features executive lounge access.

"Not happy: Tiger Woods criticized Golf Digest for running the faked interview . Tiger Woods has lashed out at a golf magazine which published a 'below the belt' fake interview with him. Woods described the parody piece in Golf Digest - which featured photographs of a professional lookalike - as a 'grudge-fueled piece of character assassination'. In the piece an outlandish parody of the champion golfer plays up to his worst stereotypes - and says the five best golfers of all time are all him. The article - entitled My (Fake) Interview With Tiger*, with the subtitle '(Or how it plays out in my mind) was written by respected golf journalist Dan Jenkins for the magazine's December 2014 issue. It includes segments where the fake voice of Woods waxes lyrical about his love of firing everybody close to him, and seems to have no idea who his longtime friend and ally Mark O'Meera even is. The comedy persona also takes on Woods's reputation for being a lousy tipper, and suggests waiters should 'get a better job'. Towards the end of the interview, pseudo-Woods also takes the unusual step of naming himself as all five entries in a list of the best golfers of all time. The character said: 'I rank me at Pebble Beach in 2000 first, me in the '97 Masters second, me at St. Andrews in 2000 third, me at Hoylake in 2006 fourth, and me at Bay Hill, Firestone, Memorial and Torrey fifth ... pick a year.' However, the real Tiger Woods failed to see the funny side of the piece, and tried to get even writing a blog post attacking Golf Digest's journalism. He began: 'Did you read Dan Jenkins’ interview with me in the latest Golf Digest? I hope not. 'Because it wasn’t me. It was some jerk he created to pretend he was talking to me.' He continued: 'All athletes know that we will be under scrutiny from the media. But this concocted article was below the belt. 'Good-natured satire is one thing, but no fair-minded writer would put someone in the position of having to publicly deny that he mistreats his friends, takes pleasure in firing people, and stiffs on tips- and a lot of other slurs, too.' Woods added that he and his agent have written to Golf Digest demanding an explanation - though editors of the magazine have already responded by reiterating that their article is a clearly-marked parody. 'Below the belt': Woods wrote an angry blog post about the non-interview, which was trailed on the cover (bottom center)","Woods lashed out at article in latest issue of Golf Digest magazine .

"The Montana judge who called a 14-year-old girl who was raped by her teacher then killed herself 'older than her years' tried to defend himself by seeming to trivialize the crimes of the instructor he sent to prison for just 30 days, it was revealed. 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape,' Judge Todd Baugh told the Billings Gazette. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' He later apologized for his words - but not the sentence he handed down, saying it was appropriate based on the specifics of the case. Stacey Dean Rambold drew a sentence of just one month in jail even though he admitted to a charge of raping Cherice Morales when she was a troubled high school freshman, age 14, at Billings Senior High School in 2008. She later killed herself weeks before her 17th birthday. Her mother said the affair with Rambold was 'a major factor' in her suicide. Defense: Judge Todd Baugh, pictured, was forced to apologize for remarks he made during the case. 'What I said was demeaning to all women, not what I believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing,' he said . Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice Morales killed herself . Cherice's mother stormed . out of the courtroom Monday after he handed down the ruling. Auliea Hanlon later accused Judge Baugh of 'blaming the victim' and said the ruling had made her lose her faith in the justice system. In the court hearing, Judge Baugh, 66, said that when he reviewed . taped police interviews with Cherice and concluded that even though she . was 35 years younger than Rambold and clearly troubled, she was 'as much . in control of the situation' as the teacher, the Gazette reported. Judge Baugh also said that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' - which mitigated Rambold's crimes. Ms Hanlon said she was outraged by the judge's words. 'As I looked on in disbelief, Judge Baugh stated that our teenage daughter was as much in control of the situation as her teacher was,' she said in a statement. 'She wasn’t even old enough to get a driver’s license. But Judge Baugh, who never met our daughter, justified the paltry sentence saying she was older than her chronological age. Rambold, 54, faces another 10 years in prison after the Attorney General's Office filed an appeal on Friday . Fury: Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's mother, said Judge Baugh resorted to 'blaming the victim' and pointed out that her daughter wasn't even old enough to drive a car . 'I guess somehow it makes a rape more acceptable if you blame the victim, even if she was only 14.' Outraged Montanans are organizing protests outside the courthouse in Billings and the Montana National Organization for Women has asked the state to investigate whether Rambold's sentence can be made longer. Activists have also began calling for challengers to step up and run against the judge, who is seeking a fifth term in office in 2014. He has been unopposed for at least the last two elections. On Wednesday, Judge Baugh backtracked and issued an apology. 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong,' he told the Gazette. He added: 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' At the hearing Monday, attorneys for Rambold, 54, said the teacher has lost his job, his license, his house and his wife and suffered the 'scarlet letter of the Internet' as a result of the allegations. Defense lawyer Jay Lansing said his client had been punished enough for his crime. Judge Baugh said he disagreed with the decision to prosecute Rambold after he was kicked out of sex offender treatment program - announced last week that he is running for re-election and is thus far unopposed. Warning: It was later revealed that administrators at Billings Senior High School, pictured, had warned Rambold not to touch female students or be alone with them back in 2004 . The Billings Gazette reports that Rambold was arrested in 2008 after police and administrators at Billings Senior High School learned that he had targeted 14-year-old Cherice, a troubled freshman at the school, and groomed her for sex. The school district had warned Rambold four years earlier to avoid touching or being alone with female students, it was later revealed. The district paid Cherice's mother $96,000 as part of a wrongful death settlement. The teacher, who was then 49, was charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors allege he had an ongoing sexual relationship with the girl. Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice killed herself. Her fault? Judge Todd Baugh ruled that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' and that in listening to the girl's police interviews, he came to believe that she was in control of the relationship with her teacher . The girl's mother, Auliea Hanlon, says that Rambold's sexual abuse was a 'major factor' in her daughter's suicide. The . Gazette reports that with the girl's death, prosecutors were forced to . defer prosecution. They agreed to dismiss the case if Rambold admitted . to one count of rape and agreed to enter a three-stage sex offender . treatment program. In . December, prosecutors revived the case and re-filed charges after they . learned that the teacher had been kicked out of the program for having . unsupervised visits with minors. Rambold's . defense lawyer said those minors were his family members.The attorney . said Rambold was attending another treatment program and was considered a . low risk to re-offend. Judge Baugh seemed to agree. He said that the former teacher's violations at the sex offender treatment program were not enough to warrant prosecution. Ms Hanlon, Cherice's mother, stormed out of the courtroom when the judge handed down the ruling and shouted 'You people suck!' at the judge. Montana District Court Judge G. Todd Baugh announced on Monday that Cherice Morales seemed just as responsible for a sexual relationship with her teacher Stacey Dean Rambold as the teacher was - even though Cherice was troubled and only 14 at the time. He also pronounced that the girl, who killed herself two years later, appeared to be 'older than her chronological age.' Baugh, 66, is running for a fifth term overseeing cases in Montana's 13th Judicial District. He has been on the bench since 1986. He announced on August 21 that he is running for re-election. So far, he is running unopposed. He recently told KULR-TV: 'When I was younger I thought, ""By golly, by the time I get to be 66, I'll be way old and ready to retire,"" but then I discovered when I got here that I’m not.' If re-elected in 2014, he would serve another six-year term. He ran unopposed in 2008 and 2002, state elections records show. He is the son of NFL Hall of Fame quarterback 'Slingin'' Sammy Baugh. Baugh did not return a call from MailOnline seeking comment on the case.","Cherice Morales was a troubled 14-year-old high school freshman when teacher Stacey Dean Rambold, then 49, groomed her for sex .

He now uses it to create unique works of art. 'Ever since I was a kid I knew I had a special connection between my eye and my nose,’ he said. ‘As I grew up I started realising air and liquids could go out of my eye if I put them through my nose. ‘Now I am the inventor of a new painting style in the art world. ‘When I decided I would do this for a living my whole family thought I was going crazy - as well as many other people. ‘But as time went by they began to understand the art I call eye-painting.’ Eye spy: Mr Granato looks down at one of his works, created entirely with watercolour paint . Here's looking at you, kid: In Leandro's case the appreciation of his art is not just in the eye of the beholder . Signed and sealed: Mr Granato's only addition by hand is his signature on his finished piece of art . Mr Granato spent two years training and developing a special formula of paint that does not damage his eyes. Leandro believes he is the only person in the world to paint this way. ‘My motivation to become an artist first came when my grandfather died because of cancer,’ said Mr Granato. ‘After this loss, I started painting to overcome this pain.' Dripping with cool: Leandro creates one of his masterpieces . Leandro Granato is working with a children's hospital to raise money for cancer research by selling his art . Mr Granato cites American artist . Jackson Pollock as one of his inspirations. The 20th century painter . made his name by using unusual painting techniques, developing his own unique style of drip painting. He said: ‘Jackson Pollock is one of my inspirations mainly because at first nobody understood him, and he was pointed out to be crazy.’ Leandro is planning a charity event to help a children's cancer hospital in Argentina. He is also searching for more galleries and art dealers to help him spread the word about his art in Europe. ‘Some people like my abilities, some don't,’ said Leandro. ‘Some say I'm crazy, but my technique doesn't hurt my body. ‘I believe crazy people are often the ones that build the roads that the wise ones will then travel across. ‘I'm constantly being examined by expert doctors, and the formula I came up with is harmless. ‘It will not cause me any health problems in the future.’","Leandro Granato can snort up to a pint-and-a-half of watercolour .

"Disbelief: Commander Eddie Grenfell has campaigned for the British government to introduce a specific Arctic medal for survivors of the convoys . The British Arctic convoy heroes who risked their lives to help transport crucial supplies to Russia during World War II have been told they cannot accept a medal for valour from the country. The Russian Embassy wrote to survivors of the notoriously perilous sea campaign - who saw 3,000 of their comrades killed - to inform them it intended to award them with the Medal of Ushakov as a symbol of the country's gratitude. But the Foreign Office has blocked the Russian's government's plans to honour Britain's Arctic heroes, because it said it would break rules surrounding the acceptance of medals. Russia has already awarded the Ushakov medal to veterans from Australia, Canada and the U.S. for their role in the Arctic convoys, which ferried vital supplies and munitions to the Soviet Union to help fight off the advance of Hitler between 1941 and 1945. Commander Eddie Grenfell, 92, who has been lobbying the British government to introduce a specific Arctic medal for the past 15 years, expressed disbelief at this latest blow to the surviving sailors. 'I cannot believe the Foreign Office, William Hague, is doing this,' he told the Portsmouth News. 'This is not a campaign medal, this is a medal for valour. He's saying that what we did out there, what we went through, had no valour at all.' He said the Russian government should go ahead and award the Ushakov medal. 'What I say is, why don't they give it to us? What would our government do? Take it off us?' Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock branded the decision an 'absolute disgrace' and a 'slur on this country'. The Foreign Office said permission to . accept a foreign award could not be given if a UK award had been given . for the same services, and pointed out that the Arctic convoy veterans . were eligible for the World War II Atlantic Star. Commander Grenfell has previously dismissed suggestions the Atlantic Star - created in recognition of a separate Naval campaign and extended to include those who served on the convoys - was adequate recognition for survivors of the terrifying trips as he continued to press for a specific Arctic medal. A statement from the Foreign Office said: 'The rules on the acceptance of foreign awards state that for permission to be given for an award to be accepted, there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years. ‘Additionally, permission cannot be granted if they have received, or are expected to receive, a UK award for the same services.' The Russian Embassy said the Foreign Office decision was a matter of 'deep regret', and added it hoped the British government would disregard the 'bureaucratic formality' and change its position. Russian run: Thick snow and ice covers the deck of HMS Vansittart in the Arctic in February 1943 . Last year Commander Grenfell told of the sense of betrayal among Britain's Arctic convoy survivors over David Cameron's failure to introduce a specific Arctic medal. While in opposition the Conservative pledged to recognise the veterans with a dedicated commemorative medal if elected. But after becoming prime minister Mr Cameron pointed to the extension of the Atlantic Star Medal to those who served in the Arctic as a mark of the nation's gratitude. But campaigners argue that 95 per cent of the 66,500 men who served in the Arctic Convoys had already earned the Atlantic Star before being conscripted on to the dreaded ‘Russian Run’. Commander Grenfell said that most Arctic sailors had been drafted from the Home Fleet and so would have been eligible for the Atlantic Star regardless.","Russia wants to award the Medal of Ushakov to Britain's Arctic convoy veterans as a symbol of the country's gratitude .

"The government is to review a controversial acne drug that has been blamed for causing depression and a number of suicides. Health ministers have ordered the probe after meeting families who say their loved ones committed suicide after taking Roaccutane. The Commission on Human Medicines, will review all the data on the drug over the next two months and the risk of adverse psychiatric reactions. A government panel is set to review the controversial acne drug Roaccutane which has been blamed for causing depression and a number of suicides . It will include experts in clinical pharmacology, dermatology, psychiatry and a representative from the British Association of Dermatologists. News of the review came on Friday as some of the families protested outside the headquarters of the manufacturer Roche, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. They included the parents of Jamie Sillcock, 26, who suffocated himself in December 2012 after years of mental health problems he blamed on the drug. He was prescribed Roaccutane at 16 but stopped 18 months later when he began suffering anxiety, fatigue and blurred vision. Jamie Sillcock suffocated himself in 2012 after years of mental health problems he blamed on the drug. His parents, Melvin and Lorraine, say he never got the drug out of his system and was plagued by mental health problems for eight years . His . parents, Melvin and Lorraine, say he never got the drug out of his . system and was plagued by mental health problems for eight years. Mr . Sillcock, 62, a photographer from Sittingbourne, Kent said: ‘They need . to find out why this drug affects a percentage of people in the way it . does. ‘It's like Russian roulette - no one knows how much damage it will do to each person. ‘The manufacturers are making millions off Roaccutane - but it has caused devastation for thousands of families. ‘We're pleased that the government appear to be taking this seriously, at last. ‘I don't think this would have happened without the pressure from the families so we do see it as a small victory. Medical student Jon Medland committed suicide in . 2004. His family said his death was linked to the drug Roaccutane . ‘However we won't stop fighting until this drug is either made safe or taken off the shelves for good.’ Jonathan . Medland, 57, from Barnstaple, lost his 22-year-old son Jon, who . committed suicide three weeks after starting a course of Roaccutane. A Roche . spokeswoman said: ‘Roaccutane has transformed the lives of many acne . sufferers, but like most medications it can have side effects. ‘Whilst . no definitive cause and effect relationship has been established to . directly link mood swings and depression with the drug, there have been . rare reports, amongst both those taking Roaccutane and acne sufferers in . general. ‘As . a caution we recommend that anybody experiencing these, or other . possible side effects with the treatment, to tell their doctor . immediately.’ Jon Medland's parents Jonathan and Pam Medland and his sister Casey. Jon's family blame his death on the drug that he had begun taking just three weeks before to help cure acne . In 2012 Jack Bowlby, 16, the nephew of racehorse trainer Jenny Pitman, was found dead at his boarding school. His family said they felt Roaccutane 'may have played a part' in his death, and that patients and their parents should be 'very aware of the possible risks'. The same year Melissa Martin-Hughes, 18, hanged herself after spiralling into depression because of severe acne. The grammar school girl, who was predicted to get three A*s in her A-levels, had been taking the drug for her condition. News of the review comes just after it was revealed that Roaccutane is being illegally sold online by dealers in Britain. The medicines watchdog launched an investigation after The Mail on Sunday discovered three websites, including eBay, selling the drug.","Roaccutane is to be reviewed by the Commission on Human Medicines .

"Two Secret Service agents on President Obama's detail has been reprimanded after trying to force himself into a woman's hotel room to collect a bullet that he had left there after meeting her hours before in the hotel bar. Ignacio Zamora Jr., who works as a senior supervisor in charge of more than 20 agents, was investigated by his superiors after a hotel staffer reported his unusual behavior. The ensuing investigation also found that he and another agent, Timothy Barraclough, were sending sexually suggestive emails to a female subordinate. Both men have now been suspended from the Secret Service and the incident remains under investigation. Scandal prone: The latest Secret Service incident happened in May of this year when an agent (not one of those pictured above) tried to get a bullet that he left in a woman's hotel room . Scene: The agent was off duty when he met the woman in the bar of the Hay-Adams Hotel just one block from the White House and he spent time with her in her hotel room . The latest scandal comes a year after the agency came under fire when one agent got into an argument with a prostitute in Colombia and a dozen others became involved with the incident and resulting cover up. The Washington Post has revealed that the backlash that resulted from the Cartegena scandal was not enough to scare the Secret Service agents straight because this latest incident took place in May of this year. The May incident began when Zamora met a woman in the bar of the Hay-Adams hotel and they went back to her hotel room. The Hay-Adams is a luxury hotel located just one block from the White House, making it’s bar a popular hangout for agents and other government workers. The President and his family has also stayed there, and he hosted a dinner there earlier this year when he was trying to reach out to Republicans over budget negotiations. Brushing past it: The report says that the agency does not have institutional issues but just problems with certain agents who were found to solicit prostitutes and drink with locals while prepping for presidential visits . Close: One of the two agents who is the subject of the investigation was a favorite of former First Lady Laura Bush (seen here with other agents in 2002 and not necessarily Ignacio Zamora Jr, who is the one from the latest scandal) During the ensuing investigation, Zamora took the bullets out of the state-issued gun that he had with him even though he was off duty. When he left later that night, he realized that he had left one bullet inside the room and asked her to let him back in. The woman, who has not been identified, would not allow him back in so he went down to the front desk of the hotel identifying himself as a Secret Service agent and asking to be let into the room. The clerk at the desk thought that the request seemed strange and the hotel contacted the White House to report the suspicious behavior. Officials then launched a probe into Zamora's activity and read through his emails on his government-issued Blackberry where they found that he and Barraclough had been sending sexually suggestive emails to another Secret Service employee. International incident: In May 2012, a Secret Service agent who was in Colombia ahead of the President's visit to the country got into an altercation with a prostitute . Woman in the middle: Dania Suarez was identified as the prostitute involved in the Cartagena scandal . The Washington Post says that the female agent's name has not been revealed because she has not be reprimanded in connection to the emails. 'We have always maintained that the Secret Service has a professional and dedicated workforce,' Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told the paper. 'Periodically we have isolated incidents of misconduct, just like every organization does.' Zamora has been pulled from his position, while Barraclough has been moved off the detail to a separate part of the division, people familiar with the case told the Post. Barraclough was given the prestigious promotion to the President's detail four years ago, but Zamora has had close contact with the first family for longer. Restoring trust: Even new Secret Service head Julia Pierson thinks that the report is flawed since it is based on an anonymous survey of agents who were effectively asked to report 'rumors and gossip' Before being added to the President's detail himself, The Washington Post reports that he was in charge of the agency's Mexico City office and then returned to the United States and was tasked with leading Laura Bush's detail while her husband was president. In her memoir, Mrs Bush specifically thanks Mr Zamora for keeping her safe in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The new investigation was revealed as part of an inspector general report that began in the wake of the Cartagena scandal which lead to the then-director to step down. President Obama then promoted Julia Pierson to head the agency, making her the first ever female director of the department.","Secret Service supervisor Ignacio Zamora Jr has been removed from the President's detail following an altercation at the Hay-Adams Hotel in DC .

"Bureaucrats in charge of the Government’s controversial green policies have benefited from a multi-million-pound bonus bonanza since the last election. The total amount of performance-related handouts given to civil servants at the Department for Energy and Climate Change has almost tripled since Labour’s final year in office to £9million. One official received a bonus of £12,000, while others received payments of more than £7,000, to reward them for their work promoting renewable power such as wind farms. MP Priti Patel asked a series of parliamentary questions that revealed the amount of money the DECC is spending on bonuses . Last night MPs lambasted the department for handing out so much at a time when consumers’ energy bills were going up as a result of the very green policies they are working on. Last year, the DECC admitted that its green policies – which will fund a new generation of wind farms and nuclear reactors – will add an average of £95 to gas and electricity bills. A separate parliamentary question has revealed more questionable expenditure at DECC, where more than £7.6million has been paid out over the last two years in pay-offs for staff who have left the department. It means 141 people leaving have pocketed an average of £54,595 each. Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey heads the department that has spent £9million on bonuses . And earlier this month, the Daily Mail revealed that the department has gone on a recruitment spree since the last election, with staff numbers soaring by more than a quarter since May 2010. Now, thanks to a series of parliamentary questions by the Tory MP Priti Patel, it has emerged that the department – headed by Lib Dem Ed Davey – has also been spending millions on bonuses. In 2011/12, the latest year for which figures are available, some £9,072,483 was spent on bonuses and other payments on top of salary. This is a 156 per cent rise on the £3,538,274 total in 2009/10, Labour’s last full year in office.The figures show that 1,062 staff received bonuses and other payments. The 20 top payments included one payout of £12,000, five of £10,000, and 14 payouts of £7,500. To make things worse, the independent Committee on Climate Change, which advises the Government on energy policy has had its own bonus spree, with taxpayer-funded bonuses increasing by 43 per cent over the past four years. The highest was £15,000. Miss Patel said: ‘Families will be shocked to see their taxes being used to fund a dangerously expensive and excessive bonus and entitlement culture among bureaucrats who are already handsomely paid. ‘Not only are officials at DECC detached from reality as they plan to destroy our landscape with wind turbines and drive up energy costs with their green energy fantasies,  they also have no concept of the need to make savings  in Whitehall.’ A spokesman for DECC said the extra payments included, as well as bonuses, overtime and other superannuation costs. She said: ‘We are working very hard to ensure energy bills are as affordable as possible.‘The Department focuses bonuses on its best performers. We believe performance awards help drive high performance towards achieving important policy objectives.’","In 2011/12  £9,072,483 was spent on bonuses and other .

"Martin Odegaard was born just six months after Norway's last appearance at a World Cup finals, but they might not have to wait another decade and a half before they're back on the biggest stage if Europe's latest teenage sensation fulfills the hype. Stromsgodset's midfield magician has been linked with Europe's finest at the tender age of 15, and is already the Norwegian Tippeligaen's most talked-about player. VIDEO: Scroll down to see 15-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard in action . Wonderkid: Odegaard in action for Stromsgodset, but will we see him in the Champions League before long? Hot property: The 15-year-old already has three goals for the Norwegian side . He's a Liverpool fan - you can probably thank John Arne Riise for that - but Real Madrid could be ready to table a £12million plus bid for the attacking midfielder, who is already firmly bedded into David Nielsen's side, scoring three times in 12 league and cup appearances with half the season gone. Fellow European giants Bayern Munich and Manchester United have already seen Odegaard in action first-hand, welcoming the wonderkid to train with them last winter. He also trained with Bundesliga side Stuttgart, and supposedly 'visited' Manchester City last year. He signed a professional contract with Stromsgodset in May to keep him at the club for 2014 and 2015, but the two-time Norwegian champions will be bracing themselves for a bombardment of interest, and could receive a fee to strengthen their finances for years to come. Still a kid: Odegaard signed a professional contract with Stromsgodset earlier this year . Even at this age, Odegaard lacks very little. He has balance, agility, confidence and a ferocious shot. To add, the Drammen-born star has shown the strength to suggest he can mix it with the big boys in the big leagues, not shying away from duels with defenders twice his size. Odegaard has attracted some firm attention on these isles, but from north of the border from Celtic. Earlier in July, Hoops manager Ronny Deila rejected claims the Scottish Premiership champions could not afford to sign the young starlet. 'It’s incorrect to say that Martin is outwith our range,' Deila told Norwegian TV. 'Martin must do what is best for him and we will do what is best for us - we’ll see if our paths meet at a later date. 'Martin is a good player but not even close to being a Celtic player at the moment. But there’s no doubt that he has the capability to be in the future.' Invest in youth: Norwegian press have suggested Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid are eyeing up at the youngster . Get them young: Odegaard trained at Manchester United last year, along with Bayern Munich, but new Reds boss Louis van Gaal has other transfer targets on his mind . It is not uncommon for clubs to battle it out with several other giants for the signature of a young star, and this is no different. In fact, Odegaard's father, former professional Hans Erik Odegaard, told Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang there have been over 30 clubs asking about his son. 'I can't name the clubs, but almost regardless of who you name, they have been in contact with us,' Odegaard senior told Verdens Gang. Verdens Gang reported that clubs such as Barcelona, Manchester United, Manchester City, Juventus, PSG and Ajax have visited Stromsgodset's Marinelyst home ground to see Odegaard in action. In the heart: Odegaard is a Liverpool fan, and is thought to have had over 30 clubs contact him . Compatriot: Former left-back John Arne Riise, a Liverpool fan favourite, hailed from Norway . 'We want Martin to develop,' said his . 40-year-old father, adding that it would be impossible to visit all the . clubs that have been in contact. 'That . (development) has been the focus over the years. If you start to think . about other things, I think the development comes to a halt,' Odegaard . said. This isn't a . matter of if Odegaard will leave Norway, more a matter of when. With . just weeks until the new season in the Premier League, Bundesliga and La .

"Scientists investigating the brain of one of the world's most famous autistic people have found several features that can explain her unique talents. Temple Grandin, professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University, is what is known as a 'savant' - someone who shows some of the social deficits of autism yet also has some exceptional abilities. A tireless campaigner for autism . research and awareness she is known for her exceptional non-verbal . intelligence, spatial reasoning, sharp visual acuity and an uncanny gift . for spelling and reading. Savant: Professor Temple Grandin, left. Unlike controls (top right), Professor Grandin has lateral ventricles (bottom right) that are significantly larger on the left side of her brain than on the right . The subject of an award-winning eponymous-titled biographical film starring Claire Danes, Professor Grandin was also in 2010 listed in the Time 100 list of the 100 most influential people in the world in the 'Heroes' category. In a bid to understand her cognitive gifts, and the accompanying weaknesses, a group of neuroscientists gave the professor a series of psychological tests and scanned her brain using several imaging processes. Jason Cooperrider, a graduate student at the University of Utah who presented the work at the Society for Neuroscience's annual meeting, explained their aims to the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. 'We asked how might brain structure and function be related to both outstanding ability and outstanding disability — the autism — within the same brain,' he said. The professor received exceptionally high scores on several psychological assessments, including tests of reading, spelling and spatial reasoning. She achieved a phenomenal perfect score on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices test, which assesses non-verbal reasoning. Her weakest skill was found to be verbal working memory. Scans showed Professor Grandin's brain is significantly larger than that of three matched neurotypical control subjects - something seen in some children with autism but which scientists do not yet understand. Her lateral ventricles - chambers which hold cerebrospinal fluid - are different in size, with the left much much larger than the right, a finding Mr Cooperrider described as 'quite striking'. On both sides, the professor possesses unusually large amygdala, sectors of the brain which are part of the limbic system and have been shown to perform a primary role in the processing of memory and emotional reactions. The researchers also traced white-matter connections in Professor Grandin's brain using diffusion tensor imaging, finding what they dubbed 'enhanced' connections in the left precuneus, a region involved with episodic memory, visuospatial processing, reflections upon self, and aspects of consciousness. Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with, and relates to, other people. It also affects how they make sense of the world around them. It is a spectrum condition, which means that, while all people with autism share certain difficulties, their condition will affect them in different ways. Some people with autism are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need a lifetime of specialist support. People with autism may also experience over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colours. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism. People with Asperger syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language. (Source: The National Autistic Society) They found she also has enhanced white matter in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. This region connects the frontal and occipital lobes, which might explain the professor's keen visual acuity, the researchers said. In keeping with the double-edged nature of Professor Grandin's condition, she also has some weak connections, which the researchers said were defined in part by decreased integrity of brain-tissue fibres. One weak area was her left inferior frontal gyrus, which includes the famous Broca's area, which has functions linked to speech production and impairment of which can leave brain injury sufferers mute. Professor Grandin's right fusiform gyrus - a brain region involved in facial and body recognition - also had compromised connections. The findings agreed with the professor's own personal assessments of her abilities. She has previously written how words are, for her, only understood when translated into pictures and described how she finds socialising 'boring'. She has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. She has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her sensory integration dysfunction and has structured her lifestyle to avoid sensory overload.","Test subject Temple Grandin is professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University and one of the world's most famous autistic people .

"Celebrity chef Matt Moran has leapt to the defence of Jamie Oliver who was blasted by the Victorian child commissioner for being a 'd***head' on Tuesday after he admitted he disciplined his daughter by feeding her one of the world's hottest chilis. Oliver admitted on Monday that  when one of his four young children became unruly or disrespectful,  he would coat their sliced apple with a type of chili known as the Scotch bonnet - because 'you can't smack naughty kids'. In an interview with Daily Mail Australia to mark ShopSmall month, the ARIA owner Moran said: 'Look, I probably wouldn't do that. I've had some fun with my kids over the years. It's all in jest, all a bit of fun. 'No one's going to hurt their kid. I don't think Jamie went out there to make his kids suffer. Someone's taken it a bit too far.' Scroll down for video . Victoria's children's commissioner Bernie Geary blasted Jamie Oliver (pictured, above) with wife, Jools and, from left, daughters Poppy, 12, Petal, 5, Daisy, 11, and four-year-old son Buddy . 'Way off the planet': After Jamie Oliver (above, left) admitted he used ultra-hot chilis to discipline his children when they were naughty, Victoria's children's commissioner, Bernie Geary (above, right) described him as 'cruel' and ' a d***head' Chef Matt Moran (pictured) came to the defence of Jamie Oliver and also criticised his . On Tuesday, Victoria's children's commissioner Bernie Geary blasted Oliver, calling him 'a d***head' and cruel' for disciplining his daughter by feeding her one of the world's hottest chilis. Scotch bonnets have a  rating on the Scoville scale, which measures chili heat, of 100,000 to 350,000, making them up to 140 times hotter than a normal chili pepper. Speaking with Radio 3AW's Neil Mitchell, Mr Geary said, 'He's a d***head Neil. It's just not appropriate to use cruelty as a form of discipline.' Mr Geary went on to say that Oliver's chili trick was a form of 'child abuse'. 'This bloke, he should realise the influence he has as a high-profile public figure and a high-profile father,' Mr Geary said. 'If he's joking it's not even appropriate because some parents and families might think it's a legitimate or alternative way of disciplining children. He's way off the planet as far as I'm concerned.' A scorcher: the 'Scotch bonnet' chili (pictured) that Jamie Oliver feeds his children is 140 hotter than a normal pepper . Mr Geary was responding to Oliver's confession about how he disciplines his children, saying on Monday, 'I give them chillies for punishment. It is not very popular beating kids any more, it's not very fashionable and you are not allowed to do it and if you are a celebrity chef like me it does not look very good in the paper. So you need a few options.' Oliver said he had once tricked his 12-year-old daughter into eating an ultra-hot Scotch Bonnet, much to the annoyance of his wife, Jools. At the BBC Good Food Show, Oliver said: 'Poppy was quite disrespectful and rude to me and she pushed her luck. In my day I would have got a bit of a telling-off but you are not allowed to do that. 'Five minutes later she thought I had forgotten and I hadn't. She asked for an apple. I cut it up into several pieces and rubbed it with Scotch Bonnet and it worked a treat. She ran up to mum and said, 'This is peppery'. I was in the corner laughing. [Jools] said to me, 'Don't you ever do that again'.' Mr Geary, who is Victoria's Commissioner for Children and Young People, said Oliver's role as an educator made his actions even more troubling. 'He purports to be a teacher and a role model and works with children. If he worked in a school in Victoria they'd sack him,' he said. Given his struggle to impose order on daughters Poppy Honey Rosie, Daisy Boo Pamela, 11, and Petal Blossom Rainbow, five, and son Buddy Bear Maurice, four, perhaps it is no surprise Oliver is not keen to add to his family. He revealed he argued with his wife of 14 years about the idea, saying: 'You know what she said last night? She is 40 in about ten days and I took her out and she goes, 'OK are we going to have another kid then?' I said, 'You what?'. Between the preparation and the simmering family tensions, Christmas lunch is often a painful experience for many Australians. But there are ways you can make it easier, according to celebrity chef Matt Moran. He provided some of his top tips about how to prepare the perfect festive meal to mark ShopSmall month, a month-long campaign to encourage customers to buy from the nation's small businesses. 1. Prepare, prepare, prepare . 'To me, it's all about preparation,' Moran told Daily Mail Australia. In other words, spend some time getting your meal together before the big day. It will make your special day that much easier. 'Have everything done, making stuff beforehand, so you're just basically cooking things in the morning. 'Your brandy custard should be done prior. Your Christmas pudding should already be done.' 'The last thing you really want to do is be spending more time in the kitchen when you should be opening presents and having a lot of fun.' 2. Too much is never enough . One of the best things about Christmas meals is the days and days of leftovers it produces, Moran said. And you shouldn't be afraid of making too much food. 'The great thing I love about a ham and a turkey is you are eating it for the next five days. To me, that's the festive season. I love that. 'I love the fact I can (grab) some ham four days later and have it for breakfast. I can have turkey sandwiches three or four days after.' 3. Buy local produce - it tastes better . Whatever you do, make sure you buy local, Moran said. 'There's nothing better than going into your local shop.' 'People want that one-on-one contact. The guy recognises you straight away - to me, that's just a nice feeling.' 'It's about buying local, supporting your guy,' he said. That could from your local butcher, fishmonger or fruit and veg provider. 'And it's Christmas, it's a festive time and you know if you buy local, it always tastes better too.' 4. Try something different . Yes, you look forward to sinking your teeth into a delicious slab of Christmas ham each year. It can stay on the table. But why not add a little extra something else to your meal? Moran told Daily Mail Australia you should take the opportunity to try something a little different this festive season. 'Go to your local grower's markets, your local fruit and veg guy, go in there and ask ... what is actually good. 'Go down to your fishmarkets. You might find something a little bit different. You might find your local fishmonger might have some... Balmain bugs or some scampi.' 5. If you want to chill out, go out . If the prospect of guests trashing your home gives you the sweats, there's the option of taking your meal somewhere else, Moran said. For the top chef, Christmas is a time of family and friends, and he keeps his restaurants closed for the day. 'We don't open Christmas Day and the reason why we don't is I spent many, many years as a young chef working Christmas Day. 'I missed out on about a dozen of them. I just always have that in my mind... I don't want my staff to (miss out).' ARIA chef Matt Moran has provided some of his top tips to make a perfect Christmas meal . The family pose together for the December issue of Red magazine, where the couple talk about family life . 'The woman wants another baby. So watch this space. But with all the power in my body we are not having another baby.' He admitted, however, that Mrs Oliver usually wins the arguments at home – even about food. He said: 'My wife loves a destroyed steak. I have been with her since I was 18 years old, how romantic, but it is hard to keep loving someone when they want a well-done steak. I have tried to tell her but she is a very single-minded, dominant woman.' The couple – who have a combined wealth of £240million – met when they were 17. The chef drove to a cinema, but crashed the car. He has joked she started dating him out of pity as a result. Mrs Oliver, a former model, has worked as her husband's PA and now designs children's clothing. Jamie Oliver, who was named as a Special Achievement Honouree at the LOVIE awards last week, said his wife Jools has asked whether they can have another child - their fifth - but the chef has said no .","Celebrity chef Matt Moran jumps to the defence of Jamie Oliver after discipline row: 'Someone's taken it a bit too far'

"We've all stood in Body Shop and wondered if the strawberry bubble bath tastes as good as it smells. I dare say some of us have given it a whirl (and swiftly regretted it...). But now there is a beauty product that really is good enough to eat. Australian natural skincare brand MooGoo have created a range of lip balms made entirely of ingredients that are chemical-free, completely  vegetarian and wholly edible - especially important in lip products where most of the substance does end up eventually being eaten. Natural skincare brand MooGoo have launched edible lip balms for £3.90 . MooGoo use red beetroot extract instead of dye from squashed cochineal beetles . The range features three lip balms, Cow Lick, Tingling Honey, and Strawberry Tinted, the last of which gets its lasting red hue from red beetroot extract rather than the usual cochineal insect dye. A MooGoo spokesperson said: 'When we were looking at how to add a subtle and natural colour to our Edible Lip Balms, we found that most other brands used ""Cochineal"" as their natural red colouring. 'This can also be called ""Carmine"", ""Natural Colours"" or ""Natural Red Number 4"". This is made by boiling Cochineal insects in water and extracting the red die from the insects as it breaks down. 'Although there is nothing wrong with this (except if you are a Cochineal beetle), it made us feel a bit funny about having bug residue on our lips, and so we looked for something nicer.' After searching, MooGoo found that red beetroot extract gave a much more natural looking colour, and was totally bug-free and healthy when ingested. And instead of tasting like beetroot, MooGoo use a natural strawberry flavour for the taste. The brand's all-natural balms were formulated after reading the ingredients on a lip balm they were used during a long car trip. Australian natural skincare brand MooGoo have created a range of lip balms made entirely of ingredients that are chemical-free . Cochineal insects are usually used to make red dye used in make up . 'The feel of the lip balms we used to use were great. The chemicals used were not. Especially on lips where most of the product is eventually eaten. 'Chemicals can build up in the body over time.  What for years might be harmless, can all of a sudden cause a reaction. 'We have made a lip balms that feel similar to our favorite lip balms from before. However, because we make it for our own use, the ingredients are all edible.'","Natural skincare brand MooGoo have launched edible lip balms for £3.90 .

"Nasa's next generation of space suit - the agency's first in 20 years - will look familiar to fans of computer generated cartoon classic Toy Story. That's because the new white and green Z-1 suit bears more than a passing resemblance to the interstellar hero Buzz Lightyear. The prototype suit was revealed in a host of pictures uploaded today to photo-sharing website Flickr, and it boasts trim of the same hue as that worn by the space ranger action figure. To infinity, and beyond! Nasa's new Z-1 prototype space suit, which, with its fetching bright green trim, looks rather like that worn by cartoon hero Buzz Lightyear . Nasa's inspiration? The Star Command space ranger strikes a similar pose in Toy Story 2 . A large hemispherical transparent dome covering the wearer's head also looks remarkably similar to that worn by Buzz - although the latest pictures do not make clear if Nasa's version comes pre-programmed catchphrases. The main advance in Nasa's rather more primitive effort is that it will have an entry point at the rear to make it easier to don than previous suits. Astronauts will be able to climb into it as quickly as you see in films, and not take an hour as they do now. The new suit will also effectively be its own airlock, dispensing with the need to spend time getting the pressure right. The 'Z-1 Prototype Spacesuit and Portable Life Support System (PLSS) 2.0', to give it its full title, will hopefully be ready in the next couple of years. On the rear will be a giant backpack which doubles as a hatch that can latch onto another space ship or Rover-like vehicle. There is therefore no need for ‘Prebreathing’ which involves using oxygen to make sure the suit is the same pressure as the ship, and can take up to an hour. There will be better bearings on the legs, ankles, hips and waist to help astronauts move more naturally whilst a urethane-coated nylon and polyester layers control the pressure more efficiently. Flexible: A Nasa engineer shows how the improved suit allows its wearer greater mobility than previous versions. It is also designed to be quicker to put on . New technology will also create more efficient cooling and will get rid of carbon dioxide more easily. Currently certain components have to be baked between missions to get rid of it. Nasa says the Z-1 represents a potential soft exploration extravehicular activity (EVA) suit configuration, though its description 'is a bit of a misnomer', according to Spacesuit Engineer Kate Mitchell. 'The suit actually contains several hard mobility elements,' she said. 'The term ""soft"" is intended to convey the idea that the primary structures of the suit are pliable fabrics when unpressurized.' This prototype suit is the first in a series being developed under the AES suit project, with the aim to have a new 'vacuum-compatible' suit ready by 2015 at the latest. 'The Z-1 was developed as a test bed to go and test various technologies and mobility joints so we can further define our architecture going forward,' Ms Mitchell said. How Nasa's suit matches up to the Star Command model: The latest pictures do not make clear if Nasa's version comes pre-programmed catchphrases - but it otherwise looks remarkably similar . The lessons from the first version will be taken into account for the development of its planned next iteration, the Z-2. Amy Ross, lead of the Space Suit Assembly Technology Development team, said: 'The data we’re gathering now will feed tools that will help us build better suits in the future. 'We haven’t built a new flight system since the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit). The last major prototype we developed was in 1992.' With missions to Mars now on the horizon, an updated version was called for. The project has been especially taxing for NASA engineers as do not yet know where the space suit will be used, meaning it has to be ready for anything. Ms Ross added: ‘It's like you're trying to go on vacation, but you don't know if you're going to Antarctica, Miami, or Buckingham Palace’.","Nasa's white and green Z-1 prototype space suit looks remarkably similar to that worn by the cartoon hero .

"With limited time still in power, President Barack Obama is staking his final two years on climate change, pushing the issue to the front of his agenda as he seeks to leave an imprint on the world that will endure after he's gone. It's a strategy rooted not only in Obama's long-stated concern about global warming, but also in political reality. Two weeks ago, Obama watched his prospects for realizing his goals on education, wages and immigration all but evaporate as voters handed his party a stinging rebuke in the midterms, putting Republicans in full control of Congress for the remainder of his presidency. Scroll down for video . With limited time still in power, President Barack Obama is staking his final two years on climate change . But on a trip last week to Asia and Australia, Obama sought — and found — fruitful opportunities to make a lasting difference on global warming. In China, traditionally a U.S. adversary on environmental issues, Obama set an ambitious new target for cutting future U.S. emissions as part of a landmark deal in which China will also rein in pollution. In Australia, he pledged $3 billion to help poorer nations address changing temperatures while prodding Australia's prime minister to stop questioning the science of climate change. 'We're showing there's no excuse for other nations not to come together,' Obama said in Brisbane, where he also pressed the issue with leaders of the world's 20 largest economies. The emphasis on climate isn't all by choice. Although Obama has long sought to rally action against climate change, White House aides say the issue has become even more attractive after the election because it's one where Obama has considerable leverage to act without Congress. Foreign policy is largely the domain of presidents, and at home, Obama has aggressively used his regulatory power to curb greenhouse gas emissions over fierce objections from Republicans and the energy industry. 'President Obama has made no secret that his climate crusade will proceed irrespective of what the American people want or what other global leaders caution,' said Laura Sheehan of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which represents the coal industry. Sheehan said Australia, whose prime minister rose to power promising to gut a hated carbon tax, is a ""prime example"" of lessons that some have learned but Obama has ignored. In China, traditionally a U.S. adversary on environmental issues, Obama set an ambitious new target for cutting future U.S. emissions as part of a landmark deal in which China will also rein in pollution . She warned the deal with Beijing, which allows China's emissions to keep increasing until 2030, will stall America's economy while China's continues to grow 'thanks to affordable, reliable power.' Climate change advocates said the deal with China is paving the way for a successful global climate treaty that nations are aiming to finalize next year, because it ups the pressure on reluctant, developing nations like India. They argue a successful treaty is the world's best chance to avert the worst effects of global warming. Facing dim prospects for Senate ratification for a new treaty, the administration is considering strategies where the agreement could be labeled a voluntary expansion of a 1992 climate treaty, relying on joint political pressure to ensure countries comply with certain parts. Yet on the domestic front, it's unclear how much more Obama can do alone. Obama said his administration shaped its new goal to cut emissions at least 26 percent by 2025 based on existing legal authorities, rather than relying on future action from Congress. But Obama has already picked the low-hanging fruit: pollution limits on U.S. power plants and emissions standards for cars and trucks, to name the big ones. Still, White House aides said Obama has enlisted his Cabinet secretaries to hunt for further steps he can take before the clock runs out on his presidency in early 2017. They pointed to increasing renewable fuels as one example. And on Monday, the White House launched a website— toolkit.climate.gov — to give state and local officials access to federal resources to combat the impact of global warming. Obama has aggressively used his regulatory power to curb greenhouse gas emissions over fierce objections from Republicans and the energy industry . As Obama competed for a second term in the White House in 2012, he told his top aides he considered climate change to be a key piece of unfinished business, said Stephanie Cutter, his deputy campaign manager. If he won re-election, he told them, he would take on climate head-on. 'He sees climate policy as good economic and health policy, but also a moral obligation to future generations — including his own daughters,' Cutter said. Yet even some of Obama's existing steps could well be repealed by ascendant Republicans in Congress, who also have plans to stop the president from going any further. Republicans are finding common cause with many Democrats in trying to force Obama to approve Keystone XL, a proposed pipeline that would carry tar sands oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast. And with the GOP set to take over the Senate in January, Republicans are already pursuing a concerted effort to gut his Environmental Protection Agency's rules on power plants, although Obama counselor John Podesta predicted they won't succeed. ""The president will complete action. It's a top priority of his,' Podesta said Monday. 'And I don't believe they can stop us from doing that.'","Obama set an ambitious new target for cutting future U.S. emissions as part of a landmark deal in which China will also rein in pollution .

"Equipped with miniskirts, kitten heels, and assault rifles, these are the goose-stepping girls who led North Korea's biggest ever show of military might yesterday. Kim Jong Un's battalions of babes were taking part in a lavish display intended to strike fear into North Korea's adversaries and rally the country's beleaguered populace behind its youthful Dear Leaer. Solemn faced and tightly regimented, they marched amid columns of tanks, artillery and farm equipment that showed the isolated dictatorship remains on a war footing 60 years after the end of the Korean war. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . North Korea's women soldiers on the march in Pyongyang's Kim Il-Sung square marking the 60th anniversary of the Korean war armistice . Grim faced: The troops paraded past the country's ruler Kim Jong Un, in what is believed to be North Korea's biggest-ever show of might . Ready for action: The parade seemed . intended to tell the world that, despite sanctions, North Korea remains on a war footing 60 . years after the end of the Korean War . Unarmed cadres of female soldiers goose-step their way through Kim Il Sung square in the parade, which was also attended by the vice president of China, North Korea's only ally . Also on show were a broad array of ominous-looking missiles which, it is feared, could be used in conjunction with North Korea's plans to become a nuclear-armed state. The assembly of weapons and troops was reminiscent of the marches held by the Soviet Union and China at the height of the Cold War. It is one of the few chances the world gets to see North Korea's military up close. Although Pyongyang frequently uses the occasion to reveal new, though not always operational, hardware, there didn't appear to be any new weapons in today's parade. Its arsenal of missiles, however, was front-and-centre. The colourful military parade in Pyongyan marked the 60th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice Agreement . Saturday's parade marks a holiday the North Koreans call 'Victory Day in the Fatherland Liberation War,' although  the Korean Peninsula remains technically at war . While the lavish parade was held, about 200 people gathered in Seoul, some burning pictures of the North's ruling Kim dynasty in protest at their northern enemy . Thousands of civilians marched alongside festive floats, and veterans sat out in the hot sun for the two-hour spectacle .

Ex military: Former North Korean Army personnel cheer and wave during the parade . North and South Korea have turned to tentative diplomacy in recent weeks, but March and April saw North Korean threats of nuclear war against Washington and Seoul in response to annual South Korean-U.S. military drills and U.N. condemnation of Pyongyang's February nuclear test, the country's third. Long-stalled North Korean nuclear disarmament talks show no sign of resuming. Today's parade marks a holiday the North Koreans call 'Victory Day in the Fatherland Liberation War,' although the 1950-53 Korean War that refers to ended in a truce and the Korean Peninsula remains technically at war. Last year's parade, held to commemorate the April celebrations of the 100th birthday of the late national founder Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un's grandfather, created a buzz among military watchers when the North rolled out a mysterious long-range missile known abroad as the KN-08. Most outside observers now believe the missiles were mock-ups, but they were carried on mobile launchers that appeared to have been obtained from China, possibly against U.N. arms trade sanctions. Choe Ryong Hae, the army's top political officer, said North Korea should be ready to fight to defend the stability the country needs to revive the economy. But his speech at Kim Il Sung Square was mild compared with past fiery rhetoric from Pyongyang attacking the United States and South Korea. History: The central square in Pyongyang is a sea of colour, left, as bronze statues of former North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il stand tall above the parade, right . Military might: A Scud short-range ballistic missile is carried on the back of a military vehicle as part of the parade . Leader Kim Jong-un (left) meets heads of delegations from various countries, who are visiting North Korea to attend a ceremony of the 60th anniversary of the truce . Meanwhile, in South Korea, President Park Geun-hye vowed not to tolerate provocations from North Korea - Seoul says North Korean attacks in 2010 killed 50 South Koreans - but she also said Seoul would work on building trust with the North. 'I urge North Korea to give up the development of nuclear weapons if the country is to start on a path toward true change and progress,' Park said in a speech. North Korea is estimated to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs, but many analysts don't think it has yet mastered the technology needed to build warheads small enough to fit on long-range missiles. About 200 people gathered in Seoul, some burning pictures of the North's ruling Kim dynasty, at a rally meant 'to condemn the nuclear development and threatening strategy of the tyrannical regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,' said Park Chan-sung, an anti-North Korea activist. Shin Eun-gyeong, who visited an exhibit on the armistice on Saturday at a recently opened history museum, said she wants the rival Koreas to be unified - but as a democracy, not under North Korea's autocratic rule. 'It's a real tragedy for Korea that we are still a divided nation,' Shin said. Fireworks explode behind the Fatherland Liberation War Museum this evening. This is one of the few chances the world gets to see North Korea's military up close . Fireworks explode over the newly constructed Korean War museum. North Korea is estimated to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs . The North's parade tradition goes back to the founding of the country in 1948. Few countries - including North Korea's communist models - continue to trot out their military forces in public squares with such pomp and pageantry. But Pyongyang has stuck with them because its leaders believe they are a good way to show the world those things about the military they want to reveal, while at the same time sending a potent message domestically of the power of the ruling elite. 'The beauty of a parade is that weapons systems don't actually have to work in order to be impressive - a missile launcher looks good even when the missile won't launch,' said David Stone, an expert on the Soviet and Russian militaries at Kansas State University. That can be risky, however. Almost as soon as last year's parade was over, military experts around the world said they thought the stars of the show - the long-range KN-08 missiles - were mock-ups of a design that is still being perfected and probably couldn't actually fly, despite North Korea's claims that it has the capability to strike the United States with nuclear-tipped ICBMs. 'They certainly learned that they might lose some reputation by showing imperfect mock-ups,' said Marcus Schiller, a private-sector aerospace engineer in Germany who is regarded as one of the world's leading authorities on North Korea's missile capabilities. 'Better to show nothing and let the world know by `leaked secret information' how dangerous they are.' Even so, analysts say the parades send important messages meant to signal strength to North Korea's people - who are not privy to such outside analysis. As it rolled out its arsenal Saturday, military helicopters, jets in formation and other warplanes did flyovers. Later, thousands of civilians marched alongside festive floats, a departure from previous parades. A truckload of soldiers wore chest packs with nuclear symbols. 'After watching this parade, I feel our country could defeat anyone,' said Ryang Un Ho, 84, a captain in the North Korean infantry during the war who sat in the hot sun with other veterans at the square for the two-hour spectacle.","Painstakingly choreographed military pageant held on the 60th anniversary of the armistice .

"It is one of the recognisable musical instruments ever made, having featured on songs by everyone from Marvin Gaye to Duran Duran. It is even credited by many as spawning electronic dance music. However, one enterprising fan of Roland's TR808 drum machine has decided to make the electronic gadget real - by recreating it using real instruments in his living room. Scroll down for video . Moritz Simon Geist with his creation, a giant drum machine using actual drums to recreate the iconic Roland TR-808 . The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer was one of the first programmable . drum machines and was introduced by the Roland Corporation in early . 1980. The first band to use the TR-808 was the Japanese . electronic music group Yellow Magic Orchestra, although it hit the . mainstream in 1982, with the release of the mainstream American hits . 'Sexual Healing' by Marvin Gaye and 'Planet Rock' by Afrika Bambaataa. It is still used in drum and bass, hip hop, R&B, house, electro, and many forms of electronic dance music. The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, known as the 808, was one of the first programmable drum machines, and the most recognisable. Released in 1980, it has been used in a string of hits in the 1980s by everyone from dance and hip hop bands to Madonna. 'MR-808 is the first drum robot that reproduces the drum sounds of the 80s - in the real world,' said Moritz Simon Geist, who built the machine. 'I have been playing electronic music for several years now, and at some place I was bored of the electronic music production process. 'So I decided to go back to the roots of sound generation – the physical sound generation – but combine it with the electronic music structure we like so much. 'I liked the idea so much, that I couldn’t stop building my own drum robots, and ended up replacing all the electronic sounds of a whole drum computer.' However, unlike the original, the robot 808 doesn't always sound the same, and was designed to sound more 'real'. 'I like the idea of introducing more 'error' into the music,' said Geist. 'A drum beaten by a mechanic robot arm can never . be as predictable as a computer generated sound. 'Consequently, the . mechanic character of the installation MR-808 introduces fallibility . into the performance.' The cabinet for the project recreates the same key layout at the original, although it can also be programmed form a connected computer. Eleven . sounds of the 808 were replaced by mechanical actuators and physical . tone-makers. The instruments . include: Snare, Bass drum, Hi-Hat, Carabassa, Clave, Ride, Clap, Tom . (3x) and Cowbell.

"Students at a Norfolk, Virginia, high school staged a walk-out Monday to protest a racially charged Twitter post mocking interracial couples, which has been sent out by a high-ranking school administrator who is white. The social media message was shared by Booker T. Washington High School Assistant Principal Amy Strickland back in June, but it was only spotted on her page recently. Miss Strickland, a recent hire at the predominantly black high school, retweeted a post from the satirical account @OrNahhTweets that featured a prom photo showing seven couples where all the women were white and all the young men were African-American. Viral image: Photo of seven interracial prom couples was retweeted by Booker T Washington High School Assistant Principal Amy Strickland back in June, but it has gone viral only recently . Not funny: Mrs Strickland, a one-time Teacher of the Year, retweeted the image from the account @OrNahhTweets, along with the caption: ‘every white girl's father's worst nightmare Or Nah' The image was accompanied by a caption that read: ‘every white girl's father's worst nightmare Or Nah?' 'I could have been any one of the boys in the picture,' Booker T Washington junior Michael LeMelle, who is African-American, told the station WAVY. 'And I really don’t see myself... as anyone’s worst nightmare.' LeMelle was one of about a dozen students who walked out of their classes Monday to call the administration’s attention to the ongoing controversy. For the past week, students at the school have been sharing among themselves screenshots of the incendiary tweet, which has since been deleted, along with Amy Strickland's account. Students said that they have appealed to the faculty last week to look into the retweet, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Norfolk School Board members told the news station Monday that they were unaware of the tweet until WAVY reached out to them for comment. As for Miss Strickland, she has kept mum on the matter and has been staying out of the public eye, avoiding all meetings and public speaking engagements, according to students. Shakira Harris said that she and her classmates do not necessarily want Strickland fired, but they believe she deserves to be reprimanded for her poor judgement. ‘Do something to let us know it has not gone unnoticed,’ Harris pleaded. Video Source 13NewsNow.com . Troubled school: The Norfolk, Virginia, high school lost its accreditation last month over poor test scores and low graduation rates . Norfolk Federation of Teachers President Thomas Calhoun issued a statement Tuesday taking the school board and the Booker T Washington administration to task for allegedly dragging their feet. ‘Sometimes they seem to be hoping the problem will go away or maybe no one will notice,’ Calhoun wrote. ‘I feel everyone would be better served if they would address issues before the news media, the public, the staff, and the students get involved and form their own opinions of what is going on.’ The NAACP also has weighed in on the scandal, saying in a statement to WVEC 13NewsNow   that the civil rights organization has launched its own investigation into the controversy surrounding the racially insensitive tweet.According to her biography on Booker T Washington High School’s website, Amy Strickland, a graduate of Old Dominion University and Eastern Virginia Medical School, where she earned a Master's degree in public health, was hired as assistant principal earlier this year.After working in public health education for several years, Strickland switched gears in 2008 and became a science teacher and cheerleading couch in Portsmouth, where she led her team to 17 Eastern District and Conference titles. This year, she won three Teacher of The Year awards, including the overall citywide award for Portsmouth. Officials at Booker T Washington would not comment to the media on Miss Strickland’s current employment status, only saying that they are looking into the allegations. The school, named after the legendary 19th century African-American community leader, educator and presidential adviser Booker T Washington, has more than 1,400 students enrolled in 9-12 grades, with 85 per cent of them black. Last month, Virginia's Board of Education stripped the high school of its accreditation because it has failed to meet state minimum scores on the Standards of Learning tests and graduation rates for the past four years.","Photo of seven interracial prom couples was retweeted by Booker T Washington High School Assistant Principal Amy Strickland back in June .

One of the leaders of the anti-fracking protest group currently staging an occupation at a shale gas test drilling site earns money writing school textbooks on citizenship, it has emerged. Jamie Kelsey-Fry, a former teacher and now a key spokesman for the No Dash For Gas campaign, is understood to have helped organise the demonstrations in Balcombe, West Sussex. The 49-year-old was also involved with the Occupy tented protest outside St Paul’s Cathedral and has been linked with multiple campaigns against capitalism and climate change. It emerged today Mr Kelsey-Fry is a member of the Association for Citizenship Teaching, an organisation which helps prepare teachers to teach citizenship, a compulsory subject for secondary school pupils. The charity, founded in 2001, receives nearly £100,000 a year in government funds, which it uses to provide professional development for teachers, to prepare teaching materials and to argue for the subject's importance. Mr Kelsey-Fry's book on citizenship, the Rax Active Citizenship Toolkit, is published by New Internationalist and was awarded 10 out of 10 in a review by the Times Educational Supplement. The teachers' magazine wrote of the book: 'The authors have pulled off a remarkable trick here in offering a huge range of interesting and provocative material while maintaining an overall coherence and sense of purpose behind the book as a whole.' It has been sold by Amazon, Abe Books, Barnes and Noble, Blackwell's, The Book Depository, Waterstones and even WH Smith. But according to The Sun, Mr Kelsey-Fry urges change 'outside of parliament' by 'direct action and civil disobedience' against an 'unjust system'. '10 out of 10': Mr Kelsey-Fry's book on citizenship has received a glowing review . Mr Kelsey-Fry lives in a council block in Islington, north London, but he hails from an illustrious family. His brother John Kelsey-Fry, 56, is a QC who represented shamed former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne at his trial for perverting the course of justice. The libel and fraud lawyer has been hailed as a legal ‘megastar’ and also represented football manager Harry Redknapp when he was cleared of tax evasion last year. And their grandfather, Sir William Kelsey-Fry, was a celebrated dental surgeon who won a Military Cross during World War One. In an article for the New Internationalist magazine, Mr Kelsey-Fry has called the current moves to explore for shale gas beneath the UK 'unbridled coporate greed gone insane.' He wrote: 'According to our cabinet of millionaires – many of whom have blatant links to the fossil fuel corporations – it seems ‘wiser’ to make a fast buck now and destroy any decent future for our species than it would be to tighten our collective energy belts, make the transition to renewables that last infinitely and ensure a sustainable future for all.' Mr Kelsey-Fry declined a request to speak with MailOnline. Crackdown: The number of fracking protesters at the test-drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex, has now dramatically fallen after the heavy police intervention . The Balcombe protests have made headlines in recent weeks thanks to the numbers of demonstrators involved and the famous faces that have joined them. However drilling is expected to resume within days at the potential fracking site as the numbers of protesters dwindle. Police made a series of targeted arrests around the camps yesterday after reviewing CCTV evidence of Monday’s protests. More than eight riot-trained policeman jumped out of a minibus before surrounding one female suspect and quickly driving her away for allegedly earlier assaulting an officer. Altogether, three people were arrested yesterday, two for offences that happened during Monday’s protests and one for a public disorder offence while a lorry was entering the site. Three more people were arrested at the site yesterday: A spokesman for No Dash For Gas said the camp is now packing up to leave, but that there would be more protests against fracking in the future . A spokesman for No Dash For Gas told MailOnline they are packing up to leave, as they had always intended. 'Most people will be leaving today,' she said. 'The very last people will be leaving tomorrow. We still have a very constructive relationship with the farmer. 'Our camp was always going to be a six day event, but we can say that many of the people who have been skilled up here will be returning and engaging in peaceful civil disobedience against Cuadrilla. 'The message to Cuadrilla is: This is not over.' Police have said that the overall operation . against the anti-fracking protests is expected to cost taxpayers more than £2million.","Jamie Kelsey-Fry, 49, is a spokesman for protest group No Dash For Gas .

"Animal rights group PETA may go to extreme lengths to save animals from the slaughterhouse but the Virginia-based organization's animal shelter killed nearly 2,000 cats and dogs at its shelter in 2013. The Center for Consumer Freedom released its annual review of PETA's Norfolk shelter and it shows a surprising 82 percent euthanization rate. Despite outcries from some fellow animal activists, PETA has declined to change its policies since 1998. Since that year, the shelter has put down over 31,000 animals, most of which it insists are injured or unadoptable. Better off? People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has a surprising track record at its Norfolk animal shelter. Publicly availanle Virginia records show that PETA kills 82 percent of its animals. PETA says about half those creatures are unadoptable . The Center for Consumer Freedom points out that PETA killed 1,792 cats and dogs in 2013 (FILE PHOTO: This shelter is not a PETA shelter) Countless celebrities have posed for PETA ads like this one featuring Khloe Kardashian. But would they have changed their mind had they known of the group's shelter activities? These numbers come from the Virginia . Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), which requires . such annual disclosures. In . 2013, PETA killed 1,792 cats and dogs, an average of 5 per day. The 1,792 figure represents 82 percent of all animals PETA took into its . shelter throughout the year. 'This delusional animal rights group is talking out of both sides of its mouth – on one side preaching animal rights, while on the other signing the death warrant of 82 percent of cats and dogs in its care. Labeling PETA as hypocritical would be the understatement of the year,' said Will Coggin from the Center for Consumer Freedom. In 2005, two PETA employees were arrested in North Carolina after allegedly killing adoptable pets and tossing the bodies into a supermarket trash dumpster. Trial evidence showed they killed animals they described as 'perfect' and 'adorable.' Defendants Adria Hinkle and Andrew Cook were tried and cleared of all charges in 2007. PETA disagrees and even released its own numbers in a statement this week: . 'PETA's shelter took in and euthanized 1,805 elderly, feral, sick, dying, aggressive, and otherwise unadoptable animals—more than 400 of whom were brought to PETA by loving but destitute guardians desperate to alleviate their beloved animals' suffering and many others who had been turned away by local so-called ""no-kill"" facilities that reject unadoptable animals in order to keep their euthanasia statistics appealing.' PETA President Ingrid Newkirk previously indicated to The Virginian-Pilot that the animal rights group could stop killing pets any time they want. 'We could become a no-kill shelter immediately. It means we wouldn't do as much work,' she said. According to VDAS, in 2010 discovered that 84 percent of the animals PETA took in were killed within 24 hours. 'PETA’s so-called ‘shelter’ might as well be called a slaughterhouse,' said CCF. 'For an organization that once disgustingly compared the treatment of farm animals to the Holocaust, you’d think PETA would avoid the appearance of systematic killing.' Meanwhile, PETA Senior Vice President Daphna Nachminovitch emphasized the pets that could be saved. 'The nearly 400 adoptable animals PETA received were placed in carefully screened, permanent homes or transferred to the Virginia Beach SPCA and other high-traffic open-admission shelters for a chance to be adopted,' she said. Since 1998, PETA's shelter has euthanized over 31,000 animals. PETA maintains most of those animals are unadoptable and that euthanasia is preferable in many cases to a life struggling on the streets (FILE PHOTO: This shelter is not a PETA shelter)","Animal rights group says its doing what's best for the animals in its Virginia shelter but critics point to unseemly 82 percent kill rate .

"They are the bane of ramblers and birds alike, but now homeowners are being warned that a nearby wind farm could cut the value of their houses by up to a third, an MP has claimed. Geoffrey Cox, Conservative MP for West Devon and Torridge, said some homes in his area are now worth 'significantly less' thanks to giant turbines, and that it is an 'injustice' that homeowners should lose out while developers and land owners potentially pocket millions. Mr Cox says proposals for scores of turbines have pushed rural areas to 'tipping point' and has called for a new scheme to compensate those whose homes are affected. Desperate times: Geoffrey Cox MP says proposals for scores of turbines have pushed parts of rural areas to tipping point . Planning Minister Nick Boles has proposed direct compensation for lost property value thanks to developments such as turbines, and also nuclear power stations, rail links and factories. The minister is eyeing a pilot scheme in the coming months, and it could be based on the Dutch model that pays out an average of around £8,000 to householders that have suffered 'detriment'. Mr Cox said he welcomed the proposal, which is likely to curry favour across rural Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, where the growing number of wind farms are seen as a blight by residents. The MP said: 'An increasing number of people are coming to me with clear evidence that the value of their home is significantly less than what it otherwise would be were the wind farm not there.' He added: 'I’m seeing a minimum 10 per cent to 15 per cent reduction. Some are seeing a loss of one-third of the value... How can that be fair?' 'How can it be right that landowners and developers are making millions of pounds, while the ordinary household is losing the value of what is their pension, or nest egg in old age.' Wind farms are the source of much debate in rural communities, with a number of protest groups furious at the loss of local beauty spots. Worse off: Geoffrey Cox said his constituents have been told by estate agents their homes are worth 'significantly less' thanks to giant turbines . In October, campaigners living near Ilkley in Yorkshire, won a campaign to have four giant turbines dismantled - the first ever wind farm to be scrapped in the UK. Residents and walkers were delighted by the return of unspoilt views across the rolling hills and deep blue waters of Chelker Reservoir. And to their relief, the 150ft high turbines will not be replaced after the council refused permission for two even bigger machines. Angela Kelly, the chairwoman of the anti-wind farm campaign group Country Guardian, says she has seen the value of a number of properties slashed thanks to the presence of a nearby turbine. She claims she has even heard of buyers withdrawing at the last minute after discovering plans for a wind farm in the local vicinity. Ms Kelly said: 'There is plenty of evidence that even the threat of a wind farm or a wind turbine  can prevent the sale of houses'. She added: 'Certainly after a wind farm has been erected properties within sight or sound of the turbines can become virtually unsaleable. Of the Planning Minister's proposal, Mr Cox said: 'I would completely support households having to be paid compensation for the depreciation of their house value as a result of wind turbines.' 'It is simple nonsense for the pro-wind lobby to say they have no effect on house prices.' But he warned: 'The devil will be in the detail. How would you differentiate between those that are entitled and those that are not?' The compensation package was revealed quietly in December’s autumn statement, but was detailed by Mr Boles when her appeared before the Local Government Select Committee of MPs. He said the proposal was a 'radical . departure' from Britain’s current planning rules, but would help speed . up major infrastructure that will boost growth, and would bring . “individual benefits” for local residents from new development. His idea goes beyond existing schemes . to compensate homeowners for roads and rail links which affect the . property by creating noise and traffic. Mr . Boles said: 'I think that everybody recognises that countries have to . do difficult things - build roads, build railway lines, build nuclear . power stations and other kinds of power sources.' Losing out: Planning Minister Nick Boles has proposed direct compensation for lost property value thanks to developments such as turbines . He added: 'It . is better for everyone that the amount of money is banged up in the . transaction process - making the decision, let alone building the thing, . as little as possible and relatively speedy. With certain projects . there has been a principle established of some kind of a benefit being . paid to very local communities.' Mr Boles went on: 'One of the things we are keen to pilot is whether people who have properties very close to a substantial development might benefit from some form of compensation for the loss of property value, something that does happen in some other countries, the Netherlands have innovated with it.' Reacting to Mr Cox's comments, Malcolm . Prescott, managing director of local estate agent Webbers, said: ‘I’ve . not experienced this myself... For every person who says I’m not keen on having a wind farm nearby, another will say it’s actually quite nice.' He . added: ‘I think so long as the thing isn’t on your actual doorstep and . you can hear it buzzing, people just accept they are part of the . landscape. Whether or not they affect property value is specific to each . individual home and not something that will affect the entire region.’ Mr . Prescott went on: ‘People are still far more concerned about other . aspects of the sale. Is it the right location? Is there access to the . beach? What are the schools like? Those are the things that really matter to people buying property around here’.","Geoffrey Cox MP says constituents are told homes worth 'significantly less'

"An American Idol season 7 contestant who was mysteriously found dead on a friend's couch in August got an official cause of death Tuesday. Medical examiners said Tuesday that Michael Johns died of a severely enlarged heart. The Australian-born singer and Idol audience fan favorite was 35. More specficially, the Orange County Coroner told the Daily News that Johns died of 'dilated cardiomyopathy with severe cardiomegaly.' Enlarged heart: Medical examiners said Tuesday that American Idol season 7 contestant Michael Johns who was mysteriously found dead on a friend's couch in August died of a severely enlarged heart. in laymen's terms, he had an enlarged heart that could no longer effectively pump blood through his body. The condition, more common in men than in women, can be caused by a number of things, including infections and thyroid disease, but also severe alcohol abuse. The Daily News reports that Johns also had a fatty liver and traces of a cold medicine in his system when he died. The singer died at a friend's home in Orange County. Johns had sprained his ankle that had swelled to his knee and had sought medical attention the day before he died.. A tragic 911 call made by the friend who found Michael Johns' cold, motionless body was  released following his death. TMZ obtained the recording in which the pal says he fears Michael is dead because he is cold to the touch and rigor mortis seems to have set in, suggesting he in fact passed more than an hour earlier. Idol fan favorite: In laymen's terms, he had an enlarged heart that could no longer effectively pump blood through his body. Meeting an Idol: Michael got the opportunity to rehears with the legendary Dolly Parton on the 2008 talent show . He also can be heard desperately giving the star CPR. He tells the dispatcher that he had seen Johns two hours prior and he seemed OK but when he returned his friend wasn't breathing. The dramatic call  came after it was reported that Johns had been drinking heavily at some point before he died. Johns was reportedly in full cardiac arrest when paramedics arrived on the scene and could not be revived. Johns, who was born Michael John Lee, was very close with his mother Janet and stepfather John, who was the father figure in Mr Johns' life. Janet and John Burke both still live in Perth but visited their son frequently, including a surprise trip to Michael's home last year. At the time, Michael expressed his delight that his mother and stepfather had 'turned up unannounced on his doorstep'. In a 2008 interview Johns spoke affectionately about his musical upbringing in Australia with his mother, stepfather and siblings, Cindy and Stephen. 'Everyone in my family is musical. My mum has a very pretty Doris Day-type voice,' he said. Married: Michael Johns passed away at the age of 35.

'My brother and sister both play piano and sing. My stepfather is a great singer too. I was always around music growing up.' Johns attended co-ed college Newman College in Churchlands, Perth. Whilst in Perth, he sang in bands and was active in the musical theatre community, performing in performances including Pinocchio and Anything Goes at Perth's Regal Theatre and His Majesty's Theatre. Mr Johns left Australia at the age of 18 to pursue music at the advice of his idol, You Am I frontman, Tim Rogers. In a 2004 interview, Mr Johns thanked an encounter with the singer at the Australian music festival Big Day Out for inspiring his move to the United States. 'I snuck backstage and approached You Am I lead singer, Tim Rogers for advice. He told me if I wanted to make something happen, I had to go to the States.' Michael left behind his Texan wife, Stacy Vuduris, whom he met in 2003 and married in 2007. The singer competed in the seventh season of American Idol in 2008. During the show his supporters called themselves 'The Aussie Posse'.","Medical examiners say 'dilated cardiomyopathy with severe cardiomegaly,' killed Michael Johns, who was found dead August 1 .

"A fifth of rape and murder suspects in the UK last year were foreign nationals. Figures showed a total of 93 people were charged with murder and 632 with rape. The statistics of suspects born abroad compares to the overall numbers of 555 murder suspects and 3,436 murder suspects. The figures were released by 37 out of 43 police forces and the British Transport Police . A survey of 43 English and Welsh police forces showed that just one failed to record any rape or murder charges against a non-UK citizen, The Sun reported. More than a third of the 210 rape suspects charged in London last year were immigrants. Out of the 180 murder suspects in the capital 41 were from foreign. In the capital 24 were from Jamaica, 14 from Nigeria, 13 from Poland and ten from Portugal. In Suffolk, 75 per cent of suspects charged with murder were immigrants. More than a third of the 210 rape suspects charged in London last year were immigrants . Cumbria had a similarly high rate, with 63 per cent of murder suspects being foreigners. But in rural Wales, Dyfed-Powys Police had no record of a rape or murder charge against a foreigner, The Sun reported. The figures were released by 37 out of 43 police forces and the British Transport Police. Hampshire refused to reveal nationalities of eight foreigners charged with rape, explaining it would lead to ethnic victimisation. The figures did not reveal how many were convicted or cleared, The Sun reported. The latest YouGov survey showed 57 per cent of people named immigration as being among the top three issues facing the country, its highest level since June 2010 and up 11 per cent on a year ago. Suffolk:               67 per cent      (6 out of 9) Cumbria:            63 per cent      (5 out of 8) Hertfordshire    60 per cent      (3 out of 5) Humberside:     50 per cent      (1 out of 2) Wiltshire:           43 per cent      (3 out of 7) Source: The Sun . The Prime Minister and his deputy promised an Immigration Bill to 'clamp down on those from overseas who abuse our public services' in the Queen's Speech last week. Extra focus has fallen on plans to deal with the impact of immigration in the wake of the rise of UKIP, which took almost one in four votes in last week’s local elections. The Immigration Bill aims to build on the coalition’s success, which has already seen the number of migrants fall by a third since 2010. Figures in February showed that one in 12 people blames rape victims for their own fate if they flirt with their attacker or if they are drunk at the time they are raped, official figures reveal. Around 2million people suffered domestic abuse in England or Wales last year, according to statistics - down by half since 1995. The group most at risk from sexual assault and violence consists of women under the age of 25, with women who have separated from their husbands also disproportionately likely to be victims. Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that six per cent of people think rape victims are to blame when they are drunk, and eight per cent criticise victims who are under the influence of drugs.","More than third of 210 rape suspects in London last year were immigrants .

"Children who are breast-fed for longer do better in school by the time they are five, new research claims. Assessments by teachers at the end of year one revealed that children who had been breast-fed for the longest reached the highest overall levels of achievement. Importantly, the teachers making the assessments were not aware whether the children had been given mainly breast milk or formula milk. Benefits: The study shows that children who were breast-fed achieved better overall . The research, published in the journal Maternal and Child Nutrition, involved 5,489 children in England. When their child was nine months old, mothers were asked about their breastfeeding habits. Two thirds of children had been breast-fed at some stage, 32 per cent had been breast-fed for at least four months and 16 per cent had been exclusively breast-fed for more than four months. Their educational achievement was then measured using the Foundation Stage Profile – an assessment made by teachers at the end of the first year of school, before the child reaches their fifth birthday. Teachers rated children on 13 scales covering six areas of development, with scores based on continuous assessment throughout the year. Half of all children in the study reached the expected standard of achievement for their age – but the figure was only 37 per cent for children who had never been breast-fed. It was 49 per cent for those breast-fed for under two months, 56 per cent for those breast-fed for between two and four months and 60 per cent for those who were breast-fed for four months or more. Disadvantage: Only 37 per cent of children who were never breast fed reached the expected standard for their age . The results were then adjusted to take into account factors such as the mother’s educational level, their socioeconomic status and their childcare arrangements. Children breast-fed for up to two months were 9 per cent more likely to have reached a good level of overall achievement than children who had never been breast-fed. Those breast-fed for between two and four months were 17 per cent more likely to have a good level of overall achievement and the effect was similar in children breast-fed for more than four months. The researchers, from the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford, said the study proved that breastfeeding children for longer periods could improve their performance at primary school and help them develop faster. They suggested that this was because the essential fatty acids found in breast milk can help cognitive development. However babies not getting breast milk are more prone to infections – which could slow down their academic progress. Breastfeeding was linked to better achievement in all areas – but the gains were strongest in communication, language and literacy, knowledge and understanding of the world and physical development. Breast-fed children also tended to get higher scores for personal, social and emotional development, problem-solving, reasoning and numeracy and creative development. The study comes after the introduction of a controversial scheme, which gives women shop vouchers in return for breastfeeding. Currently one in four women in the UK does not attempt to breastfeed – one of the worst rates in the world. A report on the study said: ‘The longer the children had been breast-fed, the more likely they were to reach a good level of educational achievement at 5 – an important predictor of later academic and employment outcomes.’","Research from Maternal and Child Nutrition involved 5,489 children .

"Shocking: Collin Brewer is facing fresh calls to permanently step down from Cornwall Council . A 68-year-old councillor who said disabled children should be ‘put down’ sparked further controversy today by comparing them to deformed lambs who need to be culled. Cornwall Council veteran member Collin Brewer said children with disabilities should only be allowed to live after the cost has been evaluated - much like farmers who kill the runt of the litter. Independent Mr Brewer stood down earlier this year after he claimed disabled children could be put to death to save taxpayers’ money. He later apologised and quit the council - but then won back his seat in this month's local elections earlier this month. But he now faces fresh calls to permanently step down after making more outrageous comments, saying ‘there may be a case’ for treating disabled children like deformed livestock. He told the Disability News Service that runt lambs are often put down by farmers who deal with them by ‘smashing them against a wall’. He said: ‘If they [farmers] have a misshapen lamb, they get rid of it. They get rid of it. Bang.’ Mr Brewer said he discussed his previous statements about putting disabled children down with a farmer from his Wadebridge East constituency. He claimed the farmer made it clear he ‘didn’t see a lot wrong with what I said, because it is something they do every day’. He added: ‘We are just animals. He obviously has got a point - you can’t have lambs running around with five legs and two heads. It would be put down, smashed against the wall and be dealt with.’ When asked if he believed there was not much difference between putting down a lamb and a child with two heads, he said: ‘I think the cost has got to be evaluated. 'It is not something I would like to do but there is only so much in the bucket. If you are talking about giving services to the community or services to the individual, the balance has got to be struck.’ HQ: Mr Brewer, who is a councillor for Cornwall Council (pictured), said he discussed his previous statements about putting disabled children down with a farmer from his Wadebridge East constituency . Asked if he believed it might be kinder to kill a child with two heads, he said: ‘Is that one child or two? ‘I would hope that, although I don’t like the idea of it, long before it is born that this problem is [dealt with] and it will probably be aborted in some way.’ And when questioned if a child with a similar impairment should be killed after birth, he said: ‘That would be up to the decision of whoever is there at the birth.’ Asked whether there was a good argument . for killing some disabled children with high support needs to save . money, he said: ‘Yes. That is why I keep as far away from health in the . council as I can. 'There may be a case. I haven’t a clue how much they cost.’ Mr . Brewer first caused outrage in February after telling a member of . Disability Cornwall that disabled children should be put down because . they cost the authority too much. He . later apologised and resigned but decided to stand again and won . re-election to the ward of Wadebridge East by just four votes in the . elections on May 2. The UK's leading disability charity . called on Cllr Brewer to resign - describing his comments as ‘insulting, . demeaning and disgusting’. Controversies: Mr Brewer won re-election to his ward by just four votes in the elections on May 2 . A Mencap spokesman said: ‘We have been contacted by a number of people who share our disgust and who are asking us to take action. ‘In an attempt to give him the opportunity to apologise, or correct these comments, Mencap has tried, on a number of occasions, to contact Mr Brewer. We have had no success as we have been told has been on sick leave and his email doesn't work. ‘We have asked him what he means by these insulting, demeaning and disgusting comments, and whether he intends to meet local groups representing disabled people to reassure them. ‘Mencap is reluctant to give him further publicity but we now join the thousands of people who have contributed to an online petition calling for his resignation as soon as possible.’ Hayley Goleniowska, 43, whose six-year-old daughter Natty has Down's Syndrome, has been campaigning against Cllr Brewer’s comments and said he has ‘brought shame on our community’ with his ‘extreme views’. She told MailOnline: ‘After Cllr Brewer's initial comments and resignation, many of us hoped he would make amends and prove the sentiments behind his apology by working with disability groups. ‘Sadly Cllr Brewer did not take the time to do this. The county was stunned when he stood again for election a few weeks later, making his apologies worthless, his arrogance all too apparent. ‘Many families were deeply angered and hurt. Cllr Brewer is bringing shame on our community, but it must be recognised that he is in a very tiny minority with his extreme views. ‘I have been invited to Number 10 to meet (Prime Minister’s wife) Samantha Cameron next week for the work I do in this field. I might just mention the thorn in Cornwall's side while I am there.’ A spokesman for Disability Cornwall said: . ‘It’s particularly frightening these views may be held by those who . have the positions and power to make life and death decisions. 'Cllr Brewer is bringing shame on our community, but it must be recognised that he is in a very tiny minority with his extreme views' Hayley Goleniowska, campaigner whose daughter Natty has Down's Syndrome . ‘It’s a sad indictment of our so-called civilised society that disabled children are increasingly discussed within the context of affordability, as if they are goods on a shelf that can be picked up and discarded at will.’ Joe Taylor, project coordinator at . the Wave Project in Truro, which works with disadvantaged and disabled . youngsters said Cllr Brewer's comments could put disabled people off . visiting Cornwall. Mr Taylor said: ‘We are dependent on . tourism and an elected councillor is saying disabled people are not . welcome here. What kind of message does this send to people? ‘The disabled tourism industry in . Cornwall is worth around £1.5 million and the council is trying to . encourage more disabled people to come here. It is really damaging on so . many levels.’ Brewer is currently on sick leave from his duties as a councillor, because of medication he is taking for a long-term health condition. His poor health meant he was not at County Hall in Truro while a demonstration of about 70 people against his re-election was taking place outside the building.","Collin Brewer: 'Disabled children should only live after cost is evaluated'

"Adults could be advised to halve the amount of sugar in their diets under new guidelines from the World Health Organisation. Experts are considering lowering the recommended limit of ten teaspoons a day to just five over fears that it is contributing to heart disease, obesity and tooth decay. Food companies may have to change their products to lower the sugar content, which would be hugely expensive and could prove unpopular with some consumers. Touching the limit: A single Mars bar contains five teaspoons of sugar . A single can of cola contains ten teaspoons of sugar, a Mars bar has five, a bowl of Coco Pops has about four and there are eight in some ready meals. The average Briton consumes 12 teaspoons a day, although research has found that some adults in industrialised countries are eating as many as 46 daily. Philip James, president of the International Association for the Study on Obesity, which works with the WHO, described the suggestion as ‘political dynamite’. ‘The food industry will do everything in their power to undermine this,’ he said. The guidance suggests lowering the amount of sugar added to food – excluding that which occurs naturally in fruit or starch - from 10 per cent to five per cent of the daily allowance, which is equivalent to five teaspoons. High in sugar: A bowl of Coco Pops contains around four teaspoons of sugar . The policy would almost certainly be adopted by the Department of Health. Professor Shrinath Reddy, a cardiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health and member of the WHO panel of experts, said: ‘I would agree with the recommendation to reduce it to five per cent. ‘There is overwhelming evidence coming out about sugar-sweetened beverages and other sugar consumption links to obesity, diabetes and even cardiovascular disease.’ The proposals were discussed at a meeting earlier this year after a study by Professor Paula Moynihan, an expert in nutrition and oral health at Newcastle University, highlighted  the danger of sugar to dental health. ‘Part of the problem is that sugary foods and drinks are now staples in many people’s diet in industrialised countries, whereas once they were an occasional treat,’ he said. ‘We need to reverse this trend.’ The WHO panel will consider the guidance over the coming months before making a final decision.Sugar Nutrition UK, an industry-funded research body, pointed out that UK manufacturers had been lowering the level of sugar in recent years to make products healthier. ‘There is no data to show that reducing intake below current levels is beneficial to health,’ said a spokesman, who claimed that the guidance was based on studies ‘of very low quality’. Research three years ago by the Emory School of Medicine in the US found that some adults were eating 46 teaspoons of sugar a day. This included six in a bowl of cereal, 14 for lunch including a slice of pizza and a fizzy drink, and 16 for a ready meal in the evening with another sugary beverage. Kellogg’s was criticised last year by the Advertising Standards Agency for claiming that high sugar was not linked to obesity. Its Coco Pops website claimed: ‘A panel of world health experts recently reviewed all the evidence and concluded that a high sugar intake is not related to obesity, or the development of diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer. 'Nor was it connected to behavioural problems, such as hyperactivity, in children.’","World Health Organisation guidelines recommend halving the current limit .

"A woman who dropped dead at a New York salon with blood pouring from her nose and mouth did not have Ebola, tests confirmed today. The Fire Department sent in Hazmat teams after the woman, who returned to the U.S. from Guinea three weeks ago, died at Amy Professional African Hair Braiding in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn on Tuesday. Tests on her body came back negative for the virus, the New York City Department of Health told MailOnline on Wednesday. Her identity has not been released. An eyewitness who saw the woman, who was reportedly 40 years old, said there was blood coming from her 'face, nose and mouth'. Scroll down for videos . The body of a victim who dropped dead at a hair salon is removed in Brooklyn, New York on Tuesday. Tests confirmed on Wednesday that she did not have the virus . FDNY activated the Special Operations and Hazmat units after the woman, who had recently traveled from Guinea, dropped dead in Brooklyn on Tuesday, raising the alert of a suspected new Ebola case . An eyewitness reported that a woman had blood coming from her 'face, nose and mouth' at the hair salon . A Hazmat team arrived back at the establishment late on Tuesday  to run more tests, setting up in a building across the street . A worker at Amy Professional African Hair Braiding said they were still open for business on Tuesday evening despite the incident. 'Everything is business as normal,' a male worker, who asked to not be identified, told MailOnline. He also said the woman, believed to be in her early forties, was visiting the owner of the establishment, Amy Cisse, and confirmed she had recently traveled from West Africa. 'She was in Guinea three weeks ago and they were monitoring her,' he said. 'We were told she had had a heart attack, but now we are hearing that she may be tested for Ebola.' The woman, who was born in Guinea according to the salon worker, was not a health care worker, and therefore not subject to the 21-day home quarantine introduced by New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo in October. As of Sunday, the New York Department of Health was monitoring 293 people as part of its Ebola precautions. On Tuesday evening, a Hazmat team was back on the scene to run tests, setting up across the street from the hair salon. It was not clear why Amy Professional Hair Braiding would not have been evacuated until it was certain the woman did not have Ebola. The salon was  decontaminated late on Tuesday by a Hazmat crew. According to a source who was on the scene, the incident occurred just after 3pm on Tuesday. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene by EMTs. Costa, a man who works in the building next door, said: 'We were in the building and all the sudden the other owner came from the store and he said somebody dropped dead in their store.' He then said he ran in there to find a woman laying on the floor. When asked what she was bleeding from, Costa said: 'Face, nose, mouth, everything.' FDNY crews changed into Hazmat gear outside the salon before heading in, for what they referred to as a 'fever travel illness'. The FDNY said it was a 'clean scene' with no bodily fluids leaving the woman's body. An FDNY memo in October reportedly instructed all personnel to use more vague terms when discussing Ebola, such as 'fever travel incident'. The New York Department of Health was on the scene to take blood from the woman. Those officials, along with firefighters and workers from the Medical Examiner's office, were all decontaminated. No one from Amy Professional Hair Braiding was decontaminated said the worker who spoke to MailOnline on Tuesday evening. NYPD officers gather to talk to witnesses outside of Amy Professional Hair Braiding in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn, New York on Tuesday . NYPD and FDNY officers cordoned off the area outside the salon on Tuesday night as the decontamination process got underway . The woman who died suddenly at the salon had been visiting the owner, Amy Cisse (pictured above) A New York City official briefed on the woman's death told ABC News on Tuesday: 'Earlier today, an individual who came to the U.S. from one of the three Ebola-impacted nations in West Africa within last three weeks died of an apparent non-Ebola condition. 'This individual at no time showed any symptoms of Ebola. However, due to travel history and an abundance of caution, an Ebola test will be performed on this individual's remains. Test results are expected later tonight or early tomorrow morning.' The New York City Health Department said that the last time the woman was checked, she did not show any symptoms of Ebola. Fire Department members could be seen changing into their Hazmat gear outside the hair salon in Brownsville, Brooklyn . FDNY referred to the death as a 'fever travel incident',  and claimed it was a 'clean scene,' with no fluids leaving the woman's body . Individuals could be seen walking in and out of Amy Professional African Hair Braiding wearing no protection at all. Last week, Dr Craig Spencer was declared free of Ebola at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan after contracting the virus while treating patients in Guinea. He was the first, and only, case of Ebola to date in New York City. On Monday, Dr Martin Salia, a Maryland resident who was flown back to the U.S. after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone, died at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The outbreak of Ebola in Guinea began in March and has resulted in over 1,100 deaths to date. The CDC has already recommended that all Americans avoid nonessential travel to the African country. Libera, Guinea and Sierra Leone have been ravaged by the Ebola outbreak which began late last year with more than 5,000 people dying from the disease in these three countries, according to the latest WHO figures.

"Australian's receiving the dole could soon be subjected to mandatory drug testing in order to continue receiving payments. The harsh suggestion is part of a major overhaul of the welfare system by the Abbott government. Inspiration for the change has come from New Zealand's welfare system which halves welfare recipients' payments when they fail a job-required drug test or refuse to submit to one. Scroll down for video . The Abbott government has confirmed it is looking towards New Zealand's welfare system policies which require job seekers to undergo job-related drug tests or face cuts to their payments . The recipients must pay back their welfare payments if they continue to use drugs after 30 days. Social Services Minister Kevin Andrews said 'We won't rule this in or out.' But the hardline approach has shown little result in New Zealand where only 22 of 8001 welfare receiving job seekers tested positive to drug use or had refused to take tests. Despite this, the government will look towards New Zealand's welfare system which Mr Andrews told the Herald Sun, was simpler and less expensive than Australia’s current structure. The approach has shown little result in New Zealand where only 22 of 8001 welfare receiving job seekers tested positive to drug use or had refused to take tests . 'While Australia's welfare system is different from New Zealand, its reforms provide a guide as to the government’s thinking on simplifying our welfare system,' he said. 'This review will look at welfare reforms overseas, including New Zealand where they have simplified their welfare system by introducing five new payments that replaced eleven old payments.' New Zealand's newly reformed payment system now includes a Jobseeker Support payment for those actively looking for work, Sole Parent Support for single parents with children aged under 14 years, and Supported Living Payments for people significantly limited by sickness, injury or disability. The suggested changes come during a welfare system overhaul by the government as it awaits the results of a report which reviews the current system . Mr Andrews said that Australia’s welfare system was complex in comparison to it’s neighboring country. It currently administers around 20 varying payments with around 50 different supplements that he claimed were costing taxpayers approximately $100 billion annually. 'To make this work requires more than 3500 pages of legislation and more than 640 pages of endnotes to administer the social security system,' he said. However, Mr Andrews acknowledged that similar changes to welfare would be more difficult to administer in Australia as it would require support from individual states.","Government revealed to be looking towards New Zealand's welfare system .

"Samsung last night announced its long-awaited Galaxy Gear smartwatch following months of rumour and speculation. During the unveiling in Berlin, the Korean firm's CEO JK Shin exclaimed that he believed the chunky watch could become a 'fashion statement' and would revolutionise how people interact with their phones. Yet despite the hype and bold claims the device has left many experts and consumers underwhelmed. Scroll down for video . Samsung has gone back to the drawing board for its second-generation Galaxy Gear smartwatch after sales of the original model, pictured, were slow. Reports from Korea claim the Galaxy Gear 2 will replace the chunky flat screen of the original with a curved OLED display and is set to look 'totally different' Marc Flores, Mobile Device Editor at TechRadar described the voice-activated watch, pictured to scale next to a traditional watch, as gimmicky and pointless, saying: 'I have no desire to put anything on my wrist that does more than tell me the time and date' Sources also claim Samsung has changed 'all the parts that looked dull or boring' on the Galaxy Gear, pictured, to make the second model more appealing . Colin White, Managing Director of SellMyMobile.com told MailOnline: 'The Galaxy Gear looks the part but is a complete let down from a technical aspect. 'The 315mAh battery will need to be charged every 24 hours, and the device is partner reliant so you can’t use it on any other Android run Smartphone other than a Samsung.' He added that the ball is now in Apple's court next Tuesday. Jason Jenkins, editor of CNET UK, . believes the concept of a smartwatch is a game changer but that it may . not be worth snapping up a Gear when it becomes available: 'You don't . need Samsung's smartwatch, but in a year or two we'll all have . something like it. 'It's . pretty simple to use and not as chunky as we were expecting. But it's . not perfect.' Although Samsung didn't announce a UK price for the Galaxy Gear, it did reveal it would cost $299 (£190) in the U.S. Nitin Bhas, senior analyst at Juniper Research said: 'In reality, the smart watch market represents a segment waiting for a killer-application, thereby lacking mass-market appeal. 'While Samsung has managed to add in some additional functionalities plus a camera compared to existing products in the market, we still do not believe that they have managed to bring out a mass market product. 'The device is also pricey and will only further limit its adoption.' A survey by CCS Insight carried out by On Drive Research discovered that although 65 per cent of people were aware of smartwatches, less than five per cent of people asked either owned a similar device or were interested in buying one. Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch is pictured next to the Korean' firms latest Galaxy Note 3 phablet. The watch will only be compatible with the phablet from launch, although software updates will expand this compatibility to other Samsung phones - a decision that  has been criticised for not being inclusive enough to attract people to buy it . And the biggest turn off for those not interested in the technology was quoted as price. Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight said: 'Given many consumers are used to getting their smartphones 'free' with a contract, that's a hefty sum to pay on top.' Sony, which announced its own version of the technology called Smartwatch 2 earlier this year, revealed at the IFA conference in Berlin that the device would go on sale at the end of the year and would cost £149.99 - potentially £50 cheaper than Samsung's model. Colin White, managing director of SellMyMobile.com  'The Galaxy Gear (picutred) looks the part but is a complete let down from a technical aspect' The Galaxy Gear will also only work with the Galaxy Note 3 phablet from launch, before software updates add the Galaxy S3 and S4 in October. White, from Sellmymobile.com, has criticised this decision, which restricts how many people can buy and use the device. Sony's device, alternatively, will work with 'most Android phones', which increases its appeal further, plus, anyone who pre-orders Sony's new Xperia Z1 phone will get the Smartwatch 2 for free from network operator EE. CCS Insight's research also found that 40 per cent of people who own devices already, such as the Pebble smartwatch and wearable fitness trackers, got 'bored' of the gadgets quickly, suggesting the same fate may lie for Samsung, and other company's, smartwatches. In reference to the design, Marc Flores, Mobile Device Editor at TechRadar described the technology as gimmicky and pointless, saying: 'I have no desire to put anything on my wrist that does more than tell me the time and date. Why do I want a camera on my watch? Why do I need to access the internet from my wrist? What could I possibly do on a smart watch that I couldn't do on a smartphone?' He continued that smartwatches have never sold well and he doesn't expect the Galaxy Gear to do any better. Gartner analysts agree. Annette Zimmermann from the analyst firm told CNBC: 'In . Gartner's device forecast we have an assumption built into our model . that says that less than 3 percent of consumers replacing their . smartphone will replace it with a smartwatch in 2017.' While . fellow Gartner colleague Roberta Cozza told MailOnline: 'So . far consumer demand for products like smartwatches has been limited, . Samsung and Galaxy are two strong brands and Samsung will evolve this . category, but we expect in general that the new smart watches entering . the market will still likely appeal to early adopters of technology . first.' Sony's Smartwatch 2, pictured, was shown off at a Sony event ahead of Samsung's conference at IFA in Germany. Research claims price will be the main barrier to people buying the technology, which may explain why EE is offering customers who pre-order the Xperia Z1 directly the device - worth £149.99 - for free . Sony's SmartWatch 2, pictured, will be available in the UK from the end of September . Ben Wood from CCS Insight continued: 'Manufacturers have to urgently address how to expand their appeal beyond the usual 'geek niche' [of male technology fans] to ensure they don't end up just being a flash in the pan.' This theory was bolstered by the fact social media analysts, We Are Social found that during the Samsung event, 81 per cent of comments were from males, while 19 per cent were from females. Will Findlater, editor at Stuff . magazine told MailOnline: 'The Galaxy Gear is a marvel of engineering but . is confused about what it wants to be. 'It packs too much power to only be a . companion device to your phone, but lacks the connectivity to make it a . useful standalone device.' Other experts also highlighted the potential security risks of the device. Vince Arneja, vice president of product management at Arxan Technologies said: 'Although Samsung’s new smartwatch is new in terms of wearable . technology, it is in essence another example of a connected device and . therefore will be subject to similar hacks and attacks we’ve seen . recently on mobile devices, tablets, automobiles and appliances.' A recent survey by security firm AVG of 5,000 consumers found that 69 per cent felt wearable technology will become more intrusive as it develops and were concerned about privacy. Yet it's not all doom and gloom, Matthew Finnie, from cloud storage experts Interoute said that with smartwatches like the Galaxy Gear, the 'opportunities are endless' and claims it won't just appeal to technology fans, but 'could benefit continuous health monitoring, or enable our ageing population to be cared for remotely at home rather than in a care home.' And people who have actually handled the device are more positive. Brian Blair from Wedge Partners told Bloomberg said the device 'was absolutely impressive' adding: 'I wasn't expecting to see such a beautiful screen. It's very elegantly designed, a very nice finish but what's really impressive is the superAMOLED screen. 'It definitely has a wow factor and it has a nice capacitive touchscreen and very smooth applications.' Figures from social media analysts We Are Social found that on launch day, the Galaxy Gear received 58,000 mentions on Twitter, blogs and forums. The Galaxy Note 3 received 29,900 and references to Unpacked - the name of the Samsung event - totalled 5,400. The #galaxygear hashtag got 5,090 mentions. Before the event there were 140,000 mentions for the Galaxy S4. During the Unpacked event, We Are Social has created a gender breakdown of those who mentioned the conference. Based on a sample of 11,931 Twitter handles, 81 per cent were male while 19 per cent were female. The overall reaction on social media to the device was: . • Unimpressed: 41 per cent . • Innovative: 49 per cent . • General Positive Reaction: 10 per cent . Continuing on the subject of apps, Scott Sage from venture capital firm DFJ Esprit: 'There is no doubt that Samsung’s Galaxy Gear is going to cause a shift in the wearable tech industry. 'Analysts have estimated that the industry is already worth $3-5 billion today and in the next three years could be worth up to $50 billion. That is an incredible wave to ride if you are Samsung.' 'But what is more interesting is the impact this will have on the apps that we use. 'Mobile has completely changed social – the social web was about context and social mobile is about interaction ie games, events and real time, albeit ephemeral, communication.' 'Just one small example, but I’m excited to see that they have launched with Evernote. 'This will radically change how I keep notes on everything from new startups that I meet, a bottle of wine that I tried at dinner that I want to remember and reading a new recipe on my wrist as I cook for my wife.' Following the launch, Vouchercodespro saw 11 per cent of the entire searches on its website for Samsung's smartwatch.","Samsung announced details of it Galaxy Gear smartwatch on Wednesday .

"The great escapes of a paratrooper who survived a firing squad, escaped from a prisoner of war camp and was shot four times in battle have emerged after his medals were put up for auction. Lieutenant Percy 'Clem' Clements became one of the most highly-decorated soldiers of the Second World War for his heroics and acts of bravery. Now the Nottingham-born soldier's medals, along with a map he used to escape from the Italian camp, a diary he kept while on the run and a memo written as he lay injured in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge have been put up for sale by his family, with the awards expected to sell for £40,000. Great escapes: Second World War Paratrooper Lieutenant Percy 'Clem' Clements survived a firing squad, escaped from a prisoner of war camp and was shot four times in battle . Medal haul: Lt Clements became one of the most highly-decorated soldiers of the Second World War for his heroics and acts of bravery, receiving the Distinguished Conduct Medal, Military Cross and Military Medal . Lt Clements was a founding member of the airborne SAS and was involved in the very first British paratroop drop over Italy in 1941. A group of 35 men, including Lt Clements, were captured after the successful mission to blow up an aquaduct. They were stripped and lined up against a wall in front of 20 irate civilians armed with shotguns. However, just as the order to fire was about to be given, an Italian army officer arrived on horseback and put a stop to the summary execution that would have been in breach of the Geneva Convention. Lt Clements then spent two and a half years in a PoW camp during which time he established clandestine communications between fellow captured officers and the War Office. He managed to escape in 1943 and spent 22 days walking more than 100 miles to reach the advancing Allied forces in Italy. Troop: Clements is pictured in the back row, immediately to the right of the parachute hole, alongside his comrades from Xi Troop, 11 SAS Battallion at Tatton Park in Cheshire before their deployment . Lt Clements rejoined his battalion and went into the Ardennes Forest in Belgium during the infamous Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. Heavily outnumbered and facing German Tiger tanks in one action, he led his men in a fighting withdrawal and was shot four times, in the stomach, arm and leg. His two stretcher bearers were killed as they carried him but he continued to direct the retreat while lying down until he passed out from blood loss. Lt Clements won the prestigious Distinguished Conduct Medal, Military Cross and Military Medal for his bravery, with the medal group being sold at London auction house Spinks later this month. Tools: A tiny Escaper's Compass, used by Lt Clements during his escape from the prisoner of war camp . Being auctioned alongside it is a tiny compass in the form of a button, a covert map he used during his escape in Italy and the diary documenting his escape. There is also an incredible note Lt Clements started to write as he lay wounded in the Ardennes. The message was to summon an ambulance for injured comrades but he passed out before he could finish it. 'Clem Clements’ medals are very rare group, quite possibly unique in terms of the combination of gallantry awards,' said Mark Quayle from Spinks. 'He was one of the most decorated airborne troops of the Second World War who never knew when he was beaten. He kept coming back for more up until the point he was wounded four times on the same occasion. 'The fact that he survived a fire squad tells you just how remarkable his story of survival was.' Lt Clements, from Nottingham, joined the army in 1928 and following the outbreak of the Second World War volunteered for special service. The British airborne unit was formed at the behest of Winston Churchill and carried out Operation Colossus in February 1941. After blowing up the Tragino Aqueduct, the group were sent to meet up with a Royal Navy submarine off the coast 80 miles away. But they were hunted down by a mob of 250 civilians, and a member of the raiding party shot and killed two Italians before the soldiers surrendered. Lt Clements said in an interview later: 'We were marched over to a bare patch where the bodies lay and a very hysterical civilian with two pistols assumed charge of a firing squad of 12 civilians armed with some ancient double and single barrel shotguns.' One ringleader incited the crowd to avenge the death of the two locals and show no mercy to the British troops. He reached the point of raising his arm to command the firing squad to take aim. 'What saved us was the fact the hysterical chap liked to hear himself talk and while he was still raving a W.O of the carabinieri came up and took over,' Lt Clements wrote. After his escape and march to freedom while being pursued by the Germans, Lt Clements was awarded the DCM for his ‘gallant and distinguished service’ as a PoW and subsequent escape. Prisoners:  'X' troop prisoners at Sulmona Camp, where Lt Clements was held for two and a half years, during which time he established clandestine communications between fellow captured officers and the War Office. He managed to escape in 1943 . He was commissioned into the 12th Parachute Regiment in August 1944 and four months later was sent in to Belgium. His platoon were ordered to occupy a hill overlooking the town of Bure but found themselves virtually surrounded by German forces. Lt Clements gave orders to withdraw but was shot in the stomach. Despite the severity of his wound he continued to give orders and successfully extracted his men before he was hit three more times and eventually passed out. He was awarded the Military Cross for leading his men with distinction against heavy armour and was later awarded the Military Medal for his outstanding leadership. After the war, Lt Clements took up a civilian post with the Ministry of Defence in Shropshire, where he moved with wife Eileen. He died in 1998. His son is Brigadier David Clements who served in Iraq as deputy to American general David Patraeus. 'His wounds (which he only survived because of his exceptional fitness) meant that he had to leave the Army after his recovery and he then worked until his retirement as a Civil Servant in the Ministry of Defence,' wrote Brig Clements in a piece for historical website ParaData. 'Clem Clements was a modest man and was embarrassed to be regarded as one of the most highly decorated members of the airborne forces he helped found. 'All who served with him paid tribute to his courage, determination and inspirational leadership. Younger men on the parachute raid, and later in the POW Camp, came to value his advice, assistance and irrepressible humour. All agree that he was indeed ""a man among men"" and one of the great fighting soldiers of the British Army.'

"A mother whose two young children were butchered in their own homes - allegedly by their own nanny - has revealed how despair overwhelmed her in the days following the brutal murder. Marina Krim, 38, found six-year-old Lucia and one-year-old Leo stabbed to death in her apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side apartment. Yoselyn Ortega, their nanny, stands accused of taking a knife to the children and then cutting her own throat in the grisly October 2012 killings. Grief: Marina Krim, left with her husband Kevin, spoke of her grief at a fundraiser for the couple's murdered children this week . Murdered: Yoselyn Ortega, center, is accused of stabbing Lucia, six, right, and one-year-old Leo (not pictured) to death. Also in the above picture is Nessie, then three, left . The shocking deaths, which Marina discovered when she brought her other daughter Nessie, then three, home from swimming, made it seem impossible to go on. Marina said: 'I was sitting in the hospital, Nessie clinging to my chest - and I was asking over and over to anybody who would listen, ""What am I supposed to do tomorrow? How do I do this? What do we do?""' Nobody could tell her anything, she recalled in a speech earlier this week, leaving her and her husband Kevin desperate for answers, People magazine reported. Victims: Lucia, left, and Leo, right, were found dead in their Upper West Side apartment by Marina, who was bringing their sister Nessie back from a swimming class . Accused: Ortega, picture in a court hearing last year, has denied that she killed the children . She said: 'The hospital workers looked at me with a blank stare. A few days later, Kevin and I met some of the top psychiatrists in New York City, and they didn't have a reassuring answer for us either.' But the couple eventually found a way out of their daily suffering and bewilderment - guided in part by the example of their three-year-old. She said: 'I remember looking at our daughter Nessie in the darkest days and I so admired her ability to just live in the present... Though she missed her siblings, she was laughing and enjoying herself and making every heartbroken person in the room smile.' Fundraiser: Marina spoke of her grief and despair at an event held by the Lulu & Leo Fund, which supports arts and science programs for children . Guests: The crowds at the City of New York Museum of Fifth Avenue bid for glamorous lots and listened to performers . Speech: Marina said Nessie helped provide the family with hope in the desperate days after the murder . Marina spoke of her family's struggle at the New York city museum on Fifth Avenue as part of a charity event for the Lulu & Leo Fund, a foundation established in honor of her murdered children. The fund supports arts and educational programs for disadvantaged children, inspired in part by the artistic leanings of the Krim children. And since the horrifying events of 2012, Nessie has now been given the chance to welcome a new sibling, after Marina and Kevin had another son, Felix, who is now around a year old. The fundraiser, held Wednesday, featured performances by a youth choir supported by the Leo & Lulu Fund, as well as auctions for charity lots including tickets to the Stanley Cup, a Napa Valley vineyard tour, and a chance to have a character named after you in the upcoming Sharknado 3 film. Worthy causes: The SingForHope choir, pictured, performed at the event on Wednesday . Many of the lots lots were tied to NBC shows - such as a set tour of Blacklist and a meeting with Today Show hos Matt Laure; fitting given Kevin Krim's job as an executive at the CNBC channel. After the event, Kevin re-posted excited tweets from successful bidders, and performers from the SingForHope choir. Meanwhile Ortega has been jailed over the killings, and awaits her trial, which has yet to be assigned a date.","Marina Krim, 38, found children Lucia, six, and Leo, one, murdered at home .

"Rev Francis Cooke said he wasn't just  a chaplain but a counsellor to all faiths . Every week for ten years the Rev Francis Cooke visited the shop floor at Bentley, offering counselling and advice to the luxury car maker's workers. But only days before Christmas he has been made redundant because the company says he might offend non-Christians. It said there were too many religions represented among the 4,000-strong workforce at its factory to warrant a Christian chaplain. Mr Cooke called the decision 'ridiculous' and said he spoke to workers of all faiths. Staff have started a campaign to reinstate the vicar, who they said was an 'important figure' who had even helped one employee who had been on the brink of suicide. Mr Cooke was directly employed by Bentley – it would pay the Diocese of Chester, which would then transfer the funds to the chaplain. He had outside roles, but this was his only paid work. He said: 'It is just beyond belief. The reason I have been given is that there are too many people of different faiths to warrant a Christian chaplain. Everyone thinks it is quite ridiculous. There have been no complaints against me and my position is to help people and not just those who are Christians.' He said he had been told to leave immediately after bosses said they needed to take a 'multi-faith outlook'. He would visit the factory in Crewe, Cheshire, once a week for six hours, and also ran Christian courses and wrote a message in the firm's newsletters. 'It is not just about offering religious services,' he said. 'I provide counselling to workers who have stresses at home such as broken marriages. I would spend a few minutes with each person which would be enough to help them feel better. 'I feel that there is something else behind this.' Mr Cooke said there had been a change since the appointment of new personnel by German firm Volkswagen, which took over the British brand in 1998.

'There have been many new faces around recently and I noticed I was being watched when I was talking to some of the staff even if it was just for a matter of seconds or minutes. I knew something was going on and that there was trouble ahead.' Yesterday one worker said: 'We have started a petition as we want him back. Everyone is really angry about it.' Retired employee John Austin, 67, said: 'He was there for a lot of people. I know one individual who was feeling suicidal, but Francis turned him around. 'He was a very important man at the factory.' A Bentley Motors spokesman said: 'We have a wide range of faiths and want to take a multi-faith outlook. It would be very difficult to have somebody from each faith. 'This now gives us the opportunity to look at this and recognise the range of faiths we have here.'","Rev Francis Cooke made redundant just days before Christmas .

"The Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously believed. The study reveals that shrinking of the . vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 . and 9,000 years ago causing a rapid sea level rise. During one period 14,600 years ago, melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft (2 metres) in just 100 years. Scroll down for video . A new study has revealed that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a rapid sea level rise. Pictured is one of many icebergs that sheared off the continent and ended up in the Scotia Sea . The results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in Antarctic's and reflect predictions for the region's future. It also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the West Antarctic ice sheet has already begun and could be 'unstoppable.' The study was conducted by an international team including researchers from Germany, Canada, Hawaii, Lapland and Australia. The group examined two sediment cores from the Scotia Sea between Antarctica and South America that contained ‘iceberg-rafted debris’. This is debris that has been scraped off Antarctica by moving ice and deposited via icebergs into the sea. As the icebergs melted, they dropped minerals into the seafloor sediments, giving scientists a glimpse into the past behaviour of the Antarctic ice sheet. An international team examined two sediment cores from the Scotia Sea to uncover the history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. In this image researchers aboard the French R/V Marion Dufresne II are shown recovering the sediment cores . Periods of rapid increase in iceberg-rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the Antarctic ice sheet. The researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago, and continuing until 9,000 years ago. Up until now, the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet wasn't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago. ‘Conventional thinking based on past research is that the Antarctic ice sheet has been relatively stable since the last ice age, that it began to melt relatively late during the deglaciation process, and that its decline was slow and steady until it reached its present size,’ said lead author Michael Weber, a scientist from the University of Cologne in Germany. As the icebergs melted, they dropped minerals into the seafloor sediments, giving scientists a glimpse into the past behaviour of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Pictured is the Calypso Corer aboard the French R/V Marion Dufresne II which was used to retrieve the sediment cores . ‘The sediment record suggests a different pattern – one that is more episodic and suggests that parts of the ice sheet repeatedly became unstable during the last deglaciation,’ Professor Weber added. The research has provided the first solid evidence that the Antarctic ice sheet contributed to what is known as ‘meltwater pulse 1A’, . Meltwater pulse 1A was a period when sea levels rose rapidly from between 52 to 79ft (16 to 24m) around 14,600 to 13,500 years. The largest of the eight episodic pulses outlined in the new Nature study coincides with this event. ‘During that time, the sea level on a global basis rose about 50 feet in just 350 years – or about 20 times faster than sea level rise over the last century,’ said Professor Peter Clark, an Oregon State University. ‘We don't yet know what triggered these eight episodes or pulses, but it appears that once the melting of the ice sheet began it was amplified by physical processes.’ The group examined two sediment cores from the Scotia Sea between Antarctica and South America that contained 'iceberg-rafted debris.' This is debris that has been scraped off Antarctica by moving ice and deposited via icebergs into the sea . Vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to . be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may . push up sea levels for centuries, according to scientists. In . a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already . started could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to . current sea levels. A Nasa . study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data of what . researchers call 'the weak underbelly of West Antarctica' shows the . melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a . critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. Evidence . shows 'a large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into a . state of irreversible retreat', says lead author Eric Rignot of the . University of California, Irvine, and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . in Pasadena, California. The . coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level, holding . back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt, he said. 'It . does seem to be happening quickly,' says University of Washington . glaciologist Ian Joughin, lead author of a separate study into the same . phenomenon. 'We really are witnessing the beginning stages.' It's . likely because of man-made global warming and the ozone hole which have . changed the Antarctic winds and warmed the water that eats away at the . feet of the ice, researchers said at a Nasa news conference Monday. 'The system is in sort of a chain reaction that is unstoppable,' continued Rignot. 'Every process in this reaction is feeding the next one. It's passed the point of no return.' Scientists say curbing carbon emissions won't be able to stop the collapse of these glaciers, but may slow the process and at least prevent the them from melting at their current speed . The researchers suspect that a feedback mechanism may have accelerated the melting, possibly by changing ocean circulation that brought warmer water to the Antarctic subsurface. ‘This positive feedback is a perfect recipe for rapid sea level rise,’ said co-author Axel Timmermann, a climate researcher at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Some 9,000 years ago, the episodic pulses of melting stopped, the researchers say. ‘Just as we are unsure of what triggered these eight pulses,’ Professor Clark said, ‘we don't know why they stopped. ‘Perhaps the sheet ran out of ice that was vulnerable to the physical changes that were taking place. ‘However, our new results suggest that the Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than previously considered.’ Today, the annual calving of icebergs from Antarctic represents more than half of the annual loss of mass of the Antarctic ice sheet – an estimated 1,300 to 2,000 billion tonnes. Earlier this month, Nasa said vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries, according to scientists. In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 ft (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels.

"Those of us caught in downpours in our shorts or left peeling soggy sausages off the barbecue could probably have told them all along. The Met Office finally admitted yesterday that the forecasts it gave of ‘dry’ weather last year were ‘not helpful’. But the organisation’s chief scientist still insisted two-thirds of its long-term forecasts are ‘very helpful’ – without specifying quite what that means for the other third. Error: The Met Office predicted that last April would be a dry month. But a later report sent to Defra said the advice was 'not helpful' as the month was 'the wettest since detailed records began' In its official guidance to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Met Office said that last April was likely to be ‘drier than usual’. Instead, of course, it turned into a washout that spilled over into the rest of 2012 – which became the wettest year since records began. So while the long-term forecast suggested a national drought that was going to get worse, tens of thousands actually found themselves facing widespread flooding. The embarrassing admission came to light thanks to a Freedom of Information request. An internal document revealed that forecasters had said at the end of March that they expected ‘drier than average conditions for April to June, with April driest’. But in a report sent later to Defra’s chief scientist, the Met Office admitted: ‘Given that April was the wettest since detailed records began in 1910, and the April May June quarter was also the wettest, this advice was not helpful.’ The Met Office has been so embarrassed by its errors in the past that it stopped issuing long-term forecasts to the public. Instead, it continues to give ‘probability’ guidance for coming months to Government departments such as Defra which need to plan. But last year, it seems, its forecast did nothing to help anyone. Yesterday, Met Office chief scientist Julia Slingo insisted that in almost two-thirds of cases their long term ‘probabilistic’ predictions were ‘very helpful’. She said of last year’s forecast: ‘In March we were facing really very serious pressures on water resources – a major drought that had been going on for a couple of years. I thought I was right to emphasise the risk of dry conditions continuing as a precautionary principle.’ Washout: New Road in Worcester, the home of Worcestershire County Cricket Club, after the record rainfall . No more predictions: The Met Office has been so embarrassed by its errors in the past that it stopped issuing long-term forecasts to the public . Still, Professor Sligo was not deterred from making a few predictions for those shivering their way through the Easter weekend. She suggested better weather would arrive – but not until May. She said: ‘We certainly see the cold weather continuing at least for the next few days, and potentially into the middle of April. Our monthly forecast looking at April slightly favours cold conditions continuing. ‘Beyond that, I think, into the summer, it’s much more difficult to predict. I think we’re expecting a return to normal conditions into May and then June.’ In the short-term, forecasters say most parts of the country can expect dry and bright spells until Tuesday, although temperatures will remain very low.","Met Office said that last April was likely to be 'drier than usual'

"College student Jon Meis said on Monday that it's hard to accept his status as a hero as he pepper-sprayed a gunman on a Seattle campus last Thursday . College student Jon Meis, who has shied away from the spotlight since he ended a Seattle campus shooting by pepper-spraying the gunman last week, said on Monday that it's hard to accept his status as a hero. Meis, 22, and his family have declined media requests since the shooting, with relatives going as far as to ask his high school not to grant interviews about him. But on Monday, Meis issued a written statement through Seattle Pacific University, where the shooting occurred on Thursday. He said he's praying for the victims, . that the tragedy deepened his respect for the work of first responders, . and that the gunman appeared to be a sad, troubled young man, not a . monster. 'I know that I am being hailed as a hero, and as many people have suggested I find this hard to accept,' he wrote. 'I . am indeed a quiet and private individual; while I have imagined what it . would be like to save a life I never believed I would be put in such a . situation. 'It touches me truly and deeply to read online that parents . are telling their children about me and telling them that real heroes do . exist.' Meis is a dean's list senior at the small, Christian college in a leafy neighborhood north of downtown Seattle. Shooting suspect Aaron Ybarra is being held without bail and has been on suicide watch at King County Jail in Seattle . He was working as a building monitor when the gunman walked into Otto Miller Hall and began firing a shotgun. A 19-year-old student was killed and two others injured, and authorities say the carnage almost certainly would have continued had Meis not acted by spraying and tackling the shooter while he reloaded. Meis credited 'God's grace' for enabling him to stop the shooter, whom police have identified as Aaron Ybarra, 26, of the north Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace. 'When I came face to face with the attacker, God gave me the eyes to see that he was not a faceless monster, but a very sad and troubled young man,' Meis wrote. Meis, pictured with his fiancee Kaylie Sparks, said he's praying for the victims, that the tragedy deepened his respect for the work of first responders, and that the gunman appeared to be a sad, troubled young man, not a monster . Meis said he's not ready to forgive him, but added: 'I truly desire that he will find the grace of God and the forgiveness of our community.' Ybarra is being held without bail and has been on suicide watch at King County Jail. His lawyer says he's sorry about the shooting and that he has a long history of mental problems. Ybarra had at least 50 additional shotgun rounds, and after he was arrested he told investigators he planned to kill as many people as possible and himself, police said. Meis also said he has been overwhelmed by generosity and support. An online campaign has raised about $50,000 for him, and supporters bought items on a wedding registry for Meis and his fiancee. He requested that any future donations be directed to the victims of the shooting through Seattle Pacific. Meis said he has been overwhelmed after supporters bought items on a wedding registry for him and his fiancee . To my brothers and sisters at Seattle Pacific University, and my brothers and sisters in Christ throughout the nation and the world, . Words cannot come close to expressing the tragedy that occurred this past week on our campus. Like everyone else, I would hear of these horrible events on the news, but go home knowing that it could never happen to us. On Thursday, my life changed. I was thrown into a life and death situation, and through God’s grace I was able to stop the attacker and walk away unharmed. As I try to return to a normal life in the aftermath of this horrible event, I pray above all things for strength for the victims and their families. While my experience left me in physical shock, I know that many people are dealing with much greater grief than I have experienced, and in honesty I probably would not be able to handle myself right now if I had personally known the victims. I know that I am being hailed as a hero, and as many people have suggested I find this hard to accept. I am indeed a quiet and private individual; while I have imagined what it would be like to save a life I never believed I would be put in such a situation. It touches me truly and deeply to read online that parents are telling their children about me and telling them that real heroes do exist. However, what I find most difficult about this situation is the devastating reality that a hero cannot come without tragedy. In the midst of this attention, we cannot ignore that a life was taken from us, ruthlessly and without justification or cause. Others were badly injured, and many more will carry this event with them the rest of their lives. Nonetheless, I would encourage that hate be met with love. When I came face to face with the attacker, God gave me the eyes to see that he was not a faceless monster, but a very sad and troubled young man. While I cannot at this time find it within me to forgive his crime, I truly desire that he will find the grace of God and the forgiveness of our community. I would like to truly thank the responders who secured the building and the medical staff who looked after myself and those who were injured. After being in this situation myself, it is even harder to imagine what it would be like to have a job where one’s life is willingly put on the line every day. To our police, emergency responders, and armed forces, you have my greatest respect. I am overwhelmed with the incredible generosity that has been showered upon me. It has been deeply touching to read the comments online and realize that my actions have had such a strikingly widespread effect. Moving forward, I am strongly requesting that any future donations be given to the victims through Seattle Pacific University. I am grateful for the prayers and support coming from our home city and afar. In these next few days, weeks, and months, please continue to pray for everyone in the Seattle Pacific community. We serve a truly awesome God and I firmly believe that it is through Him alone that we will find the strength to heal from this tragedy.

"A paedophile who admitted encouraging young boys to strip naked and perform bizarre forfeits on camping trips has been allowed to go on holiday to Center Parcs while on bail. Ex-Scoutmaster Stephen Daniell, 48, was granted permission by a judge at Maidstone Crown Court to visit the child-friendly holiday resort as long as he didn’t 'misbehave'. The controversial decision was made by Judge Charles Byers after Daniell, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, pleaded guilty today to six offences of indecency with a child. Decision: Stephen Daniell, who today pleaded guilty to six offences of indecency with a child, had been allowed to go on holiday to Center Parcs by judge Charles Byers, right. The booking was later cancelled by park bosses . Horrified bosses at the Elveden Forest resort in Suffolk  responded tonight by cancelling the booking, insisting the welfare and safety of guests, particularly children, was 'paramount'. Daniell had asked the judge whether his bail condition of residence could be relaxed to enable him to go on a pre-booked trip from September 3 to 7. Remarking that Daniell had been 'presumptuous' in booking a holiday when he was facing a possible trial, Judge Byers added that he was “not very happy” and asked defence counsel Alan Walmsley: 'What’s he doing at Center Parcs and who is he going with?' After conferring with Daniell at the back of the court, Mr Walmsley said he was going with his wife and that the holiday dates 'were out of the school holidays'. Judge Byers, who commented that he had not himself been to Center Parcs, then granted Daniell permission. Imposing an extra bail condition that he does not have direct or indirect contact with a child under 16, Judge Byers said: 'There will be no walking up to anybody and suggesting a little chat.' He also questioned whether Daniell’s wife was aware of the court proceedings. It was confirmed that she was. Daniell, who works as a window cleaner, had been due to go on trial today for eight offences of indecency with a child but pleaded guilty before it started to six of the charges. Resort: Paedophile Stephen Daniell wanted his bail relaxed for trip to Center Parks . Child-friendly: Convicted paedophile Stephen Daniell wanted to visit the Elveden Forest Center Parcs resort in Suffolk while on bail for indecency charges . The remaining two were ordered to be left on file. Prosecutor Lucy Luttman said Daniell, who has a caution for indecent exposure, met the boys through a conservation group and the offences occurred during trips to Snowdonia National Park in Wales. Miss Luttman said Daniell would encourage them to “get naked” and play forfeit games.

"A schoolboy was raped in a busy department store after being threatened by two men. The 14-year-old was wandering around a shopping centre after travelling into a city centre on a Saturday afternoon. He was using a public toilet in the mall when he became aware of two men staring at him. Inquiry: Police want to speak to these men in connection with an attack on a 14-year-old boy, who was raped in a department store in Manchester . Suddenly one of the men approached him and said: ‘Come with us, do what we say and if you try to run, we’ll get you.’ The boy was then frogmarched by the men – one white and the other Asian – out of the Arndale Centre in Manchester. Led by the arm, he was forcibly taken . about 50 yards away to the nearby Debenhams store. As shoppers and staff . walked around the four-storey department store, oblivious to the boy’s . ordeal, the teenager was forced into a lift by the two men. He was taken by the lift upstairs, where he was marched into a men’s toilet and raped by the Asian man. Two men have been arrested after a teenage boy was raped in a toilet in this Debenhams store in Manchester city centre . Yesterday a police source said the . attack was ‘absolutely horrendous’. The source said: ‘The attack on a . child in a busy department store on a Saturday afternoon will put fear . and dread into the heart of every parent. ‘If teenagers are not safe from . paedophile predators in the heart of a busy city, then it is extremely . worrying.’ Greater Manchester Police have issued CCTV images of the two . suspects wanted for questioning. Detective Sergeant Liam Boden said: ‘This young victim has been absolutely devastated by what happened to him. ‘What makes this incident doubly . shocking is that he was marched across a busy part of the city centre . during the late afternoon on Saturday. ‘However, this means I am confident that shoppers may have seen the offenders either before or after the incident. ‘I want people to take a good look at the men in these images and tell me who they are.’ The boy was attacked after being approached by two men in the Arndale Centre in Manchester . The youngster was frogmarched from the shopping mall by the men - one white and the other Asian . His colleague, Superintendent Stuart . Ellison, said: ‘When you think about a 14-year-old out in the city . centre at that time of the evening, when the footfall is pretty heavy . and there are a lot of people about, the fact that someone could be . marched across the street and into a store in this way is pretty . horrific.’ He added that he found the attack . ‘particularly disturbing’, saying: ‘When I think about family or friends . who could have been out in the Arndale at that time of night, it . disturbs me greatly.’ The assault happened ten weeks ago – . at 5.45pm on Saturday, June 2 – in the heart of Manchester. The teenager . reported the incident and was taken to a rape crisis centre at St . Mary’s Hospital where he was checked by doctors. A team of officers has been working . with the traumatised victim to build up a picture of what happened and . to obtain forensic evidence. A spokesman for Debenhams said senior staff at the Manchester store were looking into the matter.","Boy was attacked in toilet of a Debenhams store in Manchester .

"Benefits claimants cheats are able to keep money they are not entitled to because government officials fail to turn up to legal hearings, it emerged today. The Department for Work and Pensions sent lawyers to just 4 per cent of tribunals held last year to rule on decisions to cut benefits. It means that in many cases people are able to successfully argue in favour of keeping their money, because the government has failed to turn up to challenge it. Thousands of people who appeal against cuts to their benefit stand a better chance of success if the DWP don't turn up . Without a DWP official, judges refer written submissions and lawyers suggest it means the case is more likely to be won by someone appealing to keep their benefits . Official figures also show that the DWP is more likely to win cases if it manages to send someone to the tribunal. There were some 250,000 benefits tribunals last year, as many more people tried to challenged to the welfare system forced through by Iain Duncan Smith. The Work and Pensions Secretary’s decision to force millions of people to face new medical checks and work assessments has led to many people losing benefits, triggering a surge in legal challenges. Labour's Sadiq Khan criticised the government for the soaring number of tribunals . Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Government expenditure is under enormous pressure and instead of saving money, the Ministry of Justice is actually spending more taxpayers’ money on spiralling numbers of tribunal cases. 'It's a double whammy. Over the last three years, there’s been a shocking 35 per cent rise in the number of tribunals dealing with decisions made by government departments.' From April to December 2013 last year, only 4.3 per cent of cases had an official from DWP, the Telegraph reported. In 2010 the figure was 8 per cent and in 200 was 40 per cent. However, the government’s own figures show that claimants are more likely to win their case if an official is not there. When an officer was present, just 41 per cent of benefits claimants won their case. But the figure rose to 50 per cent when there was no presenting officer from DWP. Solicitor Joseph Hughes said: ‘If I was an appellant I’d rather have no representation any day than have somebody turn up,' he said. 'You can’t properly test or cross examine the evidence. There’s no-one to answer them back.’ Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: ‘It's yet another sign of the chaos and incompetence that now reigns at the Department of Work and Pensions, and the utter failure of this government to get a real grip on benefits spending.’ Justice minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘It is a matter for the relevant Department or local authority as to whether they send a presenting Officer to an appeal unless directed to do so by the Tribunal. ‘Departments and local authorities will consider each appeal on a case by case basis. The DWP played down the idea that it loses more appeals because it fails to send officers to court, but admitted it had down ‘no studies’ into the issue.","Department for Work and Pensions accused of bungling legal cases .

"For years philosophers have sought the secret to a fulfilling existence, but now one man claims to have discovered it - and come up with a formula. Research into what makes people feel happy has led renowned professor, Dr Todd Kashdan, to produce an equation called the Feel Good Formula. In it, he identifies six factors which, when put together in the right combination, make a happy soul. Chin up! Could the Feel Good Formula really give you something to smile about? The factors are: Live in the moment (M), be curious (C), do something you love (L), think of others (T), nurture relationships (N), and take care of you body (B). The winning formula is Feeling Good = (Mx16 + Cx1 + Lx2) + (Tx5 + Nx2 + Bx33). Dr Kashdan reviewed the results of nationwide research carried out into how Brits truly feel, inside and out. Dr Kashdan, author of ‘Curious? Discover the Missing Ingredient to a Fulfilling Life’ drew upon his years of experience to analyse the research. The equation sets out the perfect formula which incorporates the 'happiness six'. They include: Living in the moment, curiosity, spending time with family, doing something you love, thinking of others first and taking care of your body . Whilst it may not appear obvious how a combination of letters and numbers will make you feel good, Dr Kashdan believes this formula is the perfect prescription for a happy soul. He said: 'There is no single secret to feeling good, but when these six ingredients are carefully attended to, in the right doses, you will be on target for a happy life. 'Transform’s research shows that Britain is in need of a bit of a lift and it is great to be working with them on this mission to inspire a more upbeat Britain. 'Each of the ingredients requires a bit of work. 'Just know that your hard work will lead to the greatest rewards possible.' Steven Taylor, Marketing Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery said: 'We are delighted to have such a well respected figure as Dr Kashdan involved on the Feel Good Campaign and couldn’t be more pleased that the partnership led to the creation of an actual formula to Feel Good. 'We hope that the Feel Good Formula will continue to help boost spirits and put a smile on faces across the UK.' M Live in the moment - appreciate the . sounds, smells and sights that you take for granted everyday. Remind . yourself every waking hour to do this. C Be curious - explore the unfamiliar, mysterious, complex, and uncertain aspects of our world once a day. L . Do something you love - if there is anything that provides the . framework for a well-lived life it is the presence of activities that . are important to us and excite us. Do this once at work and once at . play. T Think of others first - offer compliments, do a good deed and . listen. This is not intuitive because many believe you need to love . yourself before you can love others. Science has found this to be false. Do this five times a day and you’ll soon see it feels good to make . someone feel good. N Nurture relationships - dedicate time to a . partner, friend or family member twice a day. Scientists have discovered . that when you observe the happiest people on the planet, every single . one has a close, significant relationship with another person. B Take . care of your body - no, you do not need three per cent body fat, nor do you need to . be able to pound through three sets of 15 unassisted handstand push-ups. Taking care of your body is about healthy eating at least three times a day . and committing 30 minutes per day to exercise.","Feel Good Formula was developed by professor Dr Todd Kashdan .

"A young boy learned his lesson the hard way after his father made him hold up a sign on a busy Texas highway admitting he was a school bully. Jose Lagares stood next to his son as he flashed a cardboard poster at the . Ft. Hood Street and W. Veterans Memorial Boulevard intersection on Tuesday afternoon saying: 'I am a bully. Honk if you hate bullies.' Although he has come under fire for his 'bad parenting', Lagares said his tough love approach has worked. Punishment: Jose Lagaras forced his son, a fourth grader, to hold a sign on a busy highway admitting he was a bully . The fourth grader, who has not been named, apologized of his own accord to the student he bullied, NBC News reported. Lagares, from Killeen, said his son was a repeat bully whose behavior worsened despite punishment such as grounding and even . hard labor. Public humiliation, he said, was ' just the final straw, and it seemed to work.' 'Bullying . is also a form of public humiliation. Maybe he understands that when he . humiliates someone publicly that doesn't feel good,' Lagares told wwlp.com. 'Hopefully he'll take that with him so the next time he tries to bully . someone he'll think about it twice.' Embarrassing: Jose Lagares made his son hold up a sign admitting he was a bully on Tuesday afternoon at the Ft. Hood Street and W. Veterans Memorial Boulevard intersection in Texas. His son apologized to his victim the next day of his own accord . However Lagares said he was inundated with negative criticism from passersby, accusing him of being a bad parent. The next day, the unrepentant father went to the same intersection holding a bright orange sign that said: 'I'm not sorry. Honk to stop bullying.' 'I've gotten that I'm lazy, that's . one that really sticks out to me that ya know there was other options . that I could of done and all that, not knowing my story with my child,' Lagares said. 'I refuse to allow my child to be somebody . else's pain. Ya know, we don't need another Columbine, and we don't . need another Solomon Harris. 'Ya know, we don't need that to happen, and I . refuse for my child to be the cause of that.' Unrepentant: After Jose Lagares was criticized for making his son hold up a sign on a busy highway admitting he was a bully, he held up his own sign the next day saying he wasn't sorry for his choice of punishment . Disciplinarian: Jose Lagares said his son learned his lesson and apologized to his bullying victim at school the next day of his own accord . While numerous passersby criticized Lagares, Melissa Esau stopped to thank him for sending a 'positive message'. I just wanted to thank him for taking some responsibility and just having his son say, hey, this isn't right,' she told NBC News.","Jose Lagares made his school bully son hold up a sign on a highway confessing his bad behavior .

"Attacked: Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, tried to end her relationship with Gary Davies on learning he lied about his age . A student slashed and 'sawed' his girlfriend’s neck with a kitchen knife to 'leave a mark on her' after she ended their relationship. Gary Davies, 25, locked Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, in her bedroom before climbing on top of her and hacking a 7cm cut across her throat - narrowly missing her blood vessels. Davies, who had been dating Miss Clegg-Gibson for just two months, said he wanted to 'teach her a lesson' after she ended the relationship on learning he had lied about his age. Davies has pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and false imprisonment but denies attempted murder at Preston Crown Court. The couple met through a friend in May 2013, started dating in July, and both took places at Lancaster University in September. Mr Paul Cummings, prosecuting, told the court the relationship had become strained in the weeks leading up to the incident as Miss Clegg-Gibson discovered Davies was years older than he said. On the night of the attack, the pair had argued about attending a party for fresher’s week, before the teenager said she wanted to end the relationship, he added. When Davies refused to leave, she called the police, and he went to the kitchen to pick a knife, the court heard. Mr Cummings said: 'He walked back into her bedroom with the knife in his pocket and she told him the police were on their way. 'He locked the bedroom door behind him and produced the knife from his pocket. 'She started to cry and asked him what he was doing. He told her to ring the police and tell them not to come to the address. 'She . phoned them back and told them what he was telling her to say but her . friends were outside her door and asked if she was ok. 'She screamed she was but she was terrified.' A few minutes later, a police officer arrived outside and asked Davies to open the door. Mr Cummings added: 'He pointed the knife towards her chest and grabbed her shoulder. 'He climbed on top of her and started to saw at her neck. She had her hand up and was trying to stop him. Help: Miss Clegg-Gibson called police while Davies grabbed a knife from downstairs. Threatening her, he told her to call them back, and tell officers they were not needed at the address . Demanding: She told the jury he had been 'very demanding', wanting to see her every day after they met through a friend . 'She was curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding and could feel the knife on her throat.' Davies, . who was also in his first year at university but lived in different . student accommodation, was stopped when the police officer kicked down . the door. His victim suffered a 7cm cut across her neck, which the court heard had cut deep into fatty tissue but had not severed a blood vessel or caused nerve damage. She also suffered two other 2cm cuts to her neck, a wound 3cm-long to her shoulder, and a cut to her thumb. After his arrest, Davies told the police that he had wanted to 'teach her a lesson' and so had taken the knife from the kitchen and 'thrust it backwards and forwards' across her neck. Mr Cummings said: 'He deliberately went to select a knife knowing the police had been contacted. 'He knew the relationship was at an end and he hadn’t been deterred by other students standing outside the room. 'He was determined that he was going to kill her and he used the knife violently and deliberately to her neck. Campaign of abuse: Preston Crown Court (pictured) heard Robinson adopted Joseph as an 18-month-old baby. She beat him, locked him in darkness and without access to a toilet from 1988 to 1998 . 'He couldn’t have known the force necessary to just leave a mark to her body.' Giving evidence at the hearing today Robyn said Davies had been a 'very demanding' boyfriend and had wanted to see her everyday. She said: 'I would have preferred more time and space to myself but he insisted he see me everyday. 'When I found out he had lied about his age I couldn’t understand it. 'It’s a big thing to lie about who you are and I was scared. 'I told him I wanted to put a break on things and he seemed very tense. I’d never seen him like that before. 'He didn’t act aggressive but I could feel undertones of aggression. 'That night I didn’t want to let him in but I knew if he didn’t find his keys he would try and stay over at mine.'

"Sources say Matt Lauer was the driving force behind firing a hotshot executive hired to help turn around the Today show’s slump in the ratings less than three month after taking over. Former ESPN executive Jamie Horowitz 'was not the right fit' according to a staff memo sent on Monday by NBC News President Deborah Turness. But sources tell reporters it was Lauer who went to Turness and pushed or the firing. Sources say Matt Lauer was the driving force behind firing a hotshot executive hired to help turn around the Today show’s slump in the ratings less than three month after taking over . Out: ESPN executive Jamie Horowitz, brought to NBC to take charge of the Today show, is exiting after less than three months . Page Six reports that their sources say 'Savannah, Natalie and Willie Geist heard about the plan and talked to Matt, who went to Turness and told her, ‘I want to keep these people,’ so she fired Jamie. Once again, Matt Lauer calls the shots at ‘Today.’ The idea of bringing Jamie in was to bring change to the show to help beat ‘GMA,’ but how can you fix it if nobody can make any changes?' Once the nation's leading network morning show, Today has fallen behind ABC's Good Morning America in the battle for ratings over the past two years. When the Horowitz’s hire was first announced in May, Turness said he would push the Today brand and look for new opportunities online and with events. But show insiders told The Wrap that Horowitz managed to alienate both presenters and producers alike during his brief tenure after he sought to pit staff against each other and create an unsettled environment. One source said he had invoked the reality show Survivor in conversations with staffers, asking them which producers they think should be ‘voted off the island’ (aka fired). 'There was a lot of insecurity and instability created when he walked in the door. He would pit anchors against anchors and producers against producers and it created a lot of internal problems,' another source told the New York Post. 'Passed over': Morales, far left, has been at the Today show since 2006 but Savannah Guthrie, in pink, joined the show in 2012 and took the top anchor spot. They are pictured with Matt Lauer and Al Roker . Overseeing: NBC News President Deborah Turness broke the news of Horowitz's departure on Monday . ‘He would ask the staff who they wanted to be their seniors and who were the weakest links in the organization.’ Horowitz wasn't supposed to officially start running the show until December 1, but had been on a 'listening tour' since September. His vision to topple GMA was not met favorably by the show's anchors, while producers were left fearing for their jobs. Horowitz was said to be completely caught off guard by the decision to let him go. In her memo to staff, Turness says Horowitz would be replaced in 'due course' and she will help oversee the show in the meantime. NBC News declined to comment on Horowitz's departure. Horowitz was president of original programming and production at ESPN. His TV career started with an entry-level position on NBC's Olympics team. The Today show continues to be rocked by reports of tensions on set. Last week it was reported that Natalie Morales is looking for new roles after falling out with fellow co-host Tamron Hall. Morales joined the Today team in 2006 as a national correspondent but she has missed out on being the top anchor, including when Ann Curry left in 2012. Following Curry's emotional exit after just a year in the job, she was replaced by Savannah Guthrie. Morales and NBC News President Deborah Turness have not spoken in months, according to sources.","Jamie Horowitz 'was not the right fit' according to a memo from NBC News President Deborah Turness .

"A woman who shot and killed her two young grandsons before committing suicide last year left a note to the boys' parents saying they did not deserve to have the children, according to a police report. Debra Denison, 47, shot and killed her grandsons Alton, 2, and Ashton Denison, six months, in Preston, Conn, before turning the gun on herself . The report, obtained by The Associated Press through a Freedom of Information request, suggests a possible motive for the first time and sheds new light on her mental health problems: The grandmother, Debra Denison, had a history of conflict with the boys' mother and had attempted suicide a half dozen times before. Denison, 47, picked up two-year-old Alton Perry and six-month-old Ashton Perry at a day care in North Stonington on Feb. 26, 2013, and was supposed to take them home for a birthday party but instead drove to a nearby lake where they were found shot to death after a frantic search. In addition to a suicide note to her husband, Denison left a note addressed to the boys' parents, Jeremy and Brenda Perry. Denison was Brenda Perry's mother. 'The . note stated among other things that Brenda and Jeremy did not deserve . to have the children and Debra wanted them to feel the loss of a child,' state police Detective David Lamoureux wrote in a report on Oct. 22. Brenda . Perry told police she had struggled with her mother for years because . of control issues and mental health problems, including dissociative . identity disorder, formerly called multiple personality disorder. Heartbreaking: Alton Perry, left, 2, and Ashton Perry, right, 6 were killed by their grandmother, Debra Denison, in February 2013. A newly-obtained police report shows Denison left a suicide note to the boys' parents saying they did not deserve to have the children . Victims: Ashton (left) and Alton (right) Perry . were found dead in a minivan at Lake of Isle in Preston, Connecticut in February 2013. It was Alton's second birthday . Scene: The bodies were found near the state boat . launch at the end of Lake of Isles Road in Preston, Connecticut . Perry, . 24, said her mother had told Jeremy lies about her in attempts to break . up their relationship and she became more easily agitated after they . married and had children. In the months before the killings, Perry said they had decided to mend fences. Her mother seemed more stable and they were planning to go to counseling together. Perry had recently added her mother to the list of people authorized to collect the children at day care, but Perry's brother or sister was supposed to accompany Denison. The grandmother went alone, and day care workers said she was friendly and talkative as she loaded the children in her van. Jance Denison, Debra's husband, said the revolver that she used belonged to him and was left unloaded in their house. Brenda Perry, the mother of the pair, posted on the day on their murder: 'God has two beautiful angels helping him now' Facebook pictures of the boys' parents, Jeremy and Brenda Perry, with Alton, when he was much younger . Jance Denison had acquired the gun from his brother months earlier because Debra Denison insisted on it being at her house following recent burglaries, the brother told police. Jance Denison said Debra had attempted suicide at least six times over 20 years and been committed but he 'never imagined Debbie was capable of this'. Several relatives told police that Debra was upset by a letter she received about a week before the shootings from her son, Christopher Allen, who is serving a 32-year prison sentence for a drug-related murder. Debra Denison is believed to have shot to death . her two-year-old and six-month-old grandchildren before turning the gun . on herself. Here she is pictured with Alton, who was found dead in the . car alongside his little brother Ashton and his grandmother . Allen, who was interviewed in prison during the search for his nephews, said that when he was younger his mother told him he was a product of rape. A month and a half before the shooting, she told him that was a lie she told because she did not want Allen's biological father to raise him. Allen said the letter to his mother expressed 'how I truly felt' about her. The report from state police said the case is closed with no further investigation anticipated.","Debra Dennison, 47, picked up her grandsons Alton, 2, and Ashton Perry, six months, from their daycare in Preston, Connecticut, on February 26, 2013 .

"U.S. researchers found more than 28 cups of coffee a week increases by half the chances of premature death in younger people . If you’re already holding your first coffee of the morning, you might want to put it down. Because drinking four cups a day could raise your risk of dying young, researchers warn – but only if you’re under 55. They found that consuming 28 cups of coffee a week increases the chances of premature death in younger people by half. The findings come from a large- scale American lifestyle study of 43,727 individuals aged 20 to 87. The US researchers suspect excessive coffee consumption may adversely affect the body’s metabolism, outweighing some of the known health benefits. Individuals with a ‘genetic coffee addiction’ may be prone to these harmful effects, they suggest. But the latest study conflicts with a number of others, which have linked moderate coffee consumption with longevity. Around 2,500 deaths were recorded over the course of the 16-year study. Just under a third of these were because of heart and artery disease. Participants who drank more coffee were also more likely to smoke, and had less healthy hearts and lungs. The risk of death from all causes rose by 56 per cent for men and women younger than 55 who drank more than 28 cups of coffee a week, said a report in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Scientists suspect excessive coffee consumption may adversely affect the body's metabolism, outweighing some of the known health benefits . Researcher Steven Blair, of the . University of South Carolina, said: ‘Significantly the results did not . demonstrate any association between coffee consumption and all-cause . mortality in older men and women.’ But the researchers did not explain why coffee did not affect older people in the same way. Coffee contains thousands of  different chemicals, which can have both good and bad effects on health. Recent research has shown that coffee . is a major dietary source of antioxidant, and it may reduce inflammation . and boost brain function. At the same time, coffee stimulates . the release of adrenaline, inhibits insulin activity, increases blood . pressure, and raises levels of homocysteine, a harmful chemical linked . to heart disease and dementia. Coffee stimulates the release of adrenalin, inhibits insulin activity, increases blood pressure (pictured) and raises levels of homocysteine, a harmful chemical linked to heart disease and dementia .

The use of a questionnaire can result . in recall bias, with people struggling to remember how many cups of . coffee they have consumed in the past week, he said. Other factors such as smoking and poor fitness could partly explain the link with premature death. Previous studies have found either no link between coffee consumption and heart deaths, or a positive effect, he added. He said: ‘There is a growing body of . data which suggests that coffee is perfectly safe when consumed in . moderation – four to five cups a day – and as part of a balanced diet.","High consumption 'raises premature death chance in younger people'

"Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is the person who bought an Atlantic City property that earned its owner folk hero status for resisting decades of overtures from developers including Donald Trump. Citing real estate records, The Press of Atlantic City reports Icahn's IEH Investments LLC paid $583,000 for Vera Coking's modest three-story boardinghouse at an auction in August. Coking won attention over the years as she repeatedly rebuffed offers from Trump and Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, as well as an attempted state takeover of her property. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is the person who bought an Atlantic City property that earned its owner folk hero status for resisting decades of overtures from developers including Donald Trump . She now lives in a California retirement home. Construction crews are now removing asbestos from the building in advance of its demolition. Many of the windows are gone, and the exterior has been wrenched off one side. The home sits next to the now-closed Trump Plaza casino. Press of Atlantic City reports that the Trump Plaza was one of four casinos to shut down this year as the state reeled from economic troubles. Icahn now controls the now bankrupt Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc's debt, and could potentially take control of the casino. He's already slated to take over the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort after that casino shuts down on Dec. 12. Icahn's IEH Investments LLC paid $583,000 for Vera Coking's modest three-story boardinghouse at an auction in August . He has yet to announce plans for the Coking home, the purchase of which puts him in control of prime real estate barely half a block from the Boardwalk. It's possible that both the house and Trump Plaza will be demolished to expand the Walk, the city's shopping and entertainment district. 'From what I heard, it would be demolished and incorporated into the extension of The Walk,” Nate Chait, Coking’s Atlantic City real estate broker, told Press of Atlantic City. 'They’ve talked about making it more of an entertainment area. I don’t think it’s going to be a casino again.' Coking purchased the home with husband Raymond, who passed away in 1967, at the price of $20,000 in the 1960s when casino gambling was still a decade off in the city's landscape.

"A terrorist plot to blow up a U.S. passenger jet timed to coincide with the Olympics has been uncovered by security agencies, according to intelligence sources. Al Qaeda intended to use a radicalised Norwegian Islamic convert to attack U.S. planes in the build-up to the London Games - which start in 26 days on July 27 - it is understood. The plan centred on using the so-called ‘clean skin’ – a terrorist with no previous criminal record and are unlikely to raise suspicions among the security services – in order to evade airport security. The al Qaeda plot to blow up a U.S. passenger jet discovered by intelligence services involved using a radicalised Norwegian Islamic convert to evade airport security measures. File picture . ‘If you are blowing up aeroplanes you are likely to be killing Brits or having a big impact on the European or British economy. [So it] would in effect be an attack against Britain,’ a Whitehall official told the Sunday Times. It is believed the suspect tasked with the attack uses the Islamic name Muslim Abu Abdurrahman, had converted to Islam in 2008, and was recruited in a terrorist training camp in Yemen, sources told the Sunday Times. It is not thought to have been aimed specifically at the Olympics in London, but security forces protecting the Games said intelligence on any possible threat was constantly reviewed. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We have planned against the four main areas of threat: terrorism, serious and organised crime, public disorder and natural hazards. 'We are working closely with Games organisers to deliver an end to end operation to ensure everyone is safe and secure. Alongside LOCOG’s in venue security operation, police will be present for the detection and prevention of crime. 'Our intelligence is kept under constant review. For operational reasons we do not discuss the exact detail of how we monitor any individual or group.' Terrorists from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular (AQAP), based in Yemen, are understood to be behind this latest plot. The same group were revealed to have been behind at least four other attempted attacks in the last four years. 'Unrepentant': Prosecutors at his trial said Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab would try to kill again . Nigerian-born British student Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was ordered to carryout a suicide mission for AQAP when he attempted to detonate a bomb in his underpants as the plane, en route from Amsterdam, approached Detroit. It failed to fully detonate aboard the flight, which was carrying nearly 300 people, but caused a brief fire that badly burned his groin. Passengers pounced on Abdulmutallab and forced him to the front of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 where he was held until the plane landed minutes later. In 2009, months before the attack, he travelled to Yemen to see Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and one of the best-known al Qaeda figures, according to the government. In February, this year, a U.S. court jailed him for life without parole. AQAP were said to be responsibility for a sophisticated attempt to blow up a cargo plane with bombs hidden in ink cartridges. At least one of the bombs planted on cargo planes heading for Chicago was primed to explode once the aircraft reached the U.S. mainland. The charred underpants with a packet of explosive powder sewn into the crotch, used by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in an attempt to blow up Northwest Airlines flight 253 . The terror plot was thwarted after the two devices - hidden inside printer cartridges - were intercepted at airports in Nottingham and Dubai on October 29, last year. Both bombs contained quantities of the powerful explosive PETN. The device discovered in the UK contained  400 grams of the lethal ingredient – 50 times more than needed to punch a hole in the aircraft’s skin – and was wired to a mobile phone. The device, discovered at East Midland airport, was timed to explode during flight after it entered U.S. air space, Scotland Yard officials said at the time of the plot's discovery. In May, this year, it was revealed security agencies had thwarted another AQAP plot to blow up a U.S.-bound airliner. The attack was prevented because the intended bomber was actually a double agent who infiltrated the group and volunteered for the suicide mission, it was revealed. Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency placed the undercover operator inside AQAP where he convinced his handlers to give him the new type of non-metallic bomb. The agent, who was in Yemen, was liaising with the CIA before handing the device over to intelligence services.",Terrorist group recruited a western Islamic radical in an attempt to evade security procedures .

There are four, but one is missing as the instructor said he was born very weak and probably did not survive. 'It was interesting to observe that they are all different in character - some were bullies and others avoided fights and were calm. 'Most of their scenes are reminiscent of characters from fairy tales about bears where all the bears walk on their hind legs and twist dance. 'It wasn’t scary because the photographs were taken from a small cottage so security was guaranteed.' This is the adorable moment a mother showed her cubs the bear necessities of fishing - and rewarded them with a high five.

"A Russian man is taking the chance to escape the rat race to the extreme - by living like a 10th century hermit in the snow-covered forests of Russia. Pavel Sapozhnikov, 24, from Moscow will spend a total of eight months living like his ancestors did on a replica of an ancient farm as part of a social experiment. He is only allowed to leave the fenced-off area of the farm to hunt and gather food, is banned from any kind of communication, and can only use authentic tools from ancient Russia. Scroll down for video . Russian Pavel Sapozhnikov, 24, pictured, has spent the past four months living on a replica 10th century farm north of Moscow, and is expected to stay there until May this year. Sapozhnikov can only leave the farm to hunt for food and can only use tools that would have been used in ancient Russia . At the start of the project, Pavel . Sapozhnikov was given the chance to document a day in the life using a . camera and notepad, and this was posted on the project’s blog. According . to this blog, Sapozhnikov spends the morning milking his goats and . eating breakfast. He then chops wood for the fire and collects water . from the well. The rest of . the day is spent either hunting for food, or carrying out manual labour . on the farm. This includes insulating the house with manure, maintaining his house and outbuildings, and other tasks around the farm. To prepare for the mission, Sapozhnikov spent months learning how to prepare animals, including chickens. He also became skilled in using the ancient tools and familiarised himself with ancient fire-building and washing techniques. He is only allowed to leave the farm to find food, and is forbidden from any form of communication. The farm is situated in a forest clearing around 50 miles north of the Russian capital. It features a house, a well, hayloft and smokehouse, plus a separate toilet, and bread oven. Sapozhnikov additionally has pens for chickens and goats. The experiment is part of a project called ‘Hero’ and was set up by events manager Alexei Ovcharenko from agency Ratobor. The theory behind the experiment is ‘to trace the social and psychological changes in personality and learn how important the support of others is to modern humans.’ With help from expert archaeologist, Alexander Fetisov, the farm was built using only materials and techniques that would have been used by ancient Russians. Sapozhnikov must also furnish his home in the same way. This includes fire lights that burn on linseed oil, wooden beds, animal fur clothes and bedding and a calendar scratched into the wall of the house. Construction on the farm began at the start of 2012, and Sapozhnikov moved in at the start of September 2013; the project is expected to run until May.

"Supporters of the policeman who shot Michael Brown have launched a campaign to put up a billboard in the city backing the officer. The campaign was launched by a supporter from Tennessee last month and has already raised the $3,000 goal to erect the sign. Plans are for the billboard to read 'Pants Up, Don't Loot' - a phrase made popular by National Review in response to the chant 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' recited by Brown's supporters. What could go wrong? This is the design for the billboard that the supporters of Darren Wilson want to erect in Ferguson . The campaign website says it intends to erect the sign in the 'heart of Florissant' where many of the violent protests have taken place. Although the $3,000 target has been reached, the billboard has not yet been purchased, it was noted by TPM Livewire. According to the campaign website: 'The funds collected from this campaign will be used to purchase this billboard for as long as possible. 'Whatever funds we receive will go directly to keeping the billboard campaign up as long as possible. Vocal: More than 100 people donated more than $3,000 to the fund to purchase the billboard supporting the controversial officer . 'If we come to an agreement with a company and can fund it for 3 months, 5 months, 7 months... we will.' Fortress America identified Don Alexander of Tennessee as the campaign founder. He told them: 'Whatever funds we receive will go directly to keeping the billboard campaign up as long as possible. If we come to an agreement with a company and can fund it for 3 months, 5 months, 7 months..., we will.' The billboard is arguably incendiary and in terrible taste considering the situation currently in Ferguson. Supporters of the policeman who shot Michael Brown have launched a campaign to put up a billboard in the city backing the officer . Outrage: People took to Twitter to complain about the billboard - which they want to erect before the grand jury announcement . Support: Some of the public have sympathized with Officer Darren Wilson and have taken to social media to express this fact . 'Hands up' of course refers to Michael Brown's alleged surrender to Officer Darren Wilson and 'Pants up' to the fashion for wearing low-on-the-waist trousers as popularized by hip-hop aritists. Most people who donated money did so anonymously and it is estimated that more than 100 did so.","Want to erect the billboard in Ferguson ahead of the grand jury vote .

"Named: Rebecca Douglas was just 15 when she plunged the steel prong into the left temple of Julie Sheriff during a petty row in the street . The teenage girl who murdered a 16 year-old rival by stabbing her through the skull with a hair comb was named for the first time today. Rebecca Douglas was just 15 when she plunged the steel prong into the left temple of Julie Sheriff during a petty row in which she accused the victim of spreading gossip about her having sex with boys. She confronted the victim outside a betting shop in south London and demanded: 'What do you think you are doing in Clapham?' The girl then asked her friends to hold her bag and Blackberry mobile phone before stabbing Julie in the shoulder and the head. Seconds later the victim, from Hackney, east London, collapsed and fell into a coma which lasted until her death five months later on September 21 last year. Douglas, who had been sleeping rough at friends’ houses, was ordered to serve a minimum of 10 years after being convicted of murder last month. The Old Bailey heard that the pintail comb had been taken out of Julie’s red weave hair before being used as a lethal weapon in the attack in Battersea, south London, in May last year. Julie, of Hackney, east London, never recovered from the swelling and bleeding it caused to her brain and died almost five months later, in September. Judge Nicholas Cooke warned parents to be aware of the dangers to young girls wearing such combs as 'fashion accessories'. He said: 'We heard evidence that a pintail comb can be used as a lethal weapon. 'We heard it can be worn in the hair as a fashion accessory. 'It can be as effective a killing instrument as a stiletto knife. It is not a very nice thing to have in your hair.' Judge Cooke said that in addition to being detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure, Douglas had been in custody for 15 months. He said she killed Julie in 'hate-filled fury' after the girls argued in the street about mobile phone messages. Judge Cooke told Douglas: 'Your victim died a long, lingering death some months after you attacked her.' Scroll down for video .

In the run-up to the killing, Douglas became convinced that Julie had been spreading malicious gossip about her having sex with boys.

Eyewitnesses remember her angrily telling Julie outside the betting shop that she was not welcome in Clapham.’ A friend of Julie’s told the court: ‘They began arguing, talking about this and that, talking about doing sexual stuff with boys. ‘The argument escalated and it became heated. Julie insisted she hadn’t said any of that. She seemed confused, in shock about what was going on. Spike: A witness saw Douglas strike Julie's collarbone without much effect and then plunge the comb into her skull . ‘I was trying to drag Julie to go but she wanted to say her piece.’ Each girl gave as good as she got . until Douglas took the comb, which a friend said Julie was in the habit . of wearing in her hair. The judge said: 'You took possession of the pintail comb and struck out in fury.' Jonathan Kinnear QC, for Douglas, said she had a traumatic and violent childhood. She had not meant to kill Julie. A replica of the black comb with a spiked metal handle had been shown to the jury. A witness saw the defendant strike Julie’s collarbone without much effect and then plunge the comb into her skull. The witness heard a sound which he described as like 'when you kill a goat back home'. Crime scene: The attack happened in Falcon Road, Battersea, South London . The girls knew each other and actively disliked one another. They met in the street by chance on the fatal day. Jonathan Turner, QC, prosecuting, said: 'There seems to have been a row brewing between them as a result of malicious gossip. Two young girls arguing about gossip and about boys.' Douglas was arrested the following day near an address in Pimlico, central London, where she was staying. She had left a BlackBerry message saying: 'I see some girl that I hate, like I actually hate her with a passion, and I kind of stabbed her.' Julie’s family moved to Britain in 2006 from Sierra Leone, West Africa, where her father, Raouf, was a policeman. He told the court in a statement: 'I am left to wonder why I brought her here and if I hadn’t, she would still be alive. 'The result of seeing my beautiful, bubbly, brilliant daughter bedridden and in a vegetative state, has left me extremely depressed. 'The attack on my daughter was wicked, savage and senseless.'

"The personal assistant who first found the body of Robin Williams on Monday morning at his California mansion has been revealed to be his close friend Rebecca Erwin Spencer. The 57-year-old who worked with the Oscar winner for years made the harrowing discovery when she entered his bedroom after he failed to respond to knocks on the door according to Radar Online. Having worked with Williams for at least 20-years, Rebecca was trusted by the sometimes manic comedian to keep him grounded, in particular keeping his ego in check by addressing him with the pet name, 'Mork Guy', in reference to his breakthrough role in Mork and Mindy. Scroll down for video . Close friends: Rebecca Erwin Spencer and Robin Williams in this undated picture from the Facebook account of the comedian's personal assistant . Friends: Rebecca Erwin Spencer, Robin Williams at the opening night of Robin Williams' Broadway debut in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in March 2011 . Rebecca, who became so close to the comic genius that she moved houses to be near to him, was seen entering Williams' Tiburon home at around 11am on Tuesday following his tragic suicide and that morning posted pictures of herself and the actor to Facebook, to which friends added messages of support. One long term friend of Robin and Rebecca revealed to MailOnline the level of dedication that the Good Will Hunting star's assistant had towards her employer. The friend, who did not want to be identified said, 'Rebecca was incredibly close to Robin. She used to live In San Fransisco, but when Robin moved out to Tiburon, she moved to a place about five minutes away.' Rebecca, who worked as Williams' assistant on more than 33 films, including his Oscar triumph for Good Will Hunting, was praised by the comic when he accepted the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award from the Golden Globes in 2005. In a typically irreverent speech, Williams thanked the Foreign Press Association for honoring his work as a comedian, paid tribute to his family and credited Rebecca with keeping his ego in check by calling him 'Hey, Mork Guy'. In another sign of the closeness between the star and his employee, one of Rebecca's neighbors claimed the Oscar winner actually bought her and her husband Dan their new house in Tiburon, although that is unconfirmed. 'What a time we had!': Rebecca Erwin Spencer uploaded this picture to her Facebook account of one of Robin Williams' many USO tours to entertain the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan . On set: This is Robin Williams' co-star from Night at the Museum, Crystal the monkey, with Rebecca Spencer, (left) in March of 2014 and (right) in another undated picture the longtime personal assistant poses for the camera . Whimsical: Rebecca Erwin Spencer was known amongst her friends for her devotion to Robin Williams and even moved to be near to the legendary comic so that she could give him her full attention . The neighbor explained: 'Both her and Dan were completely dedicated to Robin, it really was like they were part of the family. 'When we heard his personal assistant had found him, we assumed it must have been either Rebecca or Dan. 'And then when it came out that it was a woman, we knew it had to be Rebecca. It would have been so horrendous for her, it will stay with her forever. 'She used to spend so much of her time with Robin. She traveled everywhere with him and was always round at his house. Fans laid flowers at the gate of Williams' mansion in a secluded neighborhood at 95 St. Thomas Way outside Tiburon, California . 'They used to dog sit for him as well. Whenever you saw them walking their dogs and they had a little pug with them, that was Robin's. 'He sometimes used to come round and they would have little events in the back garden. We always used to joke with them that they never invited us. 'They are a lovely couple, but they are quite shy and quiet, so they didn't make a big deal of their relationship with Robin. 'This will be absolutely awful for them. I just can't imagine how they are feeling.' On Tuesday morning, Rebecca, who first worked with Robin on his 1993 hit, Mrs. Doubtfire, uploaded a picture of Robin Williams performing for the troops on one of his USO tours and added the message, 'What a time we had!'. One friend, Aunti Kr replied, 'You were the wind beneath his wings.' Another friend on Facebook, Tom Reilly wrote, 'You were an amazing team. Truly.' Louis Spotswood commented, 'Rebecca...you gave him so much that was great in his life. You did the best he could have asked for!' Williams had been open about his struggles with alcohol and cocaine and in the past months had entered a rehabilitation center to help him maintain sobriety. But many questions remained over what could have led him to take his own life. Williams' publicist, Mara Buxbaum, said on Monday that he had been suffering from severe depression, and Boyd acknowledged that he had been seeking treatment without giving more details. Williams was last seen alive by his wife, Susan Schneider, on Sunday night when she retired for the evening. She left the next morning around 10 a.m., thinking that her husband was still asleep.","Personal assistant Rebecca Erwin Spencer found Robin Williams on Monday .

"Britain’s power stations are still pumping out increasing amounts of greenhouse gases while families face a rise in taxes designed to cut emissions. The escalation in pollution levels comes as the average household is being forced to contribute £112 in green taxes each year. By the end of the decade, families will have to pay almost £300 a year to fund renewable energy, such as wind and nuclear, as well as insulating older homes. Both policies are being heavily promoted by the Government in a bid to cut the nation’s carbon dioxide gas emissions in order to meet stringent international targets. UK power stations' emissions have increased, while UK families are set to shell out £300 for renewable energy by 2020 . But last year, the levels of the gas . pumped out by Britain’s energy companies increased by 4 per cent . compared to 2011, as the amount of coal burnt for power leapt up by a . quarter. For each unit of energy, coal produces double the amount of . carbon dioxide than gas or oil. The UK is one of only four European countries that have increased pollution from power production, with only Malta doing worse. The other 23 EU nations managed to reduce emissions from power companies. Carbon dioxide accounts for more than 80 per cent of Britain’s total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 per cent of emissions coming from the energy sector and only 15 per cent produced by households, critics say targeting families while increasing output from power stations is pointless. Dr Lee Moroney of the Renewable Energy Foundation, which publishes energy data, said: ‘It is unreasonable that hard-pressed householders are being made to fund increasingly expensive and diverse energy policies which these latest figures show are clearly not working.’ Taxpayers will face extra tax to fund renewable power sources such as wind and nuclear . The latest estimated emission figures were produced by Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistical arm, which found that across the EU, carbon dioxide output for energy use had gone down by 2.1 per cent. A Eurostat spokesman said: ‘At the moment, the global price for hard coal is down and we see in the UK a huge increase in its use – 27 per cent compared to the previous year – while gas and oil use has fallen.’ Since 1990, there has been an overall decrease in UK carbon dioxide emissions of around 19 per cent. In 2011, Britain delivered the biggest emissions cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas output by 40 million tons, a fall of 7 per cent. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he will push for the EU to adopt the most stringent green targets in the world. He said he would seek a legally binding target to cut collective greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50 per cent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘Cheaper coal relative to gas has resulted in a short-term increase in the amount of carbon emissions from UK power stations. The amount of coal generation is expected to decline rapidly by 2020 as a result of our move to a low carbon economy. ‘Global gas prices have primarily been pushing up household energy bills – not green subsidies. ‘Investing in home-grown alternatives is the only sure-fire way of insulating our economy and bill-payers from international energy price volatility. ‘Our household energy-efficiency policies are more than offsetting the costs of clean energy investment. By 2020 the average household bill will be £166 lower than it would be if we were doing nothing.’","Meanwhile, gas pumped out by power stations jumped 4 per cent .
UK is one of just four EU nations that has increased emissions ."
"Fruit and vegetables are responsible for 46 per cent of food poisoning cases, recent research shows. The study by the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that leafy vegetables, namely lettuce and spinach, are the worst offenders. It also showed that meat and poultry are responsible for 22 per cent of food poisoning cases. Fruit and vegetables are responsible for 46 per cent of food poisoning cases - and leafy greens are the worst offenders. Meat and poultry are only responsible for 22 per cent . The study found that every year one in six people in the U.S. fall ill with food poisoning – about nine million people. The majority of cases of foodborne illness caused by leafy vegetables are caused by pre-cut greens which are bought in plastic bags. The reason for this is that these products tend to be eaten raw. In contrast, the bugs in meat and poultry that many people would expect to be the cause of most cases of food poisoning, are usually killed during cooking. Every year one in six people in the U.S. fall ill with food poisoning - about nine million people . Dr Michael Doyle, director of the . University of Georgia's Centre for Food Safety explained to Modern . Farmer that lettuce is particularly dangerous as harmful bacteria can . form within the plant tissue. This means that when the lettuce is washed, the bacteria will not be washed away. He added that leafy greens can cause E.Coli, salmonella, and listeria. These bugs tend to come from animals which carry them in their intestines. If the animals’ manure gets into soil or water, it can contaminate vegetables. Salmonella is especially likely to be transmitted in this way as manure can be blown around by the wind when it dries out, and salmonella is known to be tolerant to drying. In extreme cases, contaminated bagged salad can cause fatal kidney failure, according to Dr Doyle. Dr Doyle says that the only way to prevent lettuce-related food poisoning is to ensure that farmers are doing something to kill bacteria in the field, as soon as the leaves are picked. He believes that farmers should be using disinfectants to achieve this – he says that currently they typically use chlorine but that this is not very effective at killing bacteria. However, Dr Doyle accepts that the odds are in the consumers favour as millions of bags of salad are sold every year and the number of food poisoning cases is small. This data is supported by a recent study from the Food Standards Agency which showed that there are 120,000 extra cases of food-related illness during a British summer. Dr Lisa Ackerley, a microbiologist, believes this is not due to undercooked meat so much as poor hand, surface, and utensil hygiene when people are cooking outside.","Fruit and vegetables cause 46% of all food poisoning cases in the U.S.
Leafy greens, like spinach and lettuce, are the most common cause because they tend to be eaten raw so bacteria are not killed .

"Gun sales have increased at a staggering rate in Ferguson, Missouri, ahead of a grand jury's decision on whether or not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, the cop who shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown. Steve King, the owner of Metro Shooting Supplies in nearby Bridgeton, says he has sold 250 firearms this week. That is a 700% increase over the 30 to 40 guns the store typically sells in a week. Scroll down for video . Big numbers: Steve King (above), owner of Metro Shooting Supplies in Bridgeton, Missouri, says gun sales at his store have increased 700%, selling 250 firearms just this week . Sign him up: Steve King fills out paperwork while selling a handgun to Dave Benne at Metro Shooting Supplies. Mr Benne, a resident of Florissant, near Ferguson, said the Grand Jury prompted his purchase . Will he or won't he: King says gun sales are increasing 'because of Ferguson,' and as the community waits to see if Officer Darren Wilson (above) will be indicted by a grand jury for shooting dead Michael Brown . Tragic end: Brown (above) was unarmed when he was shot dead by Wilson on August 9 . 'These people are afraid,' he told The Washington Post. 'One hundred percent of them are buying because of Ferguson.' This as the FBI has warned  law enforcement agencies across the country that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence. The grand jury decision is expected to come this month. Meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in Missouri and activated the National Guard, citing the 'possibility of expanded unrest.' The state of emergency will last 30 days unless extended by another order. Getting ready: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (above) has declared a state of emergency in his state, and activated the National Guard . Making themselves heard: Protesters on both sides of the argument feel very strongly, leading the FBI to warn that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence . No doubt fueling many of these fears of unrest are reports like the one that came out on Tuesday claiming that Ferguson's own cops and their supporters were urging people to go out and get guns on online message boards. 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family,' said one commentor on the forum St Louis Cop Talk. Then there is the report that a militant group is offering a cash reward for anyone who can give them the location of Willson. A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer's  whereabouts. Brown was shot by Wilson on August 9 in Ferguson. Wilson allegedly claimed, according to his grand jury testimony which was leaked to the public, that he saw Brown and his friend Don Johnson walking down the middle of the road that day, and thought Brown matched the description of a young man involved in a recent robbery. When he tried to stop the boys, he sayid Brown punched him through the window. He sayid he drew the weapon but Brown tried to wrestle it from him while continuing to punch him in the face. His side: Wilson says Brown (above in photo) punched him in the face and tried to wrestle his gun away on August 9 before he shot at the teenager . The other side: Other eyewitnesses say that Brown (whose memorial can be seen above) had his hands up and to his side, and urged Wilson not to shoot . During that struggle for his gun, Wilson said he got off two shots, missing the Brown on the first and hitting him in the hand with the second. When Brown tried to escape, Wilson allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and started rushing towards him. This account is in stark contrast with that of several eye witnesses, and Brown's companion Johnson, who have claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.' The office of St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch have said that they will unseal all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following their decision and release it to the public.","Gun sales in one store near Ferguson, Missouri have increased 700% as a grand jury is expected to decide whether or not to indict Darren Wilson .

"Researchers from the University of Manchester have used CT scanning to take high-resolution 3D images of a caterpillar as it morphs into a painted lady butterfly. The scientists were able to track every stage of the caterpillar's development and discovered never-before-seen details, including how early the adult respiratory system appears. The scientists were trialling the use of CT scanners, which are traditionally used by doctors to find tumours and internal injuries in humans, as an alternative to dissection. These images show the pupa of the painted lady butterfly. Taken using CT scanning, the images show anatomical details of the pupa as it grows. The red section is the pupa's digestive organs, also known as the midgut. You can also see the growth of the antennae and the eyes . During the study researchers from Manchester University scanned butterfly pupas, left, using CT scanners. Over the 14-day study the pupas developed and eventually hatched into painted lady butterflies, right . There are four stages of a butterfly's development; the egg, larva, pupa and butterfly. Butterfly eggs are usually tiny and laid on the underside of host plants. Eggs may also be left in areas around the host plant. If eggs are laid early enough in a season they will become butterflies within about a week. If they are laid later in the season the eggs may have to wait until the following season to complete metamorphosis. The next stage is the caterpillar. Caterpillar's can be hairy and their appearance varies between species. Throughout the larval stage a caterpillar has to shed its skin several times in order to grow. The time between these sheddings is called an 'instar', there are usually five 'instars' and they last between two to four weeks. During the final 'instar' the pupa emerges. It is usually camouflaged against the plant they live on. The pupa stage lasts about two weeks, in which time the butterfly develops and breaks out of its chrysalis. Dissection requires killing different specimens at each stage of development to learn more about the insect. Computed Tomography (CT) is a non-intrusive way of scanning the inside of living beings and was used to get detailed images of tiny insects. The Manchester research team scanned nine Vanessa cardui pupas as they morphed into the painted lady butterflies. The pupas studied were 5mm big. They were hung inside a drinking straw and were slowly spun round. The CT scanner was then able to take 2000 X-rays as the caterpillar grew and broke out of its chrysalis. As the insects grew, the 3D images showed the development of the anatomy of the butterflies, including the tracheal airways, the antennae and the midgut. Researchers say that this new technique could be used to study the development of a wide range of insects. The CT scanners used by the University of Manchester to analyse the insides of the painted lady's 5mm pupa captured high-resolution 3D images. On the left of this image you can see the insides of the pupa, including the red midgut and the blue veins. The image on the right is shows the development of the eyes, wings and antennae . These images show how the dorsal (back), lateral (side) and ventral (abdomen) of the pupa changed from day one to day thirteen of the study by University of Manchester. By day 14 of the study, the pupa was ready to morph into the butterfly. In this CT scan image you can see the eyes at the top, the midgut and main internal organs in the centre, and the wings at the bottom . It could specifically be used to see how pesticides affect the development of bees, as the number of honey bees in particular are falling across many regions. The scientists also said they could use CT scanning to see how genetic manipulation affects the development of the fruit fly. Co-author of the study, geologist Russell Garwood told LiveScience: 'To a first approximation, every living thing is an insect, so they're worth understanding'. He claimed that between 50 and 85% of animals on the planet are insects, but most scientists only study a small selection of these bugs. This leaves room to learn much more about insects and how they develop. 'Insects are the main pollinators for the majority of our crops,' so understanding what causes them to become ill is critically important, Garwood said. The researchers also said they can also see the technique being used in forensics to study flesh-eating maggots that eat decomposing bodies. The study featured in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.","Researchers from Manchester used pioneering methods to capture the high-resolution images .

"A student has produced a series of vivid photographs that reveal what the networks that keep us connected to the web look like. The images, created by Luis Hernan from Newcastle University, show spectres of Wi-Fi sweeping and swirling around in bright beams. They were produced as part of Hernan's Digital Ethereal project, which aims to bring the invisible world around us to life. Newcastle University student Luis Hernan produced these photographs of the invisible wireless networks as part of his studies. Hernan, who is studying for a PhD in Architecture and Interactive Design, used self-designed equipment to create the images . Student Luis Hernan created the photographs using a custom-made instrument designed to reveal them. It scans continuously for wireless networks, and transforms the signal strength to colour LEDs. The results are multi-coloured streaks of light which twirl and wrap in spaces, showing how they surround objects and people. Hernan has also created an app which can be downloaded for free, for Android devices called Kirlian, which allows people to see the strength of Wi-Fi around them. Luis, who is studying for a PhD in Architecture and Interaction Design, said he is fascinated with the idea of being able to see the hidden wireless networks which surround us. 'I call the images ""spectres"" because wireless networks remind me of ghosts,' he said. 'They are there but you can't see them with the human eye. 'The fact we are becoming increasingly reliant on something that we can't see intrigues me. I wanted to find a way to show the wireless which is around us and also to show how it changes. 'It is an impossibly fragile and volatile infrastructure that holds our digital technologies together, and shapes the way in which we interact with the digital world. 'Something as seemingly inconsequential as walking around the house will interfere with and reshape their propagation and strength field. 'Close the wrong door, and the bedroom becomes a dead spot for wireless.' Hernan captured the images using a piece of self-designed equipment that converts signal strength into colour images. He also has an app available on Android called Kirlian that enables people to measure the strength of Wi-Fi around them for themselves . The images show how Wi-Fi signals of different strengths surround objects and people. They were created using a programme that changes colour depending on the strength of a signal - blue is strongest, ranging to red at the other end of the scale .

"A woman who poisoned a stranger's baby with bleach in a McDonald's restaurant had previously hurt children on several occasions, it was revealed in court today. Elaine Joyner, 53, put the dangerous substance in the 11-month-old baby boy's drinking bottle while his mum and grandmother were distracted in a branch of McDonalds. But prior to the latest incident in September, the court heard Joyner, from Deptford, south-east London, had thrown a two-year-old girl against a shop window, pushed a one-year-old boy to the ground at a hospital and slapped an 18-month-old child across the face at a bus stop. Today a judge said Joyner was a 'danger' to very young children and posed a 'serious risk' to the public. Elaine Joyner (not pictured), 53, put the dangerous substance in the 11-month-old baby boy's drinking bottle while his mum was distracted in the Eltham branch of McDonalds in London . She was given a hospital order that she be detained under the Mental Health Act at Bethlem Royal Hospital in Beckenham, Kent, and placed under an indefinite restriction order 'to further protect the public'. Joyner, who was declared unfit to plead at a previous hearing last month, had been found by a jury to have committed the bleach poisoning act. Sentencing her today at Woolwich Crown Court, Judge Andrew Lees said: 'It is clear to me from the evidence that I have read and in the hearing that took place that what you did was an inherently dangerous act which could have caused danger, serious danger, to the life of the baby. 'Mercifully he has a made a full recovery. 'It is clear to me that you have a problem, probably in the form of mental illness and probably in relation to developmental behaviour. 'This is a worrying escalation of dangerous behaviour towards very young children. I am satisfied that you suffer from a mental disorder and in the circumstances that a hospital order is made. 'There is no certainty as to whether there is a real prospect of alleviating the serious risk to the public of serious harm, especially to young children.' Joyner, of Vaughan Williams Close in Deptford (pictured), has a host of mental conditions, according to a mental health expert heard in court . In relation to the incident at McDonald's in Eltham, south-east London, last September, prosecutor Peter Clark said: 'Elaine Joyner gave to a complete stranger's baby a feeding bottle that contained a poisonous or noxious substance, a fluid that contained bleach, or something very similar. 'The baby, who was 11 and a half months old, took some of that fluid in his mouth and was immediately rendered ill by it. 'He retched and vomited over himself and turned very pale.' The baby, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, made a good recovery with no long-term ill effects. The child's grandmother said she was looking after the baby in McDonald's while his mother was at the counter and she suddenly saw him retching and dribbling. She said: 'I reached for a bottle that was in his pram. As I looked into it I noticed it was orange in colour with white milk particles in it. It was extremely frothy on the top. Sentencing her today at Woolwich Crown Court (picured), Judge Andrew Lees said: 'What you did was an inherently dangerous act which could have caused danger, serious danger, to the life of the baby' 'I realised that he had drunk something that we had not given him. Three black girls said that a woman had walked past and given him a bottle.' The boy's mother said: 'Some random person had given my baby a bottle, which he had drunk from and was vomiting. As far as I was concerned, my baby had been poisoned.' In court today consultant psychiatrist Kiriakos Xenitidis said Joyner suffered from a developmental disorder, learning disability, a potential autistic condition, as well as a mental disorder which has psychotic and depressive features. She was on anti-psychotic medication and had been receiving care in the community since 1996. The court heard Joyner had a history of harming young children. In 1997 she tried to hit a group of young children in the street where she lived, in March 2011 she pushed a one-year-old boy to the ground at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, in June 2011 she picked up a two-year-old girl and threw her against a shop window and in July 2011 she slapped an 18-month-old child across the face at a bus stop in Sidcup. Grey-haired Joyner appeared in court accompanied by hospital staff. She spoke only to confirm her name.","Elaine Joyner, 53, has a history of attacking children, it was said .

"The typical Western diet, high in fat and sugar, really does lead to an early grave, new research suggests. A study of more than 5,000 civil servants found those who ate the most fried and sweet food, processed and red meat, white bread and butter and cream doubled their risk of premature death or ill health in old age. It adds to evidence that 'Western style food' is the reason why heart disease claims about 94,000 lives a year in the UK - more than any other illness. The findings published in The American Journal of Medicine are based on a survey of British adults and suggest adherence to the diet increases the risk of premature death and disability later in life. People who ate the most fried and sweet food, processed and red meat, white bread, butter and cream doubled their risk of premature death or ill health in old age . Lead researcher, Dr Tasnime Akbaraly, of the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in France, said: 'The impact of diet on specific age-related diseases has been studied extensively, but few investigations have adopted a more holistic approach to determine the association of diet with overall health at older ages.' She examined whether  diet, assessed in midlife, using dietary patterns and adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), is associated with physical ageing 16 years later. The AHEI is an index of diet quality, originally designed to provide dietary guidelines with the specific intention to combat major chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. Dr Akbaraly added: 'We showed that following specific dietary recommendations such as the one provided by the AHEI may be useful in reducing the risk of unhealthy ageing, while avoidance of the ""Western-type foods"" might actually improve the possibility of achieving older ages free of chronic diseases.' The researchers analysed data from . the British Whitehall II cohort study and found following the AHEI can . double the odds of reversing metabolic syndrome, a range of disorders . known to cause heart disease and mortality. The research adds to evidence that Western style food is the reason why heart disease claims about 94,000 lives a year in the UK - more than any other illness .

"They say there is no such thing as a free lunch but apparently that rule does not apply to breakfasts. Thousands of people spent the morning queuing for free McMuffins at McDonald's restaurants across China as the fast food chain gave away more than a million meals. But many bargain hunters did not want to be seen queuing for a free breakfast and shielded their faces from photographers behind newspapers and clothes as they stood in line.

Eager: One man was so keen to get a free breakfast that he went to McDonald's still wearing his pyjamas . Not everyone was ashamed to claim the free food. One man was so desperate not to miss out that he did not even bother getting dressed. He was pictured wearing his pyjamas in the queue at Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong. Restaurants across the country saw huge queues as staff held signs aloft advertising 1,000 free McMuffins. Although the offer proved remarkably popular, many in China accused McDonald's of orchestrating a publicity stunt to distract people from recent media attention on bad practice. The McDonald's promotion came just days after Chinese state television aired its annual expose on corporate malpractice to mark World Consumer Rights Day. But the American food giant said the timing of the offer was purely coincidental. Hidden: Diners shield their faces behind newspapers as they wait to get their free breakfast . We can see you: One man allows his face to be seen while others duck behind their morning papers . Popular: McDonald's gave away more than a million McMuffins across China on Monday . On Friday, one of the most widely watched television shows in China  '3.15' reported on companies that it says violated the trust of consumers. Last year McDonald's apologised after it was criticised by the news programme for its food safety. However, this year the programme focussed on Volkswagen, which was criticised for alleged issues with the cars' direct shift gearbox. The company said it will address the concerns. Apple was also criticised. Programme makers accused the company of not giving the same post-sales service as users in other markets. Consumer analysts say criticism on the show can cause significant harm to a brand. James Roy, senior analyst at China Market Research Group, said: 'The minute there are questions about your practices that appear in any way credible, that can be devastating to consumer trust and extremely difficult to get back.'

"A champagne cork-like device that nurtures fledgling embryos inside a woman’s body could halve the cost of IVF, doctors believe. This would give many more women the chances of fulfilling their dream of motherhood. The clear plastic mini-incubator would also make IVF quicker, easier and more natural, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference in Honolulu heard. In a pilot study, women treated using the INVOcell device were just as likely to become pregnant as others. Nine babies have been born so far. Scroll down for video . A new champagne cork-like device could halve the cost of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), doctors claim. Pictured is the artificial insemination of a human female egg during the IVF process . Almost half of the 50,000 women who have IVF in Britain each year pay for it themselves. But with clinics charging up to £15,000 a session, some simply cannot afford it. The new technique aims to cut costs by simplifying the process. Researcher Dr Kevin Doody said: ‘The cost of IVF is tremendously prohibitive. ‘We are trying to simplify the whole process – what we like to call effortless IVF.’ In a conventional IVF lab, fledgling embryos are kept in expensive incubators for up to five days before the best ones are put into the woman’s body. This is costly. The incubators cost tens of thousands of pounds each and have to be constantly monitored to make sure they are working properly, are at the right temperature and contain the right mix of gases for the delicate embryos to grow. The INVOcell technique lowers costs by doing away with the incubators and the need for constant monitoring. The early-stage embryos are instead nurtured inside a clear plastic device of roughly the same size and shape as a champagne bottle cork. This is placed inside the woman’s vagina, which is at the right temperature and contains the right mix of carbon dioxide and oxygen for growth. Nine babies have so far been born using the new, cheaper, IVF technique. File image used . After three to five days, it is removed and the best embryos transferred to the woman’s womb as usual. Costs are also cut by giving lower doses of the powerful drugs used to boost egg production ahead of IVF. Lower doses also mean that a woman needs to make fewer visits to the IVF clinic to check the drugs are working properly. So rather than taking time off work for ten trips to her doctor, she only needs three appointments. In a study of 33 infertile women, pregnancy rates were the same among those who used INVOcell as those whose embryos were nurtured in incubators. Dr Doody, of the Center for Assisted Reproduction in Bedford, Texas, said: ‘We are amazed that we could grow beautiful, top-quality embryos without the complexity of an incubator.’ His wife, Dr Kathleen Doody, said: ‘We definitely had feedback from patients that it seemed more natural to them.’ It is hoped that by simplifying the process, it will be possible to provide IVF from mobile units, making it more accessible for those who don’t live in big towns and cities. Dr Doody, who has shares in the device’s manufacturer, Massachusetts-based INVO Bioscience, said that while it won’t be suitable for all women, it could help up to two-thirds of patients. The device may also make IVF more acceptable to the Catholic Church, which disapproves of IVF because fertilisation takes place outside the body and in a dish. With INVOcell, fertilisation takes place once the device is inside the woman’s body. INVO Bioscience hopes to have the device on sale in the US by the end of this year. It is seeking a partner for a European launch. British doctors raised safety concerns, including the potential for infection. Professor Simon Fishel, managing director of the CARE Fertility group of clinics, cautioned that it will be impossible to check the embryos for defects when they are hidden away in the device. He added that it will ‘offer options for some’. Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create fertility clinic in London’s Harley Street, said: ‘I welcome any development with the potential to reduce the cost of IVF. ‘We need to do more research to assess the impact on cost reduction and success of the method.’","Doctors believe the new technique could halve the cost of IVF treatment .

"It is every wannabe astronaut's dream - the chance to pilot a rover across the lunar surface. Now, it could be a reality for thousands thanks to a plan to put a groundbreaing virtual reality rover on the moon. The project would allow anyone to experience the lunar surface by donning an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. Scroll down for video . Daniel Shafrir, engineer and leader of the demo team with Andy, the rover they hope to send to the moon in 2016 . The lunar rover, nicknamed 'Andy,' after Andrew Carnegie, will be sent to the moon in 2016. It is a telepresence robot that can be controlled by an operator's head. Using an Oculus Rift, the researchers put two screens in front of the user's eyes to create a stereo image. They also track the user's head here on earth. By sending those mappings back to Andy's camera head over on the moon, they have it turn to match where the user was looking, giving a real sense the users is 'there'. Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University say their robot already has the backing of Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart, and is vying for a $30m prize from Google offered to a team that can send video back from the moon. 'The vision for the demo was simple: let anyone on Earth experience the moon live through the eyes of a robot,' engineering graduate student, Daniel Shafrir, 22, who is part of the three man team, told MailOnline. 'Put the headset on and you look to your left, you see the vast expanse of the moon. 'You look right and you see home. You're looking to to see what it's really like on the moon.' The scientists from Carnegie Mellon have teamed up with space firm Astrobotic to compete for the Google Lunar XPrize, which requires a team to land a robot on the Moon, move it 500m and send back video to Earth. Astrobotic Technology, which is a spin-off from Carnegie Mellon, has signed a deal with SpaceX - the private space company set up by Elon Musk - to use its Falcon 9 rocket to launch the robot in 2016. 'Imagine the feeling of looking out and seeing rocks and craters billions of years old. 'Right now its almost impossible to go to the moo,' said Schafrir. 'We make it so you can drop an Oculus on, take a look around and feel as if you're really there. 'People have to feel like they are there on the moon with us - there's something tangible about moving your head and knowing that 240,000 miles away our rover is moving its head as well.' The robot is named Andy, after Andrew Carnegie, founder of Carnegie Mellon, and the initial demo was put together in just three weeks. The team hopes the project, and the chance to virtually visit the moon, will reinvigorate public interest in space. 'It's time to go back,' said Shafrir . 'We left our last footprint on the moon on December 14, 1972. 'Unfortunately, that passion, that amazing enthusiasm that gripped the world throughout the entire Apollo program just isn't there anymore.","Robot set to land on the moon in 2016 .

"The poorest people in society have eight fewer teeth by their seventies than the richest, a study has found. While it is already known that there is a strong link between socio-economic status and oral health, the research reveals the full extent of the problem. It shows a shocking discrepancy between the dental conditions enjoyed by the richest 20 per cent of society compared with the poorest. For those aged over 65, the least well-off averaged eight fewer teeth than the richest – a quarter of a full set. The poorest people in society have eight fewer teeth by their seventies than the richest, a study has found . More than 6,000 people aged 21 and over from all income groups were involved in the British study, published today in the Journal of Dental Research. Those with lower incomes, a lower occupational class, higher levels of deprivation and lower educational attainment had the worst oral health. This includes having more tooth decay, gum disease and tooth gaps, as well as having fewer teeth. But despite these social differences, the overall oral health of young British adults is much better than it used to be. The study was a collaboration between Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust, University College London and the National Centre for Social Research. Professor Jimmy Steele, head of the dental school at Newcastle University, said: 'It's probably not a big surprise that poorer people have worse dental health than the richest, but the surprise is just how big the differences can be and how it affects people. For those aged over 65, the least well-off averaged eight fewer teeth than the richest – a quarter of a full set (stock image) 'Eight teeth less on average is a huge amount and will have had a big impact.' Dr Georgios Tsakos, senior lecturer at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL, said education was key. 'In terms of the younger adults, we showed that it is not only being poor that affects their perceptions about their oral health and quality of life, but educational attainment can also make a major difference. 'This has profound implications for policy as intervening in earlier life could have a significant long term effect on oral health,' he said. John Wildman, professor of health economics at Newcastle University Business School, and the Principal Investigator on the ESRC study, said the issue has not been given enough attention. 'Inequalities in oral health have not received the attention that they deserve. Our study is an attempt to redress this balance. Oral health contributes hugely to everyday wellbeing and addressing these inequalities may result in considerable improvements in quality of life for large numbers of individuals,' he said. Professor Richard Watt, head of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL, referred to the policy implications of this research. 'Inequalities in oral health require urgent action by organisations such as Public Health England - in particular more needs to be done to tackle the underlying causes of oral diseases such as sugary diets,' he said. One example is Sydney Alcock, 68, a shoemaker from Washington, Tyne and Wear, who was a keen trombonist in a brass band. He lost all his teeth at a young age due to suffering from gum disease, primarily caused by poor oral hygiene, and has struggled ever since. He has never smoked regularly and says he did not have too much sugar in his diet. 'You can't play the trombone without any teeth', he said. 'I have had false teeth but they don't last, so losing my teeth has made a big impact on my life. It costs a lot of money for false teeth. 'When I was young we didn't have milk or eggs, or much other dairy, we had to eat powdered eggs. I'm sure that has had an impact on how good my teeth were.'","For those over 65, the least well-off averaged eight fewer teeth than richest .

"Whether it is Mozart or Miley, your choice of music could determine whether you will perform well at your job. A new study suggests that listening to music in the office improves the speed and accuracy of tasks such as data entry, proof reading and problem solving. In an office-based experiment, 88 per cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music. Scroll down for video . If you’re doing your tax returns, then classical music such as Mozart (left) is the most effective as it improves accuracy. Listening to  Justin Bieber (right) could improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster when listening to pop songs . The study also found that 81 per cent completed their fastest work when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to. For instance, if you’re doing your tax returns, then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills. Listening to Jessie J or Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proof-reading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spell-checking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all.

Dance also music had a positive effect on spell-checking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all . Listening to music while battling through a work assignment or doing mind-numbing admin can be tempting. And while some people claim that music passes the time, others find it distracting. Now an app called Focus@Will claims to boost your attention span by up to 400 per cent, using ‘neuroscience-based music channels’. The music is designed to help people focus and ‘effortlessly zone out distractions’ as well as retain information while studying. Half of people listen to music while working, but it could be the ‘wrong’ music, according to the company behind the app, because songs with lyrics are designed to connect with people emotionally – distracting them. The app has ‘attention amplifying’ music channels, which the San Francisco-based start-up says are scientifically designed ‘to engage with the brain’s limbic system. ‘This soothes the easily distracted fight or flight mechanism, increasing attention span and general focus,’ it says. The research, undertaken by Brighton-based Mindlab International, suggests that silent offices may be the least productive. ‘The MusicWorks experiment revealed a positive correlation between music and productivity – overall it showed that when listening to music, nine out of 10 people performed better,’ said Dr David Lewis, chairman of Mindlab International. ‘Music is an incredibly powerful management tool in increasing the efficiency of a workforce. 'It can exert a highly beneficial influence over employee morale and motivation, helping enhance output and even boosting a company’s bottom line.’ The research also showed that when people sat in silence, they made the most mistakes while solving equations and spell-checking. Ambient music worked best for accurate data entry tasks, with participants scoring a high pass rate of 92 per cent. ‘The increase in levels of productivity when music is playing is striking,’ said Paul Clements, Director of Public Performance Sales, PRS for Music. ‘This project provides a refreshing reminder of the multiple benefits to be gained from listening to music at work.’","88 per cent of employees improved accuracy when listening to music .

"In the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung has announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. Scroll down for video . In the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung has announced plans to curb the number of phones  it makes each year by between a quarter and a third. Instead of saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better . The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Last month, for the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits took a hit. The smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year. Despite a drop in profits, Samsung has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter. But, it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline. Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG all posted more than 15 per cent growth in their smartphone shipments, according to market research firm IDC. Samsung's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter, and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year. Samsung's rise to the world's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with Google's Android operating system. But other Android handset makers are matching Samsung in terms of performance, features and design. Shares of Samsung Electronics did rise 4 per cent, however, in Seoul. Although the earnings were weak, they were better than some forecasts. Plus Samsung said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to Christmas. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September. These figures were in line with what Samsung predicted earlier in October, and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model. The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models. But the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business. In response to the dramatic drop, Samsung also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. The earnings were below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider. The decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED. 'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured Samsung Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone' In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple. Last month, Samsung also received upbeat initial responses to its Galaxy Note Edge smartphone (shown), a smartphone with a curved side screen that can display weather, news, apps and other information. But the supply volume for the Edge smartphone will be limited, not giving a big boost to its earnings, analysts said .

With growth momentum in smartphones sagging, Samsung is moving to step up its presence in the semiconductor business.

"Gordon McQueeney, 77, bled to death in March after hemorrhaging during a biopsy operation . A pensioner bled to death after medics failed to warn him to stop taking his blood-thinning medication before surgery. Retired lorry driver Gordon McQueeney died in March after he haemorrhaged during a biopsy procedure. Doctors were unable to stem the bleeding, and the 77-year-old great-great grandfather died later that day. The father-of-seven was taking anti-platelet medication to thin his blood, which exacerbated the bleeding. His widow Dorothy said she specifically asked nurses whether her husband should take his tablets as normal on the morning of his operation, and was told he could. She has now criticised the NHS's offer of £14,000 compensation, branding it 'outrageous and disgusting'. Hospital bosses have apologised for 'inadequacies' in Mr McQueeney's care. Mrs McQueeney said doctors called her back to the hospital at 11am, three hours after he was admitted, and was told her husband was dying. She said 12 members of their family watched him 'slip away' at his bedside at 5.50pm. The hospital wrote to Mrs McQueeney last week to apologise, and offer compensation. The letter read: 'Your husband's anti-platelet medication was unknown to the clinicians prior to his referral for a liver biopsy and at the time of the procedure itself. 'The Trust acknowledges that this was not appropriate. 'The Trust would like to convey its most sincere apologies for the shortcomings identified during the inquest and within the Trust's own investigation. 'Please do be assured that the outcome of this investigation has led to changed practices within the Trust concerning knowledge of patients' medication prior to elective procedures such as biopsies. 'The Trust is confident that this will address the shortcomings identified and prevent similar occurrences in the future.' Mr McQueeney's bleed was exacerbated by anti-platelet medication he was taking to thin his blood, making it difficult for his blood to clot. His widow Dorothy McQueeney said she rang the hospital the morning of his operation to ask if he should still take his tablets, and was told he could . The father-of-seven was having a biopsy after doctors identified lesions on his liver and lung, which they feared could be cancerous . The 76-year-old widow, said: 'I think their offer is outrageous and disgusting and an insult to my family. 'His life is priceless to us. This is supposed to be a routine, everyday thing. His health was not the best but he was nowhere near dying. 'He walked in that morning and we left him with a cup of tea and newspaper, chatting to the nurses. 'We didn't think we would never speak to him again.' She said she recalls calling the hospital before taking her husband in, to check on his medication. The Royal Bolton Hospital has apologised to Mrs McQueeney and offered her £14,000 compensation, which she branded 'outrageous and disgusting' 'I rang up the hospital and I said ""is there a bed for my husband?"" 'She said yes. I said: ""Should I give him his medication?"" She said yes again.' Doctors had identified lesions on Mr McQueeney's liver and lung, which they feared were cancerous. They referred the 77-year-old for a biopsy. All biopsies carry a risk of bleeding but the anti-platelet medication exacerbated the bleed, in Mr McQueeney's case. Coroner Alan Walsh ruled at an inquest in September: 'Gordon McQueeney died as a consequence of intra-abdominal haemorrhage as a recognised complication of a liver biopsy. 'This was exacerbated by a complication of anti-platelet medication on a background of naturally occurring disease.' Mr McQueeney was father to Wendy, Belinda, Tracey, Jeanette, Paul, Geoffrey and Diane, and had 26 grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren and one great-great grandchild. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'The circumstances surrounding Mr McQueeney's death were tragic and it is understandable that his family are very upset. 'They have our deep sympathy and apologies for their loss. 'We held a detailed investigation to examine the root causes and what lessons there were to be learned. 'The report was shared with Mrs McQueeney and HM Area Coroner. 'At the inquest into Mr McQueeney's death which was held on September 25 we shared with the coroner the actions we were taking in order to minimise the possibility of such an occurrence happening in future. 'We also apologised in court to the family. 'With regards to any financial compensation, claims are not dealt with by this trust but by the NHS Litigation Authority which negotiates the amount to be offered.'","Gordon McQueeney bled to death following a biopsy operation in March .

"The thing that struck me most, when my daughter started secondary school in September, is how different all the girls in her year look. All shapes and sizes, from teeny-tiny waifs who look like they’re barely out of reception, to big strapping ones, taller than me, and with all the accessories to match. Or, as my daughter herself put it with great excitement: “Mummy, some of them have got even bigger boobs than you!” Tall, short, stocky, skinny, sporty or speccie, they are all special in their own way. All starting out on life’s long journey; no longer children but not yet women. And still, for the most part, mercifully unaware that their appearance matters much. Sure, they might admire someone’s pretty hair, or blue eyes, or cheek dimples; but that nasty little worm of self-doubt that afflicts so many older girls and women has yet to burrow its way into their hearts and minds.

The latest example of this comes from American lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, currently intent on a British invasion. Ten super-skinny models in push-up bra and pants pout, simper, giggle and hair-twirl their way across a billboard by way of promoting VS’s new so-called ‘Perfect Body’ range. And there’s no mistaking what they mean by ‘perfect’: perky of bosom, tiny of tummy and negligible of behind — with a thigh gap wide enough to park a bicycle in. As if that weren’t enough, the girls appear to have been stretched even thinner with a little help from that digital miracle device Mr Photoshop. One of them, a dark-haired girl in a purple set, appears to have the proportions of a Barbie doll, which, as we all know, is anatomically unfeasible. All have visible ribcages and wrists like sparrows. Of course, no one expects a brand like Victoria’s Secret to advertise its wares on ordinary women. But there is a line between aspiration and thinspiration, and this campaign clearly oversteps the mark. As for their use of the word ‘perfect’, it’s not only offensive to the 99.9 per cent of the female population who don’t share the models’ ‘perfect’ proportions, it’s also deeply irresponsible, if not downright cruel. Especially given the brand’s target market. Which is obviously not me. Or indeed anyone over the age of 22 or bigger than a size 6. Only the other day I saw a gaggle of 14 and 15-year-olds scuttling out of Victoria’s Secret in London’s Westfield shopping centre, laden down with garish bags presumably containing various items of microscopic and sexually precocious underwear. When I was their age, my mum was still buying my pants, and rightly so. Hurrah, then, for the three British students who are demanding that the company — which is the largest American lingerie retailer — apologise, and alter the wording on the advertisement. Like other overtly body-conscious brands of this ilk — from American Apparel, with its adverts awash in demeaning pornographic imagery, to Jack Wills, which imagines all girls as salty-haired surf sirens — they’re aiming squarely at all our daughters. Young women who are picked to model for Victoria’s Secret, including Alessandra Ambrosio (left) and Adriana Lima (right) - who claims she only consumes liquid protein nine days before a show - are nicknamed 'Angels' That’s right: those same happy girls who start off being all shapes and sizes, unaware that there is any aspect of themselves that is wrong, and who end up hating their bodies half to death. Who look upon the likes of Martha Hunt and Adriana Lima and all the other so-called ‘Angels’ (young women picked to model for Victoria’s Secret are nicknamed Angels) and find themselves so lacking in the fundamental virtue of extreme thinness that they lose all sense of reason and proportion. This advert — and all the others like it — is not just harmless titillation. It’s a deliberate projection of an ideal of female beauty so narrow as to be virtually unattainable. It is also deeply damaging. And that is exactly how Victoria’s Secret and their buddies like it. Because what these companies are really peddling is not underwear; it’s a lifetime of body insecurities. Why? Simple. That’s how they maintain demand and ensure that consumers keep coming back for more. Treat them mean, keep them keen. First create the problem . . . then provide the solution. Because, let’s face it, if all the women in the world suddenly woke up tomorrow miraculously happy and comfortable in their own skins, what need would there be for push-up bras? Female self-loathing is the commercial cornerstone of the fashion and beauty industry. Every woman who looks in a mirror and hates what she sees is a potential customer, lured by the prospect of finding the ‘perfect’ answer to her imperfect appearance. When a woman declares she has nothing to wear, what she really means is: ‘I hate myself for not being thin/pretty/young/busty enough’. Successful commerce is all about profit margins. So if you’re Victoria’s Secret and you make cheap, rather nasty mass-produced underwear that normal women wouldn’t dream of buying because it fits so badly and makes you itch, it’s in your clear financial interest to detract as much attention away from the actual product as you can, and to sell an image instead. You put on super-glamorous fashion shows, hype up your models, hire pop stars, build a buzz. You get every hot-blooded male lusting after your ‘Angels’ and every impressionable young girl wanting to be one. You ruthlessly exploit every weakness of the naive young female mind — and then you sit back and watch the cash roll in. Of course, when you’re old and wise and a bit grumpy, like me, you can see through these shameless tactics and make your buying choices accordingly. But when you’re young and naive and inexperienced, and all you want to do is please others and be accepted by your peer group, it’s so much harder to be rational. Shoppers are pictured at the Victoria Secret store on New Bond Street, central London, which attracts teenagers in droves . When you see ten girls in bikinis like this, you don’t think: ‘My goodness, they look like they could use a bowl of beef soup and a buttered bun.’ You think: ‘If only I looked like that, all my problems would be solved.’ No matter that to get this way, these models, the Martha Hunts and Erin Heathertons of this world, have to spend weeks on end eating nothing but shredded kale and protein shakes. Or that they have to give interviews in which they gush about the joys of juicing and ‘drinking lots of warm water in the mornings’. ‘Angel’ Adriana Lima, for example, claims she consumes only liquid protein for nine days before a show — and then stops drinking completely 12 hours beforehand, because, as she enthusiastically explains ‘sometimes you can lose up to 8lb just from that!’ Great! Young girls don’t read things like that and think: ‘She’s clearly mad.’ They think: “Oh, excellent. If I do that, I too can be a supermodel.” Except they almost certainly can’t. No one can lead a halfway normal existence existing on nothing but warm water and protein shakes. Certainly not teenage girls, whose bodies are still developing and need a sensible, nutritious diet. And even if they did, there’s no guarantee they’d end up a size 000, in their underwear on a billboard. I know, because when I was young I tried very, very hard to be super-thin. But even at my thinnest, I could never make the grade because I’m simply not built like that. I have huge hands, even bigger feet — and a pair of shoulders like an ox. The fact is these girls — these so-called ‘perfect’ girls that Victoria’s Secret are encouraging women to emulate — are not normal. It’s not just that they lead obsessive, narcissistic lifestyles, in which the only thing that matters is the way their bottom looks in a thong. It’s also that they belong to a species all of their own. The difference between these girls and your average female is the difference between a solid little Welsh pit-pony and the winner of the Grand National; or a sausage dog and a whippet. Same species, worlds apart. Nothing wrong with either, of course. What’s wrong is the relentless and totally demoralising message that one is ‘perfect’ — and the other not.","Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret has launched billboard advert featuring ten super-skinny models in push-up bras .

"Imagine watching a film with a friend on the same screen where you watch it through the eyes of the villain, but they have the hero’s perspective. That’s just one of the many uses for Invisivision glasses, a product developed by PipeDream Interactive based in Ontario, Canada. The ‘smart glasses’ have an additional layer of lenses that can flip up and down, giving viewers two different experiences - or even entirely different films - when staring at a cinema screen. Scroll down for video . Canadian company Pipedream Interactive have unveiled their Invisivision glasses (pictured), which they say can provide viewers with different movie-watching experiences. When the lenses are flipped up and down they switch between two image streams, something that is commonly seen in 3D movies . The company are currently seeking funding for their design on Kickstarter. The patent-pending eyewear uses filters to separate streams of 3D images. Dual perspectives – Watch a scene through one of two views, such as through the eyes of the hero or the villain. Reveal and conceal – Flipping the glasses could show and hide subtitles in multiple languages. Adult content – The company says the glasses could let a parent and child, for example, switch between a PG and 18-rated version of a scene. Hidden scenes – Additional content could be hidden within a scene using the glasses. Video games – The glasses could be used to hide objects and easter eggs in video game worlds. Changed vision – Invisivision glasses could also be used to enhance gameplay, such as giving the player night-vision. By interspersing content within rapidly alternating frames of a movie, the technology could allow for some novel applications. These range from giving dual perspectives during a movie to providing subtitles for only those that want to see them. ‘When viewing content with Invisivision, the user simply moves the additional lenses in front to reveal hidden content,’ the company writes on Kickstarter. ‘Moving the additional lenses back restores the original content.’ The glasses make use of the fact that 3D movies work when two image streams are displayed simultaneously, but they are slightly offset. ‘In 3D entertainment, our brains then combine the two nearly-identical images, and thus depth is created,’ says the company. Using the two image streams separately, the illusion of two completely different scenes is created. In addition, having one side of the glasses up and the other down will produce a standard 3D effect. Later this year the company is planning to show off the technology in a movie they created with actors JP Manoux and Aaron Ashmore. And backers of the project on Kickstarter will be given early access to the premiere. One of the touted uses for the technology is the ability to watch hidden scenes from a movie by flipping up or down the lenses. Here, for example, only viewers with the glasses flipped in one direction will see the 'monster' sneaking up on actor JP Manoux .","Canadian firm PipeDream Interactive has unveiled their Invisivision glasses .

"They chomped, they chowed, they chewed. Wings disappeared and, in two competitors' cases, reappeared, but it was 5-foot-7, 125-pound mother-of-four pulled off 'the greatest performance in Wing Bowl history,' Molly Schuyler devoured 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes at a competitive eating contest in Philadelphia. Ms. Schuyler flew past the previous long-standing record of 337 wings as she finished the last round of the 22nd annual WIP 94 Sportsradio Wing Bowl. Scroll down for video... Ms Schuyler captured a $22,000 payday by devouring 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes at a competitive eating contest called Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia last Friday . Winging it: The mother of four from Bellevue, Nebraska cleaned up at the WIP's Wing Bowl 22 . She's no chicken: Molly Schuyler, who stands 5'7"" tall and weighs just 125 pounds, ate 363 chicken wings to take the crown - and set a new Wing Bowl record . At 8 a.m. the 120-pound woman virtually swallowed the wings for her breakfast as second-place finisher Patrick Bertoletti from Chicago could only chomp home in second place with a total of 356 wing. Ms. Schuyler, whose performance host Angelo Cataldi dubbed 'the greatest ever', won $22,000. Asked by Mr Cataldi what she would do with the money, Schuyler said, 'I have car payments and kids, so it's all good.' 'Who eats 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes?' Mr Cataldi asked, still mystified by the performance. Victory! Molly Schuyler is the champion chicken eater! Not bad for a morning's work: Molly Schuyler is handed the winning check for $22,000 before heading to Iowa for her next eating competition . Ms. Schuyler breezed to the first-round lead, eating 186 wings in 14 minutes as the top 10 advanced. One of those eliminated in the first round was Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, who managed only 65 wings. The second round lasted 14 minutes, and the final round was a two-minute sprint to the finish. 'To tell you the truth, I didn’t even think I was going to win this, I was looking and hoping to finish in the top three,' said Ms. Schuyler to CBS 3. 'We come from Omaha and we don't really have the kind of wings you guys have out here,' she said smiling. 'I had to 'wing' it.' The eating and all the surrounding shenanigans took place in front of a sold out crowd. This weekend she if off to Des Moines, Iowa Friday afternoon to compete in the IHOP Pancake Bowl on Saturday, and then attempt to defend her title later Saturday afternoon at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival. Where did it all go? Molly has a petite frame. At 5ft 7in and 125 pounds, her eating abilities are truly incredible . Make mine a large! Molly's been competitive eating for less than a year and says she eats to support her 4 kids . 'I think I could eat some more,'kid Ms. Schuyler, the Wing Bowl 22 crown skewed on her head. 'This was freaking crazy. I kept eating and I kept saying I didn’t want to know how many wings I ate until the end. I just wanted to focus on what I was doing. But I don’t think I want to eat another chicken wing for a while. Hopefully I’ll be back next year.' Each year, Wing Bowl brings out some of the region’s best competitive eaters, who themselves have to prove their worth to qualify for the event by performing a miraculous feat of eating. To qualify for the Wing Bowl, Schuyler ate nine pounds of cottage cheese in 114 seconds. She also holds a world record for eating a 72-ounce steak in less than three minutes. The previous record of 337 was established in 2012 by one of the world's best-known competitive eaters Takeru Kobayashi. The only other woman to ever win the contest was Sonya “The Black Widow” Thomas, who won Wing Bowl 12 with 167 wings in 2004. Wing Bowl creator Al Morganti had predicted Ms Schuyler odds-on favorite for the event at 2-1. Asked whether she would return next year to defend her championship, presumably still feeling rather full, Ms. Schuyler said, 'maybe!' Large appetite: Previously, Molly Schuyler wolfed down a 72oz steak in 2 minutes 44 . seconds, earning her a place in the world record books - and a spot of . indigestion, no doubt . Room for more: Despite the colossal size of her dish, Mrs Schuyler's appetite continues to roll, and she is seen reaching for handfuls of fries . Non stop: Earlier this year, Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by . demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large . soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland . Talking about her speed-eating abilities, she added: ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon. ‘I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.' Her husband, Sean, also says she is 'amazing when it comes to eating.' In 2013 Mrs Schuyler competed in more than 20 different food eating contests across the country. Slender: Mrs Schuyler's slim physique, and the fact that she has birthed four kids, may come as a surprise to those who've watched her eat . New-found skill: Mrs Schuyler, a full-time server, only started eating competitively last August . Victories included eating 9lbs of fried mushrooms in 8 minutes and eight beef patties in 1 minute and 46 seconds. She also beat ‘Man vs Food’s Adam Richman at Jethro's BBQ Diner challenge in Iowa by polishing off a 5lb meat sandwich made of pork, chicken, bacon, brisket and deep fried cheese in less than eight minutes. All Pro Eating, the world's only independent competitive eating organization, lists her as the world's number one female.","Molly Schuyler, 34, of Nebraska, tackled pile of wings at a competitive eating competitions in Philadelphia .

"As lucky bounces go it’s right up there with the Dambusters – and only narrowly missed ending in catastrophe. But this time it wasn’t the RAF dropping bouncing bombs on Germany, but the modern Luftwaffe inadvertently dropping one of its own transporter planes onto a busy main road, from where it bounced onto the runway, 30 yards away, as up to a thousand spectators watched in horror. It was the plane’s last fight and one its pilot, Captain Jasmin Kirsch, is unlikely to forget – but for all the wrong reasons. Close encounter: The Transall C-160 military plane approaches the Ballenstedt airfield in Saxony-Anhalt, central Germany, but lands on a side road before the runway . Families, children and plane-spotters . had come to celebrate what was billed by the . authorities as ‘the final flight’ for the 31-tonne Transall C-160 . military transporter plane. The drama unfolded as the colossal plane - which was being de-commissioned by Germany’s armed . forces - came in too low and landed about 100feet short of the . runway on a main road built along a raised embankment. The consequence of this was chillingly spectacular but potentially catastrophic. As spectators lined the runway capturing head-on in film and video the moments of . the plane’s final approach . and landing into Ballenstedt airport in . Saxony-Anhalt in eastern Germany, its nose appeared to dip quite low. Still filming: The spotters stand their ground as the plane approaches even though the pilot had reported that he could not see the start of the runway from his cockpit . But horror struck as six of . the plane’s landing wheels thudded into the raised road embankment . causing the plane to bounce back into the air, with its wings waggling . momentarily to the right. Some of the onlookers closest to the . road were forced to duck and . dive for cover just feet (and possibly inches) away from its 131-feet . wings and propeller blades. The Transall C-160 military . transporter plane flew another 30 yards to the start of the runway where . 100 yards further on its pilot brought it to a safe stop. Some witnesses said the fans were . ‘suicidally close’ to the runway and questioned how the police and . authorities could have allowed that. Photographs and video footage of the . unfolding drama show spectators throwing . themselves to the ground to avoid the roaring 15-feet . four-bladed propellers. Film footage posted online . captures the comments of those witnessing the unplanned bounce, with one . man amid the oohs, aaahs, and gasps summing up his surprise with a German swear word. Inches from death: The two enthusiasts by the fence post come desperately close to going under the wheels as their comrades continue to capture the incident . The pilot Captain Kirsch is reported . in Germany’s ‘Bild’ newspaper saying: ’From the cockpit we couldn’t make . out the start of the runway.’ Pensioner Herbert Dzienkowski, 62, who witnessed the incident said: ’After circling the airfield twice the aircraft came down.’ He described how the 44 year-old aircraft ‘ripped up’ the tarmac on the main road as it hopped with a bounce back into the air. Even the police responsible for . cordoning off the landing area appeared surprised as there only a few ineffective metal barriers and cones . along the side of the road. Transall C-160 military transporter planeCrew: 3 (two pilots and a flight engineer)Max load: 93 troops, 88 paratroops or 62 stretchersMax weight: 16 tonnesLength: 106ft . Wingspan: 131ft . Height: 38ft . Built: 1965to 1985 . Built by: ‘Transporter Allianz’ – consortium of German and French plane makers . Number built: 214 . Engines: 2 Rolls-Royce Tyne turbo-prop . Propellers: 2 . Top speed: 368mph . Max altitude: 27,000ft . Range: 5,500 miles . The military plane, which has clocked . up 12,000 flying hours in its lifetime  is to spend its retirement as . an exhibit at the Aviation Museum in  Wernigerode. The museum's spokesman, . Madeleine Aulich, said:’Thankfully no-one got hurt.’ But witnesses talking about the . incident on the internet are concerned – particularly with cars parked . up close along the road which bi-sects the airfield about 100feet short . of the start of the runway. One said:’There was nearly a catastrophe with fatalities.’ Another noted that it was ‘suicidal’ for spectators to go – or even be allowed to go – so close pointing . out: ’That’s a 5.5metre propeller blade in front of the wing.’ A third said: ’Be glad the . undercarriage tyres held up on impact and there were no bits and pieces . flying around people’s ears.’ One group in a specially cordoned off . area for photographers seemed most at risk. A piece of . close-up footage shows the plane almost on top of the cameraman, who . pans to see the silhouette of the flight crew in the cabin just as the aeroplane skims the people in front of him – including the . back of one person. One observer called Harry Klein noted: ’Whoever on the ground allowed spectators to go so close should be heavily fined.’ The Luftwaffe said they were investigating the issue of the raised road. Wing commander Kai Gudenoge, . spokesman for the Luftwaffe in Köln-Wahn, said: ‘The problem of the . raised road does exist. Whether it is the only cause, I can’t say. We . still feel the shock in our bones.’ He said the problem was not the . plane but the insufficient barriers: ‘We had from the airport . authorities the confirmation that streets should have been clear’. The Transall C-160 which has a crew . of three and can carry up to 93 troops was built by a French-German . consortium Transporter Allianz and has been in service around the  world . – including Afghanistan - since 1965 with the German, French and South . African military with some 214 built until 1985.

"A stowaway fell thousands of feet from a plane on to a quiet suburban street after apparently hiding in the landing gear. The body of the victim, in his thirties and from North Africa, was discovered in an affluent London neighbourhood under the Heathrow flight path. Aviation experts say he was probably dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off or because of the extreme cold at high altitude. Detectives initially believed Mr Matada was from Angola as he had the country's currency on him when he was found in the street in Mortlake, pictured . Probe: Forensics were on the scene in the affluent London suburb after the extraordinary incident . It is thought the man’s body dropped from the aircraft undercarriage as the plane came in to land. Residents on the tree-lined road in Mortlake, on the south bank of the Thames less than ten miles from the airport, yesterday spoke of their shock on finding the body after hearing a loud bang. Billy Watson, 26, a security guard who lives opposite where the man fell, said he saw the body ‘all twisted up’. He said: ‘It is unbelievable. The first thing I thought when I saw the body was that it must have fallen from quite a height. Location: Home: The only evidence left on the scene in Mortlake, south west London, was dark smears on the pavement where the blood was cleared up . ‘You could tell by the way his body was mangled. There was a big pool of blood coming from his head.’ Last night, others said they were . amazed blood could still be seen on the family street.  Catherine . Lambert, a mother of two, said it was ‘disgusting’ that the scene had . not been cleared up. ‘It’s shocking you can still see . splatters of blood,’ she said, adding that the body was left uncovered . by police for ‘a good few hours’ after it was found. She said: ‘We just wonder what made . him get in that plane and want so badly to escape.’ Another resident, . who did not wish to be named, said: ‘No one saw him fall because it was . early on a Sunday morning. ‘Whatever he was trying to escape from must have been horrendous to make him do that.’ Richard Taylor, of the Civil Aviation . Authority, said a stowaway in an aircraft undercarriage was unlikely to . have survive as he would either be crushed by the wheels after take-off . or freeze in temperatures as low as minus 40C (minus 40F). He said: ‘The chances of survival for a stowaway are very slim, particularly in the recess of the landing gear. ‘I don’t know of anyone who has survived being stowed away on a long-haul flight. ‘When the landing gear comes down at . the other end, a few miles from the runway and about 2,000ft in the air, . if there is a person who had died they would fall out.’ Police said they were investigating whether the body was that of a stowaway.’ The discovery comes just over a . fortnight after the body of a stowaway was found in the landing gear . recess of a BA plane arriving at Heathrow from Cape Town.

"Four Jaguar car adverts have been banned for glorifying high speeds and ‘encouraging dangerous driving’. Advertising watchdogs were unhappy that Jaguar’s ‘irresponsible’ focus on the speed and acceleration of their cars was emphasised by the sound of engines being revved and high tempo music. But the rap could prove a blessing in disguise for the British sports and luxury car firm whose latest slogan is: ‘It’s good to be bad.’ Scroll down for video . 'Encouraging dangerous driving': Four Jaguar car adverts have been banned for glorifying high speeds . Ruling: Advertising watchdogs were unhappy that Jaguar's 'irresponsible' focus on the speed and acceleration of their cars was emphasised by the sound of engines being revved and high tempo music . The four banned video adverts on Jaguar's website showed a car driving at speed through a tunnel in Switzerland and crossing over the single white lines in the middle of a road, before driving across a mountain road at night. Another scene showed a car driving on open land at high speed, while voice-overs said: ‘The adaptive dynamics technology reacts 20 times faster than the human eye. ‘It delivers a smooth drive by continuously analysing speed, steering and body movement of the car 500 times a second, giving every journey an instinctive, stable and agile ride.’ The adverts ended with the Jaguar logo alongside text reading: ‘Jaguar. How alive are you?’ to the sound of an engine revving. One viewer complained that the ads were irresponsible because they ‘glorified speed and encouraged dangerous driving’. Advertising watchdogs agreed and ordered the videos be withdrawn. But the ban could ironically be a boost to the car firm which  has built a whole campaign around the strapline ‘It’s good to be bad’ and hired  big-screen A-listers Sir Ben Kingsley, Mark Strong and Tom Hiddlestone to act as its ‘villainous’ ambassadors. Blessing in disguise? the ban could ironically be a boost to the car firm which has built a whole campaign around the strapline 'It's good to be bad' Velocity: A car was shown driving at speed through a tunnel in Switzerland and crossing over the single white lines in the middle of a road, before driving across a mountain road at night . In one Bond-like movie advert for the Jaguar F-Type - which has not been banned - Sir Ben intones: ’Have you ever  wondered why in movies, all the villains are played by  Brits?’ Jaguar also has David Beckham as its brand ambassador in China. 'Because we considered that speed was the main message of the ads and the ads portrayed the cars being driven in a dangerous manner, we concluded the ads were irresponsible and condoned dangerous driving' Advertising Standards Authority . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the overall impression of the four banned adverts  was a focus on the speed and acceleration of the cars, emphasised by the sound of engines being revved, high tempo music and the use of blurred lines. It noted that the cars were driving on what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be ‘irresponsible and illegal’ on a public road in the UK. The ASA said: ‘We considered that the cars were being handled in a dangerous manner that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly. ‘The ASA acknowledged that Jaguar had amended the ads to include an on-screen caption, which stated that the ads were filmed on closed roads with a professional driver and advising that viewers always obeyed local speed limits. Criticism: The Advertising Standards Authority noted that the cars were driving on what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be 'irresponsible and illegal' on a public road in the UK . Luxury car manufacturer: The adverts ended with the Jaguar logo alongside text reading: 'Jaguar. How alive are you?' to the sound of an engine revving . ‘However, we did not consider that this amendment went far enough to resolve the points of complaint. ‘Because we considered that speed was the main message of the ads and the ads portrayed the cars being driven in a dangerous manner, we concluded the ads were irresponsible and condoned dangerous driving.’ It ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form and told Jaguar ‘not to portray speed as the focus of an ad in future... and not to portray driving behaviour that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly in future’. Jaguar said the footage of the cars on the open highway was filmed in Switzerland on closed sections of road on the Susten Pass and the Grimsel Pass, but a caption making this clear was mistakenly omitted. The company said the ads' emphasis was the technical features and abilities of the cars, and the shots of the cars crossing lanes on the closed road were specifically to highlight the lightweight construction for cornering stability and safety. It said the ads ‘at no time demonstrated any dangerous driving’ and there was no indication that speed limits were broken. Jaguar has unleashed its fastest and most powerful road-legal production car ever with a top speed of 186mph and a £140,000 price-tag to match. The exclusive super-fast two-seater F-Type ‘Project 7’ will accelerate from rest to 60mph in just 3.8 seconds and is to make its fitting public debut at the opening of the four-day Goodwood Festival of Speed in Sussex tomorrow. However, perhaps in keeping with Jaguar’s ‘bad boy’ marketing strategy, its launch also coincides with the stern rap from advertising watchdogs who criticised the manufacturer for glorifying speed.

Jaguar says its new luxury sports car is a ‘fully road-legal’ two-seater open-topped roadster with  race-inspired bucket seats, a specially designed stowable roof and 196-litres of luggage space. It is the first to be built by Jaguar Land Rover’s recently-founded ‘Special Vehicle Operations’ division with production limited to an exclusive limited-edition run of 250 cars globally. First deliveries are to begin in the middle of next year for those who can afford the sticker price of up to £140,000. The name ‘Project 7’ acknowledges Jaguar’s seven historic Le Mans race wins overall. The design has been inspired by the Jaguar D-Type racing car launched exactly 60 years ago which in the 1950s clocked up three wins in the Le Mans 24 hour endurance race and which was itself the inspiration for the legendary E-Type sports car that epitomised the Swinging Sixties. A Jaguar spokesman said: ‘It is the fastest and most powerful production Jaguar ever built. We will produce it in an exclusive run of up to 250 units, hand-built by Jaguar Land Rover’s Special Operations team.’ Powered by a 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine developing 575 horsepower - as much as nearly six Ford Fiestas -  it accelerates from rest to  60mph in just 3.8 seconds and has a top speed electronically limited to 186mph. It features super-lightweight and  aerodynamically sculptured carbon-fibre bodywork designed to cut down weight and help it cut through the air with less resistance. Aerodynamic side skirts, rear diffuser and an adjustable rear spoiler are all made of carbon-fibre to generate 177 per cent more ‘downforce’ to keep it firmly on the road, rather than taking off like an aircraft. John Edwards, managing director of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations said: ‘It's the most powerful production Jaguar ever built, and pays homage to Jaguar's seven outright Le Mans victories with distinctive design cues inspired by the Jaguar D-type which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year.’ Power is sent to the rear wheels through Jaguar’s eight-speed Quickshift automatic gearbox with manual override. And it has equally powerful carbon ceramic brakes to keep it rooted to the road – even on tight bends - and bring it to a safe stop. Even the exhaust pipe system can be tweaked to increase or decrease the roar from this latest leaping cat car which rides on specially made 20in gloss black alloy wheels. Jaguar’s chief engineer for vehicle dynamics Mike Cross said: ‘The result is a driving experience that’s pure and involving in every sense.’ Each car will sport a specially numbered plaque located between the two seats and signed by Jaguar design director Ian Callum. Two seater: Powered by a 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine developing 575 horsepower - as much as nearly six Ford Fiestas - it accelerates from rest to  60mph in just 3.8 seconds . Luxury: It features super-lightweight and aerodynamically sculptured carbon-fibre bodywork designed to cut down weight and help it cut through the air with less resistance . New release: The interior features carbon-fibre veneer inserts on the console, an Alcantara steering wheel with a leather option and machined aluminium gearshift paddles . He said: ‘F-Type Project 7 is the perfect example of how, as a design team, we can move quickly with our engineering colleagues. We’ve pushed the boundaries of what’s possible. It is the perfect contemporary embodiment of the D-type that inspired it.’ 'We've pushed the boundaries of what’s possible' Ian Callum, Jaguar design director . The driver and passenger sit in lightweight race-inspired bucket seats finished in a quilted racing-style diamond pattern. Four-point racing harnesses are available as an accessory. The interior features carbon-fibre veneer inserts on the console, an Alcantara steering wheel with a leather option, machined aluminium gearshift paddles and bespoke tread-plates with the ‘Project 7’ logo. The car will be offered in five metallic colours: Ultra Blue, Italian Racing Red, British Racing Green (all with white racing decal options), Ultimate Black and a new colour, Glacier White (both with grey decal options).","Focus on speed 'emphasised by engine revving and high tempo music'

"A black New Jersey man is suing his former employer Benjamin Moore for discrimination after he says the paint company named two brown paint tones after him. Clinton Tucker's suit claims he was given the boot in March after he repeatedly complained about the colors Tucker Chocolate and Clinton Brown. Tucker alleges one of the colors was a part of the company's Williamsburg Collection, a project he helped market. Racist? A former black Benjamin Moore employee in New Jersey is suing the paint giant for racial discrimination after he was fired for complaining about two paint colors that he says were named after him . 'Despite [Tucker's] repeated complaints and protestations to BM management about these appallingly racial color names, no action was ever taken by Benjamin Moore to change the names of these colors,' reads the suit. The color remained on the Benjamin Moore website as of Sunday, where its description suggests the name has its origin in Colonial Williamsburg. 'Capturing the 1798 color requested by St. George Tucker for his home facing Courthouse Green, this deep brown is classic and understated,' reads the site. Regardless of its purported beginnings, 'being a black man named Clinton Tucker, the plaintiff found this [color name] to be extremely racially offensive' Do you see it? The Benjamin Moore website claims that Tucker Chocolate, from the Williamsburg Collection the plaintiff helped to market, has its origins in this home in Colonial Williamsburg . What's more, 'when this was mentioned at a meeting with at least eight people including his supervisor, this was met with awkward silence.' It was part of what the plaintiff is claiming was a culture of racial insensitivity and even outright aversion. 'In addition, BM has a color called Clinton Brown,' reads the suit. 'A BM employee pointed this out to the plaintiff and thought it was funny.' The suit notes that Benjamin Moore also has a paint color called Confederate Red 'offensively described by Benjamin [Moore] as a ""timeless and enduring classic.""' Tucker believes that he was denied opportunities to advance because of his race 'despite spending countless hours in the office' and that his 'two white, blonde-haired and blue-eyed subordinates' remained at the company after his termination. Tucker is seeking damages for discrimination, retaliation and a hostile work environment.","Clinton Tucker worked for the company's website in New Jersey starting in 2011 .

"Female aspiring police officers in Indonesia are being forced to undergo 'virgin tests', a human rights organisation reports. Following a recruitment drive earlier this year, 7,000 women are currently undergoing training in Indonesia, after fulfilling a number of criteria. In order to become a policewoman, a candidate must be aged 17.5-22 years, follow a religion, be at least 5ft5in, not need glasses and: be a virgin. Female force: Indonesian wannabe policewomen must be aged 17.5-22 years, follow a recognised religion, be at least 5ft5in tall, not need glasses and, astonishingly enough, be a virgin . 'In addition to the medical and physical tests, women who want to be policewomen must also undergo virginity tests, so all women who want to become policewomen should keep their virginity,' the Indonesian police states on its website. However, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, a number of applicants were only told of the test moments before it was about to take place. 'I felt embarrassed, nervous, but I couldn't refuse, ' a 2013 applicant told the HRW according to GlobalPost. 'If I had refused, I couldn't have become a policewoman.' According to another female applicant, the tests have seen the aspiring police officers undress in front of 20 other candidates before being led into a room without a door, in pairs. There, in the company of the other applicants, the women were subjected to internal examinations to determine if they were virgins. Humiliating: Female applicants were forced to undress in front of 20 other candidates before being led into a room without a door in pairs, where the 'virginity tests' took place . 'The Indonesian National Police's use of virginity tests is . a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women,' said Nisha Varia, associate women's rights director at HRW. 'Applicants who failed the test were not necessarily . expelled from the force, but women described the test as painful . and traumatic.' The practice, which is supposed to determine if the . candidate's hymen is intact, has been widely discredited as . unscientific and degrading. A spokesman for the national police confirmed virginity . tests still happened but that there was no requirement for . female candidates to be virgins. 'There is a complete health test for both female and male . candidates including checking reproductive organs and the . virginity test for women will be a part of that routine,' said . Ronny Sompie. 'But there has never has been a rule that requires . policewomen to be virgins, so there is no discrimination.' One candidate, who had undergone the test and asked to . remain anonymous, said she agreed with it in principle. 'I don't have a problem with the test...but the way in which . it was conducted, with many people in one room, violated our . privacy,' she said.","Indonesian women 'have to maintain virginity' to become police officers .

"Clambering down from his tiny coffin-sized shack built into the steel girders of its huge frame, this is the man who lives in Manhattan Bridge. Calling the New York City landmark home for the past year, he has managed to quietly come and go - while millions of oblivious commuters have rushed past his makeshift wooden home without a second thought or glance. Emerging daily at dawn with only the odd cyclist or early morning subway rider for company, the man was only first-sighted recently - prompting a report of a suicide attempt as he safely climbed back into his home boxed in between the subway and bike lane. Scroll Down for Video . Emerging: This is the man believed to be called 'Joey' who lives in Manhattan Bridge and was photographed leaving his makeshift home on Tuesday morning . Speaking heavily accented English, the man offered up his name as Joey and said that he had arrived in New York City 13-years previously from China. Climbing down: The man - who is originally from China - has lived in the bridge in secret for the past year . When asked where he had lived in China before arriving in the United States, middle-aged Joey said that he had worked in Shanghai, but had left to try and find a better life in the United States. Claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling, Joey said that for the past year he has called the Manhattan Bridge his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby Chinatown. Indeed, dotted around the shack built into the bridge are evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area. Joey said that there were others who . lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her . worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912. Surprisingly . well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge, Joey said that the brutal . winter that New York and the nation just experienced was difficult to . endure. Left to his . climb back into his home, Joey has said that he is working on a second . shack just 15-feet up the ramp from his current abode. Each of the cramped homes are around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seem to be protected with bike locks. Good morning: The man makes his way down from his shack at dawn - to avoid the hundreds of thousands of people who use the bridge on a weekly basis . Discarded materials: Water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where 'Joey' has built his home in the Manhattan Bridge . Daylight: 'Joey' explains that he has been coming and going from the Manhattan Bridge for the past year - until a reported suicide attempt - which was in fact him climbing into his home - revealed him to New York . Home: After speaking for a moment - 'Joey' returned to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining . Admittedly the dwellings, narrow spaces just big enough for one person to lie down, are cramped, but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements. The New York Post first reported on Sunday about a middle-aged Chinese man who was seen locking his plywood 'door' with a bicycle lock each morning and return for the evening to sleep. To reach the dwelling, which is built into the bridge frame on the Manhattan side of the bridge, he climbs a chain-link fence. Last Sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide. Dwelling: This is 'Joey's home - seen in daylight in the Manhattan Bridge . Joey likely picked this spot because it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway. 'People are really desperate for . places to stay. I say, if he’s not bothering anybody, he’s not bothering . me. Leave him alone,' Marcha Johnson, a passerby riding her bike near . the shantytown told the Post. The pods are built into the underside of the upper deck of the bridge, below car traffic and above the subway.

"A Sydney woman who allegedly murdered her abusive partner told police he was a 'psycho' and she just didn't want him to hurt her any more. Jessica Silva broke down in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday as her trial was shown a police interview she gave the morning after 28-year-old James Polkinghorne was stabbed to death on Mother's Day in 2012. In the video, Silva repeatedly wraps a brown blanket around her shoulders as she tells police how a fight had broken out between her, Mr Polkinghorne and her brother Miguel Silva outside her Marrickville home in Sydney's inner west.

"A string of Twitter accounts have been closed after they were revealed to contain disturbing images of child abuse. The graphic pictures were apparently made public late last night after hacking groups claimed to have broken into the private accounts to expose their indecent content, the NSPCC said. The charity said it received a 'flurry' of reports overnight relating to at least half a dozen Twitter accounts which were later disabled. The NSPCC has received at least half a dozen reports of child abuse images in private Twitter files . They will now be investigated in the US, where the micro-blogging site is based. An NSPCC spokesman said: 'Apparently these were pretty disturbing images of child abuse. ""We understand the authorities in the US are now looking at the accounts.' The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) said it had also received around 30 reports, relating to at least four accounts. A spokesman added: 'Twitter are obliged by law to send details of any accounts containing indecent images of children to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US. 'NCMEC will then forward information for investigation to law enforcement agencies in the relevant country where the user is believed to be based, or children believed to be at risk.' Authorities were first alerted to the apparent abuse by a number of Twitter users at around 11.30pm. This came after hackers apparently opened up a number of private accounts which were previously kept hidden from public view, the NSPCC said. It remains unclear whether any of the images were uploaded by a British user or a user based abroad. The nationalities of any children involved are also unknown. Twitter has yet to comment on the images but has apparently issued a response to anyone contacting the company over the images of alleged abuse. This reads: 'We do not tolerate child pornography on Twitter. When we are made aware of such images they will be removed from the site without further notice.'

"Soft drinks laden with sugar could raise a woman’s risk of developing womb cancer, claim researchers. They said those who downed the highest amounts were 78 per cent more likely to suffer from the disease as those who did not. The disease tends to hit women aged 50-plus and is Britain’s fourth most common female cancer, killing nearly 2,000 a year. Risk: The study, of almost 25,000 women, showed that those who drank lots of fizzy drinks were more likely to contract the disease . The 14-year study involving almost 25,000 women in their 50s and 60s looked into endometrial cancer, which affects the lining of the womb. The participants  gave detailed data about what they ate and drank, with around half having fizzy drinks. Almost 600 developed endometrial cancer, the most common form of the disease when it affects the womb. However, there was no link with diet versions. The University of Minnesota researchers said that they couldn’t rule out that women who had lots of sugar-laden drinks had lots of unhealthy habits. However, they believe the sugar in the soft drinks to be key as it could make the women put on weight. This is important because fat cells make oestrogen, a hormone that is believed to fuel endometrial cancer. Overweight women also tend to make more insulin, another hormone linked to the disease. Killer: Womb cancer kills nearly 2,000 women in the UK every year . Researcher Dr Maki Inoue-Choi said: ‘Research has documented the contribution of sugar-sweetened beverages to the obesity epidemic. ‘Too much sugar can boost a person’s overall calorie intake and may increase the risk of health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.’ The study, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, is the latest in a long line to raise concerns about the health effects of the soft drinks enjoyed by millions of Britons every day. Previous studies have linked them to a host of health problems, including heart attacks, diabetes, weight gain, brittle bones, pancreatic and prostate cancer, muscle weakness and paralysis. The soft drinks industry says that its products account for a tiny amount of overall calorie intake.","Study reveals link to the cancer - which kills 2,000 British women a year .
