For one night only: Esther Rantzen is bringing That's Life! back to TV screens as she launches her helpline for older people . The show announced the creation of Esther Rantzen’s Childline three decades ago. And now the presenter is bringing That’s Life! back to TV screens for one night only  – as she launches her helpline for older people. Miss Rantzen will appear on tonight’s edition of BBC’s The One Show, teaming up with hosts Matt Baker and Alex Jones to front an updated version of the long-running magazine programme. That’s Life! ran on BBC One for more than 20 years and was famous for campaigning on serious issues, as well as running light-hearted sections featuring funny poems, performing pets and strangely shaped vegetables. Miss Rantzen is using tonight’s show to launch her latest charity – the Silver Line helpline for older people – 27 years after she launched the children’s service Childline on That’s Life! The dedicated phone number, which allows children to speak to trained advisors for free and in confidence, received thousands of calls in its first year and continued to expand until it became part of the NSPCC in 2006. Several former That’s Life! presenters will be in the audience tonight including Howard Leader and Bill Buckley. The Silver Line was created by Miss Rantzen with the aim of linking lonely older people to services in their area. Decades on: Miss Rantzen (pictured with bullied children Katherina Smith, centre, and Vicky Blowers, right) announced the creation of children's service Childline on That's Life! 27 years ago . It will provide a ‘befriending service’ and will also help those who may be suffering from abuse or neglect. Kate Jopling, director for the Campaign to End Loneliness, said: ‘Loneliness is a shockingly common problem, but admitting we are lonely can be incredibly hard to do because of the stigma that surrounds it. Long-running magazine programme: That's Life! ran on BBC One for more than 20 years and was famous for campaigning on serious issues . ‘When people find the courage to ask for . help, it is vital that someone is there to listen – which is why a . 24-hour phone line, where people are always on hand to take your call, . is such an important addition to the safety net available to older . people.’ She added: ‘We hope that Esther Rantzen’s new project the Silver Line will provide a really prominent new gateway to this support.’ David McCullough, chief executive of the Royal Voluntary Service, which is supporting the campaign, said: ‘It is essential that older people have easy access to information and services that can help improve their lives – whether that is a simple measure like having a “befriender” come and visit every week or help facing larger issues such as moving into a care home or losing a partner.’ He added: ‘Older people who call the Silver Line will be put in touch with vital local services, such as those provided by the Royal Voluntary Service which provide companionship and support, helping older people to live life rather than simply exist.’ Miss Rantzen wrote in 2011 about the loneliness she suffered after the death of her husband. Last year she revealed in the Mail that she would be setting up the Silver Line to help other people experiencing the same problem. ‘Loneliness particularly strikes older people who are used to having a purpose in life, to being needed,’ she said. 24-hour phoneline: The Silver Line aims to link lonely older people to services in their area, providing a 'befriending service' and help for those suffering from abuse or neglect . ‘Gradually, the community they used to belong to has shrunk away to nothing… After a busy family life, and perhaps an active career, being alone has come as a painful shock.’ She added: ‘So, I hope and believe that the Silver Line could become a lifeline to all those older people who have contributed so much throughout their lives but now feel so isolated and alone.’ The Silver Line phone number is 0800 4 70 80 90.","Esther Rantzen has teamed up with hosts Matt Baker and Alex Jones for the updated version of the long-running TV programme .

Ministers are to sell off almost £1billion in student loans to a private debt collection agency. The London Stock Exchange will be told this morning that the Government has agreed a deal to privatise £900million-worth of loans made to students who went to universities in the 1990s. The move will lead to fears that the private firm will be much less sensitive in chasing debts, and could hound those facing financial problems to pay up – even more than two decades after they went to university. The London Stock Exchange will be told this morning that the Government has agreed a deal to privatise £900million-worth of loans made to students who went to universities in the 1990s . Almost 15,000 people have signed an online petition against the plans, saying it will simply allow private companies to profit at the expense of poor former students. The sell-off comes just weeks after the controversial sale of Royal Mail. Shares have shot up since the sale, leading to concerns they were massively undervalued. The controversy could be repeated with student loans because it is reported that the sale will be for a fraction of the debt’s value. The e-petition on the Downing Street website says: ‘By selling outstanding loans to the private sector, the Government would lose a long-term source of revenue to the Treasury, sacrificing it for meagre short-term gain and potentially leaving private financial companies to profit without investing back into the UK economy. ‘Coupled with proposals to remove the cap on student loan interest rates, this would saddle many UK graduates with loans they would be unable to repay during their working lives.’ The disposal, to a debt recovery specialist, will be for a fraction of the debts’ face value, and encompasses mortgage-style loans that are the last of their kind still in public ownership. The sale, which does not include Income Contingent Repayment loans like the ones currently offered, comes as student groups step up their protest over the disposal of the loan portfolios. The Coalition is drawing up plans to sell the entire outstanding student loan-book, which has a face value of roughly £40bn. The move will lead to fears that the private firm will be much less sensitive in chasing debts, and could hound those facing financial problems to pay up . Investment bankers from Barclays and Rothschild were appointed by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills last month to oversee the sale. The terms and conditions for borrowers who took out mortgage-style loans will not change as a result of the sale. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said during the summer that the Government hoped to raise £10billion from the sale of corporate and financial assets such as the student loan book by 2020. Speaking in March, when the mortgage-style student loan auction was initiated, David Willetts, the universities and science minister, said: ‘Selling the remaining mortgage-style student loans will allow us to reduce public debt and maximise the value of one of the Government’s assets. ‘The private sector’s expertise makes it well-placed to collect this debt and the sale will also help the Student Loans Company to concentrate on providing loans to current students.’ The low recovery rate on the 1990s loans means the sale price is likely to be only in the tens of millions of pounds, reflecting the distressed nature of the debts, people close to the situation said on Sunday. The mortgage-style loans were available between 1990 and 1998, with two tranches sold in 1998 and 1999. Repayments on them can be deferred for a year at a time if borrowers’ income is below 85% of the national average earnings. ‘The remaining loans owned by the Government are mostly in deferment or in arrears, so total annual repayments are low,’ BIS said in March, adding that it was likely to receive significantly less than £900million from a buyer.","Almost 15,000 people have signed an online petition against the plans .

The Coalition was split yesterday on David Cameron’s plans to limit access to benefits for EU migrants, with a Lib Dem minister saying it could ‘put us on the wrong side’ of Europe. Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish Secretary, said he would ‘need to be persuaded’ on proposals to impose a minimum period before newly-arrived migrants could claim handouts. However, London Mayor Boris Johnson backed the Prime Minister’s calls for restrictions, saying: ‘It is clearly time for the UK to take back more control of the terms under which EU migrants arrive on our streets. Split: Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, left, says he would 'need to be persuaded' regarding David Cameron's plans to limit access to benefits for EU migrants, while Boris Johnson, right, has backed the plans . 'We need much more flexibility to set conditions for claiming benefits. ‘I am in favour of immigration by talented and hard-working people, but the present system is mad: cracking down on Australians, New Zealanders and high-spending Chinese students and tourists, but completely incapable of dealing with a sizeable influx from within the EU, some of whom show no sign of wanting to work.’ The reluctance to impose restrictions by the Lib Dems comes despite even Labour accepting there should be controls to ensure immigrants do not come here from Eastern Europe purely to live a life on benefits. Proposals: Mr Cameron plans to impose a minimum period before newly-arrived immigrants can claim benefits . Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, yesterday said her party had suggested nine months ago it was in favour of transitionary limits on benefits for Romanians and Bulgarians moving to Britain after border controls are lifted on January 1. The comments will, however, raise eyebrows, because Labour refused to impose similar controls in 2004 when the borders were flung open to migrants from Poland and elsewhere in the EU. Number 10 has acted after two polls revealed deep public unease about immigration. On Friday, a survey for the Mail showed more than four in five people did not want unrestricted access to the UK for Romanians and Bulgarians, and said they were concerned the NHS and schools would be put under too much pressure. And a poll for The Times a day later showed that, by a huge margin, tightening border controls tops the wishlist for renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU before a referendum in 2017. The Mail revealed on Saturday that new limits on EU migrants who claim benefits in Britain are to be a key demand in the Government’s attempt to negotiate a looser relationship with Europe. Cabinet sources say that gaining the right to ‘shut the door’ on  benefits for newcomers and existing migrants who have not lived here for a minimum period – possibly around six months – would be top of the list. Details are expected to be announced by the Prime Minister soon, perhaps as early as this week. Number 10’s tough stance on migrants comes days after two polls revealed just how worried Britons are about border controls. On Friday, a survey  for the Mail showed 82 per cent would say no to free access to the  UK for Romanians and Bulgarians. While on Saturday, a survey for The Times showed that despite voters being happy with David Cameron’s stance on immigration controls, a poll of their priorities before he attempts to claw back powers from Brussels put tightening border controls at the top. It led the next two highest-ranked priorities – human rights reform and expanding non-EU trade – by a margin of 30 per cent. One Tory minister said: ‘Everyone knows we’ve got to do something. And something big.’ But yesterday, Mr Carmichael voiced concerns at imposing tougher conditions on EU migrants amid fears about the number of Bulgarians and Romanians expected to come to the UK from January. David Cameron is hopeful for support from a number of other EU countries for curbs on ‘welfare tourism’. As many as 12 countries, including Spain, Germany and Denmark, are understood to have concerns that large numbers of people are arriving only to claim generous benefits. All are demanding powers to limit the benefits that can be claimed – but so far the European Commission has proved unwilling to change. The Commission has previously threatened Britain over plans to limit benefits handouts, claiming that they ‘infringe the human rights’ of EU citizens. One Cabinet minister said: ‘The writing is on the wall for the way the Commission is behaving. Other countries have also had enough.’ The move could trigger a clash with the European Commission, which prevents member states from discriminating between their own citizens and those from other European Union members. The Lib Dem MP told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics that he could ‘see the need for robust  transitional arrangements’ but he added: ‘I would need to be persuaded of that, but I am prepared to look at the whole situation in  the round. ‘Potentially it might put us on  the wrong side of the rest of the European Union. It’s something that we should be discussing with them, certainly.’ But Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove also backed Mr Cameron’s position yesterday. On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he said: ‘The Prime Minister … struck exactly the right note on migration, which is to celebrate the achievements of people who come here. ‘But when it comes to new migrants from accession countries in the EU, we need to look properly at the benefits system to make sure people are coming here to work and contribute, not to take advantage of what is rightly a generous welfare system.’","Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael is unsure about David Cameron's proposals .

David Moyes claims we haven't seen the best of Manchester United yet, despite their resounding 5-0 victory over German side Bayer Leverkusen this week. Moyes, who will pit his team against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday, believes United can prove their Premier League title credentials on a more consistent basis. 'I still think the best is still to come,' the former Everton manager said. 'I still think we can continue to improve and progress.

He said United would only sign players 'if the right players are available and they fit exactly what we want.' He added: 'We would like to [sign players], but as always there are no guarantees.' United chased one of Moyes former players Leighton Baines for much of the summer, and the Scot was asked whether the Reds would return for the Everton full back in the future. 'If they are determined to hold on to him [Baines] then he can't be going anywhere,' Moyes said. 'So it's worthless asking me the question.'","Moyes claims United can improve on 5-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 24 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:56 EST, 24 November 2013 . Three female RAF recruits have each been paid £100,000 in  compensation by defence chiefs – for injuries caused by marching like men. The women said parading in step with male recruits for several weeks forced them to lengthen their stride too far - resulting in spinal and pelvic damage. Their claims were settled earlier this year following a five-year legal battle with the Ministry of Defence, which accused them of exaggerating their symptoms. Keeping up: Women at this RAF base in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, can be seen marching at the same pace as male recruits . Critics condemned the ‘compensation culture’ within the Armed Forces and blamed the case on an ‘obsession with gender equality’. The payouts are bigger than many of the lump sums paid to soldiers shot on the front line in Afghanistan. Former defence minister Gerald Howarth told the Mail on Sunday: ‘This case is completely and utterly ridiculous - it belongs in the land of the absurd. ‘The defence budget is strapped and we’re making 20,000 troops redundant, yet these former recruits are being paid six-figure sums. ‘The MoD must stand up to the compensation culture and get the wider public on its side. If the RAF has erred in its training procedures it is because of society’s obsession with gender equality.’ In settling the case, the MoD accepted it had failed to follow guidelines about stride lengths for men and women, and made the women carry the same heavy packs as male recruits. RAF policy states that women should not have stride lengths longer than 27in, and should be at the front of a march to set  the pace. Compensation: Tracie Davies, pictured, said she was in agony within weeks of starting her training . The female recruits, who were aged 17, 22 and 23 at the time, were forced to stretch their strides to 30in during basic training at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire. They have been compensated for nine years of lost earnings and  pensions - despite all reportedly having successful careers outside the military. The payouts came as the Armed Forces’ compensation bill for 2012/13 topped £108.9million - up £21million on the previous financial year. One of the recruits, Tracie Davies, said she was in agony within a few weeks of starting training in 2006. ‘The guys were over 6ft tall so I was over-striding to march in step with them,’ she said. ‘When I started getting pains in my groin I was told to march through it, even when I was carrying a heavy pack which was almost the size of me. ‘I trusted the medics to know better than me so I carried on marching. But eventually I couldn’t take any more and burst into tears.’ An X-ray found that she had four separate pelvic fractures. She added: ‘I was put on crutches and sent home on sick leave. My fractures didn’t recover sufficiently for me to complete basic training and in 2008 I was medically discharged.’ At the time she was given £3,000 in compensation by the military but later sued. A spokesman for  the Ministry of Defence said it had ‘legal liability’ to pay compensation in some cases, and had changed its training practices to ensure the problem didn’t arise again. ‘When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the Ministry of Defence has a legal liability to pay compensation,’ she said. ‘Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so. The RAF takes the welfare of it recruits very seriously and has reviewed its recruit training practices to mitigate against this risk.’ In 2007, the MoD paid £484,000 to an RAF typist who injured her thumb at work. The woman, then in her 20s, claimed it caused her to become depressed. Her award was almost double what a soldier would have received at the time for losing both his legs in the course of duty.","The women's claims were settled after a five-year battle with the MoD .

'They were sat in lines on benches, with desks in front of them and a teacher in the corner at the front of the room. 'There was a blackboard, but no chalk, pens, pencils, books or learning materials of any kind. The teacher didn't even speak the same language as the students. 'Education plays a critical role in development, and these children, though they had access to schooling, had no opportunity to learn and fulfil their potential. It's impossible not to be moved by something like that. Mr Sears said education was not 'a miraculous weapon' against poverty but played a 'crucial role' as an 'enabler' of human rights.","Friends Richard Sears and Nick Gough have already travelled 2,330 miles .

Conversation: Politicians descending on Charlotte for the Democratic National Convention will be greeted by not one, but two highly-controversial billboards aimed at religion . Agenda: The American Atheists, a non-profit organization that promotes the 'absolute separation of government and religion,' has put up two advertisements slamming both Christianity and Mormonism . The American Atheists say that the signs are meant to 'expose the foolishness' of religion in the political landscape. They hope that by targeting these two religions, they can push faith out of politics. 'The election of our leaders in the United States is one of the most important decisions that we as citizens make. Allowing our judgment to be clouded by sheer silliness is unacceptable,' David Silverman, president of the American Atheists, said in a statement. 'We want to show the people of our country the foolishness of mixing religion with politics.'

A photograph of a giddy, luminescent man in his underwear is pictured alongside the message. A different version of the ad opens with 'God Is A Space Alien.' Statement: The American Atheists say that the signs are meant to 'expose the foolishness' of religion in the political landscape . Argument: They hope that by targeting these two religions, they can push faith out of politics . The second sign is located above Wilkinson Boulevard and reads 'Christianity: Sadistic God; Useless Savior, 30,000+ Versions of ""Truth,"" Promotes Hate, Calls it ""Love.""' A photograph of Jesus on a slice of toasted bread accompanies this message. Both advertisements then say 'Atheism: Simply reasonable. Join American Atheists!' 'Our great country was founded on the secular ideals of the Constitution. Allowing religion to be the litmus test of our candidates undermines the very core of our freedoms,' Teresa MacBain of the group said. 'Article VI of the Constitution states, ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification"" for those desiring public office. How can we disregard our governing principles so blatantly?'

Two young boys in Southern California have been hospitalized after ingesting methamphetamine in separate incidents which police believe may both be due to tainted Halloween candy. The parents of one unnamed two-year-old took their son to an Orange County hospital on Saturday night after he started experiencing nightmares and wouldn’t go back to sleep. Lab tests confirmed that the boy had been exposed to the dangerous drug. Parents in Southern California are warned to check their children's Halloween candy after two separate incidents of kids ingesting meth were reported . Prior to getting sick, the boy had eaten a packet of Smarties candy he had received while trick-of-treating on the 25000 block of Calabria Way, Moreno Valley, on Halloween night. The boy is expected to be released from hospital on Tuesday. Investigators are exploring whether the drugs came from tainted treats or another source. Pieces of candy tested as controls - or .

U.S. Department of Justice, which will conduct further tests to determine whether any of the police department's results were 'false positives.' Those tests could take months to complete. Police have already probed the family's home from another source of the meth and the boy's grandfather told NBC that his family have ‘nothing to hide.’ Police believe that a two-year-old boy may have got sick after ingesting a packet of Smarties candy he had received while trick-of-treating that could have been tainted with meth . A second boy in Huntington Beach was also hospitalized on Saturday after eating Halloween candy and he also tested positive for methamphetamine. Detectives have confiscated all the six-year-old's trick-or-treating take-home and are testing to see if any of the sweets were laced with meth. ‘We know it was one of the things he was doing before he became sick, or under the influence,’ said Lt. Mitch O'Brien of the Huntington Beach Police Department. The six-year-old, who is currently recovering, collected his candy near Beach Boulevard and Atlanta Avenue, officials said.

A horse owner has been jailed after his cob was found hanging from a cliff face because he left it tethered too close to the edge. Samuel Smith, 54, tied his young male gypsy cob near a sheer 50-ft drop at Pakefield near Lowestoft, Suffolk. The colt was later discovered hanging off the cliff face from the rope that had been left tied around its neck. Despite attempts to save the horse by RSPCA workers and veterinarians, the colt died from a collapsed windpipe. Rescue attempt: RSPCA workers pictured attempting to save a young male gypsy cob who was left hanging from a cliff face after his owner left him tethered too close to the edge . Dangerous: Samuel Smith, 54, had left the young colt tied up at Pakefield cliffs in Suffolk - leaving him perilously close to a 50-ft sheer drop . Smith, from Kessingland, Suffolk, admitted causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the horse's welfare needs after the incident. As well as being jailed he was banned from keeping animals for 15 years by Lowestoft magistrates. The court heard how RSPCA inspector Nicky Thorne was called to the scene where the horse had fallen last March and managed to cut the unconscious piebald colt free with her pocket knife. Veterinary surgeons battled for six hours to save the horse with the help of fire-fighters and coastguards, but it died from a collapsed windpipe on arrival at the Norfolk-based Redwings Horse Sanctuary. Inspector Thorne said after the hearing: 'This was a tragic case which highlights just how dangerous tethering can be. Severe injuries: RSPCA workers and veterinarians battled to save the horse's life but he eventually died from a collapsed windpipe on arrival at the Redwings Horse Sanctuary in Norfolk . 'Dozens of people were involved in trying to save that poor little horse on a cold, wet and windy night - but just one person was responsible for leaving him tethered beside a steep cliff and then hanging by his neck over the edge. 'The prison sentence shows how seriously the court took this case and should act as a deterrent against the reckless use of tethers on horses left unattended like this.' Nic de Brauwere, a senior veterinary surgeon at Redwings who took part in the rescue, said: 'There is no doubt that the horse suffered terribly, which is harrowing enough in itself. 'But what is most upsetting is the knowledge that the whole incident was completely unnecessary. 'Inspector Thorne behaved with incredible courage and we felt at the time that he might have a chance, but sadly too much damage had been done. 'I thank the courts for recognising the tragedy and futility of this incident and hope that anyone who tethers their horses will be reminded that if it has to be done at all tethering has to be done properly or there can be dire consequences for the horses and ponies involved.'

These bizarre and somewhat sinister images look like something out of a twisted fairytale. The macabre tableaux show stuffed . animals in a variety of human situations, including a wedding attended . solely by kittens and a primary school class where all the pupils are . bunnies. But in the Victorian era - and right up to the 1970s - they were part of a thriving tourist attraction which drew in thousands. The purrfect wedding: In this display more than a dozen kittens are posed and dressed up like they are at a wedding . I do: The kitten bride, groom and vicar were posed up to mimic a real-life wedding ceremony . Detail: The kitten guests are given very intridcate costumes, including earrings and a waistcoat chain . From 1861 until 1970 the models were on display at a museum attached to the White Lion pub in Bramber, Sussex. The intricate scenes were created by eccentric Victorian taxidermist Walter Potter between 1855 and 1890. Little is known about Potter's life, but the dioramas he created have a legacy all of their own, and in their heydey were so popular that the platform of the local railway station was expanded to accommodate extra visitors. Other scenes show a sombre procession of birds walking past a coffin, a group of rats entranced by a game of dominoes, and one particularly bizarre image shows a very dapper monkey taking a ride on a goat. Learning to multiply: These rabbits have been arranged like pupils in a Victorian school . Touching: The animals are given realistic expressions and poses . Eccentric: The scenes were crafted by Walter Potter, pictured holding a stuffed fox . When Mr Potter died in 1918 his descendants took over the museum, but as the Victorian fashion for stuffed curiosities waned the museum ceased to be a viable business. After it was forced to close in its Bramber location in 1970, the attraction moved to Bright then Arundel, Sussex, where it still drew in more than 30,000 a year. The collection was then bought up and moved again to Cornwall, where it stayed for almost 20 years. But in 2003 this exhibit too was forced to close, and the whole collection went to auction. Quite the party: One of the scenes shows kittens politely taking afternoon tea . Sombre: This scene shows two birds carrying a third inside a tiny coffin . Enclosed: Some of the exhibits were shown in ornate displays, such as this . Curiosity: The museum, pictured in action, was extremely popular with the public of the past . When a single buyer for the lots could not be found, the dioramas were sold off individually by London auctioneers Bonham's, and made more than £500,000. The tableaux are now scattered across the world in the hands of enthusiasts, but the curious images have been brought back together in a new book, Walter Potter's Curious World of Taxidermy. Co-author Joanna Ebenstein, a . 41-year-old from New York who runs the website Morbid Anatomy, spent six . months in London researching the book. 'These artefacts look utterly bizarre to us now', she said. Parlour game: These squirrels are shown relaxing over a game of cards . Precision: These rats enjoy a game of dominoes using miniature playing pieces . 'But they were once seen as quaint, charming and amusing, fit for the parlour or to delight the family on holiday. My two favourites are The Kittens' Tea & Croquet Party and The Kittens' Wedding. 'They both have this wonderful tension between perversity and a completely over-the-top cuteness. Each kitten is fully realized as its own character, and rendered with great charm. 'For . a man who was not a particularly skilled taxidermist in the . conventional sense, he definitively had a certain gift, and I think you . see that most with the kittens.' Ms Ebenstein said Mr Potter's motivation . for making the scenes were unclear, but that it was a much less bizarre . occupation in the Victorian era. Bizarre: Some of the stranger creations include a . monkey riding on the back of a goat, left, and a stuffed kitten which . was born with two faces, right . Attraction: The museum, pictured here at its original site in Bramber, Sussex, was a big draw . She said: 'We know very little about Walter Potter and why he made these pieces. 'But we must remember that at this time, taxidermy was so popular and so much a part of the fabric of daily life that every village had its own practitioner. 'The fact that Potter chose this medium-and that was so popular with a mass audience for around 150 years-is not as bizarre as it seems to the contemporary viewer. 'He worked in the 19th century, long before the practices of spaying and neutering. 'Cats and dogs simply bred, and kittens and puppies were routinely drowned to dispose of excess numbers, especially in the countryside, where Potter lived. 'There would also have also been an ongoing supply of strange or freak animals-most of which die in infancy-from local farmers who knew Potter, his proclivities, and his tiny museum.'","The surreal images show kittens marrying, squirrels playing cards and a monkey riding a goat .

The Atlanta Braves are leaving Turner Field and moving into a new 42,000-seat, $672 million stadium complex in Cobb County in 2017. Braves executives John Schuerholz, Mike Plant and Derek Schiller said Monday that the team decided not to seek another 20-year lease at Turner Field and began talks with the Cobb Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority in July. The infrastructure at Turner Field was originally built for the 1996 Summer Olympics before being converted to a baseball park that opened in 1997. 20 years: Fans watch a game between the Atlanta Braves and the Los Angeles Dodgers at Turner Field, which will no longer be the home of the Braves as of 2017 . End of an era: The Turner Field stadium shown here before the very match ever played between the Braves and the New York Yankees in 1997 . Announcement: Braves executive Mike Plant, pictured, along with colleagues, John Schuerholz and Derek Schiller, announced the new plans on Monday . The stadium will be part of a 60-acre development near Cobb Galleria mall. Plant says talks broke down with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreational Authority earlier this year. He adds that the team has not signed a contract with Cobb County, but he's '100 per cent certain it will happen'. Schiller says financing will come from the Braves and the Cobb County government. The team will be responsible for any cost overruns. New location: The new stadium will be located at the northwest corner of the I-75 and I-285 intersection in Cobb County, 14 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta . Opening ceremony: The stadium was originally built for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia . According to the team’s website, the reason for leaving is because they do not think the venue 'can remain viable for another 20 to 30 years’. ‘Turner Field has served the Braves well since 1997, but it is in need of major infrastructure work, which will cost around $150 million.’ It says the upgrades are ‘functional ones’, such as replacing worn-out seats or upgrading the stadium's lighting, which would ‘do little to significantly enhance the fan experience’. The team says Turner Field has served them well since 1997, but it is in need of major infrastructure work, which will cost around $150 million . The website says the cost for additional projects to ‘improve the fan experience’, could exceed $200 million. ‘Those upgrades still wouldn't address the logistical challenges outside the stadium – lack of consistent mass transit options, inadequate number of parking spaces and limited access to major highways,’ says the Braves website. It says the new stadium in Cobb County will be at the heart of a new entertainment complex, which will be open every day of the year.","Baseball team Atlanta Braves will be leaving Turner Field after 20 years .

Tragedy: Raymond Elsmore worked at the Queen's Inclosure Primary School crossing for 13 years . An 82-year-old lollipop man was killed by a car as he helped a pregnant mother and child to cross the road where he had worked for more than 13 years. Raymond Elsmore was wearing a high visibility jacket and holding up a sign on his usual patch of road when he was hit by a Nissan Micra. He sustained severe head injuries and died later in hospital after being . flung against the windscreen of the car. Lauren Paul, who was driving, has pleaded not guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, claiming she was blinded by the sun. Miss Paul, of Waterlooville in Hampshire, was on her way back to the college where she worked just after 3pm on December 5 last year when the incident occurred. Investigations established she had been travelling between 21mph and 28mph. Portsmouth Crown Court heard Mr Elsmore stepped into Tempest Avenue, Waterlooville, to help a woman and her child across it as he had done many times outside Queen’s Inclosure Primary School. An accident investigator, who visited the crash scene, said the bright sun could have blended in with a high visibility jacket similar to that worn by Mr Elsmore at the time of the accident. But Matthew Lawson, prosecuting, said the Highway Code stated that a driver should 'slow down or if necessary stop' if dazzled by bright sunlight. He added: 'The defendant’s driving at the time fell below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver in all the circumstances. 'The charge is that Miss Paul was driving without due care and attention. All drivers must stop when they see a lollipop man.' Mr Lawson said the Micra’s windscreen was shattered by the force of the blow and Mr Elsmore was flung down the road on the rebound. Trial: Lauren Paul, 22, hit Mr Elsmore in her Nissan Micra last year. She claims she was blinded by the sunlight . Miss Paul, blinded by the sunlight, only heard the bang. She claimed she was not late, not speeding and was fully alert. She was also heard to say that her windscreen had misted up and she had been trying to demist it, Mr Lawson said. Distraught: Toni Ponting, the pregnant mother he was helping to cross, said: 'my blood was boiling' After the accident, Miss Paul told a police officer: 'I was driving along the road, the sun was low and my screen was starting to mist. 'I pulled my visor down and heard a bang. I never saw the guy from first to last.' Mr Elsmore was taken by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital where he died of chest and head injuries suffered in the accident. Mr Lawson said: 'Sadly the injuries were incompatible with survival.' Mother-of-two Toni Ponting, who Mr Elsmore was helping across the road, said the driver became hysterical when she realised what had happened. Mrs Ponting, a part-time teacher, said: 'Ray was first to step in the road and there were no cars coming. We had a clear view and we spoke as we crossed. 'I could see cars coming behind him. Ray did not notice them because he was looking the other way. 'I saw the car approaching Ray and scoop him. It did not appear to slow down but stopped after it hit him. 'My blood was boiling, at the time being pregnant and hormonal, I was enraged and confused. 'The driver was upset and distraught. I said to the driver, ""could you not see him?"" and she said she could not. 'I told her she should not be driving. It was a cold, clear day and I had no difficulty seeing.' The case continues.

More than two years after Dr. James Nordstrom's body was found bludgeoned to death and stashed in a wood pile in his backyard in northwest New Mexico, the man jailed for his murder is finally going on trial. Nordstrom was beaten to death with a pool cue in the foothills near Farmington, N.M, and this Wednesday, John Mayes, 20, will go on trial for the June 2011 slaying. The judge says there's no disputing he beat him to death, the issue is self defense. The adopted son of Farmington's city manager, who was 17 at the time, faces first-degree murder, aggravated burglary, tampering with evidence and other charges. John Mayes points to a diagram of Dr James Nordstrom's residence while his defense attorney, Stephen Taylor, examines him during a 2011 preliminary hearing . The trial is set to begin Wednesday and is expected to last several days. Prosecutors have described it as cold-blooded murder. Defense attorneys argue their client was protecting himself and was influenced by a rare behavioral disorder that can affect people who have been neglected, abused or orphaned as children. According to arrest records, Mayes first told police he was running away from home when he saw the man's secluded house and broke in. He said he hid in a bedroom in the house while Nordstrom watched television. Mayes said he struck Nordstrom, 55, about eight times with the thick end of a pool cue when the man came into the bedroom. Mayes told police he wrapped Nordstrom's body in a rug, tried to clean up, then watched television and ate a tomato. Then he left the house and slept in the victim's truck for about four hours before returning and trying to bury the body. John Mayes takes the stand for the defense during his preliminary hearing in August 2011 . When he got tired of digging, an arrest warrant says, the teen told police he dragged the body to the wood pile. Police say Mayes then ate at a Burger King and shopped with the doctor's credit card. Mayes later pleaded not guilty and testified at a preliminary hearing that he approached the house while Nordstrom was washing his truck and asked if he could spend the night. After a tour of the home, Mayes said the two watched the end of a James Bond movie, ate and played some pool. Mayes alleged it was at the end of the pool game that the doctor made sexual advances toward him. The teen said Nordstrom continued to advance toward him so he kept hitting him until he fell and then died. State District Judge William Birdsall granted a defense motion in August to move the trial to Gallup. The decision came after potential jurors in San Juan County returned a questionnaire, with more than half of them saying they believed Mayes was guilty. On Friday, Birdsall made his final pretrial ruling on what photographs jurors would be allowed to see. Mayes' attorneys argued the autopsy report and trial testimony would be enough evidence to explain how Nordstrom died. The photos 'would be unduly prejudicial to the jury,' defense attorney Stephen Taylor said. 'And they would be shown to the jury just for that effect.' Birdsall said he would not allow pictures that were taken of Nordstrom's body at the crime scene. One of those images showed the doctor had a nearly severed finger, which prosecutor Brent Capshaw said indicated the doctor had his hand up in self-defense as he tried to protect himself from Mayes' blows. 'No one's disputing the fact that Mr. Mayes beat him to death with a pool cue,' the judge said. 'And no one is disputing that was the cause and manner of death. The issue is self-defense.' Mayes has been in jail for over two years, ahead of this trial.","Dr. James Nordstrom's body was found stashed in a wood pile in his backyard .

The number of married couples splitting up in Beijing has soared as people exploit a loophole in new tax legislation. In March, China brought in a 20 per cent tax on the profits owners make when they sell their homes. The number of married couples splitting up in Beijing has soared as people exploit a loophole in new tax legislation . This means couples that sell their marital home together will be stung by the property tax. But the law does not apply to divorced couples. This allows married couples with two properties to put one property into each name, divorce and then sell them tax-free. The couple are then allowed to re-marry. This gap in the statute is leading to thousands of people splitting up just to avoid the costly bills when selling their home. Nearly 40,000 couples divorced in the Chinese capital in the first nine months of this year, up 41 per cent on the same period in 2012, the Beijing Youth Daily said, citing official figures. Warning: A Shanghai marriage registration office, where divorce applications are also processed in China, has put out a sign saying: 'There are risks in the property market, think twice before you get divorced' The growth rate in divorces was 'far higher' than in the previous four years, the newspaper added. 'The exceptionally fast growth is related to tax evasion by some people taking advantage of a loophole in the (new) property purchase regulations introduced by the government,' Li Ziwei, a marriage expert and former civil affairs official in Beijing, said. Couples in other cities, where property prices have rocketed in recent years, have also turned to the practice to avoid the capital gains tax, which can amount to tens of thousands of dollars. Homeowners were previously taxed at just one or two per cent of the sale price. A Shanghai marriage registration office, where divorce applications are also processed in China, has put out a sign saying: 'There are risks in the property market, think twice before you get divorced'. Property prices are a sensitive issue in China and authorities have sought for the past three years to control their rise. As well as the capital gains tax, other measures have included restrictions on purchases of second and third homes, higher minimum down-payments and taxes on multiple and non-locally owned homes in some cities.","China brought in 20 per cent property tax in March .

A vendor was approached near the Old Bailey and asked to 'consider' removing the magazine's latest edition from his stand because it could prejudice legal proceedings. The 'Halloween special' cover shows Ms Brooks, 45, pictured outside the High Court, above the caption 'Horror witch costume withdrawn from shops' and surrounded by carved pumpkins. The former News International chief . executive is currently facing trial along with seven other defendants . including ex-Number 10 spin doctor Andy Coulson. Last night the Attorney General confirmed . the cover was not in contempt of court, and the police's behaviour branded . 'worrying' by press freedom supporters. Yesterday a jury was sworn in to try the case, which may take as long as six months, and the judge took the unprecedented step of showing them the cover and telling them to dismiss it. 'Unfortunately Private Eye has seen fit today to put out their November edition. You will undoubtedly see it on the newstands, so I can show it to you,' Mr Justice Saunders said. 'It bears a picture of Rebekah Brooks on the cover. It's meant to be satire. You ignore it. It has no serious input and it is not relevant to your considerations. 'It is one of those things that you will have to ignore - a joke which in the circumstances of today is a joke in especially bad taste.' Case: The police acted fearing that the trial of Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, both pictured outside court today, could be put in jeopardy. The Attorney General said it would not. Despite Justice Saunders' actions, the Attorney General quickly decided Private Eye posed no problems to the trial. Presiding judge: Mr Justice Saunders showed the magazine to the jury and called the cover 'a joke in especially bad taste' His spokesman said: 'The front cover of the current edition of Private Eye has been . brought to the attention of the Attorney General, but it has been . decided that proceedings for a potential contempt of court are not . required in this case.' The man asked to take down the cover, Tony McCarthy, has described his shock after he was approached by the authorities twice yesterday and the Met has confirmed that they tried to take action at two stalls near the Old Bailey. 'Metropolitan Police Service officers, in conjunction with other parties within the trial, made enquiries with a vendor about the latest Private Eye publication to assist the court. They advised the vendor that the publication may be in contempt of court,' a spokesman said. Press freedom campaigners have heavily criticised the action. Padraig Reidy, from the Index on Censorship told the Daily Telegraph: 'It is an example of a very blasé attitude towards the free press on the part of these individual policemen. That is worrying. 'The vendor should be congratulated for demanding to see a court order, which didn’t appear.' Today the hacking trial is due to start. Brooks and Coulson allegedly conspired with former News of the World head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, the tabloid’s ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, and others to illegally access voicemails between October 2000 and August 2006. In the dock: from left: Ian Edmondson, Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Clive Goodman, Cheryl Carter, Charlie Brooks and Mark Hanna - their trial is to start today . Controversial: Scotland Yard's actions following the latest cover of the magazine, edited by Ian Hislop, pictured, has led to criticism from press freedom campaigners . Brooks is also charged with conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials. She also faces allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice – one with former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49 – over the alleged removal of material from News International. Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks and former head of security at News International Mark Hanna are also accused of conspiring together to pervert the course of justice. Coulson, David Cameron’s former spin doctor, is also charged with conspiring with the News of the World’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, 56, to commit misconduct in public office. They all deny the charges. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Met asked two vendors to 'consider' taking satirical magazine off sale .

Tragic: Jayne Rowley, 47, pictured here with husband Martin, 45, at their daughter Victoria's wedding two months ago, died after catching malaria in Gambia . A mother-of-two has died after catching malaria while on holiday with her husband at their luxury villa in Gambia. Jayne Rowley, 47, who made regular trips to the west African country over the past two decades, suffered a seizure after the bug attacked 'every organ in her body'. Today her husband Martin Rowley, 45, spoke out about his regret that they did not 'religiously' take their anti-malaria medication. Two days after returning from a 10-day break two weeks ago, the couple were rushed to Blackpool Victoria Hospital for treatment. They had been staying in their three-bedroom holiday home in the Brufut area of Gambia, which they had owned for two years, where they regularly donated football kits and goalposts to local children. But they did not follow medical advice to take tablets at regular intervals throughout the day, and on Wednesday Mrs Rowley - mother to Victoria, 22, and James, 17 - succumbed to the illness. Her devastated husband of 25 years has spoken of the heartbreaking moment he waved his wife goodbye so she could be treated on a different ward before she died from the killer bug. Mr Rowley, 45, from Lytham in Lancashire, said: 'I never thought anything of waving her goodbye at the time because I was still in a bit of a blur. 'We had been bed-ridden and we decided we had better go to hospital to get ourselves checked. 'We thought it must have been something more sinister than flu because I almost couldn’t walk, it was so bad. 'On the way she had a seizure which was horrendous for her. 'I wasn’t able to be by her side because I was being treated.' Mr Rowley said he first started showing flu-like symptoms on November 17 and his wife started feeling ill two days later. He said: 'The only way I can describe it is the worst case of flu you can experience. 'Whereas with flu the headaches get better, in this case they get worse and worse. Regular visits: Mr and Mrs Rowley often visited their villa (pictured) and donated to local communities . Tourist destination: The couple from Lytham, Lancashire, visited Brufut in Gambia (pictured) numerous times . 'It’s like being hit by a sledgehammer every moment of the day.' The following week they went to hospital and Mrs Rowley had a seizure and ended up in intensive care. He was told of his wife’s deteriorating condition in the early hours of Tuesday. She was visited by 35 friends and family members before she died the next day. Mr Rowley said: 'She was just a lovely girl and a good mother to our children. I’m still in a state of shock - I’ll never see her again. 'I don’t think the children will cope with it, they’re struggling.' Before their visit they had not followed health warnings to regularly take anti-malaria medication before, during and after the trip. Mr Rowley said: 'We were never religious with them so we might just have taken a couple of them. Malaria, a tropical, mosquito-borne disease, causes fever and vomiting and can disrupt the blood supply to vital organs if it remains untreated. These symptoms become evident around 10 to 15 days after being bitten. The parasite has become resistant to some treatments and, with no effective vaccine, trying to halt the disease has been limited to controlling mosquitoes, distributing pesticide-laced nets for homes and spraying the indoors of buildings with insecticides - the method known as vector control. At-risk people, including pregnant women and children, can also take antimalarial medications during seasons when the cases of malaria are highest. The CDC points out that no antimalarial drug is 100 per cent protective and should be used in conjunction with other measures like insecticides. Despite efforts, the disease still kills around one million people and leaves more than 200 million sick every year. 'We would be slack with them and just buy them locally in Gambia. 'When I saw her on Tuesday she was completely out of it and didn’t regain consciousness. It attacked every organ in her body. 'We . go back and forward a few times a year. We got complacent. I would . recommend nobody does this as we have learnt by our mistake.' The couple, who have owned and run Carpets of Lytham for many years, began feeling unwell after their return, which he had put down to returning to a cold climate. After being bed ridden for several days they decided to seek medical help. Mr Rowley’s condition has been treated and on Thursday he was discharged from hospital with a course of anti-malaria medication. The couple met when Mr Rowley worked as a barman at the Ship and Royal pub in Lytham, Lancashire. They later married and had two children who are both employed at their parents’ business. Just two months ago, Victoria got married. Mr Rowley said: 'The one thing we said last night was Jayne was at least alive to see Victoria get married, because it was the proudest day of her life.' The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine said only two people died of the disease in the UK last  year. Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite which enters the bloodstream when a person is bitten by the female mosquito. After a few days, the infected person will become very ill and fevered Malaria is a leading cause of illness and death, affecting 300 million people around the globe and resulting in 800,000 deaths a year. Worldwide, a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. Dr Ford, who practises at the tropical medicine school’s travel clinic and is a clinical adviser for the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC), said malaria was treatable with early diagnosis. But she said people needed to take a full course of anti-malaria tablets as part of their travel arrangements to high-risk areas. According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) The Gambia is a major tourist destination for British tourists with more than 60,000 visitors a year accounting for 60 per cent of its tourists.","Jayne Rowley from Lytham in Lancashire suffered a seizure two weeks after holiday with husband to three-bedroom villa in Brufut, Gambia .

Prolific: Robert Knowles, pictured in May, has chalked up his 334th offence - and has been in court every year since 1959 . An unstoppable thief who has been in court an average of three times a year since 1959 has been jailed - for clocking up his 334th crime. Robert Knowles, 66, has broken the law so many times that prosecutors have lost track of his records. The alcoholic is 'institutionalised' and steals to be sent back to jail, a court heard. And this week marked a personal milestone for him - it was his 200th conviction for shoplifting. Knowles, who started his spree aged 13, was caught on Wednesday stealing two boxes of chocolate from Thorntons in Plymouth city centre. Despite him eating the £13 chocolates in the street, a security guard let him off with a warning. So he strolled to a nearby Tesco Metro and walked out with £26 of food - prompting staff to call police. Alan Harris, defending, said: 'He has spent much of the last decade, if not more, in prison. 'I have addressed dozens of benches over the years with a maudlin debate about whether he wants to die in prison.' And in 2011, when Knowles admitted stealing two bottles of whiskey, watches and socks worth £279 from Marks and Spencer, Mr Harris said: 'He recognises himself as institutionalised. 'He can cope very easily with prison but cannot cope very well with the world outside. 'He . would rather be in custody and is resigned to spending the bulk of the . rest of his life there. This is as bleak a plea and mitigation as this . court can ever wish to hear.' Ceaseless: Knowles stole food from a Tesco Metro, pictured, after a Thorntons security guard let him off . Bleak: Plymouth Magistrates' Court, pictured, was told Knowles wants to spend the rest of his life in jail . The Crown Prosecution Service cannot give a full breakdown of his offences because so many of . them they pre-date its creation in 1986. Homeless Knowles was sent to a correctional school at the age of 13 and has been stealing ever since - appearing in court 186 times, including in every single year since 1959. Knowles was last jailed in July for stealing wine, chicken and boxer shorts from Marks and Spencer - but was released four months later. Presiding magistrate Nadine Fletcher jailed Knowles for two months after he admitted both thefts. Knowles has been one of several criminals to win the dubious honour of being named 'Britain's most prolific thief'. Those with an even worse record include Bolton kleptomaniac Harry Hankinson, 64 - who in June blamed his 501 crimes on a blow to the head in 1970 which changed his personality. And in March David Archer, from Prestatyn, North Wales, clocked up his 343rd offence - just edging out competition from Knowles.","Robert Knowles from Plymouth has been in court every year since 1959 .

For Banksy's penultimate piece of his month-long takeover of New York's streets he headed over to Yankee Stadium where he stenciled this wildcat. The work, called Bronx Zoo, is located across the street from the baseball stadium at East 162nd Street and Jermome Avenue. The cat seems to have graffiti tags instead of spots and sits on a yellow line of paint. Wild: Banksy's creation called Bronx Zoo was created by using graffiti tags to make it look like a cheetah's spots . Gothamist pointed out that the work's name may refer to the fact that Yankees earned the name Bronx Zoo between 1972 and 1981 because of the fighting between George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and Reggie Jackson. Yesterday, the artist appeared to be trying to win over the Big Apple by helping to raise money for a local charity with a piece. The elusive artist took a painting from a charity shop and added a seated Nazi officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six-figure sum. He took his cues from The Thomas Crown Affair remake as he purchased a painting from the Housing Works shop on 23rd Street before adding his own spin to the work and donating it back to the same store.

The original landscape picture showed sun breaking through clouds above an unspecified mountain range by a river in the woods. Banksy then added a Nazi officer with his back facing the viewer, sitting on a bench looking at the scene. As verification, the artist posted a picture of the work to his website where he chronicles his daily contribution to New York's art scene. He titled the work 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil' on his website. He also added his signature beneath that of the original artist, K. Sager. Banksy bought this painting from a charity shop and then added the Nazi officer and signed his signature below that of the original artist, titling his new piece 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil' A spokesperson from Housing Works has confirmed the sale and said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the painting. The charity, which is dedicated to helping end homelessness and those living with HIV/Aids, received a call confirming the Banksy connection on Tuesday. It is being sold via an online charity aution website. It was initially listed Tuesday evening with a starting price of $76,000 according to The Village Voice. As of 11pm local time, it was already up to $201,200. Drawing a crowd: Throughout the day on Tuesday, spectators began to realize that the picture hanging in the charity shop window was actually made by the famed graffiti artist .

House prices surged by 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November, marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years, Nationwide has reported. Prices have been rising every month for the last year and the latest monthly increase of 0.6 per cent took average UK house values to £174,566. The annual increase is the strongest seen since July 2010, but Nationwide said that despite the strong pick-up in the housing market, prices are still around 6 per cent below an all-time high recorded in 2007. Boom time: House prices rose 6.5 per cent year-on-year in November, marking the fastest annual increase seen in more than three years . On the up: Prices have been rising every month for the last year and the latest monthly increase of 0.6 per cent took average UK house values to £174,566, but that is still around 6% lower than the all-time high in 2007 . Yesterday, the Bank of England took the first step in putting the brakes on the surging property market as it scrapped an initiative that has had a significant part to play in encouraging mortgage lending. Governor Mark Carney said the Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) stimulus was no longer needed amid rising house prices, and it would instead be focused on helping small business borrowing, which remains muted. Funding for Lending has offered lenders access to cheap finance on condition that they pass on the benefits to borrowers, and experts yesterday said that the Bank's move could spell the 'beginning of the end' for ultra-cheap mortgage deals. Fears of a looming property bubble have been growing in recent months amid a string of reports suggesting demand in the housing market far outstrips the growth in the supply of homes. Scaling back: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney (pictured) said the Funding for Lending scheme stimulus was no longer needed due to rising house prices . London in particular has seen strong demand this year, and Land Registry figures released yesterday showed that house prices in London were up by 8.7 per cent year-on-year in October. But the market remains patchy and prices in the North East have dropped by 3.1 per cent year-on-year, the Land Registry figures showed. The Government's new Help to Buy scheme, which offers state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent was launched in October. This is expected to inject further activity into the market among credit-worthy buyers who have particularly struggled to get on the housing ladder or move up it since the financial crisis struck because they have a lack of upfront funds. Lenders representing around two-thirds of the mortgage market have committed to coming on board the scheme and there are also signs of competition increasing to attract low-deposit borrowers from lenders which are outside the Help to Buy scheme. Huge divide: In contrast to rising values in London, much of the rest of the country has seen scant growth . Residential property prices in the capital continue to outpace the national average . Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that a large part of the uplift in the housing market is also down to improvements in the labour market and the brighter economic outlook, which has helped to bolster sentiment amongst potential buyers. He also highlighted the impact that low mortgage rates have had on borrowers' costs. Mr Gardner said: 'Mortgage rates have declined significantly from the already low levels prevailing last year. 'For example, Bank of England data indicates that the interest rate on two-year fixed-rate mortgages for those with a 10 per cent deposit has fallen from 5.6 per cent to 4.4 per cent over the past 12 months. 'For a buyer purchasing the typical UK home over 25 years, this equates to a reduction in monthly payments of around £110 (£1,320 per year) at the current average house price.' Boom: But the Bank of England has been criticised for sending out 'mixed messages' People are taking out mortgages at the fastest rate since before the financial crash, according to the Bank of England. October saw 67,701 home mortgages approved - the most in any month since February 2008. The deals, worth £10.5 billion, have led to fears of a new property bubble. Another 35,261 remortgaging deals worth . £5.3 billion were approved in October, above the average of 33,800. To combat the rise the bank is changing the terms on one of its main credit schemes, Funding for Lending, to focus more on helping small businesses. Matthew Pointon, a property analyst at Capital Economics, criticised the Bank of England for sending out mixed messages by trying to cool the market just as Help to Buy expands. 'There have been some tortuous attempts to explain how all these policies fit together, but the end result is a bit of a mess,' he said. 'That could in itself serve to confuse potential buyers, and that may hold them back from jumping into the housing market.' However, the bank's figures also showed people are more cautious about personal debt in the run-up to Christmas. Consumer credit grew by £457 million in October, halving from a £1.1 billion rise the previous month. The rise in personal loans and overdrafts of £219 million was also a sharp fall from September's . five-and-a-half year high of £935 million.","Prices have been rising every month for the last year, Nationwide says .

Sexism has become so rife in everyday life that 75 per cent of schoolgirls say they are sexually harassed, while one in five 7-year-olds admit to having gone on a diet to conform to body image pressure. Young women are bombarded with sexism - from being shouted at the in the street, to feeling pressured into losing weight, to experiencing hypocritical double standards in their sexual behaviour, a Girlguiding report warned. Girls aged 11 to 21 are as likely to have been harassed at school as on the street, the survey found. Young women also feel that their behaviour is judged by different standards to boys – 76 per cent say that girls are judged harshly for sexual behaviour that is deemed acceptable in boys. But sexual harassment was not confined to unpleasant comments - the survey found the pressure of body image also damaged girls' self-esteem and confidence, and affected youngsters from the age of seven. Among 11-to 21-year-olds, 80 per cent think there is too much discussion about women’s weight in the media and 71 per cent say they would like to lose weight. Worrying, a fifth of girls of primary school age (7- to 11-year-olds) say they have been on a diet. Girls also feel that their behaviour is judged by different standards to boys – 76 per cent say that girls are judged harshly for sexual conduct that is seen as acceptable in boys.

Seven out of ten girls aged 13 and over report further experiences of sexual harassment at school or college.

'Sexual harassment is . commonplace, girls' appearance is intensively scrutinised and their . abilities are undermined', a report from Girlguiding UK warns. The report Equality for Girls is based on a survey of more than 1,200 girls and young women aged seven to 21. Girlguiding UK chief executive Julie Bentley said it was a 'wake-up call' and that the issue urgently needed to be addressed. 'This cannot be dismissed as something that girls and young women just have to deal with as they grow up,' she said. Girls needed to live in an equal society if they were to flourish and fulfil their potential to be leaders in all walks of life, added Ms Bentley. Ms Bentley said: 'The findings show that girls feel that they experience high levels of sexism in their everyday lives - at school, online and in the media - and that this has a negative imapct on girls' confidence, wellbeing and, too often, their aspirations. 'Girls recognise that these inequalities are likely to have an impact on their future opportunities and curtail their choices. The survey of a representative sample of girls and young women, both Guides and non-Guides, gives 'a disturbing insight into the state of equality for girls in the UK', says Girlguiding UK, which has more than half a million members.","Girls and young women experience shocking levels of everyday sexism and discrimination at school, on the street, online and in the media .

A lesbian forklift truck driver has been awarded £7,500 damages after her boss bombarded her with pornography and made crude comments about her sex life. Coleen Rowntree won a discrimination claim after relief chargehand Steven Evans repeatedly switched on the Babe Channel at work and asked her about sex. She told an employment tribunal that Mr Evans continually made remarks about her sexuality when she was the only woman on the Knauf shopfloor at night. She said: 'He nearly always puts the Babe Channel programme on the television showing women’s private parts and makes digs and comments about it to me often with an audience.' Ms Rowntree, 47, told the hearing he made rude comments while watching the TV show relating to her sexual activity with her female partner and asked what she would do with the women on the telly. She said: 'It showed women and women having sex as well as men and women having sex.' He asked what sex toys she used and if she would be having sex at the weekend. When a potential employee was being shown round Ms Rowntree said Mr Evans could not make out if it was a 'lad or a lass.' He asked her 'is she one of you then?' and when Ms Rowntree inquired what he meant he replied 'bats for the other side.' Ms Rowntree said he repeatedly called her a 'd***head' on the radio and that 'a Lottery win for the claimant would be a win for him because she would leave.' Ms Rowntree, 47, told the hearing her colleague made rude comments while watching the TV show relating to her sexual activity with her female partner . When another worker said he had something for Ms Rowntree in his car Mr Evans replied: 'I hope it is a noose.' She also said Mr Evans called another male employee, who was not homosexual, 'gay boy' or 'Phyllis' which she thought was a dig at her. The Leeds tribunal partly upheld her complaint of discrimination on the grounds of her sexual orientation and awarded her damages for injury to feelings. They said having to watch the Babe Channel show and suffer comments from Mr Evans was 'unwanted' conduct. 'I felt dirty, distressed and belittled for being gay'Coleen Rowntree . 'It had the effect of violating her dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating and offensive environment for the claimant,' said Employment Judge John Trayler. Ms Rowntree, from Grimsby, made her claim against building materials supplier Knauf UK earlier this year. She told a remedy hearing that the bullying had a major impact on her health. 'I was going through hell,' she said. 'The pressure Steve was putting me through left me suicidal. If I had got a gun I would have shot him.' She was happy in the job but had problems with Mr Evans. 'I lived with a woman. I’m gay. I was taunted for a long time. I was bullied by a bloke for my sexuality.' The agency worker quit Knauf in April, 2011 after working at the Immingham site for more than two years when she said she could take no more and was then sacked for smoking, which was against company policy. Ms Rowntree claimed her long-term partner later walked out on her because of her troubles at work. The agency worker quit Knauf in April, 2011 after working at the Immingham site for more than two years . She would go home and break down and relate what she was going through to her partner. 'She was the one taking it all. If she had been a fella she would have sorted him out at the gate,' she said. She had been left 'heartbroken and hysterical' at the split in February, 2012 and tried to hang herself. 'I felt dirty, distressed and belittled for being gay,' she said. 'I began to worry about my sexuality. I realised I was gay in my late teens but I began to think that I should find a boyfriend and be like everyone else. 'I was going downhill fast.' Her solicitor Rob Childe told the hearing: 'This strikes at the heart of her identity. She didn’t want to talk about being a lesbian with her work colleagues. She was made to feel ashamed of her sexuality.' He said despite an internal investigation the perpetrator Mr Evans had gone unpunished. Nick Cooksey, for the company, said Ms Rowntree had not referred to her relationship breakdown in her initial statement to the tribunal and there was no evidence to say it was because of events at work. Despite visiting her GP she had not complained about her problems at work and she got another job within a month of leaving Knauf. 'There was a culture of banter and strong exchanges at work and she gave as good as she got,' he said. A spokesman for Knauf said: 'Knauf seeks to maintain the highest standard of conduct and considers equality and diversity to be an important element of its business. 'We have a hardworking and loyal workforce at Knauf with no finding of any discrimination complaints prior to this issue in 2011 or subsequently. 'Although many of the complaints made by Coleen Rowntree were not upheld we regret that the Tirbunal found evidence of sexual orientation discrimination. 'The company has ensured all lessons learnt will enable us to continue to provide a free workplace free from discrimination.' Lawyers for the company said they did not accept that she was bombarded with pornography, and that he only allegedly made some comments while watching a non-subscription adult channel on a handful of occasions.","Coleen Rowntree won a discrimination claim after colleague Steven Evans  made crude comments about sex and played pornography at work .

The mystery buyer who paid a record £89million for Francis Bacon's Three Studies Of Lucian Freud is a member of the Qatari royal family dubbed the most powerful woman in art, it was claimed today. Speculation has been rife about the identity of the successful bidder after the triptych last week made history by becoming the most expensive work of art ever to be sold at auction. Today, the latest name to emerge is that of Sheikha Mayassa, the sister of the emir of Qatar who has  around $1billion a year to spend on art in her role as head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA).

Famed artist: Bacon is one of America's most famed painters. Two of his other works of art are shown left and right . Bacon (1909-1992) was born in Dublin to English parents and moved to London in 1926. Although . he had no formal training as an artist, he started to exhibit his work . in the 1930s and a decade later his angst-ridden paintings of twisted and . mutated forms became a sensation in the artistic community. He died of a heart attack in Madrid in 1992. Today, his work is among the most popular of 20th-century art at auction. In May, Christie's achieved the highest total in the history of auctions when it sold $495 million worth of art at its postwar and contemporary sale. The auction house said Bacon's three-paneled work, which depicts the Dublin-born painter's friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud on a chair, with a view from each side and one face on, was 'a true masterpiece that marks Bacon and Freud's relationship' and their 'creative and emotional kinship.' 'The juxtaposition of radiant sunshine yellow contrasting with the brutal physicality and immediacy of the brushstrokes in this celebrated life-size triptych is what makes Bacon's art so remarkable,' said Francis Outred, the head of European postwar and contemporary art for Christie's. 'This suddenly becomes a very important conversation between two masters,' Outred said in an interview. He noted that Three Studies Of Lucian Freud is one of only two existing full-length triptychs of Freud, a grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, and that the three panels were separated for 15 years in the 1970s before being reunited. Christie's also offering a Warhol Coca-Cola, which carries an estimate of $40 million to $60 million, and a sculpture by Jeff Koons, Balloon Dog (Orange) expected to fetch $35 million to $55 million. On Wednesday, Sotheby's will try to break the $71.7 million record price for a Warhol when if offers the monumental Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), which has an estimated sale price of $60 million to $80 million.","Sister of emir of Qatar reportedly bought Three Studies Of Lucian Freud .

With its Union flag roof, painting of the Battle of Waterloo on the side and portrait of the Queen at her Coronation emblazoned on the bonnet, this car needs a seriously patriotic buyer. Artist Paul Karslake bought the 1990 Bentley Mulsanne and then customised it with paintings of some of the most glorious moments in British history. Now the one-of-a-kind car is up for auction in Weybridge, Surrey, where it is expected to sell for at least £15,000.

Mr Karslake, 55, brother of Ronnie Wood's ex-wife Jo, chose to paint wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill on the boot, alongside scenes from the Battle of Britain and the Falklands War. The car's rear pillar carries a portrait of the Duke of Wellington with scenes of the Battle of Waterloo along the off-side rear wings. And the near-side rear pillar includes a portrait of Admiral Nelson together with scenes of the Battle of Trafalgar. The entire roof is adorned with a dramatic rendering of the Union flag with a Second World War Lancaster bomber flying over it. In addition to the dramatic portraits, the Bentley's front wings feature scenes from the First World War along with the poignant addition of poppies over the wheel arches. Eccentric Mr Karslake is better known for his portraits of the likes of Keith Richards and The Kray Twins. Mr Karslake says he is 'sick and tired of wishy-washy art' and wanted to do something 'concise and patriotic' He said: 'I am sick and tired of wishy-washy art.

A former IRA terrorist who injured 200 people when he blew up a car bomb at the Old Bailey has been criticised for writing a book about escaping from the notorious Maze prison. Gerry Kelly, who is now a politician in Northern Ireland and Sinn Fein's spokesman on policing, was one of the ringleaders of the 1983 prison break and has been accused of shooting a guard in the head. Now he has published a book to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the escape, prompting critics to claim that he is 'glorifying terrorism' and has a 'twisted mind'. Memoir: Gerry Kelly, pictured left as a politician and right during his terrorist days, has written a book about escaping from HMP Maze in 1983 . Escape: Mr Kelly and 37 other prisoners broke out of the Maze, pictured, in September 1983 . During a new interview, Mr Kelly refused to deny that he shot the guard, admitting that he pointed a gun at him and said: 'Do not move or I will shoot you.' The 60-year-old became an IRA militant when he was just a teenager, and played a crucial part in the bombing of the Old Bailey in 1973. One person was killed and nearly 200 injured when a car bomb went off outside Britain's top criminal court, in the City of London. Mr Kelly was arrested and sentenced to life in prison over the bombing, and joined dozens of other IRA members on hunger strike in HMP Maze, near Belfast. But on September 25 1983, he and 37 other prisoners escaped from the top-security facility, killing one guard and injuring 20 during the break-out. Return: The former bomber leaving the Maze in 1999 after meeting with IRA prisoners to discuss disarmament during the peace process . Unapologetic: Mr Kelly, pictured next to an IRA member at a republican event, has refused to say sorry for his role in the Maze prison break . In his new book, The Escape, Mr Kelly . write of the moment he confronted a prison officer, pointing a gun at . him and saying: 'Do not move or I will shoot you.' Two . shots were fired at the guard - one of which hit him in the head, . although he survived the shooting - and the official report into the . escape named Mr Kelly as the gunman. Book: Mr Kelly is publishing this memoir about the prison break at the Maze . This week he told the Independent: 'There were two shots fired. There was myself and others there, so clearly it was a prisoner who shot him. But that is as far as I will go.' Although he insists he has now renounced violence, he said that 'the struggle has to be defended', and described the Maze escape as 'a very proud moment'. The chairman of Northern Ireland's Prison Officers' Association said that Mr Kelly's actions were not 'something he should be proud of', and accused him of re-opening old wounds. 'I don't think it's something he should be proud of – that he shot a prison officer in the head in an attempt to escape,' Finlay Spratt told the News Letter. He added that prison officers had 'come to get used to these boys glorifying their terrorism', adding: 'If they say they're wanting to move on and put the past behind them, then they shouldn't be bringing up these acts of terrorism in the past.' Unionist politicians reacted with fury to the news of Mr Kelly's book and called on him to apologise for the break-out. 'This is not something in any way worthy of celebration,' said Jonathan Craig, who represents the Democratic Unionist Party on the Northern Ireland Policing Board. 'Rather Gerry Kelly should be apologising to the victims and their families. 'It is clear to everyone, even those who would be sympathetic to nationalism, that Gerry Kelly has a twisted mind when it comes to the past and the events of the Troubles.' Carnage: The scene outside the Old Bailey in London following a car bomb detonated by Mr Kelly . Mike Nesbitt, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said that Mr Kelly was 're-traumatising many families' with his memoir. 'For . his victims, his book isn't ""a great yarn"", but instead a nightmare . relived,' he told the Belfast Telegraph. 'He can write as many books as . he likes, but he won't rewrite history.' But Mr Kelly told the Independent: 'I've tried to do what I did with integrity. People might baulk at that, but I think I've come through life with some integrity. 'You might think everything the IRA did was wrong, but I don't.' Following the Maze escape, he was recaptured in the Netherlands and extradited to Britain, but was released in 1989. He was considered a key point of contact between the IRA and Northern Irish politicians during the peace process, and was elected to represent Belfast North in the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998. Mr Kelly is now Sinn Fein's spokesman for policing and justice, and sits on the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Forbidding: The entrance to HMP Maze in County Antrim, site of the 1983 escape . The escape from HMP Maze on September 25, 1983, was described at the time by Margaret Thatcher as 'the gravest in our prison history'. The jail in Country Antrim, nine miles from Belfast, was notorious for housing paramilitary prisoners, and was regarded by many IRA members as a symbol of repression. Many of the most feared terrorists were held in the specially constructed 'H-Blocks', where hunger strikes and 'dirty protests' became common. Although the Maze was supposed to be the most secure prison in Europe, officers had apparently grown complacent in the months before the break-out after Gerry Kelly and other prisoners pretended to start co-operating. Using six guns which had been smuggled in to the facility, IRA members took their guards hostage, preventing them from raising the alarm. The prisoners then took over part of the jail and took the officers' uniforms, subsequently comandeering a lorry which was delivering supplies to the prison and using it to drive to the outer fence. Although officers fought back, 38 prisoners made it past the fence and fled into the surrounding countryside as it took authorities nearly two hours to bring the Maze back under control. 20 prison guards were injured in the escape by being shot, stabbed or beaten, while officer James Ferris collapsed and died after he was stabbed with a chisel. Half of the escapees were caught within two days of the break-out, but most of the others made it to the IRA stronghold of South Armagh and were offered the chance to build a new life in America. Some - including Mr Kelly - were recaptured and returned to prison, while others were killed in clashes with British troops, but several escaped the authorities and two have never been tracked down at all.","Gerry Kelly, 60, bombed the Old Bailey in 1973 and led the escape from HMP Maze in 1983 .

New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan says the Roman Catholic Church has been 'outmarketed' on the issue of gay marriage and has been 'caricatured as being anti-gay' Dolan discussed the church's positions opposing same-sex marriage and abortion in an interview with 'Meet the Press' moderator David Gregory that will air Sunday on NBC. Gregory noted that Illinois just became the latest U.S. state to legalize gay marriage and asked, 'Regardless of the church teachings, do you think this is evolving in such a way that it's ultimately going to be legal everywhere?' Cardinal Timothy Dolan will not give up on the gay marriage issue and cannot support the Affordable Health Care Act because it would cover the cost of an abortion . Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn acknowledges the applause after legalizing gay marriage . Or, he asked, will there be 'a backlash' against gay marriage? 'I think I'd be a Pollyanna to say that there doesn't seem to be kind of a stampede to do this,' Dolan said. 'I regret that.' Asked why the church is losing the argument on gay marriage, Dolan responded, 'Well, I think maybe we've been outmarketed sometimes. We've been caricatured as being anti-gay.'

Stacey Rambold, 54, was originally sentenced to just 30 days for allegedly grooming a troubled 14-year-old student for sex . Prosecutors in Montana are fighting to get a former teacher back behind bars after a judge sentenced him to just one month in prison for raping a 14-year-old girl who later committed suicide. Stacey Dean Rambold, 54, was sentenced in August after he pleaded guilty and he was released from prison on probation the following next month. The verdict of Judge Todd Baugh drew fierce criticism after he ruled that the victim, Cherice Morales, was more mature than her age and 'just as in control' of the relationship as the teacher. That statement was mentioned in Friday's appeal filing by prosecutors. The filing by the Montana Attorney General's Office said the sentencing by the district court did not meet the state's mandatory minimum sentence, reports CNN. ‘The circumstance of a 47-year-old teacher having sexual intercourse with his 14-year-old student is precisely such a circumstance warranting a mandatory minimum sentence,’ the court document said. Prosecutors said the 10-year-prison sentence they had pushed for at trial would still be appropriate. The Montana Attorney General's Office filed its appeal with the state Supreme Court. It is unclear when that appeal will be answered. Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice Morales killed herself . Less than a month after his original sentence, Baugh admitted that he had made a mistake and tried to change his verdict. But the state Supreme Court barred him from a new ruling, saying he didn't have the legal standing to change a sentence. Baugh has also tried to apologize for statements he made during the trial. 'I made some references to the victim's age and control,' he told CNN affiliate KTVQ. 'I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say at that point, but it didn't come out correct. What I said was demeaning to all women, not what I believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing.' Rambold was arrested in 2008 after police and administrators at Billings Senior High School learned that he had targeted 14-year-old Cherice, a troubled freshman at the school, and groomed her for sex. Defense: Judge Todd Baugh, pictured, was forced to apologize for remarks he made during the case. 'What I said was demeaning to all women, not what I believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing,' he said . The school district had warned Rambold . four years earlier to avoid touching or being alone with female . students, it was later revealed. The district paid Cherice's mother . $96,000 as part of a wrongful death settlement. The . teacher, who was then 49, was charged with three counts of sexual . intercourse without consent and prosecutors allege he had an ongoing . sexual relationship with the girl. Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice killed herself. The girl's mother, Auliea Hanlon, says that Rambold's sexual abuse was a 'major factor' in her daughter's suicide. Following the girl's death, prosecutors were forced to defer prosecution. They agreed to dismiss the case if Rambold admitted to one count of rape and agreed to enter a three-stage sex offender treatment program. Rambold, 54, faces another 10 years in prison after the Attorney General's Office filed an appeal on Friday . Her fault? Judge Todd Baugh ruled that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' and that in listening to the girl's police interviews, he came to believe that she was in control of the relationship with her teacher . In December, prosecutors revived the . case and re-filed charges after they learned that the teacher had been . kicked out of the program for having unsupervised visits with minors. Rambold's . defense lawyer said those minors were his family members.The attorney . said Rambold was attending another treatment program and was considered a . low risk to re-offend. Judge Baugh, 66, seemed to agree. He said that the former teacher's violations at the sex offender treatment program were not enough to warrant prosecution. He also said that when he reviewed taped police interviews with Cherice and concluded that even though she was 35 years younger than Rambold and clearly troubled, she was 'as much in control of the situation' as the teacher. Judge Baugh also said that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' - which mitigated Rambold's crimes. Cherice Hanlon's mother, stormed out of the courtroom when the judge handed down the ruling and shouted 'You people suck!' at the judge. Fury: Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's mother, said Judge Baugh resorted to 'blaming the victim' and pointed out that her daughter wasn't even old enough to drive a car .","Cherice Morales was a troubled 14-year-old high school freshman when teacher Stacey Dean Rambold, then 49, groomed her for sex .

Celebrations: Auburn fans roll Toomer's Corner following a win over Alabama in an NCAA college football game in Auburn . 'Team of destiny': The hero of the night, Chris Davis, who scored the winning touchdown, says they 'won't take no for an answer' The Iron Bowl is college football rivalry game played annually by the football teams of the two largest public universities in Alabama, the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn University Tigers. The series is considered one of the best and most hard-fought rivalries in all of sports. As the rivalry was mainly played in Birmingham, Alabama, for many years, the name of the Iron Bowl comes from Birmingham's historic role in the steel industry. Auburn has always been the underdog as Alabama leads the series 42–35–1. Davis caught the ball about 9 yards deep in the end zone after freshman Adam Griffith's 57-yard attempt fell short. He then sprinted down the left sideline and cut back with nothing but teammates around him in a second straight hard-to-fathom finish for the Tigers (11-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference). ‘I knew when I caught the ball I would have room to run,’ Davis said. ‘I knew they would have big guys on the field to protect on the field goal. ‘When I looked back, I said, ""I can't believe this"".' Auburn clinched a spot in the SEC championship game with the stunning victory over the powerhouse from across the state. The Crimson Tide (11-1, 7-1) several times seemed poised to continue its run toward the first three-peat in modern college football, but couldn't put the Tigers away. Overjoyed: Fans celebrate in Toomer's Corner after the game between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn Tigers at Jordan Hare Stadium. The Tigers defeated the Crimson Tide 34-28 .

'Stared from the bottom': Auburn mascot Aubie celebrates following a win over Alabama in the Iron Bowl game on Saturday . Yay! Auburn fans throw toilet paper into the air to celebrate their win . Asked if it was the biggest win of his career, Tigers coach Gus Malzahn said: ‘It ranks right up there.’ But he said he'd ‘probably’ still celebrate just like he has since his high school coaching days: With a Waffle House meal. ‘That's what you coach for, that's what these kids play for, to get a chance to win the SEC championship,’ Malzahn said. The Tigers put it away just when . overtime on tap. The public address announcer in the stadium had already . declared the game 28-28 at the end of regulation. But Alabama got 1 second restored and one more play after a review of T.J. Yeldon's run to the Auburn 39. That . gave the Tide coach Nick Saban a chance to try the long field goal - . and now he probably wished he never did, given the stunning result. ‘It was a great game,’ Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron said. ‘Sometimes luck just isn't on your side. ‘It's . one of those crazy plays. It's almost like a video game. That's . something you do on Madden or NCAA. It's just a wild play.’ Still celebrating: People are seen still in good spirits and hanging around after the game to celebrate their drastic win . 'One of those crazy plays': Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron said the last-minute Auburn win was almost like a video game.

It . lived up to the billing - and then some. According to NCAA records, it . was only the fourth time that a missed field goal was returned for 100 . yards. This finale even one-upped Auburn's last-gasp win over Georgia two weeks earlier. A deflected 73-yard touchdown pass from Nick Marshall to Ricardo Louis dubbed ""The Immaculate Deflection"" with 25 seconds left set up only the second top-five Iron Bowl matchup and first since 1971. A team that went 3-9 last season and had been destroyed by Alabama 91-14 combined the past two seasons will play for an SEC title and perhaps a trip to the BCS championship game. Touchdown! Auburn Tigers cornerback Chris Davis (11) runs the game-winning touchdown against the Alabama Crimson Tide at Jordan Hare Stadium . Undefeated Ohio State, which was third in the BCS standings this week and figures to move up to second behind Florida State, will have something to say about which teams play for the national title, too. No doubt the Buckeyes, who won their own thriller against Michigan earlier in the day, were celebrating Auburn's win almost as much as the Tigers. But the Tigers were already making a case to jump the Buckeyes.

Right size: Laura Harold 33, was chosen to stand in for Saoirse Ronan, 19, because they have almost identical figures . For any woman, being told you look half your age is as good as it can get. But it's just in a day's work for Laura Harold of South Wales, who was cast to stand in for a 19-year-old Hollywood beauty. Harold appears in How I Live Now, in place of screen siren Saoirse Ronan. Miss Harold was picked by the film's casting agent to appear in stunts and a naked dream scene, such is her likeness to the teenage actress. She beat other younger candidates to film the low-budget adaption of Meg Rosoff's novel. Saoirse, star of Lovely Bones and Atonement, spent time with Laura on set so she could master the actresses walk and mannerisms. Miss Harold said: 'It was lucky that I fit the measurements needed to play Saoirse's character. In fact my waist is a little smaller. 'Friends say how lucky I am to play a 19-year-old at my age. I am naturally petite but it is a massive compliment to fill in for a Hollywood actress. I keep myself fit but don't have any special diet.

Proud mum: Miss Harold has not let her acting get in the way of starting a family. She is pictured here with her partner Michael Taylor and their baby son Torin . 'She is young and we messed about, of course, but when it was time to work she really got her head down. 'It was great fun to party with the cast and blow off some steam. I felt like one of the gang during my time filming. 'I had a chauffeur and was very well looked after. The project was low budget and we were tight for time so I came in as Saoirse's body double because she couldn't be in two places at once.' The actress, a trim size eight, filmed in London and Wales last year - and has since had a baby son Torin, now 21 weeks. But she has managed to get her trim figure back. Her nude scene is part of dream sequence in the movie - and Laura said the film crew were 'very kind and considerate' during the filming. She said carpenter partner Michael Taylor, 40, wasn't jealous of her baring all for the film's audience. She said: 'He's very supportive of everything I do and proud of me too.

The cause of a fatal crash that killed the 21-year-old daughter of an Ohio sports presenter in September is still a mystery, police say. Maria Tiberi hit the back of a truck at about 11pm on September 17, but tests have proved she had not been using her phone and had no alcohol or drugs in her system. An investigation found no sign that the daughter of WBNS-TV anchor Dom Tiberi had applied her brakes and she had not been driving erratically. Loved: Tiberi shared this photograph of himself and his daughter Maria, who died in September . 'It is believed that a momentary lapse of . attention or an unknown distraction was the probable cause of the . accident,' investigators told the Columbus Dispatch. Her father is now campaigning to make young drivers more aware of the dangers of being distracted behind the wheel. He has set up the Maria Tiberi Foundation to encourage better defensive driving.

Made by the Queen's jeweller, designed by the nation's favourite chocolatier, this 22-carat golden egg dazzled Britain in 1983. Created for a giant egg hunt, the 'Creme Egg mystery Conundrum', it sent hundreds of hopeful winners into a frenzy, searching for cryptic clues all over the country. The hunters were asked to locate a casket containing a certificate, entitling them to claim the valuable prize. Rare: TV antiques expert David Harper marvelled at the egg made by the Queen's jeweller in 1983 . However the competition proved so popular that it had to be called off before all the caskets had been found after thousands of people started digging up private land and historic sites. This egg, made by Garrard and Co, jewellers to the Queen, was called The Burning Hand. It was the tenth out of 12 made for the competition and was found buried in the grass verge of the A66, west of Bowes in County Durham. Treasure: Another egg (left), this one found near a cemetery on the Isle of Man, was sold last year. The eggs were given out as a prize for a 1983 Cadburys Creme Egg Easter competition the country 'went mad for' The man that found it, who wishes to remain anonymous, scoured the clues in the specially-made book and worked the egg was nearby. The three-inch collectible has been in his possession ever since. Now, he has decided to sell it. TV antiques expert David Harper said: 'The country went mad for the competition and it ran out of control. The chap who found the casket said he literally tripped over it. 'It's been in his possession ever since.' The egg will be entered into a specialist sale of 20th Century goods which will be held in Cheshire on January 28-29. Its estimated value is between £6,000 and £8,000, but its colourful history could see that figure doubled, experts claim. Last year, another of the collection - found in a cemetery - was sold on the Isle of Man. Ellis Finch, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'It is a solid gold egg that is hollow inside and the surface has been chased and enamelled extremely skilfully.' The Isle of Man egg was the 12th mystery in the book and the cryptic tour ended at Maugold (more gold) churchyard.

Topless barber: 46-year-old Loveland, Colorado resident Suzette Hall was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion of cutting hair without a license and felony criminal impersonation. Witnesses told police she gives topless haircuts . A 46-year-old grandmother in Loveland, Colorado was arrested earlier this week after allegedly offering topless hair cuts. Since authorities couldn't find evidence of the Craigslist ads offering nude barbering services, Suzette Hall was arrested for practicing without a license and felony criminal impersonation. But friends of Hall say she was wrongly accused as part of a ploy by her ex-husband and ex-business partner who wanted her behind bars. Authorities started investigating Hall when a series of checks bounced for chair rentals at a salon on the 2200 block of Main Street in Longmont, according to the Longmont Times-Call. It turned out the checks hadn't been signed by Hall, so it was difficult to peg her for check fraud, but she wasn't off the hook. Police soon found out that Hall was practicing as a hair stylist in Longmont without a license, after being previously ordered to stop working in 2008 for the same reason. In addition to illegal hairstyling in Longmont, Hall opened a hair salon called Rebel Beauty in nearby Johnstown with a business partner. But Hall soon left the salon when her co-owner, a woman named Anne, objected to certain business practices. Witnesses told police that Hall started 'charging $45 for topless haircuts and is advertising on Craigslist'. Police were unable to find the Craigslist advertisements, but it is possible that they were flagged and purged. The accusation is interesting considering a picture Hall posted to her Facebook in August. Salon uniform: Hall posted a picture on Facebook which made it seem as if she were wearing nothing. In the caption she wrote that she 'decided to wear nothing but flowers to work today' In the picture, Hall appears to be wearing nothing, and covers herself up with bouquet of flowers. 'Soooo frckn hot today...decided to wear nothing but flowers to work today...P.S. Never wear thorny roses,' she wrote. Once Anne found out about the topless haircuts, their business relationship deteriorated. Police say Anne was 'not comfortable with this and she did not want to have topless haircuts in her business because she is a single mother and...she did not believe this was safe and proper'. But topless haircuts may have just been the tip of the iceberg. Anne believes Hall went so far as to solicit sex from male customers after noticing a strange man come into the salon, and finding used condoms in the trash later. Prostitution allegations: Hall co-owned and operated a salon in Johnstown before being pushed out by her business partner who believes she was soliciting money for sex from their male customers . Anne told police that Hall admitted to accepting payment for sex, sometimes going on 'house calls'. Divorce: Hall's ex-husband told police that she started advertising her services on Craigslist after leaving the salon. Their break-up must have been recent, as she posted this picture of 'My husband!' to Facebook in early October . Eventually, Hall agreed to leave the business and started working freelance as a stylist in Loveland. Her ex-husband told police that she advertised her services on Craigslist as the 'Rebel Barber' claiming that her license 'was in the mail' and that she had also a applied for 'a nude license of hairstylists'. No such license exists, police confirmed with state regulators. Hall's break-up with her husband seems to be relatively new. On October 4, she posted a picture of him on her Facebook calling her husband 'one hot Roughneck'. Friends say Hall was the target . of a 'witch hunt' orchestrated by her ex-husband and business . partner who 'got together and lied to police and tried to get her . arrested'. A . man named Jason claiming to be Hall's friend wrote on her Facebook, . saying that her business is legal as you don't need to have a hair . styling license to own and operate a salon. 'To . her friends and family...I'm going to clear her name and all this . slander,' Jason wrote. 'To Ked Hall and Anne as well as all the haters . out there...F*** you... stay turned folks I'm gonna bust this s*** wide . open...don't f*** with an American soldier.' Witch hunt: A man named Jason claiming to be Hall's friend posted on her Facebook, saying she was innocent and he would prove it . Hall has a pretty lengthy record with nine previous felony convictions including identity theft, motor vehicle theft, felony theft and possession of a weapon by a previous offender. She also has a misdemeanor record.

Adam Clayton, from Darlington, was named player of the year last year but was devastated when new safety rules barred him from matches. The under-9s player is too young to wear contact lenses so his mother Emma, 33, bought the sports goggles - but they are still banned under the rules, which rugby chiefs admit are unfair. Fed up: Adam Clayton, 9, was told he can no longer play rugby, despite his mother buying him special goggles . Mrs Clayton accused the the Rugby Football Union . (RFU) and International Rugby Coard (IRB) of discriminating against players with poor eyesight. 'Adam loves rugby,' she added. 'He won player of the . year last year and he has a big trophy that he's so proud of, but now . he's been told that he can't play.

The goggles are allowed for non-contact rugby and for under-8s, but not for children any older. Mrs Clayton added she has been told Adam will be able to take part in training, but not full matches. The regulations ban players from having rigid materials on their faces because they can be a danger to themselves or people they tackle. Several parents have complained to the RFU, which is now trying to revoke the policy. A statement by the RFU said: 'Players of all age grades are permitted to wear spectacles, glasses or specifically designed sports goggles in all forms of non-contact rugby but not in any form of contact rugby. 'This means that under-9s and above are not permitted to wear any eye wear when playing contact rugby. 'The RFU recognises that this prohibition is not socially inclusive and creates difficulties for children with impaired eyesight who are not yet able to wear contact lenses. 'For these reasons, the RFU is talking to the IRB to permit under-12s and below to wear sports goggles, subject to certain conditions.

The mother of a 14-year-old schoolgirl who killed herself after being targeted by internet bullies, held a teenager captive for four hours during which she stabbed him and threatened to slit his throat. Tracey Tompkins told terrified Niall Hirrell she would put him in a body bag and bury him at Gilroes Cemetery, Glenfield, Leics, where 'nobody would find him'. At the end of his four-hour ordeal, Niall, who has learning difficulties, was forced to walk the streets naked and bleeding from multiple injuries. The attack happened six months before . Tompkins' 14-year-old daughter, Hannah Smith made national headlines . when she committed suicide after being targeted by internet trolls. The two incidents are not related, but Hannah's death was mentioned during her mother's sentencing at Leicester Crown Court. The . hearing was told that Tompkins, high on a cocktail of drink and drugs, . punched, head-butted, kicked and knifed 19-year-old Niall during a row . over £60. The victim was so traumatised he has since twice undergone in-patient psychiatric treatment. James . Bide-Thomas, prosecuting, said that the background to the case began on . February 10 when Niall, now 20, helped Tompkins' brother move out of . his flat. In doing so, they threw some items out of a window but, in the process, a window was broken in the flat below. That . led to an argument with the tenant and the police were called, but it . was decided that Tompkins, her brother and Niall would each pay £20 to . cover the cost of the window and avoid prosecution. Two days later, Niall was at the new flat of the people he had helped move, in South Wigston.Tompkins was also there. At 8pm, she cornered Niall in the kitchen, closing the door behind her, demanding he immediately stump up the full £60. He sent a number of texts and made desperate calls on Tompkins' phone, asking family and friends for £60 but without success. Mr . Bide-Thomas said she then punched him in the face, head-butted him and . kicked him - and started threatening him with more serious harm. Mr . Bide-Thomas said: 'She grabbed a kitchen knife and put his hands on a . cutting board, proceeding to run the blade along the top of his hands, . cutting him. 'She said she was going to stab him. He had a number of wounds to his side, arms and the back of his head.' Tragic: The attack happened six months before Tompkins' 14-year-old daughter, Hannah Smith, pictured, committed suicide after being targeted by internet trolls . After an ordeal which lasted four hours, Tompkins told Niall she would kill him, put him in a body bag and bury him in Gilroes cemetery - 'where no-one will find you'. The court heard she took his mobile phone, removed the SIM card and smashed it. Mr Bide-Thomas added: 'She made him strip naked, took him to the front door and poked him in the back with the knife, telling him to go. 'He got a bin bag and walked to a Tesco, where they initially thought he was drunk but then found he was hysterical.' Battered and covered in bruises, he was too scared to tell the truth at first, because Tompkins had earlier held a knife to his lips, calling him a 'grass'. He at first claimed to have been robbed, said Mr Bide-Thomas. In a victim impact statement, Niall said he could not understand why he was 'so badly treated for £60'. The court was told Tompkins' criminal record dates back to 1996, when she was prosecuted for common assault. In 1997, she committed four offences of causing actual bodily harm (ABH) and two thefts. In 2001, she was dealt with for ABH and battery, between 2002 and 2007 she committed dishonesty offences and there was a public order offence in 2007. In February this year - just three days before she attacked Niall - she was given a community order for a racially aggravated public order offence. Richard Holloway, mitigating, said Tompkins had failed to appear in court for her scheduled sentencing on September 27 due to heroin addiction, but later surrendered after going 'cold turkey'. Mr Holloway said: 'She realises her actions were awful. She'd taken strong lager and a mixture of prescribed and non-prescribed drugs when she committed them. She'd got this completely out of proportion.' Mr Holloway said Tompkins did not go to Hannah's funeral 'as she was stopped by other relatives, and deeply regrets that'. He said Tompkins was concerned about her 16-year-old daughter - Hannah's older sister, Jo - who found Hannah following her death in August, 'and wants to be as much support as she can'. The hearing was told Tompkins separated from the girls' father years ago. Senior probation officer John Pugh told Judge Michael Pert QC that Tompkins 'says she owes it to her (deceased) daughter and to her 16-year-old daughter to sort her life out'. Tompkins, of St Saviour's Road, North Evington, Leicester, admitted blackmail, by demanding money with menaces, and wounding. She was given a merciful two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years, with one year's supervision and a drug rehabilitation requirement. Judge Pert said: 'You subjected the victim to a lengthy ordeal to get money out of him. 'On the other hand, I've read about you and heard of circumstances that are very sad. 'If you fail the court's order, you will go to prison.'","Tracey Tompkins held terrified Nial Hirrell captive for four hours .

A financial adviser who attacked and killed a millionaire socialite after defrauding him of £343,000 to fund a lavish lifestyle has been found guilty of murder. David Jeffs, 36, splashed out on Lotus sports cars, dined at fine restaurants and stayed at top hotels using his client Roberto Troyan's money. He also frittered away his client's wealth on holidays to Mauritius, Ibiza and the USA, and blew £19,500 on his stag party at the Spearmint Rhino strip club. Murderer: David Jeffs, left, swindled his client Roberto Troyan, right, out of £343,000 and then killed him . When Mr Troyan, 63, realised hi deception and threatened to 'end his gravy train' Jeffs battered him to death at his Mayfair apartment. Jeffs had just £5.77 left in his bank account and owed the taxman £200,000 at the time of the killing. He was convicted today of murder and fraud by abuse of position by a jury of three men and nine women at Croydon Crown Court. Jeff's wife Sherry Woodward bowed her head and sobbed while Jeffs, dressed in a dark suit with a striped shirt and black tie, showed no trace of emotion. Jeffs, the son of an ambulance driver, began working for Mr Troyan in 2005. He was taken on shortly after the death of the wealthy man's 52-year-old civil partner Anthony Feldman, who was an architect and interior designer. Mr Feldman's clients included Princess Michael of Kent and former Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken. Scene: Roberto Troyan was found dead in his property in this mansion block in Mayfair by a cleaner earlier this year . The architect's inheritance had made the victim very wealthy and Jeffs took advantage of his 'frail and vulnerable' client. Prosecutor Ed Brown told the court that 'As a result he was able to live the high life but all at the expense of the deceased who - when the defendant first met him - was a rich man.' 'He died less rich by hundreds of thousands of pounds thanks to this defendant's dishonesty. 'When the life to which the defendant happily had become accustomed to appeared to suddenly to come to an end, and that there was a real possibility that his callous acts would soon be found out, he killed him'. Jeffs blew thousands of pounds every month on polo matches, sports cars, and electric guitars. He spent £15,000 in August 2012 alone on his wedding to teacher Sherry Woodward and on their honeymoon tour of Ibiza, Malta, and Las Vegas. Jeffs had also been earning £53,000 per year with the Surrey-based firm HFM Columbus, and enjoyed an annual expense account of £8,000. 'Victim': Mr Troyan who had employed David Jeffs as his financial advisor since 2005 . Shortly before the killing Jeffs used the victim's money to pay a trip to Center Parcs for him, his son and his wife. Jeffs claimed that Mr Troyan paid him £1,000 a week - with two years' money in advance - while employed as his 'financial concierge'. But the reality was Jeffs' bad advice had left Mr Troyan struggling following the Icelandic banking crisis in 2008. He had advised his client to plough £1.2million in insurance bonds that were then invested into a subsidiary of Kaupthing, Iceland's largest bank, which went bust in October 2008. The victim, who was one of the first gay men to enter a civil partnership in Britain, was complaining bitterly about Jeffs and may have confronted him about his huge losses before he died. He was found lying dead in a pool of blood by his maid in the kitchen of his Mayfair flat on March 8. Mr Troyan had suffered multiple skull fractures, a fractured jaw, cheek and eye-socket and had inhaled blood into his airways. Murder charge: David Jeffs, 36, battered Roberto Troyan to death in his Mayfair home when his fraud was about to be uncovered, a court heard . Jeffs was seen on CCTV entering Mr . Troyan’s Mount Street apartment on the afternoon of March 8 and leaving . some 15 minutes later. He then left voicemail messages on Mr Troyan’s phone, claiming he was trying to reach him, in a bid to cover his footsteps. After murdering Mr Troyan, Jeffs travelled to Guildford, Surrey where he bought black bin-bags, wet wipes and a new set of clothes like the ones he was wearing in Mayfair. He then spent 45 minutes at a service station where he changed in a Starbucks toilet before disposing of his blood-stained garments. When Jeffs was first interviewed by police, days after the murder, he denied entering Mr Troyan's home and claimed he had only knocked on the front door but got no answer. After scientists found Mr Troyan's blood on Jeffs's briefcase, he changed his story and told police he was confronted by a mystery man who was covered in blood. He claimed he had not previously mentioned the man to avoid association with the 'messiness' of Mr Troyan's life and the scrutiny of the Inland Revenue. 'That Robert had paid me, over the course of three years, such a large amount of money and knowing that I had paid not a single penny in tax, it weighed heavily on my mind,' Jeffs said. 'In my mind the man might have been an angry pimp in some sort of bondage session, or into drugs, things like that. 'There was certainly drug-taking and possible activity with rent-boys who had been up to Robert's flat previously. 'There were times when I saw him passed out naked on the floor and debit cards covered in what looked like cocaine'. He said there were often random men present and evidence of drug-fuelled sex parties when he arrived for meetings. 'I saw a lot of evidence of cocaine-taking and sometimes there would be men I did not know there. 'Leather paddles and pornography was poorly hidden in a wicker basket and I once found Robert completely naked, passed out in his lounge surrounded by sexual paraphernalia.' Exclusive neighbourhood: Police launched a murder investigation in Mayfair after Mr Troyan was discovered dead. He had been bludgeoned to death . Jeffs, from Nottingham, denied murder and fraud by abuse of position. He will now be sentenced on 10 December at Southwark Crown Court. After the conviction, Baljit Ubhey, CPS London Chief Crown Prosecutor, said: 'This was a case of cold and calculated deception which resulted in the violent murder of Roberto Troyan by David Jeffs. 'As Mr Troyan's financial adviser, David Jeffs was able to gain his trust but then quickly began to abuse that relationship to fund his own extravagant and excessive lifestyle. 'Jeffs exploited Mr Troyan's lack of financial knowledge to steal £343,000 which he spent on sports cars, luxury hotels, exotic holidays and hospitality tickets to sporting events. 'When he realised his dishonesty was about to be exposed Jeffs murdered Mr Troyan and created an elaborate web of lies to account for his spending and to cover-up the murder. 'Today he has been brought to justice for his crimes and we hope his conviction will bring some comfort to Mr Troyan's family. Our thoughts are with them at this time.'","David Jeffs, 36, defrauded his client Roberto Troyan, 63, for years .

'He said to me the other day, ""mum, I don’t think I’m ever going to get over this,"" and it broke my heart.' Hardworking Daniel was hired by Shepton Mallet Town Council as an assistant in the park in 1986 and when private company Quadron took over in 2002 they kept him on.

Parents who buy their children tablet computers at Christmas should ensure anti-porn filters are applied, Culture Secretary Maria Miller says. Tablets such as iPads and Kindles are expected to be one of the top presents this year - with Tesco and Argos coming on the market with cheaper versions. But the Culture Secretary warned last night that unless parents switch on family filters, their children could stumble across porn and other inappropriate material. Maria Miller has told parents to ensure anti-porn filters are applied if they buy children tablets for Christmas . The top four internet service providers have agreed to ask all households whether they want to install a filter over the next year, thanks to the intervention of David Cameron and pressure from the Daily Mail. But until that happens, Mrs Miller said parents had to take the initiative and install filters themselves. TalkTalk and Sky have already made network filters available, meaning parents do not have to install filters on every separate device. BT and Virgin will follow within the next two months. A recent Ofcom report showed a dramatic rise in the number of younger children owning tablets. The use of tablet computers has tripled among five to 15-year-olds since 2012 (42 per cent, up from 14 per cent), and 28 per cent of infants aged three to four now use a tablet at home. Mrs Miller said: ‘Many more children will be unwrapping smartphones and tablet devices on Christmas Day. ‘For parents and children, the internet is fast becoming part of everyday life at work, at school and socially but parents are rightly wary about what children are being exposed to online. ‘We have worked with industry to make it far easier for parents to be confident their children are being protected. Parents need to think about putting filters on their accounts and finding out more about keeping children safe online.’ Ms Miller warned that unless parents switch on family filters, their children could stumble across porn and other inappropriate material . The four main ISPs - who supply internet connections to almost nine out of 10 UK homes - have agreed that all new broadband customers will have the settings for family friendly filters automatically switched on. By the end of 2014 all existing customers will have been presented with an unavoidable choice about installing family friendly content filters which the user will not be able to skip. Only the adult account holder will be able to change the filter settings. Outside the home, all mobile operators have agreed to ensure that adult content is filtered and users will have to prove they are over 18 to switch them off. Family-friendly filters are now being applied to public wi-fi by the six companies that provide 90% of public wi-fi across the UK. Last month an expert warned that newly-released tablet computers from Tesco and Argos could put children at risk of stumbling across porn because they do not come fitted with filters. Tesco has brought out a cheap device called a Hudl, while Argos has introduced MyTablet which is aimed specifically at ‘tweenies’ aged from eight to 13.

British girls are the second most likely to get drunk in the developed world, a report has found. Only in Denmark are 15-year-old girls more likely to say they have been drunk at least twice in their lives. The UK is one of only seven of the globe’s industrialised nations where drinking among girls is a larger problem than among boys – leading to fears of a dangerous ladette culture taking over. Binge problem: Britain's position in the survey puts it below countries traditionally seen as having alcohol problems, such as Russia . Some 44 per cent of British  15-year-old girls told researchers they had been drunk at least twice, compared to 39 per cent of boys. Britain is sixth in the world league table for boys. Last night health experts said the shocking figures were a ‘siren call’ to ministers, and warned the NHS will have to cope with an avalanche of liver disease among young women – with some dying in their 20s. Britain’s shameful placing is far higher than countries such as Russia which are traditionally seen as having problems with alcohol. And France and Italy, which have a more responsible ‘Mediterranean’ attitude to drinking, are also much lower in the teen drinking league. Female teenage drinking in France is less than half the level of that in the UK – even though French children are often given wine with meals at a young age. The shocking findings, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, show that bottom of the list is the US, where there is a much greater stigma against teenage drinking. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, special adviser on alcohol to the Royal College of Physicians, said the culture in Britain had changed, so that being drunk was now seen as ‘socially acceptable’, while children are not protected from advertising which glamorises drinking. He said: ‘We are now seeing more and more young women – in their 30s and even in their 20s – with end-stage liver disease. Teenage girl drinking graphic . ‘This isn’t necessarily about alcoholics either; this is young women who started early and got into the habit of drinking in large amounts. ‘This Government has been very laissez-faire about regulation and this is the result – we are in a very bad place about alcohol.’ Latest NHS figures show around 17,000 people were admitted to hospital with liver disease in 2011/12, with a doubling in admissions among those under 30 in the past decade. Julia Manning, chief executive of the think-tank 2020Health, said: ‘It used to be that women and girls in this country would be ashamed of being drunk, but now this ladette culture has taken hold. We have ended up with a situation where young girls are really concerned about seeming cool – yet they don’t care about being seen vomiting in public.’ She said the shocking findings were a ‘siren call’ to ministers, demonstrating the urgent need to tackle the drinking culture by reducing access to alcohol, with tighter licensing and regulation of advertising. She also warned that girls’ drinking culture is putting them at risk of sexual exploitation. The figures are contained in the OECD’s Health At A Glance report for 2013, and based on the most recent worldwide survey, which took place in 2010. Among girls, the UK is second and equal with Finland on 44 per cent of 15-year-olds saying they had been drunk twice before – behind Denmark on 56 per cent. Just behind us are Eastern European countries such as Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary. Russia stands at 19 per cent. Britain is far ahead of other Anglophone countries such as Canada (35 per cent), Ireland (28 per cent) and the US, on just 13 per cent. Most continental countries fare far better, including Italy (14 per cent), France (17 per cent), Portugal (18 per cent) and Greece (19 per cent) – although Spain is 36 per cent. The OECD average is 28 per cent. Eric Appleby, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘If we want to help young people to make healthier choices we need to cut out irresponsible alcohol advertising and for the Government to introduce a minimum unit price, a targeted measure designed to protect the young, which we know saves lives and cuts crime.’ Jonathan Birdwell of Demos said: ‘All the evidence points to the fact that the younger people are when they get drunk, the more likely they will be exposed to serious health risks in later life.’","Report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development quizzed teens on their drinking habits .

A man who killed his girlfriend when he crashed his car after smoking cannabis walked free from court after the victim’s mother begged a judge to spare him prison. Samantha Jennings, 26, died when Thomas Whitehouse, 23, lost control of his Vauxhall Astra and ploughed into a stone wall and then a tree. The mother-of-two, who was sat in the front passenger seat, died at the scene after the collision on the A449 in Cookley, Worcestershire, on December 8 last year. Mr Whitehouse also suffered horrific injuries in the crash had to have a leg amputated. Police tests after the accident found no alcohol in Mr Whitehouse’s blood but they did detect traces of cannabis. He admitted causing death by careless driving and possession of a Class B drug at a previous court hearing. But on Friday, Mr Whitehouse, from Stourbridge, West Mids, was spared jail after Samantha’s mum Deborah asked for him to be shown mercy. He was instead given a four-month prison term suspended for 12 months at Worcester Crown Court.Judge Patrick Thomas QC agreed with the defence that a custodial sentence shouldn’t be imposed immediately due to what he described as 'powerful personal mitigation'. In a moving sign of forgiveness, Miss Jennings' mother Deborah sat alongside Mr Whitehouse’s family in court and asked for him not to be sent to jail. Prosecutor Paul Whitfield said: 'The victim’s mother wishes that he be spared prison.' Defending Gurdeep Garcha added: 'It speaks volumes of Mrs Jennings that she has remained in contact with Mr Whitehouse’s family throughout this ordeal. 'She sits next to Mrs Whitehouse.' On the night of the crash Whitehouse and his girlfriend Samantha had driven back from Birmingham and picked up two pals, including Leander Mock. At the inquest into Samantha’s death at Worcestershire Coroners Court in April, Mr Mock said he felt a bump before the car started to skid and it felt like the rear tyres had left the road.

He won an Oscar for writing about Shakespeare In Love – and now  Sir Tom Stoppard is in the same situation himself. The 76-year-old father of four,  who is regarded as Britain’s greatest living dramatist, is to marry Sabrina Guinness, the brewery heiress who was once romantically linked to Prince Charles. Sir Tom and Sabrina got engaged several weeks ago and have just started to share their news with their close friends. Guinness is good for him: Sir Tom and Sabrina earlier this year . One acquaintance, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Tom is the great love of Sabrina’s life and she could not be happier. She thinks he is the kindest, most wonderful man in the world and they are both beyond happy and thrilled. ‘Sabrina has shown the ring to some of her friends and all I will  say about it is that there are a lot  of diamonds. But the couple are not shouting about their engagement from the rooftops and some of their closest friends still don’t know.’ The couple, described as being ‘passionately in love’, began their relationship in secret, but it was confirmed when they sent out joint Christmas cards last year. In recent months they have been increasingly seen together in public, and in May, Guinness accompanied Stoppard to a lunch hosted by the Queen for members of the Order  of Merit. The playwright is one of just 24 members. Sir Tom’s friends say the relationship has breathed new life into his writing and the couple now plan to start a new life together in Dorset. Romantic links: Sabrina with Prince Charles, Prince of at a polo match in Windsor Great Park, Windsor in August 1979 . He is believed to be working on a new novel and his first new stage play since the West End hit Rock ’N’ Roll in 2006. Sir Tom is also understood to be working on a stage adaptation of Shakespeare In Love. He has been married twice before and over the years his private life has become inseparable from his public persona. His rise to fame on the back of Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead – which was first performed at the 1966 Edinburgh Fringe – was blamed for the collapse of his seven-year marriage to Josie Ingle in 1972, as she was said to resent living in his shadow. His second marriage, to agony aunt Dr Miriam Stoppard, lasted 20 years but ended when he began a public affair with The Good Life actress Felicity Kendal. Friend to the stars: Sabrina Guinness talks to Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in 1978 . They had a seven-year relationship before she returned to her husband. Stoppard’s 1982 play The Real Thing, is about a middle-aged playwright who becomes infatuated with an actress, originally played by Kendal. Ms Guinness, a charity entrepreneur who is 19 years Stoppard’s junior, is one of the best connected people in the world, counting everyone from U2 to the Rothschilds among her friends . Her sister Julia Samuel is a godmother to Prince George – and when Sabrina dated Prince Charles in his bachelor days, he was reportedly much taken by her willowy legs and bubbly warmth. Sir Tom and Sabrina did not want to comment last night.","Father-of-four Sir Tom and Sabrina got engaged several weeks ago .

A study has shown that bits of the brain are bigger and better connected in people who have lots of friends. And the more sociable they are, the bigger the brain boost. Parts of the brain are bigger and better connected in people who have lots of friends, a study has found . The finding comes from Oxford University scientists who asked 18 men and women how many friends they had met, spoken to on the phone or emailed in the past month. The average number of friends contacted was around 20 but some were in touch with more than 40 people. Others only made contact with ten pals. Scans showed that around half a dozen brain regions were bigger in those who were more sociable - and the more friends someone had, the larger the areas were. One of the sociability regions was the anterior cingulate cortex, an area we use to keep track of what other people are doing. However, it is thought that other brain regions, which aren't used when socialising, shrink in comparison . The scans showed that connections between this area and another that we use to work out how others are thinking and feeling were particularly strong in sociable types. The Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference also heard that there were strong connections between the various areas involved in sociability. Researcher MaryAnn Noonan said: ‘In more sociable humans, perhaps these communication pathways are more like motorways than windy country roads, making information processing more efficient and better.’ With earlier work in monkeys producing similar results, the researchers think it is not the case that sociable people are simply born with brains that are better wired for friendship. Instead, they believe that people with lots of friends use certain brain regions more often, leading to them growing to keep up with the social demands. Dr Noonan said: ‘If I hedged my bets, I’d say the brain is changing in response to social network size. 'But that is not to say that there isn’t a genetic influence, so that if you come from a sociable family, your brain is predisposed to that.’ It is hoped that learning more about how the brain reacts in social situations could lead to new treatments for autism, schizophrenia and other conditions in which people struggle to interact with others. However, sociable types should note that the finding doesn’t mean that they have bigger brains overall. It is thought that other brain regions, which aren’t used when they are out socialising, shrink in compensation.","Researchers at Oxford University interviewed 18 men and women .

The shambolic UK Border Agency wrote off £100million in a catalogue of waste during the three years before ministers moved to shut it down, it emerged today. Home Secretary Theresa May killed the agency off earlier this year, condemning it as a ‘troubled’ organisation dogged by years of catastrophic failure. Analysis of the UKBA’s accounts reveal it squandered millions on empty buildings, giving money to asylum seekers who were not entitled to it and booking flights for people who were not deported. The UK Border Agency was broken up after it emerged the backlog of immigration cases would take 24 years to clear . The agency was repeatedly criticised for its failure to get a grip on Britain’s immigration backlog. Mrs May lost patience in March after it emerged there were 321,726 outstanding cases involving immigrants, which would take until 2037 to clear. But behind the scenes a string of blunders meant the agency was wasting millions on buildings, plane tickets and compensation. The agency’s accounts reveal how the money was written off under the heading of 'losses and special payments'. In 2012-13 the agency wrote off £42.9million, a significant increase on the £25.1million wasted in the year before. In 2010-11, a total of £30.3million was written off. Home Secretary Theresa May said the agency had been 'troubled' and had a 'closed, secretive and defensive culture' Amongst the money that was written off in the last three years were: . It included £2.5million in 2012-13 alone . booking flights for failed asylum seekers who did not leave the country . because they were granted the right to appeal. A doomed plan to build an immigration detention centre in Bullingdon, Oxfordshire  wasted £1.7million before being abandoned. The agency also lost more than £8million after being told projects it ran for refugees failed to meet funding criteria laid down by the European Union. Some £1.6million was spent renting a building that was not needed while £1.5million was wrongly paid out to staff in payroll errors. The extraordinary errors were made at a time when UKBA bosses were receiving six-fugure salaries and generous bonuses. Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: ‘The UKBA appears to have been as dysfunctional at managing out money as it policing the borders. ‘It's simply not good enough that taxpayers' money has been wasted in this manner. The officials responsible should be held to account, not eased into another cushy roll where they can waste money yet again.’ UKBA was set up under Labour in 2008. It was first split almost two years ago, when passport checks and customs were hived off into a new Border Force after officials were found to have downgraded border checks used to spot terrorists. In March Mrs May announced it would be cut into two parts, one to deal with visa applications and backlogs and the other to track illegal migrants. In a damning assessment of its failings, she told MPs: ‘The agency has been a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008 and its performance is not good enough.’ Responding to the revelations of waste, a Home Office spokesperson said: ‘The government is determined to build an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. 'We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010. ‘The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. This is why we split the Agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates.’ The UKBA was created in 2008 to replace the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in the Home Office, a department which was already in chaos, with asylum claims piling up, and staff badly demoralised. It emerged some 450,000 asylum cases had not been dealt with but left in boxes at the Home Office. The shake-up that led to the creation of UKBA was meant to clear up the mess and stop similar scandals happening in future. But history repeated itself: Nearly 400 of the 1,000 foreign prisoners were told they could stay in Britain and dozens remained untraced. More than 100,000 of the 400,000 asylum seekers were allowed to stay, which MPs said in effect amounted to an ‘amnesty’. Around 500,000 Eurostar passengers boarded trains in France and arrived in the UK without being checked against the warnings index of suspected terrorists. Border security checks were also suspended regularly and applied inconsistently from 2007 onwards. In February last year, Theresa May hived off the UK Border Force, which is responsible for frontline controls at air, sea and rail ports, from the wider UKBA. But in November last year, John Vine, the independent chief inspector of the UKBA revealed that thousands of immigrants were allowed to stay in the UK without undergoing proper checks because of a mountainous backlog of cases. At one point 100,000 pieces of post were unopened and some 14,000 applicants had already been refused the right to stay but were still pleading with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to reconsider. An additional 2,100 cases - shipped in a box from an office in Croydon to Sheffield - were still waiting for an initial decision at the time of the inspection with some dating back a decade. In a scathing report in March, the Home Affairs Select Committee said it would take the UKBA 24 years to clear through a backlog the size of the population of Iceland of asylum and immigration cases.","Analysis of discredited agency's accounts reveals scale of waste .

"New study shows traditional familial names are more present in areas in the South and West . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:00 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:02 EST, 12 November 2013 . What's in a name? If you're in the South, it's a great deal of honor. A new study has found that it is far more common for parents to pick names for their newborn sons that stems from their own fathers. Patronyms, or names that come with 'Junior' or subsequent numbers at the end, are regularly found in cultures where a great amount of honor or where family reputations are held in high regard. Father's footsteps: Former Vice President Al Gore Jr was named after his father, former Senator Al Gore Sr (pictured together in 1993 when the younger Gore was in the White House) Sons of the South: Patronyms are known to be more common in areas considered 'honor cultures' like the Southern United States. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr was named after his father (pictured together in 1964) A new study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin suggests that areas of the country or times of tragedy can influence the selection of names. The researchers from the University of Oklahoma suggest that the migration of clan families from England, Scotland and Ireland to areas of the south and the Appalachian region resulted in a large congregation of 'honor cultures'. 'Our baby naming practices can shed light on what we care about, in a subtle way, and they might also serve as a mechanism for transmitting our cultural values from one generation to the next,' professor Ryan Brown told The Los Angeles Times. One such lesson shows that some outdated stereotypes have not gone away over the generations, as the research found that newborn sons are much more likely to be given the names of their forefathers as opposed to newborn daughters. Family pride: Both John F Kennedy (left) and his brother Robert (right) named their sons after themselves . 'That parents in honor states in the . United States do so with respect to sons but not with respect to . daughters also communicates cultural values,' the report reads. 'Specifically, . the preference for naming boys after their male forebears underscores . the special value placed on boys and suggests that male babies are . considered to be more important than female babies in honor cultures, or . at least in the honor culture found in the United States.' There was not explicit break down of which states are and are not considered honor states, but that is expected to be the subject of a future study. Famous faces: Both Harry Connick Jr (left) and Robert Downey Jr (right, seen with his father) have patronyms . Timing was also discovered as a factor, as there was a noted uptick in patronyms following the September 11 terror attacks- except not where they may have been expected. Even though the attacks killed the most people living near New York and Washington DC, the researchers found that honorific names were given increasingly in states in the South and West that are more generally associated as 'honor cultures'. Names were not the only way that residents of those states showed their emotional reaction to the attacks, as they also ranked among the areas with the highest military recruitment. Some of the traits that are associated with honor ideology can be interpreted in negative ways, however, as previous research connected honor ideologies with high suicide and execution rates.","New study shows traditional familial names are more present in areas in the South and West .

He's a proud family man already, but President Barack Obama will turn to his children when it comes to life after the White House. Sasha Obama could be the deciding factor in whether the first family stay in Washington once he leaves office in three years. In a taped interview with ABC News, the President said his now 12-year-old daughter 'will have a big vote in where we are' because she will be a sophomore in high school. When Obama leaves office in January 2017 after two terms, eldest daughter Malia could be off in college. 'This is our home': Michelle and Barack Obama talk about staying in Washington following the presidency because of their daughters education . Family first: Sasha (left) and Malia Obama (right) take their dog Bo for a walk on the grounds of the White House. First lady Michelle Obama and her two daughters Sasha Obama (left), 12, and Malia Obama (middle), 15 with the family's dogs Bo and Sunny . Both girls attend the exclusive Sidwell Friends School in northwest Washington, the same school Chelsea Clinton went to when Bill Clinton was president. Obama said he and his wife, Michelle, have to make sure Sasha is doing well until she goes off to college. 'So we’ve gotta - you know - we gotta make sure that she’s doin’ well… until she goes off to college,' Obama told Barbara Walters. 'Sasha will have a big say in where we are.' He suggested that no decisions have been made. But he did hint that tearing Sasha away from her friends might be asking too much, saying his wife and daughters already have made 'a lot of sacrifices on behalf of my cockamamie ideas, the running for office and things'. Current home: If the Obamas do stay in Washington and maintain a residence in the city, President Obama would be the first president to do so since Woodrow Wilson . In another portion of the interview, which aired Friday night on ABC's 20/20, Mrs. Obama says she tries not to tell her husband what to do because 'he's got enough people in his ear'. If the Obamas do stay in Washington and maintain a residence in the city, President Obama would be the first president to do so since Woodrow Wilson. Wilson, who was partly paralyzed from a stroke, is the only former president in U.S. history to maintain a residence in Washington, D.C., where he stayed until his death three years later. 'I try to stay out of his ear,' she said. Mrs. Obama says she and the president treat their living quarters on the second floor of the White House like a sanctuary, particularly when their girls are home. Obama gives a sit-down interview with Barbara Walters for ABC News, which aired Friday night, speaking a lot about his family . This is the fifth time journalist Barbara Walters has interviewed the Obama family . She says the girls like to talk about their day, which often has little to do with what's going on in the rest of the world. 'Everyone has to have their safe haven, a place of peace and calm and, you know, that's home for us,' the first lady said.","In a new interview with ABC News, Barack and Michelle Obama discuss life after the presidency .

Cages designed to protect children from Mexican gray wolves at New Mexico's bus stops have come under fire for demonizing the endangered animals, which have never attacked anyone in the state. Environmentalists argue the wooden and mesh cages erected in the town of Reserve a decade ago are only furthering the misunderstanding of the animals, their behaviors and the dangers they pose. But supporters of the cages - including residents and conservative anti-government organizations - insist that the animals, which were reintroduced to the area in 1998, pose a very real threat. The debate has resurfaced because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to extend Endangered Species Act protections for around 75 wolves left in New Mexico and Arizona. Necessary? Children stand in a wolf cage in Reserve, New Mexico. Environmentalists say the cages, designed to protect against the Mexican gray wolf, give the wrong impression about the animals . The FWS is also seeking to make it illegal to kill . wolves in most situations and would greatly expand the area . where wolves can exist without interference, FoxNews.com reported. To many conservatives in the area, the proposals are simply examples of meddling government officials who do not know what it is like to live with wild wolves. Ranchers are now battling the extension, claiming the animals should be hunted. Anti-wolf campaigns are underway, portraying the animal as a savage beast that stalks and preys on children. The opinion has led to scores of illegal killings of the wolves over the past two decades. Carolyn Nelson, a teacher in Catron County where the cages have been built, said even more needs to be done to protect the town's children. Danger? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to extend Endangered Species Act protections for 75 Mexican gray wolves in New Mexico and Arizona - but residents say they're a threat . The Mexican gray wolf, a subspecies of the gray wolf, is the world's most endangered wolf. They typically prey on elk and deer, but are also known to eat rabbits and squirrels. After the species was wiped out in the U.S., they were bred in captivity and reintroduced to the wild in Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. There are now only around 75 in the states. In the past four decades, there have been just three documented wolf attacks on humans in North America - and none of these were by the Mexican gray wolf. The attacks took place in Canada and Alaska, not the West. Likewise, the incidence of wolves killing cattle and sheep is less common than believed. Around a third of sheep deaths across the country are due to predators and just 0.4 per cent of those attacks are by wolves, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Interestingly, domestic dogs are responsible for almost 20 times more sheep deaths. In cattle deaths, wolves kill fewer cows than coyotes, domestic dogs, cougars and vultures. Nevertheless, residents of New Mexico towns such as Reserve - where the cages are found - say the animals have stalked and cornered their children, spreading fear in the community. She told the Los Angeles Times that seven years ago her son, then 14, came across three wolves while out walking and backed against a tree as the animals circled him. He cocked his gun and the wolves ran off, but 'it was a miracle he wasn't killed,' Nelson said. Caren Cowan, the executive director of the . New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association, said that the wolves were bred in . captivity and reintroduced into the wild, leaving them unafraid of people. 'In . Catron County, the wolves were following some kids home from schools, . some of them could no longer walk to the bus stop like they used to,' Cowan told FoxNews.com. 'They are a constant problem and we spend a . great deal of time and effort on this issue.' The approximately 20 cages in Reserve were installed on the orders of Reserve Independent Schools, Catron County Sheriff Shawn Menge said. She explained how earlier this year, one of the wolves frightened a mother and her son near a bus stop. When she tried to make it leave, it moved towards the mother instead, she said. The Fish and Wildlife Service removed the young male wolf by shooting it with an arrow, but the story quickly spread, unsettling residents. But Eva Sargent, director of Southwest programs for Defenders of Wildlife, said that keeping the cages was politically motivated, rather than based on safety concerns. While there are some - albeit few - reports of animals attacking livestock, they rarely attack humans. Even with the livestock, domestic dogs kill 20 times as many sheep as wolves do, data shows. Speaking out: David Spady, the producer of an anti-wolf film, said the Endangered Species Act was an example of the government meddling in an issue without knowing how it actually affects people . 'There's been absolutely zero, nada, zilch attacks on humans by wolves in the Southwest, so I think these cages are a reaction to a non-problem,' Sargent told Fox. 'For some people, it's a political ploy to bring attention to other things. A lot of the fear stirred up by these kid cages, at the base of it, is an anti-government fear and the wolves are standing in for that.' Yet, still residents in the West say the decision should be up to them, not Washington. 'The wolf is symbolic of a larger fact,' David Spady, the producer of an anti-wolf documentary told the LA Times. 'The federal government is running roughshod over private property . rights. 'We at the local level believe that we understand the . needs of our place, rather than somebody in Washington, D.C.'","Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to extend protections for 75 Mexican gray wolves - reigniting a debate about the danger they pose .

Thanksgiving Day is no longer all about turkey: It's eating away at Black Friday shopping. U.S. shoppers spent $9.74 billion on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. That's a drop of 13.2 percent compared with last year, according to data released today by research firm ShopperTrak. The decline appears to show that more Americans shopped on the holiday itself: Combined spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, which had been considered the official start to the holiday buying season until this year, rose 2.3 percent to $12.3 billion. Rampage: Customers stormed the shoe department at Belk in Kinston, North Carolina, on Thanksgiving Day for early sales . The data reflects that Thanksgiving, which along with Christmas was one of two days a year that most stores were closed, is becoming an important day for major retailers. Black Friday is a time when big retailers open early and offer deep discounts, but a few started opening and offering those discounts on Thanksgiving a couple years ago. And this year, at least a dozen did so, with a few opening earlier in the holiday than they did last year. The National Retail Federation, a retail trade group, predicted that 33 million, or almost a quarter, of the 140 million people who planned to shop during the four-day holiday weekend that ends on Sunday, would do so on Thanksgiving. Analysts had questioned whether the holiday openings would steal sales away from Black Friday or result in people spending more overall. 'Retailers were pretty successful in drawing the consumers into the stores on Thursday,' said ShopperTrak founder Bill Martin, whose company counts how many shoppers go into about 40,000 stores in U.S. But 'Thursday's sales came at the expense of Black Friday's numbers'. Manic: Shoppers in the Macy's Herald Square flagship store in New York search for bargains on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving . The decline in sales on Black Friday was the second one in a row. Last year, sales on that day dropped 1.8 percent to $11.2 billion, though it still was the biggest shopping day last year, according to ShopperTrak. Despite the big drop this year, Shoppertrak's Martin said he thinks Black Friday will remain the biggest shopping day of the year for the tenth consecutive year. But if retailers continue to promote Thanksgiving as the start of the holiday buying season, he thinks the holiday will eventually surpass Black Friday in sales. 'We're just taking Black Friday sales and spreading them across a larger number of days,' Martin said. There will be a clearer picture of sales for the first holiday shopping weekend tomorrow when The National Retail Federation releases data. Overall, the retail trade group expects sales to be up 3.9 percent to $602 billion for the season, which encompasses the last two months of the year. That's higher than last year's 3.5 percent growth, but below the 6 percent pace seen before the recession. Bargain hunters: Dominicans shop for deals on 'Black Friday' at a mall in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic . Some retailers said the holiday shopping season is off to a good start. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said it sold two million TVs and 1.4 million tablets on the Thanksgiving, while Macy's said 15,000 people showed up to the 8pm opening of its flagship New York City store on the holiday. Edwin Molina, 30, a New Yorker who works in construction, waited with his wife in line for an hour at a Best Buy that opened at 6pm on Thanksgiving. He said he likes the holiday openings. 'It was better, less hectic,' he said. But not everyone liked the earlier start to the shopping season. Workers' rights groups and some shoppers led small protests to decry the way some store employees had to miss holiday meals at home. And as his wife shopped in a mall near Atlanta on Black Friday, Curtis Akins, 51, sat on a bench, lamenting the holiday openings. 'It's taking away from the traditional Thanksgiving,' Akins said.","U.S. shoppers spent $9.74 billion on Black Friday - a drop of 13.2 percent from last year .

For budding pop stars or rebellious teens, a tattoo is virtually a rite of passage. Until now, the same could not be said of ageing BBC broadcasters. But David Dimbleby has thrown convention to the wind at the ripe old age of 75… by having a scorpion inked onto his shoulder. Last-minute regrets? David Dimbleby, 75, looks a little wary as he has his tattoo done . The veteran presenter said he decided to ‘man up’ and visit an east London tattoo parlour while filming his latest TV series Britain And The Sea for BBC1. He was researching the history of Polynesian tribal tattoos, which were first brought to the UK by Captain Cook’s crew in the 18th Century, when a producer suggested he have one done himself. Work of art: He had a scorpion iinked on his shoulder to mark his star sign, Scorpio . Mr Dimbleby said he initially refused on the grounds he was too old, despite admitting it was a lifetime’s ambition. But he then decided to have a design to mark his star sign Scorpio. He told Radio Times: ‘Instead they did something with black pencil that can be washed off. ‘But when I saw it in a preview of the film I thought: “That’s a bit feeble.” I thought it was wimpish having it just drawn on and I needed to man up.’ Mr Dimbleby’s two-and-a-half inch tattoo cost £60 at the Vagabond tattoo agency in east London last month. He said: ‘It took about 30 minutes - an hour in all - and I thought of Winston Churchill having his done while mine was being done. It wasn’t painful at all, it just zings a bit.’ ‘It’s modest. It can’t be seen unless I choose to show it to someone. I’m rather fond of it actually, this little scorpion sitting on my shoulder ready to attack my enemies.’ The co-owner of Vagabond, Rebecca Morris, told the Daily Mail Mr Dimbleby was ‘a pleasure to work on’. She said: ‘He’s not someone who is representative of our client base, but we have had older people come to have tattoos. ‘He was very light hearted and in high spirits. He dealt with the pain well - he flinched a few times but he was chatting all the way through. Manning up: The veteran presenter said he decided to 'man up' and visit an east London tattoo parlour while filming his latest TV series Britain And The Sea, pictured, for BBC1 . ‘It was nice to see him in a different light, he was friendly and approachable and much less serious than you would imagine.’ As well as presenting the BBC’s long-running Question Time series, Mr Dimbleby is known as the solemn anchor of nearly every televised state occasion. He has presented every general election since 1979.

It’s a dream come true for me. It’s beautifully done, actually. It’s a work of art.’ Reaction: Mr Dimbleby said his second wife Belinda Giles, pictured, was 'mildly amused' by his tattoo . He added: ‘They have these 3D tattoos . now that are done using photographs, which are just astonishing, but I . wasn’t about to have one myself. ‘And then there’s Cheryl Cole’s bottom. I wasn’t tempted to have any private parts decorated, I have to tell you. I thought the shoulder was the most discreet place.

Mr Dimbleby – who is the son of broadcasting legend Richard Dimbleby and the brother of BBC journalist Jonathan – lives in East Sussex with his second wife, Belinda Giles. Asked what she made of his tattoo, he said: ‘I think she’s mildly amused. I believe she wanted a tattoo once, but has never got around to it. Maybe I’ll be able to persuade her.’ Mr Dimbleby is not the first famous septuagenarian to have a tattoo.

Southwark Crown Court heard that there were several health and safety failings with the club at the time of the incident.

The . court heard factors which contributed to the girl’s death included the . lack of an observer on the boat at the time of the incident, the speed . of the boat, it’s 'unnecessary' turning at tight angles, and the colour . of the equipment the children were wearing - making it difficult to spot . them if they fell in the water. Parents of some of the children were watching from picnic tables when Mari-Simon fell into the water. Two of the witnesses leapt into the river after failing to get Mr Gibson’s attention. The driver later told police he did not see the girl fall in. He said: 'I turned the boat around and she went under.' The court heard the 11-year-old was later pronounced dead. 'Changes in the law': Andries and Ancia Cronje gave a statement to the press outside Southwark Crown Court. Mr Cronje said 'Our 11-year-old daughter died prematurely. A promising life stretched out ahead of her' Summing up, Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'The first thing that obviously must be said in this very unhappy case is a word of sympathy and a word of acknowledgment of the dreadful grief and terrible loss suffered by those who loved Mari-Simon. And of them there were plenty.' He said that if the company was still solvent he would have slapped it with a bigger fine that would have led to its closure. The judge criticised the company for not having a spotter on board, saying it was 'absolutely obvious' one was needed, and said the case was a particularly serious example of corporate manslaughter. The firm was guilty of 'persistent and deliberate failures to provide observers', he added. Sports club: Southwark Crown Court heard that there were several health and safety failings with Prince's Sporting Club at the time of the incident. The driver, Matthew Gibson, had no UK-recognised qualification . Closed: The Prince's Club closed its doors after the death of 11-year-old Mari-Simon Cronje. It was ordered to pay £134,579.69 - all the money in the firm's accounts and another £100,000 donated by owner, William Bottriell . Praising the 'dignified and deeply, deeply touching' statement of her father, he said the fine in no way reflected the value of Mari-Simon's life. The club had originally denied committing corporate manslaughter but later changed their plea to guilty. The club's director Mr Walker also denied a charge of neglect by a director, which accuses him of responsibility for the alleged health and safety failures which led to Mari-Simon's death. No action was taken by the prosecution and a not guilty verdict was issued by the judge.","Mari-Simon Cronje died during a birthday celebration in September 2010 .

Josh Lyons' release by Tottenham knocked his self-confidence to the extent he felt unable to go out socially . A talented striker who spiralled into depression after being dropped by a Premier League football club took his own life an inquest heard. Josh Lyons, 26, from Crawley East Sussex, was picked for the Tottenham Hotspur youth side as a schoolboy and was thrilled to be playing for the team he supported. But after working for three years to get a professional contract, he was released by the London side aged just 16 leaving him ‘feeling like a failure.’ At an inquest into his death a coroner condemned the lack of support he received from the top London club. Mr Lyons went on to have spells at other youth sides, but didn't have the same passion and enthusiasm for football and started to suffer from anxiety which left him unable to go out with friends. It was at Crawley Town where he bowed out from the game, when he was dropped by the side aged 18. The inquest, in Horsham, West Sussex, heard how after suffering years of depression, Mr Lyons ended his life on a railway line near Ifield West Sussex after telling his parents he was going for a run in March this year. White Hart Lane football staduim, home to Tottenham Hotspur: The side have expressed their condolences to Josh Lyons family after being criticised by a coroner . Speaking at the inquest last week, assistant deputy coroner Karen Henderson criticised the sport saying that professional clubs should do more to support young footballers. She said: 'It was that pivotal point that crushed a young man's life and all the dreams that go with it. 'That one moment I find was the single most important factor that led to the events that ended up on the train tracks. 'It is very difficult to build up the hopes of a young man only then to have them dashed at a young age. It is very cruel. 'I find there was an absence and lack of support in football.' The inquest heard how Josh started his junior career with Wimbledon, before being spotted by Spurs. After the rejection he sunk into depression, and had to come home from traveling in Thailand because he felt so unwell. In 2008 he visited a GP saying that he had been having thoughts of suicide. He was referred to a counsellor and was treated with medication and therapy for four years. Mr Lyons was hit by a train on the main London Victoria to Portsmouth line. Speaking after the inquest his devastated father Liam, 57, said: 'By playing for Spurs, who he supported, Josh was fulfilling every boy's dream. 'But he was released after three years and it was a massive blow to his self-esteem and self-confidence. 'Josh felt as though he  was a failure.' Spurs also offered their condolences to the family, and said that more is now being done to support players who don't make the grade. A spokesman said: ''Club support mechanisms have evolved considerably in the past decade. 'We place a strong emphasis on creating a safe environment where our players are able to discuss any kind of issue . Leon McKenzie has spoken about how he attempted suicide . with academy staff as well as employing a strong pastoral team to work with our coaches and host families in terms of caring for our young players. 'We also fully support Premier League workshops that promote positive mental health and encourage emotional well-being. 'The club is committed to giving support to youngsters beyond their playing time with us, assisting in planning for their futures by offering support and advice in terms of further education, vocational work or even in helping them to try and find a new club. 'We are deeply saddened to hear of Josh’s passing and extend our sincerest condolences to his family and friends.' The death comes at a time where depression in football has arisen as a major issue in the beautiful game. In November 2011 former Newcastle United, Everton and Leeds star Gary Speed hanged himself after a long struggle with depression. Former Norwich City striker Leon McKenzie also tried to kill himself after a serious injury coincided with the the breakdown of his marriage and family. And in 2009 German international goalkeeper Robert Enke also took his own life after a struggle with depression.","Coroner criticises club for not supporting Josh Lyons after rejecting him .

A father and son blackmailed a company boss with pictures of his married business colleague and a half-naked woman in a Dubai hotel room after a £180million deal turned sour, a court heard. They demanded £35,000 to prevent the images - which showed the man being straddled by the woman - being put on the internet, damaging the international company’s reputation, and shown to the subject’s wife, Isleworth Crown Court heard. Karim Ashikali, 57, and Mohamedraza Ashikali, 26, both of Stanmore, claim the blackmail complaint was invented to cut them out of a lucrative deal. Karim Ashikali, 57, (left) and Mohamedraza . Ashikali, 26, (right) are accused of blackmailing a company boss with pictures of his married business colleague and a half-naked woman in a Dubai hotel room . They maintain Mohamedraza - known as Mo - is owed £35,000 in wages by the company. They have pleaded not guilty to making an unwarranted demand with menaces against the businessman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, between November 6 and November 20 last year. The businessman and the Ashikalis had a meeting at the company’s HQ in South Kensington on November 6, after a fruitless investment trip by both defendants to Dubai resulted in Mohamedraza parting company with the consulting firm. The jury heard the company boss’s colleague - identified as Mr B - was photographed stripped to the waist in a Dubai hotel room, lying underneath a mystery woman wearing only a bra and knickers. 'When they came in Mo held his phone up and showed me the pictures. 'They were of Mr B with a woman sitting astride him, taken from two different angles,' explained the businessman. 'The only reason the Ashikalis came to me was to discredit him.' Mohamedraza also allegedly threatened to tell Mr B’s wife that her husband was enjoying a fling with an attractive young female member of staff at the company, and had a recording of the employee confirming the affair. 'He said he was going to post the images on the internet. 'He was never owed any outstanding salary. That is money he wanted to keep quiet, to not tell Mr B’s wife.' The Ashikalis failed to find investors for the company while in Dubai, but Karim claimed the Saudi Arabian consul-general could authorise a deal that would generate huge profits. It is claimed they demanded £35,000 to prevent the images - which showed the man being straddled by the woman - being put on the internet, damaging the international company's reputation, and shown to the subject's wife, Isleworth Crown (pictured) Court heard . However, the businessman says the deal was flawed and Mr B agreed with him, denying there was any motivation to 'cut out' the Ashikalis. With the consul-general demanding nine-tenths of the commission, the businessman told the court: 'It would have been illegal. Totally illegal.' He also told the court his company 'lost complete faith' in the Ashikalis efforts to source investment in the Middle East. 'Some of those investors were not investors at all. They were trying to take our money.' The businessman said he reported the Ashikalis after cash demands were made following the meeting when the compromising pictures were revealed. 'We discussed it after receiving an email saying Karim wanted money and then we went to the police. We took it as a demand.' He said Karim emailed him claiming time was running out to stop his son going public, warning: ‘I don’t think I can hold him [Mo] off much longer!!' The trial continues.

Yo-yo dieting - which can mean some women lose up to 10 stone in a decade - but pile even more weight back on. Now, a Channel 5 documentary aired tonight uncovers the . depressing truth of weight loss - that within one year of their diet, 80 per cent of people will gain weight, often more than they lost. Scroll down for video . Struggle: Big Brother's Josie Gibson (before slimming to a size 10) admits she is obsessed with food. 'I love it, have no ""off"" button and lick the plate,' she tells a Channel 5 documentary airing tonight . Yo-yo: Big Brother's Josie Gibson has battled with her weight since she was six. She is now at her slimmest, a size 10, but admits she is terrified about piling the pounds back on - like 80 per cent of dieters . Determined: Josie (pictured) last week is one of many women who have previously piled the weight back on after dieting. She says her weight gain made her feel suicidal . In . the programme, viewers follow Big Brother star Josie Gibson’s . well-documented battle with yo-yo diets, meet 59-year-old Hayley whose . weight has fluctuated for most of her life and Claudia, who has . accepted the only way she will ever be thin is to ‘starve herself – and I . can’t do that’. All the women in the programme have lost weight – only to pile it all (and more) back on. At 28 years old and a size 10, Josie is the slimmest she has ever been– but she admits it is a daily battle. ‘I . am obsessed with food – I love it, have no “off” button and lick the . plate,’ the Big Brother star tells the documentary. ‘At times I’ve been so desperate to stop eating that I’ve . left the dinner table and gone and put a bikini on for 20 minutes,’ she . confesses. ‘But it still doesn’t work.’ After appearing on Big Brother in 2010 she shed four stone – but piled it all back on when she broke her ankle. Having . worked so hard, she admits she felt suicidal about her weight gain – having . battled with her figure since the age of six and ballooning to 19 stone . by the age of 18. ‘People would text me saying “go and hang yourself, you whale” – it was horrific.' she says. Over . the years, she tried everything to shed the pounds – from fad diets to . weight loss pills. ‘They were meant to flush out fat but left me with . spag bol in my pants,’ she candidly tells viewers. Now a svelte size . 10, she has thrown away her fat clothes and is studying to become a . personal trainer in a desperate attempt to stay slim – given that fact . she can ‘put on half a stone in weekend’. She's . not alone. We are a nation of yo-yo dieters, as so many of . our celebrity friends such as Natalie Cassidy, Kerry Katona and Steps' Claire Richards prove. In fact it's not unusual for a woman to . lose 10 stone in a decade as her weight fluctuates. The average diet lasts just five and a half weeks, and the average woman . will embark on 61 diets in her lifetime and spend around 31 years of her . life trying unsuccessfully to lose weight. One such woman is 59-year-old Hayley Morris who has been on a diet for . three-quarters of her life  - and even suffered a heart attack because . of her weight. Addicted to yo-yo dieting: Viewers also meet Claudia Connell who has gone up and down six dress sizes over the last two decades. This is her at her thinnest . Struggle: Ms Connell admits the real reason for her weight gain is because she lacks willpower  - but also because 'it's very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight' Like many women, she has lost weight – only to pile it back on and some more. Over a 40-year-period she has lost 27 stone but ended up 10 stone heavier. Aged 15, she was already 12 stone, going up to 26 stone at the age of 32. ‘I . was addicted to food and this is what scuppered every diet. In the . past, if I had any problem, my excuse was to overeat – it was the only . thing in my life I could control at times. ‘I would also write off . the whole day if it started badly food-wise. Breakfast tended to be four . or five slices of toast, then more pasta and bread throughout the day. It was like an illness – but no-one to blame but myself.’ Now at the . age of 59, after developing diabetes and suffering a heart attack, she . is desperately trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle and she the pounds . before her weight kills her. Then there are the women who are addicted to the buzz yo-yo dieting gives them. Diet disaster: Hayley Morris, 59, has ended up 10 stone heavier than when she started dieting . Claudia . has gone up and down six dress sizes over the last two decades. She was . a size eight until the age of 30, but then gained four stone over the . next eight years. She then dropped to under eight stone before piling on . the pounds to go up to a size 18. She admits the real reason for her . weight gain is because she lacks willpower  - but also because ‘it’s . very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight’. She . explains: ‘There is that feeling of euphoria when you get down to a size . 12 or 14 that’s addictive. It wouldn’t be exciting if you could always . fit into size 10 jeans.’ Despite this, she says she wanted to cry at . pictures of herself looking ‘morbidly obese’ and is terrified of being . ‘the fat person on the bus taking up the seat’. And like many failed . slimmers, the list of diets she has tried is endless, ranging from . cabbage, grapefruit to one that involved eating anything red – ‘I ended . up eating fruit gums’, she admits. Viewers also meet 23-year-old Gemma, whose mother was paying her to lose weight even when she was at primary school. By the age of 11 she weighed a staggering 18 stone – and she’s been battling the weight ever since. ‘I . go on crazy diets like the cup-a-soup one, where I lost two stone in a . month – but I put it back on as soon as I finished,’ she says, now . weighting 24 stone. ‘I am an emotional eater and it’s sticking with the . diet that’s the problem.’ Claudia is having more success – but even she fears it will be short-lived. ‘I’ve . lost one-and-a-half stone in two months, but I know I will put it back . on,’ she admits. ‘Starvation is what it takes for me to be thin  - and I . just can’t starve myself.’ Got Thin - Got Fat Again! is on Channel 5 tonight at 9pm .","Big Brother star is one of several yo-yo dieters in Channel 5 documentary .

GCHQ set up fake pages imitating LinkedIn and other websites in order to spy on communications firms, it has been claimed. Leaked documents apparently reveal that the British surveillance service targeted security staff responsible for safeguarding networks across Europe. The claim is likely to lead to further controversy among Britain's allies coming just a week after it was reported that the UK was spying on Germany via its embassy in Berlin. Claims: Spies at GCHQ, whose headquarters are pictured, are alleged to have hacked into telecoms firms . German magazine Der Spiegel reported that one tactic used by GCHQ to monitor mobile phone and internet traffic was to install 'malware' via dummy copies of popular websites. British spies apparently found out which employees of Belgium's state-owned telecoms firm Belgacom used business network LinkedIn and other sites, including tech news forum Slashdot. They then created copies of LinkedIn pages which were indistinguishable from the originals but which secretly installed software on the users' computers, the magazine reported. This malware, installed by a process known as 'Quantum Insert', allegedly gave GCHQ access to the company's routers. Communications networks are particularly valuable to spies, because they allow instant access to individual users. Defence: The agency's director Iain Lobban insists its work is essential to national security . Other companies prioritised by GCHQ, . according to Der Spiegel, were companies which process billing payments . between mobile phone companies in different countries. Spies . are alleged to have hacked in to the computers of engineers at Comfone . and Mach, both largely unknown to the general public but key to . international communications networks. By infiltrating telecoms companies, Britain is apparently able to compile detailed portraits of suspects' lives. Leaks: The latest allegations came from documents obtained by contractor Edward Snowden . In one case, Der Spiegel reported, the firm drew up a list of multiple computers used by an employee of Mach, as well as his Skype, Gmail and social networking accounts. The latest hacking allegations were brought to light in secret documents leaked by former U.S. government contractor Edward Snowden. They are believed to centre around a GCHQ department called 'My Network Operations Centre', or MyNOC, which brings together key staff from different divisions to work on infiltrating international telecommunications. One leaked document shows Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visiting MyNOC for a briefing on Afghanistan. A LinkedIn spokesman told Der Spiegel: 'We were never told about this alleged activity and we would never approve of it, irrespective of what purpose it was used for.' The spying claims have prompted a furious reaction within Belgium, where public prosecutors have launched an investigation. Last week, the British ambassador to Germany was summoned to meet government officials over allegations that GCHQ had installed a 'listening post' on top of the British embassy. And over the weekend an Icelandic politician claimed that the UK spied on officials who were negotiating over the collapse of the country's banks. GCHQ's head, Iain Lobban, delivered a robust defence of the agency's work when he appeared in front of MPs at a select committee hearing last week. The agency has refused to comment on the latest allegations. Edward Snowden, a former contractor at America's National Security Agency, has rocked the intelligence world by leaking secret documents which reveal the previously unknown extent of global spying. While most of his revelations involved the NSA, he has also made a number of disclosures about GCHQ, which shares intelligence with the U.S. and other close allies. It emerged that British spies regularly tap in to the fibre-optic cables which carry internet traffic around the world, co-operating with telecoms firms to intercept data. The programme, known as 'Tempora', is meant to target terror suspects but also collects information about millions of innocent people. Documents passed to newspapers by Mr Snowden showed GCHQ also monitors emails sent using popular services such as Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. A diplomatic outcry ensued when it emerged that Britain had spied on the leaders of other governments during the G20 summit in London in 2009. And last week the German government - already furious that the U.S. had been tapping the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel - summoned the British ambassador for a meeting over claims that the UK embassy was used for spying by GCHQ.","British spies apparently spied on security staff at European telecoms firms .

Many people agonise over how to get a better night's sleep, but now scientists believe they have come up with a formula that simplifies the problem. Researchers have come up with the formula by considering a person’s tiredness, bedtime, mattress comfort, their number of waking hours, noise, light, heat, and duvet thickness. The formula scores the person’s sleep quality from ‘great’ to ‘tossing and turning all night’. Researchers have come up with a formula by considering a person's tiredness, bedtime, mattress comfort, their number of waking hours, noise, light, heat, and duvet thickness . The researchers hope it will also help people work out what they need to do get to sleep quicker, and to stay asleep for longer. The formula, developed by the University of Manchester in association with The Fine Bedding Company is - sleep quality = [(T x Bt) + C ] / [ Ha + S + L + (H x D)] . A score of two is a great night’s sleep, one is average and zero is tossing and turning all night. The ‘T’ stands for tiredness and is calculated by working out the number of hours since your last overnight sleep, minus the number of hours spent napping, plus the hours of physical exercise undertaken during the day. ‘Bt’ means bedtime and is calculated by taking a person’s bedtime that night and dividing it by their normal bedtime. ‘C’ stands for comfort and is calculated as pillow, plus bedding, plus mattress, minus nine. Scores for each item of bedding are worked out by rating them from one (very uncomfortable) to five (very comfortable). ‘Ha’ stands for the average hours awake - this is how long you spend awake on an average day. For most people it will be about 16 hours. ‘S’ represents sound and includes any sounds except white noise or soothing sounds you’ve found to lull you to sleep. It is rated from one (very soft sounds) to five (very loud irregular disturbing sounds). The researchers hope the formula will help people work out what they need to do get to sleep quicker, and to stay asleep for longer . ‘L’ is light and includes any light in the room, including illuminated clocks, natural lights and LEDs (where 0.1 is very soft light and 2 is very bright blue spectrum light). ‘H’ represents heat and is calculated by working out the number of degrees different from 16 to 17 Celsius the temperature is, and then dividing it by ten. ‘D’ stands for duvet appropriateness for room temperature - a good duvet can help us to maintain a comfortable body temperature while we sleep even if the room is a bit too warm or too cold. If it is highly breathable it can also prevent moisture from accumulating. Duvet appropriateness is determined by a self-rating from zero (compensates perfectly for room temperature) to three (does not compensate well and leaves you far too hot or too cold). Dr Penny Lewis who runs The University of Manchester’s sleep lab said: ‘It is always fun to try and boil down a very complicated process into something really simple, and that is what we have attempted with this equation. ‘We wanted to keep things easy, but sleep is complex and there are lots of factors that we haven’t included, for instance the psychology of how you feel about the room you sleep in. ‘Also, the extent to which the things we have put in influence sleep varies hugely from person to person, so this equation really should be viewed as a guide that may make people think about some simple ways they might be able to improve their sleep.’ Her suggestions for a good night’s sleep include keeping a regular bedtime schedule - so your bedtime and get up time are about the same every day, avoiding napping, and getting plenty of exercise. Other key variables are heat, sound and light Dr Lewis suggest people make sure their room is cool -about 16 to 17 degrees Celsius - and that their duvet is breathable to keep their body at the right temperature without allowing moisture to accumulate. She also suggests people keep their room as dark and as quiet as possible throughout the night. Finally, she says comfort is very important to sleep quality so recommends people make sure all their bedding is comfy. The formula is . - sleep quality = [(T x Bt) + C ] / [ Ha + S + L + (H x D)] .

A six-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack moments after his father plunged a knife into his mother. Joseph Chadwick was asleep in bed at the family's Bolton-le-Sands home when he woke to hear his mother Lisa Clay screaming for help. As he stood at the door to his parent's bedroom, his father Paul Chadwick, launched a horrific attack on his son. Victims: Lisa Clay holding her young son Joseph. The pair were killed when Paul Chadwick went on a rampage, launching a frenzied attack on his partner and six-year-old son . The 34-year-old turned on Joseph as his partner, 40, tried to escape across the landing. Chadwick repeatedly stabbed the six-year-old before plunging the blade into his partner again as she tried to get help, before returning to kill his son. He then stabbed himself in a botched suicide attempt. The horrific scene confronted Mr Chadwick's mother as she peered through the letter box in a bid to reach her family when Joseph failed to arrive at day care. She was faced with Miss Clay's body lying in the hallway and Chadwick, lying with life-threatening wounds, on the floor at the foot of the stairs. When police officers broke into the house they discovered Joseph lying on a bed upstairs with his arms crossed. Tests revealed the youngster had been stabbed 25 times. One wound in his neck measured 3.5ins, while he suffered six puncture wounds to his chest. His mother's body suffered 32 separate knife wounds to her neck, chest and legs - 18 were to her hands and arms. Multiple wounds: Tests revealed Miss Clay suffered 32 stab wounds to her neck, chest, legs, hands and arms. Her son Joseph suffered 25 puncture wounds to his tiny body . When he was interviewed by detectives Chadwick claimed he wanted the three of them to be 'together in death'. He said, ‘I feel awful, terrible, I wish I could turn the clock back. I have done wrong, I love my boy and my girl. 'I didn’t mean to. I killed them but I don’t know why I did it.' Preston Crown Court heard the tragedy occurred on the day self-employed landscape gardener Chadwick was due to see a psychiatrist for the first time about his deteriorating mental health. He and his family had moved to a semi-detached house using money left from Miss Clay’s mother and appeared to be 'normal happy family' with no financial problems. She worked part time at a Marks and Spencers store. But despite having 'the perfect family' Chadwick had begun talking of 'voices in his head' in the weeks before the double killing. He claimed clients weren’t talking to him and people were saying they thought he was gay. His mother was so worried about his behaviour she urged him to seek help and he was referred to a psychiatrist by his GP. But on April 9 - the day of the hospital appointment - Chadwick got out of bed at 5am to get a glass of water. He picked up two kitchen knives and hid them under his marital bed as Miss Clay lay asleep. Prosecuting Mr Stuart Denney QC said: 'He said he picked up a pillow and put it over his sleeping partner in an attempt to suffocate her. 'He then stabbed her a number of times but she managed to get out of the bedroom and across the landing and down the stairs. 'Meanwhile Joseph came to the bedroom door and he said he grabbed hold of Joseph and stabbed him two or three times before pursuing Miss Clay and stabbing her several more times. 'She fell and tried to get up to the front door but the defendant pulled her back.' Secure unit: Chadwick, 34, is being held at Guild Lodge mental health facility. On the day of the double killing he was due to see a psychiatrist about his deteriorating mental health problems . Chadwick stabbed his partner repeatedly and returned upstairs where he found Joseph still slightly breathing and stabbed him again. Afterwards he placed Joseph on his bed with his arms crossed over his body before slashing his neck and upper body up to five times and falling down the stairs. Chadwick’s mother, Susan made the discovery after she tried and failed to contact the family when Joseph was not dropped off for child care. Blood was said to be in the kitchen, lounge, hallway and both bedrooms and one knife was found under the double bed and another blood stained knife found near to the door of the double bedroom.

Astonished: Sir Philip Hampton has revealed the 'completely out of body experiences' he has had negotiating RBS bankers' pay packages . Super-rich bankers at Royal Bank of Scotland earning £4million a year are ‘absolutely outraged’ they do not earn even more money, the chairman admitted yesterday. Sir Philip Hampton revealed the ‘completely out of body experiences’ he has had negotiating people’s pay packages at the State-owned bank with people who occupy a ‘different world.’ RBS was rescued by the taxpayer in a £45billion bailout in 2008, and the State still controls an 81 per cent stake. The former boss Fred Goodwin was subsequently stripped of his knighthood. Speaking in London yesterday, Sir Philip expressed his horror at the ruthless pay demands made by some RBS staff. He recalled one meeting when a man was complaining bitterly that he only earned £4million a year when a rival at another bank earned £6million for doing the same job. He said: ‘I can tell you I’ve had some completely out of body experiences in recent years where I was talking to somebody about potentially getting a £4million pay package. ‘And outrage coming across the table from the other side because they know that somebody doing a comparable job at another bank is getting £6million. ‘And this is absolutely outrageous to them. That somebody is getting 50 per cent more.’ Sir Philip, who earns a basic salary of £750,000 a year, said many bankers think it is ‘very, very, very unfair that they are only left with £4million to rub along with.’ Bailout: The Royal Bank of Scotland was rescued by the taxpayer in a £45billion bailout in 2008 . Asked how he had responded to this man’s demand, Sir Philip said he was ‘actually rather surprised.’ He added: ‘It is part of the different world that can be inhabited. Intellectually it is sort of right, isn’t it? I am paid a third less for doing the same job. ‘But is it reasonable? Not many people would say that it is.’ The unnamed man is not on the bank’s board, and is likely to be a senior trader whose pay does not have to be disclosed by the bank. He has subsequently left the firm. Despite their large pay packages, Sir Philip said he regularly receives emails from staff at RBS who are complaining that they do not earn enough money. The bank’s own figures show the huge pay packages enjoyed by hundreds of its staff, while cashiers in branches and thousands of staff at head office earn far more modest salaries. Overall, it has 368 key staff, known as ‘code staff’, who earn an average package of £700,000 each, while 93 workers were paid more than £1million last year. Speaking at a conference organised by the High Pay Centre, the independent think-tank, he said: ‘I get people sending me emails saying: ""My bonus is only going to be X"". ‘That is a fraction of what I’m worth, and can you have a word in the right places?’’ Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the current pay regime in Britain is ‘obscene and unfair’. She said: ‘A big bonus is being given to any boss with a pulse currently.’ Robert Talbut, chairman of the Association of British Insurers’ investment committee, said: ‘One of the biggest problems that we actually have is that people who have turned in a reasonable performance are rewarded far too much.’","Sir Philip Hampton reveals he has had 'out of body experiences' with staff .

An increasing number of elderly people are renting properties after selling their own homes, new data has revealed . An increasing number of retired people are selling their homes and moving into rented accommodation in a desperate bid to access cash, experts say. Overall, there has been a seven per cent . increase in the number of tenants aged 66 to 70 moving into rented . homes after selling their own properties. In addition, half of all regions in the UK saw an increase in older tenants downsizing to rented homes in the past year. Experts believe many pensioners are being forced to sell up to release equity from their homes as their pension pots dwindle and living costs continue to rise. And, figures compiled by HomeLet Rental Index Data suggest pensioners have no choice but to downsize into rented homes as suitable alternatives are being bought by younger first-time buyers with the help of Government initiatives. Yorkshire and Humberside have seen the . largest increase in tenants over the age of 65, while the East Midlands . has the highest rate with 3.1 per cent of pensioners living in rented . accommodation. 'Pensions aren't providing the same level of contributions they were 30 or 40 years . ago,' said Gary Abraham, Director of Sales and Marketing at HomeLet. 'For many elderly people, the only equity they have is in their homes and they're having to unlock income from other sources like selling their houses.' 'The government are specifically only helping one demographic... new houses are being built for younger people.' While some elderly people may be forced to sell their homes and downsize to save money, others may be moving in to rented accommodation as they feel their 'money may outlive them', says Mr Abraham. 'A lot of the new homes aren't suitable but another thing to consider is that is pensioners could be taking a short-term view and using their equity to provide a standard of living they're used to.' The HomeLet October 2013 Data Index breakdown reveals how the price of renting has increased less over the past three years . 'It appears the demographic of the UK . tenant is changing. While initiatives, such as the Build to Rent scheme, . are positive moves to alleviate supply, the Government needs to . consider these purpose-built properties are not going to be suitable for . all,' added Mr Abraham. 'Therefore, focus must also be kept on . the maintenance of existing properties, so all tenants are able to live . in suitable properties depending on their individual needs.' 'Momentum must be maintained though so those living within the private rented sector are offered the best quality properties and security needed as part of their tenancy agreements.' The report also revealed that though the cost of . renting has decreased by 4.6 per cent during the month of October to £815, . tenants across the board are still paying 2.7 per cent more on average than last year. When comparing previous years, this . month’s figures show from October 2010-2013, . average UK rents increased less each year, after rising by 4.8 per cent in 2011, . 3.1 per cent in 2012 and 2.7 per cent in 2013. This is also true in the capital, . where the rate of increase in average rents slowed down by 2.3 per cent between . October 2011-12 and four per cent between October 2012-13. The East Midlands, Greater London and . the North West were the only regions where rental costs increased, with . properties in the North West costing 4.5 per cent more to rent than . last year, and those in the capital almost 21 per cent more than in . 2010. 'Our new figures could suggest the effect of the economic downturn in 2008/09 is beginning to reduce,' said Mr Abraham. 'There’s certainly more confidence within the housing market at the moment and an increasing amount of first-time-buyers are now purchasing their own properties as a result of increased lending and mortgage availability.' 'Recent reports suggest the Build to Rent scheme will improve the private rented sector by boosting the supply of buy-to-let homes within the market. 'Properties rented with longer-term tenancies as part of this scheme aim to not only offer additional security to tenants and their families, but also curb spiralling rents recorded over the past few years.'","Number of elderly tenants increased in more than half of UK's regions .

Two former soldiers who fire-bombed a mosque in revenge for the killing of soldier Lee Rigby were caught on CCTV preparing petrol bombs and throwing them at the building, a court was told. Stuart Harness, 33, and Gavin Humphries, 37, were shown in footage each carrying two home-made petrol bombs from Harness’s home in the town. Grimsby Crown Court was shown footage from more cameras, which caught them later, launching the bombs at the doors of the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre, four days after Fusilier Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks, in London, in May. Two former soldiers who fire-bombed a mosque in revenge for the killing of soldier Lee Rigby were caught on CCTV preparing petrol bombs and throwing them at the building, a court was told . A jury of eight women and four men heard how a number of worshippers were inside the mosque when the attack took place on May 26. They managed to extinguish the fire and Harness and Humphries were soon arrested as they were witnessed attacking the building by passing police community support officers, the court was told. Both men have pleaded guilty to the arson attack, the jury heard. Excerpts of CCTV footage from the mosque and Harness’s home were shown to the jury on the first day of the trial of a third man, Daniel Cressey, 24, of North Lincolnshire. Cressey, who is Harness’s cousin, is accused of driving the two other men to the mosque. He denies one charge of aiding and abetting arson, being reckless as the whether life was endangered. Before the case started, Judge Mark Bury explained to the jury how case related to an arson attack on a mosque that was an alleged reprisal for the killing of Fusilier Rigby on May 22. He excused members of the jury panel with close connections to the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre from serving. Stuart Harness, 33, and Gavin Humphries, 37, were shown in footage each carrying two home-made petrol bombs. The attack came four days after Fusilier Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks . Prosecutor Jeremy Evans told the court how worshippers inside the mosque that evening heard a fire alarm going off and spotted flames coming from the outside of the front door of the building. Mr Evans said those inside immediately took steps to put the fire out and it was extinguished. He said two police community support officers patrolling outside spotted what Harness and Humphries were up to and chased them back to Harness’s home, where the pair were detained. Mr Evans told the jury how CCTV footage was recovered from outside the house, some of which was shown in court today. The prosecutor said the silent footage showed the petrol bombs being made in the yard. In one section, shown to the jury, Cressey is seen arriving at the house as a metal table is on fire. Mr Evans told the jury the other men had set light to split petrol to burn it off. Fusilier Lee Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks, in London, in May . He showed the jury various clips of Cressey at the house and told the jury it was not conceivable that he did not know what they were doing or what they were planning. Later footage shown in court showed Harness and Humphries carrying the petrol bombs out of the house - one in each hand in front of them. Mr Evans said the prosecution case is that they then got into Cressey’s car to drive the short distance to the mosque. The prosecutor told the court that Cressey admits going to the house but is expected to deny that he knew what they were planning despite being in his cousin’s home for 40 minutes before they all left. He said Cressey is also expected to deny seeing any petrol bombs at the house. Mr Evans showed the jury more CCTV footage, this time of Harness and Humphries at the mosque. Tne clip clearly shows four petrol bombs flying through the air before exploding in bright orange flashes at the door of the building. Returning to Cressey’s alleged role, the prosecutor said: 'This was a team effort, members of the jury.' He said: 'He could not have missed the fact that there were home made petrol bombs being constructed or had been constructed in the property.' Cressey sat in dock with a security officer, wearing a dark suit, grey tie and white shirt. The trial, which is expected to last about three days, was adjourned until tomorrow.

Hold up: Walter Unbehaun, 73, an ex-convict during the bank robbery in Niles. He allegedly told investigators he became accustomed to life in prison and intended to get caught so he could live his final years behind bars . Unbehaun allegedly leaned on a cane as he walked into Harris Bank in Niles at the weekend. He told the cashiers that he had just six months to live, so he had nothing left to lose, according to a federal complaint citing his post-arrest interrogation. Unbehaun also allegedly lifted his coat to show a teller a silver revolver shoved into his waistband. Investigators say Unbehaun walked out of the Harris Bank in Niles with $4,178 in his pockets. He wore no disguises, so law enforcement quickly tracked him down using surveillance-camera photos of him holding up the bank, the complaint said. Robbery: Investigators say Unbehaun walked out of the Harris Bank in Niles with $4,178 in his pockets . When authorities stopped Unbehaun on Sunday outside a motel room where he was staying, he immediately threw down his cane and surrendered, saying he knew they were there because he robbed a bank the day before, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. Unbehaun told investigators hours after his arrest that he had spent most of his adult life in prison and 'felt more comfortable in prison than out.' 'He wanted to do something that would guarantee that he would spend the rest of his life in prison, and he knew that robbing a bank with a loaded gun would accomplish that,' according to the complaint, signed by FBI agent Chad Piontek. Contacted on Tuesday, Unbehaun's defense attorney, Richard McLeese, declined to comment. Unbehaun's most recent stint behind bars ended in 2011, when he was released after serving 10 years for a 1998 bank robbery. His Illinois record alone includes multiple other felonies dating back decades. Unbehaun made an initial court appearance Monday in Chicago and was ordered to remain in jail pending further court procedures. No additional hearing dates were set. If he is eventually convicted on the new bank robbery charge, he could be sent to prison for up to 20 years.","Walter Unbehaun accused of holding up a Chicago bank and stealing $4,178 .

One of Britain's most historic stately homes is set to reopen to the public after around £5m worth of renovations that have restored Kenwood House to its former beauty. Eight rooms have been re-presented and reinterpreted to reference different periods in the building's history. They have been redecorated to reference the period during the 18th century when the house was bought by William Murray, the 1st Earl of Mansfield. Kenwood House, on the northern edge of Hampstead Heath, has undergone a major refurbishment that includes a recreation of the original Robert Adam interiors . Maddy Wall from English Heritage is one of the many staff who have been involved in the project. She is pictured in the Great Stairs at the house . Efforts have been made by the conservation charity to painstakingly refurbish and in some cases recreate the original grand interiors. A close-up of the the ceiling of the library shows the level of detail involved . Brewing magnate Edward Cecil Guinness, first Earl of Iveagh, bought Kenwood House and estate in 1925. When he died in 1927,  the first Earl of Iveagh bequeathed the house, estate and part of his collection of pictures to the nation for the members of the public to enjoy . He commissioned the renown architect Robert Adam to remodel it from 1764–1779. After a lengthy renovation, The Adam . rooms at the Hampstead Heath home have been represented to show as . accurately as possibly the original interior. According to Heritage England, who . carried out the work, visitors will be encouraged to relax and enjoy the . new interiors, take in the view and discover the stories of Kenwood. The library at Kenwood House is one of the most picturesque rooms in the property. It will be open to the public when the refurbishment is complete later this month . Kenwood contains purchases from a sale of objects from Scone Palace. These include silver tableware, four chairs in the Chinese Chippendale style and a family portrait by Sir Peter Lely . The Iveagh Bequest includes important paintings by many great artists, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Turner, Reynolds and Gainsborough. The rooms displaying the Iveagh . Bequest, referencing the time when the house was donated to the nation . by Lord Iveagh a member of the Guinness brewing family, have been . presented to suggest an 18th-century gentleman's lifestyle, in keeping . with the former owner's original wishes. Kenwood is known for its fascinating . social and political history, with links to law reform, slavery, brewing . and philanthropy told through the lives of the people who lived and . worked there. The newly refurbished rooms now feature family trails, an interactive dolls house, original letters and architectural designs. Also in situ are priceless collection of artworks by Rembrandt, Van Dyke and Gainsborough which were originally owned by Lord Iveagh. They have spent nearly a year on the road as the Heath’s famous stately home closed its doors for the restoration. English Heritage curator Laura Houliston, replaces books in the . library. The property's reopening has been lauded as a chance for adults and children to learn about one of the country's historic homes . Furnishings on the outside of the house, such as these period metal benches have been given a touch-up ahead of the reopening. Inside, Wendy Richardson, a member of the Conservation Team, cleans a bookshelf in the Library . The house, dating from the 1600s, was . closed from the start of April while vital roof repairs are done and . the landmark cream facade is stripped down and repaired. The art collection will traveled to three galleries in America in a year-long tour called the Art of Kenwood in London. Paul Griffiths who oversaw the work as English Heritage’s area manager for historic properties in and around London said: 'This really is [architect Robert] Adam’s masterpiece ' The Guitar Player by Johannes Vermeer, on display at Kenwood House, is just one of the works of art which were bequeathed to the nation .

A killer who bludgeoned a betting shop manager to death for less than £300 just yards away from a police safer neighbourhood team office is facing a life sentence. Shafique Aarij, 21, battered married father-of-three Andrew Iacovou repeatedly with a claw hammer at a branch of Ladbrokes in Morden, Surrey, before leaving him to die. Aarij, a regular gambler at the shop, deliberately targeted the bookies when he knew only one member of staff was present. He grabbed £296.68 from a till tray before ‘calmly’ walking out of the store, splattered in his victim’s blood, and catching a bus. Killer: Shafique Aarij bludgeoned a betting shop manager to death for less than £300, just yards away from a police safer neighbourhood team office . Mr Iacovou, 55, desperately hit the panic button but local police were not even alerted as the call only went to Ladbrokes’ head office. Cameras also failed to capture the incident as he was knocked straight to the floor during the attack, Southwark Crown Court heard. For 90 minutes he lay helpless on the other side of the counter while punters came in to play on the fruit machines, unaware the manager was even there. Mr Iacovou’s lifeless body was eventually discovered by a shocked customer, who called the emergency services. Victim: Andrew Iacovou, the manager of the Ladbrokes branch and a married father-of-three . A post-mortem found he suffered haemorrhages and brain injuries after the brutal killing at the Aberconway Road branch, where he worked for 20 years, at around 8.30am on May 25 this year. Mr Iacovou was pronounced dead at the scene at 10.28am, next to the hammer which claimed his life. The killing took place just minutes away from the Merton SNT, the court heard. Aarij admitted being present at the store and killing Mr Iacovou. But he denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility after claiming he suffered from psychotic schizophrenia. A jury of eight men and four women found him guilty after just 49 minutes of deliberating. Members of Mr Iacovou’s family, including his mother, who all attended the entire week-long trial, wept as the verdict was announced. Aarij, flanked in the dock by mental health officers, showed no emotion. Judge Anthony Leonard QC adjourned sentence and said: ‘Before I pass sentence its right I get up to date medical reports particularly from the hospital he is being held at.’ Prosecutor Max Hill QC had earlier told the jury: ‘Contrary to something that he was to claim to the police later after he was arrested, the defendant did not go on the gaming machines at Ladbrokes that Saturday morning. ‘The defendant comes up to the service window by the cash office and gesticulates at Mr Iacovou. ‘You may conclude that was a ruse by this defendant to induce Mr Iacovou to open the security door to the cash office. ‘Mr Iacovou seems to have managed during the struggle to press a panic alarm button, but that action was virtually his last, because this defendant felled him with a hammer blow to the head.’ Aarij then rained further blows on Mr Iacovou’s head as he lay helpless on the floor. ‘Mr Iacovou was killed on the spot,’ Mr Hill said. Andrew Iacovou died at the Aberconway Road branch of Ladbrokes, Morden, Surrey . ‘Having killed Mr Iacovou, the defendant them removed his baseball cap, wiped his brow, replaced the cap and then set about stealing cash from the counter.’ ‘Although Mr Iacovou activated the panic alarm, CCTV simply showed the back of the defendant’s head as he stood at the till. ‘When this defendant made off with just under £300 in cash, he left Mr Iacovou entirely alone.’ Aarij also unsuccessfully tried to break into the store safe before casually walking out with a splash of blood on his right cheek. 'Mr Iacovou was mortally wounded and never regained consciousness. He died on the floor of the security office,’ Mr Hill said. ‘Because of where he lay, he was almost concealed to the outer world and was not discovered for an hour and a half.’ Aarij, of no fixed address, will be sentenced on a date to be fixed.","Shafique Aarij, 21, facing life sentence for horrific attack on father-of-three .

Christmas has become so commercialised it has lost its true meaning, David Blunkett has warned. The former Home Secretary claimed ‘fairy lights, tinsel and extravagant presents’ have made us forget about those who do not have families to celebrate with. Mr Blunkett used the example of one of his constituents – who organises an annual Christmas lunch for hundreds of lonely and homeless people – to highlight the importance of helping others over the festive period. David Blunkett has warned that Christmas has become so commercialised it has lost its true meaning . Saying we should be ‘counting our blessings’ rather than feeling sorry for ourselves, he urged families to relearn the ‘true spirit of Christmas’ by inviting less fortunate into their homes. He told the Radio Times [must credit]: ‘Charles Dickens published A Christmas Carol in 1843, introducing the world to Ebenezer Scrooge and Tiny Tim. It remains perhaps the most popular Christmas fiction story of our time. ‘But since it was written, it saddens me that Christmas has become so commercialised and over-hyped that its true meaning has become lost beneath the welter of fairy lights, tinsel and extravagant presents. ‘But despite what I say, I am not a Scrooge. I like Christmas and recall with fondness the simpler Christmasses of my childhood. It’s an occasion when most of us look forward to spending time with family and those we love. The former Home Secretary told the Radio Times ¿fairy lights, tinsel and extravagant presents¿ have made us forget about those who do not have families to celebrate with . ‘Nevertheless, for some, Christmas will bring only heartache and loneliness, and the thought of families getting together to celebrate serves only to make the loneliness worse.’ Mr Blunkett said the story of one woman in his Sheffield constituency was ‘heart-warming’. Every Christmas Day for the past six years, Gloria Stewart, 63, has organised a lunch for lonely and homeless people by gathering funds, food donations and volunteers from local businesses. In the past, the event – staffed by volunteers from a bank branch – has welcomed single mothers, dementia patients and a 105-year-old pensioner. He said: ‘Her story began in November 2008, when she attended a hospital appointment and asked those around her whether they were looking forward to Christmas. ‘She was shocked to find that many of those she spoke to were not. In fact, they were dreading the festive period as they found it a very lonely time, and one elderly lady was preparing yet again to spend Christmas Day alone in bed. ‘Although not in the best of health herself, Gloria had the idea of organising a Christmas lunch for some of the hundreds of people destined to spend the season in isolation. Believing that there must be others in the community who felt as she did and would be willing to help, she set about raising funds.’ The Labour MP added: ‘Her first dinner was attended by 87 people and over the years, the event has grown and grown. This year several hundred guests will sit down to lunch, to enjoy turkey and trimmings, a singsong and a smile. ‘No one, least of all Gloria, could have dreamed that her idea would have expanded in the way that it has and become a major event in Sheffield. It is a massive logistical task but each year, she manages to pull it off.’ Mr Blunkett said we should take inspiration from Mrs Stewart and welcome others into our homes on Christmas Day or help create similar festive occasions.

Former chief constable of North Yorkshire Police Grahame Maxwell, who along with Adam Briggs, has been asked to pay back £100,000 after a review of the legality of allowances paid to them . A disgraced former chief constable and his deputy who left their force after being embroiled in a high level nepotism inquiry have been asked to pay back £100,000 in allowance payments. North Yorkshire's former chief constable Grahame Maxwell and his deputy Adam Briggs will be written to and asked to pay back . the cash after a review of historic and current payments made by the force. If repayment is not forthcoming, the . North Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Julie Mulligan will seeking legal advice on potential further steps . to recover the money. Mr Maxwell was the chief until last year, when his contract was not renewed. Mr Briggs retired two years ago. Both were . embroiled in controversy over allegations that they helped relatives in . police recruitment processes. Mr Maxwell was given a final written . warning after admitting gross misconduct following claims of nepotism. His deputy Mr Briggs was cleared of . helping a relative get round part of the recruitment process to become a . PC but still received 'management advice' as a result of the . investigation into his conduct. Mr Maxwell's contract was not renewed last year and he left the force with a controversial £250,000 golden goodbye. Today, Ms Mulligan and . current chief constable Dave Jones published a decision notice on their . review about the allowances paid to them while they were in their posts. Ms . Mulligan said the review was commissioned to see whether all elements . of chief police officer allowance packages paid in the past had a solid . legal basis. Details of the specific elements of pay involved have not been disclosed but they are understood to included payment of 'personal development' allowances and a car allowance. The notice . said: 'The review found that there were some elements which were paid to . Mr Maxwell and Mr Briggs that, although decided upon in good faith at . the time, do not appear with hindsight to have been within the legal . power of the police authority. 'Whilst additional details are sought and further specialist legal advice is obtained, commissioner Julia Mulligan is asking for certain sums to be repaid by former chief police officers, specifically Mr Maxwell and Mr Briggs. 'The total amount involved is £99,866, identified over the six-year period examined by the review. The commissioner is also seeking further information on past payments and expenditure.' In a joint statement, Ms Mulligan and Mr Jones said: 'This report was commissioned as a consequence of public concern locally about payments made to former chief officers. Embroiled in controversy: Adam Briggs, former Deputy Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police . 'We have decided to take a series of actions, including seeking repayment of almost £100,000, to resolve this issue once and for all. 'Once the report has been published, it will be the first time North Yorkshire Police will have published a report of this nature, and is in stark contrast to the old way of doing business and keeping reports like these under lock and key. 'It is an example of how committed we are to transparency and openness.' Ms Mulligan told BBC Radio York: 'It's taxpayers' money they have had and we have asked for them to pay it back.' Asked whether the North Yorkshire review had ramifications for other force areas, Mrs Mulligan said: 'It definitely does. I've spoken to a number of commissioners who are facing similar circumstances and they are going through a similar process, considering what action they are going to take and seeking legal advice. 'In the light of what's happened here, I absolutely would say PCCs do need to have a really good look at this and I do know that many of them are.'","It follows a review of historic and current payments made by their force .

The Virginia State Senator whose son stabbed him before shooting himself has spoken out about the incident for the first time. Creigh Deeds was released from the hospital on Friday after his 24-year-old son Gus stabbed him multiple times, and now he has told how he plans to dedicate his life to improving the mental health system. 'I am alive for a reason, and I will work for change,' Mr Deeds said. 'I owe that to my precious son.' Close: Gus Deeds (left) stabbed his father Creigh (right) before shooting himself dead and now his father has vowed to work to improve Virginia's mental health program (seen together during Creigh's gubernatorial bid in 2009) Gus Deeds had health issues and had been ordered into emergency custody on Monday, but was released after only six hours because the psychiatric hospital did not have a bed for him. Gus went to get treated at the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, a state-run mental health agency, and they held him there until 6.30pm on Monday November 18. He then went to his father's home and 13 hours after his release, he attacked the 55-year-old former gubernatorial candidate. Gus and his father were said to have had a close relationship, and he was a fixture on his dad's failed campaign in 2009. 'I have very strong opinions about the (Community Services Board), and feel like they are responsible,' Mr Deeds told The Record newspaper of Highland County. 'My life’s work now is to make sure other families don’t have to go through what we are living,' he said as reported by The Richmond Times-Dispatch. Grieving: Deeds, seen hugging his son after his concession speech in 2009, faults the psychiatric hospital for releasing his son just 13 hours before the attack due to a technicality and due to a lack of beds . Mr Deed's clear view of the fault of the medical agencies is now being questioned since three hospitals in Western Virginia came out saying that they had beds for Gus, who had been in and out of college in recent years due to health issues. Administrators at Western State Hospital in Staunton, Rockingham Memorial Hospital in Harrisonburg and the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville- all of which were within a two hour drive- told The Washington Post that they had open psychiatric beds at the time Gus was released. The conflicting reports have prompted three different investigations into the release and ensuing attack.

Mr Deeds was released from the University of Virginia hospital after being treated for his stab wounds. He was able to get himself out of his house where Gus had attacked him and walk to the road where a relative happened to be driving by. Gus died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on the scene.

Quick thinking: Stephen Turner became a hero after he steered a Huddersfield bus to safety in these bushes after the driver collapsed at the wheel on a steep hill . A hero managed to save a group of passengers on a runaway bus after grabbing the wheel when the driver collapsed. Father-of-three Stephen Turner, 56, had only been on board for 10 yards when the vehicle began careering down a hill in West Yorkshire. The driver of the single decker had passed out and the bus was rolling out of control towards a busy junction and traffic lights. When he realised what had happened, Mr Turner, of Dalton, Huddersfield, jumped out of his seat but found he could not move the driver from his chair or reach the pedals. He then grabbed the wheel and steered the runaway bus around a lamppost, bringing it to a halt in some trees and bushes on the side of the road. All eight passengers escaped injury and the bus driver has since been discharged from hospital. The incident happened on the 341 Stocksmoor to Huddersfield service in Yorkshire at 12.30pm on Saturday. 'I noticed the driver was leaning over but at first I thought he was checking the cash machine,' Mr Turner said. 'But then there was a judder as we caught the kerb and slumped even further into the aisle. 'My first thought was how to slow the bus down. I just did what came instinctively.' He had got on the Yorkshire Tiger bus with his wife, Janice, 54, and said  he noticed something was wrong with the driver after just 10 yards. He said: 'I took it into some trees and bushes on the left to slow it down and had to swerve round a lamppost at one point. 'I realised I couldn't go fully into the trees as it might have flipped the bus over. Fortunately it stopped. 'I'm just glad everyone is safe, when the driver came round he had no idea what had happened and his eyes were glazed.' Evasive action: Mr Turner had to grab the wheel of the 341 bus, similar to this one, but could not stop it moving because the driver was slumped with his feet on the pedals . Incredible: The bus was heading down this hill towards a major junction before Mr Turner took control . Stephen, who has a three sons - Craig, 29, Leigh, 27, and Glenn, 21, said: 'I just did what I needed to do. 'I even surprised myself, especially when you think what could have happened'. After he had spoken to the authorities Stephen and his wife jumped on another bus and continued their journey in to town. Passenger Richard Brabiner, 40, who witnessed the drama, said: 'I was sitting on the back seat and a woman at the front of the bus noticed the driver was leaned over. 'She thought he was just checking his mirrors then realised he had actually passed out. 'The man who steered the bus is the one who saved the day. I didn't even get his name but I thanked him once we stopped and he waited for the police and ambulance to arrive.' Martin Gilbert, business director at Yorkshire Tiger buses, said: 'We want to express our huge appreciation to Mr Turner and his quick thinking and reactions.'","Stephen Turner, 56, was only on board for seconds before he took control .

Cigarettes will be sold in plain packaging by May 2015 following an astonishing double U-turn by David Cameron. Ministers today battled to insist they were not 'playing catch-up' as Labour claimed the government had only acted after being faced with the prospect of a major defeat in the House of Lords. Now new laws are to be rushed forward so that a ban on branded packets can be introduced before the next general election, ahead of a review of the evidence from Australia, the first country to impose plain packaging. Scroll down for video . U-turn: Britain is to follow Australia, which became the first country to pass laws forcing cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging . Just four months ago the Prime Minister angered health campaigners by dropping a promise to introduce a ban. Amid a sense of chaos, Downing Street over-ruled the Department of Health to insist the plans would not go ahead. It prompted Labour leader Ed Miliband to accuse Mr Cameron of being the 'Prime Minister for Benson and Hedge Funds'. Campaigners believe plain packaging will make cigarettes less attractive to smokers, particularly the young. Ministers are to rush through laws giving power to copy Australia where cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking . They were backed by then-health minister Anna Soubry who admitted  ‘gorgeous’ cigarette packets persuaded her to take up smoking as a ‘symbol of glamour’. And one study in Australia found that those buying cigarettes in unbranded brown packets were 81 per cent more likely to consider quitting. Now the government has asked paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler to carry out a review of the evidence, which will be completed by March. The move is also designed to defuse a toxic row about the influence of Mr Cameron’s controversial strategy chief Lynton Crosby. The Prime Minister was dogged by questions about lobbying when he blocked plans by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for a ban in July – because Mr Crosby’s firm works for tobacco giant Philip Morris. David Cameron (left) had been accused of bowing to pressure from strategist Lynton Crosby (right) to block the plain packaging laws, something Number 10 denies . Nick Clegg today admitted he had broken another promise: he has not given up smoking. Two years ago he announced he had given up his ‘evening fags’ because he wanted to be able  to out-run his three sons when they are teenagers. But challenged over his pledge as the government announced plans for plain cigarette packaging, Mr Clegg admitted he had suffered a lapse. ‘I’m trying to be a little less categorical.  I do lapse from time to time, but my smoking habit is much, much more under control than it ever was. ‘I don’t every day, it’s much, much less. But, what I’m not going to pretend is that I will never ever smoke a cigarette again in my life, because I suspect I might well.’ He said he started smoking in his early teens, but suggested peer pressure played a bigger part than packaging. He added: ‘My memory is actually that it was so much to do with peer pressure, it was all the boys and girls in my year were smoking, and just holding out from that. ‘Now, what the evidence does appear to suggest is that one of the things that drives…it’s not the only thing, but one of the things that drives, is the kind of glamour with which cigarette packages are presented and marketed. ‘If the evidence shows as the emerging evidence appears to show that this would make a difference, then we as a government of course will take that step.’ His about-turn came shortly after it . emerged Mr Crosby had told him to ‘get the barnacles off the boat’ – a . reference to dumping controversial policies ahead of the election. Mr . Cameron denied being lobbied directly by his elections adviser but . refused to say whether the two men had discussed the issue. Public health minister Jane Ellison said accused Labour of being 'rather miserable' for suggesting that the Government was merely trying to avoid a defeat in the Lords, where a vote on the issue is due shortly. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'People do feel strongly, and quite rightly, This is fundamentally about children's health. 'We know that two-thirds of people start smoking when they are children. 'It is quite a complex area of policy and we know from the Australian experience that it is quite controversial. It is a quick review, we've asked Sir Cyril to report by March, to have a look, to take that independent view, to step back from the politics of this and to survey the evidence for us. 'I think that is a sensible next step in making policy in this area.' But Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'If the Government were serious it would be taking action now to cut the harm from tobacco to children. 'Instead, we’ve got another review and why have we got this announcement now? 'It’s because the Government was on the verge of losing a vote in the House of Lords in the next couple of weeks. 'So, I don’t believe this is a serious move that they’ve now converted to the cause and I’m afraid it’s just a tactic to avoid humiliation in the House of Lords.' Health campaigners had urged the government to follow Australia which this year became the only country to adopt plain packaging, all cigarette packs are drab green. Research suggests non-smokers and young people find less appealing. A Government source said the move to ban branded packets would put a stop to claims from the opposition about Mr Cameron being in hoc to the tobacco lobby: ‘This will nail Labour’s ridiculous smears. Now the pressure will be on Labour to get behind this amendment to enable the introduction of standardised packaging.’ But health sources insisted that months of internal wrangling and continued pressure from campaigners, also played a part in the decision. In July, ministers said they were  shelving the proposed ban because of insufficient evidence that it would work. There were also fears that the Government will become embroiled in a long and costly legal dispute with the tobacco industry, which argues that a ban would be illegal. A ban is also opposed by many Tories, who view it as nanny state interference. A health source last night said: ‘We always said we would look at the emerging evidence and this is the earliest opportunity to do it.’ Cigarettes have already been banned from being displayed on view in shops, and are instead sold under the counter . Smoking causes over 100,000 deaths every year in the UK and the Policy Exchange think tank has estimated it costs society £14billion. Despite a huge reduction in the numbers since the 1950s, it is  estimated that one in five Britons still smoke. The move was welcomed by health campaigners today. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: 'Stopping cigarettes being marketed to children as a glamorous and desirable accessory is one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation. 'If this becomes law next year there is no question that it will save thousands of lives in the future.' Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This is an early Christmas present for all of the campaigners that have been working tirelessly to save young lives.' But Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: 'This could potentially be a very disappointing U-turn by the Government. 'Plain packaging will have a negligible impact on health, will boost the black market, and do enormous harm to small businesses. 'In the words of David Cameron, let's treat adults like adults and give them more responsibility over their own lives.'","Branded cigarette packets to be banished from shelves by May 2015 .

Three mischievous pigs who fled their woodland pen to go on a month-long rampage had almost doubled in size by the time the farmer had found them. The six-month-old sows broke free from their sty in the Forest of Bowland, Lancaster, where they were fed only grass as part of an environmental initiative. Perhaps unsatisfied with their meager diet, the trio of Saddleback pigs escaped from the enclosure they shared with one other, sparking a lengthy man hunt which ended in their capture a month later. Guilty: The three fugitive pigs were eventually found after having gone on the run for almost a month . When the six-month-old sows were eventually tracked down their keeper was shocked to discover they had ballooned in size . The pigs were eventually found grazing in a farmer's field by their keeper, Phil Dykes, reserve officer for the . Lancashire Wildlife Trust. 'We’d had them for about three weeks . and then three of them decided to do a runner under the fence. 'We could never understand why one stayed, but she got very sad lonely and had to go home to her owners. 'We had volunteers going to see them every day so it was my wife Rose who went one day and found three of them had gone. 'We started searching and going out with a bucket of food - their favourite - but there was no sign of them.' The mischievous pigs left one other behind in the sty when they escaped in the Forest of Bowland, Lancaster . The animals were found grazing on a farmer's land, and put up a strong fight before being wrestled to the ground and taken back to their sty . Keeper, Phil Dykes, eventually found the animals after following trails of their excrement. He had become worried for the animals' welfare when they didn't return to the pen shortly after going missing . Mr Dykes, who began to worry for their welfare, eventually tracked them down by their excrement. 'I have become quite the expert in dung,' he said. 'I was worried about them because they had been gone so long and I was starting to think someone might have rounded them up. I was sure someone would have seen them in nearly a month, so I was very relieved to find them.' It took three grown men to tackle the mischievous pigs to the ground before they were taken home. 'We had to have a pig wrestling match to get them on dog leads so we could take them home. The pigs were taking part in a woodland environmental project to keep grass short and benefit the environment when they escaped . The Tamworth Two, Butch and Sundance, famously escaped the butcher's knife before being settled into a sanctuary by the Daily Mail in 1998 . 'They thought it was highly amusing, but they were worn out when we finally got them home' 'They have been happy as Larry since they got back. They are very inquisitive animals and they were definitely pleased to see us.' Their great escape bears resemblance to that of the Tamworth Two, a pair of pigs who managed to flee a transit lorry while being taken to an abattoir in 1998. Named after film outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the siblings were six months old when they made headlines across the world. After being recaptured, the animals were treated to a luxury life in the Rare Breeds Centre in Woodchurch near Ashford, Kent, by the Daily Mail.","Three six-month-old pigs fled their woodland pen for month of indulgence .

Controversial: Ron Hogg, from Durham Constabulary, claims claims 'consumption rooms' for heroin users would help curb crime . Drug addicts should be given ‘safe heroin’ and a private place to inject it – all at taxpayers’ expense, according to an elected police commissioner. Ron Hogg, the Police and Crime Commissioner in charge of Durham Constabulary, said the state should provide heroin for free and ‘consumption rooms’ where addicts can inject without fear of arrest or prosecution. It would cost the state an estimated £18,000 a year per user. The Labour politician, who is a former senior police officer, said: ‘We want the health service to provide addicts with safe heroin, with consistent purities and safe additives. We believe this will help reduce disease and death. This doesn’t mean we’re going soft on drugs in any way. ‘What we are saying is we have a group of people here who commit large numbers of crimes to feed their habits and those illegal drugs cause massive health problems.’ However, critics rejected his proposal. Kathy Gyngell, a research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies, said it was ‘totally irresponsible’, adding: ‘Shouldn’t we be spending that money on intensive rehab and trying to get them off drugs?’ Mr Hogg’s suggestion was also shot down by the Home Office. A spokesman said the Government had ‘no plans to allow drug consumption rooms’. Earlier this year Mr Hogg’s chief constable, Mike Barton, called for the legalisation of class A drugs like heroin and cocaine as the war against them had ‘failed’. Mr Hogg said he was not suggesting drugs should be freely available, but said better regulation could help bring a halt to addiction. Mr Hogg, a former senior policeman, said: 'The successes of trials around the world have led both myself and chief constable Mike Barton to believe that using drug consumption rooms to treat heroin addiction should be explored further - certainly county-wide. ‘Results published in the Lancet showed that prescribing pharmaceutical heroin in this way can reduce the use of street drugs and associated levels of crime.’ Pilot schemes which involved decriminalising drugs have already been held in London, Brighton and Darlington. Councillors in East Sussex are set to consider consumption rooms - often dubbed ‘shooting galleries’ - in Brighton next year. But Public Health England, part of the Department of Health, said consumption rooms might not be the best way to tackle illegal drug use. It said: ‘These facilities would be expensive to provide and may not be the most cost effective way of achieving outcomes for service users.’ Danish solution: One of Copenhagen's consumption rooms, available to the city's 8,000 hard drug users . Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, slammed the scheme as a misuse of public funds. He said: 'Many people will have very serious reservations about their money being spent in this manner. 'Police chiefs should be doing their part to tackle addiction, not spending taxpayers’ money facilitating it. 'Ultimately . taxpayers would be paying for a room for people to break the law in, . something that could have very serious and unforeseen consequences.' Copenhagen, in Denmark, already runs a similar scheme to the one proposed by Mr Hogg. There are 8,000 hard drug users there, who all have access to two drug consumption rooms, launched last year and this August. Ivan Christensen, who manages the rooms, told the BBC: 'We are providing a clean environment for long-term addicts and we have found that they are now much more likely to access other health services in the area.' Theory: Mr Hogg quoted a study that claims prescribing pharmaceutical heroin can lead to a reduction in crime .","Ron Hogg, crime commissioner for Durham, said 'consumption rooms' would help curb crime .

A 37-year-old man who ran away with a 15-year-old girl and sparked a state-wide search boasted two months ago that they shared a 'secret', it was revealed today. Emily Lalinksy and Robert Messer were found in a Michigan field on Tuesday afternoon and each were taken to separate hospitals where they received treatment for dehydration and ‘superficial self-inflicted wounds’ to the wrist. Lieutenant Cal Lauria told MailOnline: ‘Emily’s still in hospital. They were both dehydrated when they were found and they’re keeping her in a bit longer.’ Scroll down for video .

He said he was not authorized to comment on whether the wrist wounds found on both Emily and Messer were part of a suicide pact formed between the couple. Messer is in police custody pending charges and has been placed on suicide watch. Emily's mother is still reeling from the shocking disappearance on Sunday - completely unaware just how close the Messer, a family friend, had got to her daughter. But a search online shows that Messer at least was becoming increasingly brazen in his show of devotion. On his Instagram account two months ago he posted a picture of Emily with the caption: 'Looks like someone knows a secret'. More...

Yesterday Emily’s family spoke of their relief and delight that the teenager had been found. Asked by text whether she was pleased to have her daughter home, Emily’s mother, Lisa Schwartz replied simply: ‘You betcha.’ She summed up the ordeal as ‘every parent’s nightmare.’ Emily and Messer were found in a field in Washtenaw County, near 7 Mile and Chubbs Road in Northville. Their discovery brought to an end a search that began when Emily vanished from her home in Plymouth Township four days ago. Found: Emily Lalinksy, pictured with Robert Messer, is staying in hospital for longer after they were found suffering from identical 'self-inflicted' wrist wounds . During that time police had feared for her safety. Emily's mother had made public appeals for her safe return on television, during which she admitted: ‘I think once Bob realizes what he has done he might hurt himself and I don’t know where that would leave her.’ Speaking today from the family home in a quiet Plymouth neighborhood Lisa’s husband, Neil said: ‘Lisa’s priority now is Emily and looking after her.’ Relieved that the teen is back in her mother’s arms he reacted angrily to comments made by former neighbor, Donna Kelm, yesterday. Mrs Kelm told MailOnline that she had seen Messer and Emily ‘kissing in his truck and holding hands,’ Mr Schwartz said: ‘If somebody saw something why didn’t they say anything? Why didn’t she tell us or report it to authorities. ‘I have no respect for somebody saying that now.’ He added: ‘I’ve only been in her life for the past couple of years but I’m telling you if we’d known something we’d have done something.’ As a family it is clear that the Schwartzs feel deeply betrayed by Messer, a man who has known Emily since she was a little girl and who Mrs Schwartz regarded as a ‘father figure’ for her six children. Both Messer and the teenager left notes professing their love for each other, with Emily asking her mother to try not to blame herself. Messer, recently divorced and father to a son, wrote: ‘We are in love and cannot be apart from each other. Distress: Emily's mother, Lisa, and her new husband, Neil Schwartz, are delighted she is back home. However, Neil told MailOnline he is angered that a neighbor who claimed to have seen Emily and Messer kissing in a truck didn't report it to anyone . Explanation: They left behind a letter explaining why they had run away and apologizing to their families . Desperate search: Police had been appealing to the public for help and received a number of tips that may have led them to the couple's hiding place . ‘This is sad to us but our love, though we’ve had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of our lives. Please be happy for us.’ In a heartfelt note to her mother, Emily wrote: ‘You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I’m so sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would’ve done it. ‘Try not to be sad and don’t blame yourself, nothing could be done.’ Messer had become a friend of Emily’s mother when they met at church. ‘I trusted him,’ Schwartz told ABC7 at the height of her search for her daughter. ‘My whole family trusted him. My daughter trusted him. Bob was always like a brother to me. ‘Emily doesn’t have a dad, so she always looked up to Bob as a dad, as a father figure. They’re both very introverted. They both love photography and they both love hiking.’ She said that far from feeling concern at Messer’s involvement in her teenage daughter’s life she had been grateful for the time he spent with her. She said: ‘With me having so many kids I could not just take her and do things with her, so he was like, “I’ll take her to Ann Arbor, I’ll take her to the Botanical Gardens.’","Emily Lalinsky and Robert Messer were found in a field in Washtenaw County, Michigan on Tuesday afternoon .

Two giggling women have been filmed twerking on the New York subway - in path of thundering trains and inches from a 600-volt rail. Police are investigating the video, in which a male friend can be heard laughing as the tattooed pair in black sweatshirts plead: 'No face! No face!'. Scroll down for video . Idiots in training: Two women twerking on subway tracks. One stuck out her tongue like Miley Cyrus . I've Been Twerking on the Railroad: The women perform in an apparently deserted subway station in New York . Unsafe: The scene is thought to be on the 8th Avenue line where trains run 24 hours a day on a live rail . A Metropolitan Transport Authority spokesman told the New York Daily News the video is thought to have been shot on the 8th Avenue line, which carries subway routes A, C and E. The three routes run 24 hours a day and trains are as often as every five minutes. They also use a 600-volt live rail - which it appears can be seen in the video and has caused high-profile deaths recently. The shocking clip has been viewed more than 50,000 times in the day since it was uploaded to YouTube, prompting outrage on the video sharing site. Several users said the pair should 'win a Darwin award' for their supposed attempt to eliminate themselves from the gene pool. Blurred Lines: As well as calling the stunt unsafe, some viewers said the women were simply bad at twerking . Embarrassment: One of the women covers her face as her friend moves round to film her. Police are investigating after fears the women could have been hit by regular trains or electrocuted themselves . Craze: Twerking has gone global since Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke performed at the VMA awards . Others complained they were not very good at twerking. The . rump-shaking craze has exploded since pop star Miley Cyrus performed . the energetic dance with Robin Thicke at the VMA awards earlier this year. Videos have flooded the internet of twerkers performing in some curious places, including libraries, car bonnets, church and even - in one case - on the grave of the performer's grandmother. The video has been passed to the NYPD, who are investigating. One viewer on Youtube suggested it could also have been shot at Fordham Road station in the Bronx. It is on the D line, which also runs all night with trains as often as every six minutes. It comes after high-profile deaths involving the lethal live rail on New York's subway over the summer. Matthew Zeno, 30, drunkenly urinated on the 600-volt rail in Brooklyn and was killed by the current passing through the stream. A friend who tried to help him was also injured. Another man was fatally electrocuted two weeks later when he dropped his cellphone on the tracks in Greenwich Village and jumped down to find it. In February, New York recorded nine subway injuries - three of which were fatal - over just six days. The third rail is used to power trains and usually carries a standard 625 volts. It becomes fatal when people or animals connect it to the ground. If part of a person is touching the ground and part is touching the live rail, the current will take the shortest route to earth, handing its victim a lethal dose of electricity.","Tattooed pair danced inches from a 600-volt live rail in New York .

Now all that is set to change with the release of Hollywood Dogs, a glossy coffee table book that gives you a closer look at the canine stars of the 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s. Among the famous hounds featured in the book are German Shepherd Rin Tin Tin, who appeared in no fewer than 26 different films, and Asta, the Wire Fox Terrier best known for his role as Skippy. Movie star: Jean Simmons cuddles up to a tiny dog on the set of Spartacus, in which she played Varinia, in 1960 .

During his lengthy screen career, Pal also found time to sire Lassie Junior, who took on the role after his father retired, and in turn sired the next Lassie, Spook. Another famous canine to appear in the lengthy tome is Terry the (female) Cairn Terrier who played the iconic role of Toto in the Wizard of Oz, and also featured in another 15 films, including Bad Little Angel, The Women and The Chocolate Soldier.

Bitter: Michelle has pursued he former husband for years over his refusal to disclose his full worth and reach a settlement . A ‘bankrupt’ tycoon at the centre of the country’s most acrimonious divorce case stood to make £2.8 billion from Facebook shares, the High Court heard today. Scot Young, 51, also received £80m in cash payments between 2004 and 2009 ‘for which no entries were found in the bank statements provided’, the court was told. The businessman is accused by his estranged wife Michelle, 49, of hiding the proceeds of his empire in a bid to deny her a huge cash settlement. Mr Young was said to be worth £400m in 2006 but now claims to be penniless and heavily indebted. But his wife has demanded £300m, maintaining her husband is worth ‘a few billion at least’. She has claimed to be living in a Pimlico bedsit and struggling to make ends meet. Today Rex Howling QC, for Mrs Young, referred to a forensic analysis of Mr Young’s bank accounts. The search had revealed ‘a phenomenal amount of money’ passing through them, Mr Howling said. ‘There was £134m of cash movement through your various accounts between January 2004 and October 2009. ‘A total of £80m of payments were made to Mr Young, for which no entries were found in the bank statements provided.’ The barrister also referred to a hand-written note of Mr Young, which was seized in 2012. The scrap of paper mentioned the Facebook flotation and a share deal involving Silicon Valley giant Sean Parker, the social network’s first president. ‘Will make $4.5 billion’, it concluded. Mr Young denies the claims but insisted: ‘This is just a random piece of paper with my scribbling.‘Can I state for the record that I have never owned shares in Facebook in any shape or form’, he said. Mr Howling asked why Mr Young had paid out a £200,000 deposit on two villa in February 2006, during the period of his supposed ‘financial demise’. ‘If you knew that you were already in difficulty, why were you investing £200,000 in that sort of project?’, Mr Howling asked. ‘Because I was getting it at a very good discount to the market value’, Mr Young responded. The businessman was asked why he had received emails and service charge bills for London properties he claimed not to own to which he responded: 'I think its a little bit unfair that I’m being asked to prove a negative.' Mr Young was also quizzed on a labyrinthine network of companies which it is alleged were used to hide his vast fortune. ‘These are all public companies!’, he exclaimed. ‘That doesn’t prevent you owning small or large shareholdings in those companies’, Mr Howling said. Defiant: Alex Young claims he never owned Facebook shares and is penniless despite bank records showing £134million passing between his accounts . But Mr Young contested this claiming that such ownership would have been disclosed to the court. Yesterday the court heard from lawyer Stephen Jones, of Jirehouse Capital. Mr Jones frequently avoided questions by citing legal privilege, but denied helping Mr Young create a ‘sham’ bankruptcy. Mr Justice Moor had earlier rejected a bid to hear his evidence in private. Moving on: Scot Young pictured his model and TV presenter girlfriend Noelle Reno . Later, the court heard from Paul Osborne, senior partner at city law firm Fox Williams, who had regularly dealt with Mr Young. Mr . Howling said Fox Williams held around 200 ledgers, and 'hundreds if not . thousands of files' related to Mr Young's business activities. He asked Mr Osborne whether his firm had retained any documentation which had not been disclosed but they claimed they had not. The court however did hear Mr Young concede that around 30 to 40 'residual' and unimportant files remained. 'They had no interest in those matters', he said. The court also heard a fresh explanation for 'Project Marriage Walk' which was a plan to purchase a house in Bletchley Park, rather than a plot to hide Mr Young's wealth during the breakdown of his marriage, the court heard. The court also heard from Gwilym Davies, dubbed Mr Young's 'first lieutenant'. He called his former boss 'quite secretive' and admitted that Mr Young would 'keep the bigger things to himself'. Mrs Young audibly scoffed as Mr Davies said his salary from Mr Young had been £120,000 per annum. Mr Young was jailed for three months earlier this year after he refused to reveal information about his finances. He was found in contempt of court in what Mr Justice Moor said was ‘flagrant and deliberate’ disobedience. The Youngs met in 1986 and have two daughters together but separated in 2006. Their bitter divorce proceedings have lasted for several years and the hearing continues.","Scot Young, 51, is accused by his estranged wife Michelle, 49, of hiding the proceeds of his empire to avoid reaching an expensive divorce settlement .

She is accused of murdering her baby son Callum, after keeping his existence a secret . A young mother battered her 11-month-old son to death after covering up months of abuse by pretending he was not her child, the Old Bailey heard today. Emma Wilson, 25, is accused of inflicting an 'unsurvivable brain injury' on her son Callum, who had also lost sight from a detached retina and had multiple fractures and bruising all over his body. The jury heard she used a false name for her son and claimed that she was looking after him for her cousin. She paid hardly any attention to the boy on trips to the nursery and shrugged off concerns about the number of bruises on his face, it is claimed. Two weeks before his death Callum suffered fractures to nine ribs, his left leg and his right arm, the court heard. The injuries were not discovered until the boy was rushed to hospital after being found unconscious in his cot on the morning of March 18, 2011. Wilson, who denies murder, remained calm and did not appear to be upset at the plight of her child, the court heard. Callum died two days later as a result of a severe head injury caused by a blunt impact. Wilson claimed 'constant pushing and rolling' of Callum by his then 23-month-old brother, who can not be named for legal reasons, may have been to blame. Prosecutor Paul Dunkels QC said: ‘The injuries were a culmination of a series of violent acts by her towards her vulnerable son. ‘She must have realised she was causing Callum a great deal of pain. Her last and fatal assault on him involved a forceful impact on his head. 'It must have been a directly blow to his head or striking his head on something. ‘It may have been done in a moment of temper, it might have been regretted immediately after it was done but at the critical moment that was her intention.’ A post mortem examination revealed severe swelling to the baby’s brain, to the extent it had shifted within the skull and was pushing down on the stem. There was also bleeding around the optic nerves on both eyes and he had suffered a detached retina. The pathologist also discovered old and new fractures to ribs on both the youngster’s back and front, one to his wrist and one to his lower leg. There was bruising to his face, head, chest, back and leg. The court heard Wilson tried to hide Callum’s existence from her family and friends after his birth on April 23, 2010. She became pregnant with the boy while having an affair with a young man, Lee Workman, and DNA tests later proved her partner Neil Mitchinson was not the father, jurors were told. Wilson planned to put him up for adoption and gave him away to a foster parent but changed her mind and took him into her home in November that year. Two days later a social worker noticed a tiny scratch on his face but Wilson claimed it had been caused by an older boy. In January 2011 the GP also noted five scratches to his nose and side of his face and bruises to his forehead and cheek. Wilson gave the same explanation but insisted she did not have any concerns. During the same period staff at a local nursery, the Woodlands Park Village Children’s Centre in Maidenhead, Berkshire, also noticed bruising. Wilson had given the boy’s name as Callum Keeler and claimed he was her cousin’s baby. A jury at The Old Bailey, pictured, heard Callum died from a severe head injury caused by a blunt impact . ‘She used this to distance herself from the many bruises,’ said the prosecutor. ‘Witnesses describe how Callum always used to have old and fresh bruises on his face.’ Wilson told one witness that ‘she dreaded taking him back to his mum as his mum must think she beats him’. Mr Dunkels said the abuse led to Callum becoming increasingly withdrawn and less mobile. ‘In the early days he had been a happy, smiling baby but he became blank, emotionless and listless,’ said the prosecutor. ‘She [Emma Wilson] gave the impression that her relationship with Callum was not that of mother and son. ‘It seemed that she was annoyed at having to look after Callum for her cousin.’ Experts believe that Callum suffered the fractures to his ribs, arm and leg between March 6 and 10. Mr Dunkels said that Wilson did not take her son to the nursery between March 8 and 9. ‘The prosecution suggest she may have been keeping Callum away while he made some recovery from the effects of the injuries she had caused to him at that time,’ he added. On March 11 another mother heard Callum screaming and crying at the swimming pool and then noticed him with new bruises on his face, the court heard. Four days later a nursery assistant also noticed a large bruise on his cheek and one of the mothers described him as being ‘the worst she had ever seen him,’ it is claimed. On March 17, Wilson explained away bruising by claiming that Callum had fallen off a toy at the nursery. She told staff she was not bringing him to a ‘Stay and Play’ event the next day because she did not have to look after her cousin’s child on Fridays. Mr Dunkels said: ‘Right to the end she was perpetuating her lies as to who Callum was and distancing herself from him by concealing their true relationship.’ Wilson, 25, from Windsor, told people Callum was her cousin's child. She denies murdering the 11-month-old . Photographs of Callum during this period also revealed the bruising to his face - including one in which Wilson grins next to her crying son. ‘This is a photograph taken when he is obviously pretty miserable - that doesn’t seem to be a matter of concern judging by the look on her face,’ said Mr Dunkels. Another photo showed Callum moving away from a young boy wielding a pair of open secateurs. Wilson took Callum to her parents’ home on the afternoon of March 17 before heading back to her flat in Windsor at 7pm. ‘At some time over the next 13 hours when Callum was in her sole care at her flat he received a fatal blow to his head and the earlier fractured ribs were re-fractured,’ said Mr Dunkels. Their neighbours downstairs heard five or six loud banging noises which shook their ceiling between 7.30pm and 8pm, the court heard. The next morning at around 8am Wilson’s mother dialled 999 after receiving a phone call from her daughter. Speaking to her mother, Wilson said: ‘I just got him out the cot. He was fine when he went to bed. he’s lifeless and not doing anything. He’s making noises but I don’t know.’ Paramedics noticed bruises above his left eye and on the side of his mouth. Mr Dunkels said that Wilson had been unable to put forward a ‘plausible explanation’ for the injuries. ‘Callum was in her sole care at her flat throughout that 13 hour period and nothing she has said can explain what has happened to him. ‘The effect of the injuries would have been immediate and catastrophic.’ Wilson, of Windsor, denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Two weeks before he died Callum had fractures to nine ribs, his leg and arm .

A pet dog was starved by its owners to the point where it tried to eat an umbrella to stave off hunger. Paddy, a two-year-old black spaniel, was so malnourished that he weighed just nine kilograms when he began to chew on the black plastic brolly in a desperate bid for sustenance. Rachael Pugsley, 37, and her husband Richard, 38 reluctantly took their pet to a vet when they found the tattered umbrella and realised what had happened. Starved: Paddy had not been fed properly for three weeks and was dehydrated, a court heard . Last resort: According to a vet, the malnourished dog turned to the umbrella as a desperate source of food . Staff became suspicious when, after being told that Paddy needed a £1,000 operation to remove parts of the umbrella from his intestine, Mrs Pugsley left the dog with the vet. She said she need to talk about the cost of the operation with her husband and would return in 'ten minutes'. She never came back, forcing the RSPCA to launch an investigation. Inspectors said that Paddy would have 'died a slow and painful death' if experts had not intervened, Dartford Magistrates’ Court heard. The Pugsleys, who have three children and two other dogs, were summoned to court twice in August of this year but failed to show. They finally attending a hearing on October 17 when they were fined and ordered to carry out community service. Thin: The signs of Paddy's neglect were instantly spotted by vets who were able to see the dog's ribcage through his coat, above . Vet Bruce McLeary, who treated the dog, said: 'The dog was so hungry, it’s no surprise that it chose to eat an umbrella.' Andrew Wiles, prosecuting, said: 'The dog was seen by the nurse and the account given was that the dog had eaten part of an umbrella two days previously. 'It was determined that an operation would be necessary. 'The dog was emaciated and dehydrated and Mrs Pugsley was told treatment could be between £400 and £1,000. 'She signed a consent form and she then left the dog at the surgery saying she needed to speak to her husband and would return in 10 minutes. She didn’t do that.' Luke Meyer, defending, told magistrates the Pugsleys were struggling financially at the time and couldn’t afford an operation. Road to recovery: Paddy was taken away from his owners, who were fined and forced to carry out community service. The Spaniel has since been rehomed by the RSPCA . He said: 'All their dogs had been insured but that insurance had been closed because of financial worries. Had that insurance not lapsed this would never have happened. 'Mr Pugsley owns his own business. On a good year he gets £30,000. 'It’s been hard when they have three children at various ages and a grandchild as well, who rely on Mr Pugsley’s income.' Mr Pugsley was ordered to pay £1,000 in costs while Mrs Pugsley was charged £60.60. The couple were also each given 100 hours community service. The family, from Dartford, Kent, are allowed to keep their other two dogs, Fred and Bella, but Paddy has now been rehomed.","Paddy, 2, was 'emaciated and dehydrated' and needed £1000 surgery .

It would be heartening to think that friends, family and workmates are truthful all the time. Human nature, sadly, is not like that – but you can boost the chance of straight answers by asking questions in the morning. A study found that it is easier for people to lie in the afternoon as the self-control which normally stops them cheating breaks down as they get tired. A study by Harvard University found that men and women find it easier fib and deceive in the afternoon when they are tired, than in the morning . Researchers added that the more . fundamentally honest someone is, the more likely they are to succumb to . the ‘morning morality effect’. They said: ‘Our findings suggest that the mere time of day can lead to a systematic failure of good people to act morally.’ Are you more likely to lie in the afternoon than the morning? The conclusion came from experiments at Harvard University in Massachusetts, US. In . one, a group of young men and women were shown a pattern of dots on a . computer and asked to say if there were more on the right or left of the . screen. In some cases, it was hard to tell but in others the correct answer was clear. The . volunteers were given cash for every round they played. However, the . payments were not given for answering correctly. Instead, the . participants were given ten times as much for choosing the right side of . the screen rather than the left, which encouraged fibbing. Those . who played the game in the afternoon were more likely to say the dots . were on the right when they were clearly on the left, reported the . journal Psychological Science. Are there benefits to lying? The U.S. researchers said that people who lie with ease on a regular basis are less affected by the stress and strains of everyday life . A . second experiment tested if respondents were more aware of ethics in . the morning than in the afternoon. Men and women were given words with . missing letters and asked to complete them. Those . taking part in the morning were more likely to see  E_ _ _ C _ _  and _ . _ RAL and think of the words ‘ethical’ and ‘moral’. But those doing the test in the afternoon tended to form the words ‘effects’ and ‘coral.’ Two . further experiments  confirmed that people become more flexible with . the truth as they day went on. The study also showed that those who . prided themselves on being honest were more susceptible to the effect. Three experiments showed the more honest someone is, the more likely they are to lie when they are tired and their willpower wanes . It is thought that tiredness makes it harder for them to exercise the self-control needed to resist the temptation to cheat. In . contrast, those who lie with ease have less self-control to begin with . and so are less affected by the strains of everyday life. The researchers said: ‘We found that people are vulnerable to a gradual depletion of self-regulatory processes as a result of unremarkable daily activities. ‘This depletion can, in turn, lead them to act in ethically questionable ways. ‘Unfortunately, it might be that the most honest people are most susceptible to the negative consequences associated with the morning mortality effect. ‘In other words, our findings suggest that the mere time of day can lead to a systematic failure of good people to act morally.’","U.S. researchers found the self-control needed to prevent us from lying breaks down as we get tired .

Plans to protect a statue of the Duke of Wellington from vandals who keep putting a traffic cone on its head have been withdrawn after thousands protested online. The monument to the former Prime Minister in Glasgow is so frequently targeted by drunk students and other revellers that it more often sports a cone than not. The city council this week announced plans to deter the vandalism, which is said to cost £10,000 to undo every year, by raising the statue to make it inaccessible. Prank: The statue of the Duke of Wellington in Glasgow's Royal Exchange Square is frequently targeted by vandals who put traffic cones on its head . But some residents claim that the cone is itself a venerable city tradition, and a petition against the planned change attracted 10,000 signatures. Now the council has backed down and cancelled the £65,000 refurbishment project in reponse to the public pressure. The statue of the Duke, who is regarded as one of Britain's greatest ever generals after defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, was erected in 1844 in Glasgow's Royal Exchange Square. In the past few years it has become a magnet for pranksters, who place cones on Wellington's head as well as on that of his horse. The practice has become iconic in some . quarters, and in 2011 was named one of the 'top 10 most bizarre . monuments on Earth' by the Lonely Planet guidebook. Plan: Officials proposed raising the statue's plinth to prevent people from climbing on to it . However, the city council claims that it has to remove the cones at least 100 times a year, at a cost of £100 each time, and argues that the tradition casts Glasgow in a 'depressing' light. The refurbishment would have raised the statue's plinth to 6ft, which would 'deter all but the most determined of vandals'. The proposal was welcomed by Sandy Stoddart, the Queen's sculptor in Scotland, who told The Herald: 'Any move to end the tedious, unfunny, irreverent and strangely righteous addiction Glasgow has had to ""coning"" the Wellington statue I greet with warmth. Outcry: 10,000 people denounced the plans this week; the statue is pictured last summerwith a cone which was painted gold in honour of Glasgow's successful Olympians . 'The single most embarrassing thing about the culture of Glasgow has been the cone on the Duke's head. It is detestable.' But . a petition set up by campaigners argued: 'The cone on Wellington's head . is an iconic part of Glasgow's heritage, and means far more to the . people of Glasgow and to visitors than Wellington himself ever has.' Glasgow's equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington was sculpted by Italian artist Carlo Marochetti and erected in Royal Exchange Square in 1844. It celebrates the great general's achievements in defeated Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, after which Wellington went on to become Prime Minister. The statue stands in front of the city's Gallery of Modern Art in one of the most important public squares in Glasgow. Around the early 1980s, pranksters - often including drunk students - began vandalising the statue by placing traffic cones on its heads. While the city council has urged residents to avoid damaging the historic monument, some regard the practical joke as evidence of the city's unique sense of humour. After the petition attracted 10,000 signatures, with another 45,000 people showing support on Facebook, the council announced that the plans were being withdrawn. A council spokesman said today: 'The wording of the report was appalling and the leader of the council has instructed officers to withdraw the planning application.' Campaigner Michael Gray organised a protest at the statue today, which was due to become a celebration after the council's decision. 'It's funny and cheers people up on their way to work and I think that's a good thing for the city,' he said. 'It's difficult to put a price on something like that. 'If they had raised it, I think someone would have just put it back on. It's already quite high so no matter how high it is, someone would just get a bigger ladder.' Jennie Kermode wrote on the online petition: 'As a regular writer of tourist brochures, I note that much of what attracts visitors to Glasgow is the humour of its people. This is not something the council should be ashamed of.' And Lara Davis added: 'The cone is more of a symbol of the defiant, fun spirit which Glasgow has always embodied and for which it's renowned throughout the world.'","Statue of Duke of Wellington in Glasgow is repeatedly targeted by vandals .

Philip Benwell yesterday pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to Leila Crofts by wanton and furious cycling and will be sentenced next month. The 38-year-old hit the young girl with his bike as she was crossing a zebra crossing with her au pair on July 26. Leila was knocked unconscious in the collision in Poole, Dorset, and was left fighting for her life in intensive care. Benwell, who was cycling downhill at the time of the crash, came off his bike but then picked it up and walked off. Witness Louise Barber had to use the au pair's mobile phone to telephone Leila's mother and inform her of the accident. She tended to Leila along with lifeguards from the beach before the girl was rushed to hospital. Mrs Barber, 42, said: 'The au pair couldn't speak English too well and was asking for me to speak to the child's mum on the phone. 'I spoke to her mum and told her I was sorry to say this, but her daughter had been in an accident - it was awful.'

Tasha Bradford and Sylvester Storey's fairy-tale romance ended just over a week after their wedding when the Florida newlyweds got into a rollover crash that killed the young husband and cost his wife a leg. Tasha and Sylvester, better known to his loved ones as a 'Buck,' tied the knot in Panama City, Florida, on October 19 and set out for their honeymoon in the mountains of Tennessee. As the newlyweds were driving home in the early hours of October 27, the Storeys were involved in an accident on Interstate 85 in La Grange, Georgia. Sylvester Storey was pronounced dead on the scene. His 31-year-old wife was airlifted in critical condition to Grady Hospital in Atlanta, where doctors amputated her badly injured right leg and removed a portion of her damaged colon. ‘The day that we got there, she was swollen. She has a neck brace. She had tubes in her mouth. She couldn't even speak,’ Tori Cooper, Tasha's sister-in-law, recalled to WMBB. On Wednesday, Tasha's friends and family finally got some good news: the 31-year-old woman will be transferred to a hospital in her hometown of Panama City to continue her recovery. The tragic tale of the Storeys' love and loss has struck a chord with people across the country, who took to an online fundraising account on GoFundMe set up by the couple's church acquaintance to help out with Tasha's mounting medical bills and her husband’s final expenses. Deadly crash: The Storeys were driving home from their honeymoon in Tennessee when their 2001 Chevrolet Blazer somehow flipped over in Georgia, landing on its roof . Momemnt of horror: Sylvester (pictured left) was pronounced dead at the scene, while Tasha was airlifted to a hospital in Atlanta with a mangled right leg and internal injuries . So far, more than 220 people have donated just over $12,000 - a fraction of the $1million goal. Despite her misfortunes, the 31-year-old widow insisted from her hospital bed that she is blessed. When Tasha was rushed to the intensive care unit with her right leg mangled beyond repair, she recalled having a dream in which her dead husband appeared at the site of the crash that killed him. ‘He said, “I can't stay, but I just want to tell you goodbye, and I love you,""’ she told CNN. ‘God has a greater plan than I'll ever know. I know with time and healing, he'll send someone my way who will love me for me.’ For Tasha and ‘Buck’ Storey, their union was a match made in heaven. From the very first date, the two bonded over their Christian faith and love of the 'Star Trek' franchise. This past May, the Florida couple got engaged after two years of dating, and five months later they exchanged their vows at High Praise Worship Center in Callaway. Before walking down the aisle, the bridal party held a prayer asking God to bless them. Perfect pair: Tasha, a professional photographer, and Sylvester, a commercial fisherman, bonded from star over their Christian faith and love of 'Star Trek' Fairy tale romance: The happy couple got engaged in May after two years of dating .

During . the nuptials, Tasha and Sylvester read aloud letters they had written . for each other and took communion before sealing their union with a . kiss. Still smiling: In the face of many misfortunes, Tasha still believes that she is blessed, and that God has a plan for her . Afterwards, Mr and . Mrs Storey drove to Gatlinburg, Tennessee, for their honeymoon – a week . that was supposed to be a joyful prologue for a long life together. The . couple revelled in their newfound happiness, visiting the Hollywood Wax . Museum, sitting in a small café over cups . of cocoa and watching a football game together. On . the morning of October 27, the Storeys woke up in the dark and hit . the road in their 2001 Chevrolet Blazer SUV en route to Panama City, . which they were hoping to reach in time for the evening prayer service . at their church. Tasha was . curled up in a blanket in the backseat of their unheated car. She . remembers her husband urging her to take a nap and promising her, 'I'll . be OK.' Sylvester also said that he loved her, not knowing it would be . the last time he uttered those words. No . one is quite sure what happened next, but Tasha later remembered being awakened by the . lurching motion of the SUV rolling on the highway. When she looked down, . the 31-year-old professional photographer saw that her right leg was . badly injured. With the vehicle flipped upside down, Tasha Storey was unable to free herself from the seatbelt and began screaming for help. Several . Good Samaritan came to her aid and extracted Tasha from the car, . covering her with blankets until first responders arrived and took her . to a hospital in Atlanta. It wasn't until Tasha was in the ER that a nurse broke it to her that her husband’s didn't make it. ‘I . knew God had his side because he was such a good, Christian man,’ Mrs . Storey recalled. ‘I had no doubt where he was going to go.’ Miracle girl: Tasha, pictured left with her late husband, has a long road ahead of her before she fully recovers . What followed next was a series of emergency surgeries to severe her fractured right leg and remove a length of colon that had died from lack of blood supply. Tasha Storey has a long road ahead of her. She will have to undergo months of physical therapy before she is fitted with a prosthetic leg. The young widow does not despair.

Jailed mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger is to appeal his conviction on charges including 11 murders less than a week after he was handed two life sentences for his crimes, his lawyers claim. The 84-year-old former leader of Boston's Winter Hill gang is expected to die in prison after being convicted in August for gangland . crimes in the 1970s and 80s including racketeering, extortion and drug dealing. Bulger's lawyers have said he believes his trial was a 'sham' because he wasn't allowed to argue that a now-deceased federal prosecutor gave him immunity to commit crimes. Scroll down for video . Appeal: James 'Whitey' Bulger upon his arrest in Santa Monica, California, on June 22, 2011. He had been on the run for 16 years . He was sentenced Nov. 14 to two consecutive . life terms after a two-day hearing at which families of his victims . vented their anger, and Judge Denise Casper castigated him for 'almost . unfathomable depravity.' In . a brief, two-page filing in U.S. District Court in Boston, Bulger, who . was arrested in California in 2011 after spending 16 years on the run, said he was appealing the jury's verdict. Before the trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper had prevented his lawyers from mounting the case that the he had been granted immunity for his crimes, reasoning that no immunity deal would allow a person to commit murder. During . the two-month trial, Bulger's lawyers said that their client had been . an 'organized criminal' and spent much of their energy arguing that he . had never served as an informant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Prosecutors . and government witnesses said during the trial that corrupt FBI agents . who shared Bulger's Irish ancestry turned a blind eye to his crimes as . he ruled over Boston's criminal underworld in the 1970s and 80s, in . exchange for information they could use against the Italian-American . Mafia. Bulger declined to testify in his own defense during his trial, telling the judge he regarded the proceedings as 'a sham.' In the day: James 'Whitey' Bulger headed up Boston's West Hill gang during the 1970s and 80s before disappearing in 199. He claims he was granted immunity for his crimes . The FBI used these projections of James 'Whitey' Bulger during their . hunt to find him. He was one of America's most wanted men, on the run . for 16 years . Prior . to the trial, Bulger's attorneys were successful in appeals court in . getting the judge originally assigned to the case, Richard Stearns, . pulled off it. They . challenged Stearns' impartiality, noting that he had worked for the U.S. Attorneys' office in Boston when prosecutors were developing the case . against Bulger. Bulger fled . Boston in 1994 on a tip that arrest was imminent and spent 16 years on . the lam before the FBI caught up with him in June 2011, living in a . seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California. His story inspired Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film 'The Departed'. For years he was portrayed as a Robin Hood figure who . bought Thanksgiving turkeys for working-class South Boston residents and . kept hard drugs out of the neighborhood. A courtroom sketch shows Bulger sitting as relatives of his murder victims give evidence at the federal court in . Boston . But that image was shattered when authorities started digging up bodies more than a decade ago. Prosecutors . at his two-month trial portrayed him as a cold-blooded, hands-on boss . who killed anyone he saw as a threat, along with innocent people who . happened to get in the way. Connolly was . later convicted of second-degree murder in Florida for leaking . information to Bulger that led to the slaying of a gambling executive. Speaking after the trial, Tommy . Donahue, the son of murder victim Michael Donahue, told reporters he had . waited 31 years for someone to pay for his father's death. 'That old bastard is finally going to be in prison, he's going to die in prison,' Donahue said. 'It’s bittersweet but it’s a damn good feeling. 'The next time I ever want to hear anything about him, I hope he’s dead.' Former Boston FBI agent John Connolly .

Dutch researchers compared cell structures called telomeres in more than 2,400 people with and without depression (posed) Suffering from depression can dramatically speed up the ageing process in cells, research has found. Tests revealed that cells appeared biologically older in people who were severely depressed or who had suffered from the condition in the past. Dutch researchers compared cell structures called telomeres in more than 2,400 people with and without depression. Telomeres bracket the ends of chromosomes to protect cell's DNA being damaged, but they are shortened when cells divide and can indicate ageing. On average people naturally lose between 14 to 20 base pairs of DNA in the telomeres each year, Everyday Health reported. Telomeres of people who had ever suffered depression were significantly shorter by about 83 to 84 base pairs of DNA, than those of people who had never suffered from the condition. Scientists said the difference indicates approximately four to six years of advanced ageing. The differences in a measure of cell ageing called telomere length couldn't be explained by other harmful lifestyle factors, such as alcohol or smoking, the BBC reported.

A convicted robber who attended the same public school as Prince Charles has said his time at the boarding institution prepared him for prison. Paul Macklin has compared serving time for armed robbery to boarding at Gordonstoun School in Elgin, Moray. The 40-year-old son of a millionaire businessman has just been released from prison after serving almost a decade for threatening two police officers with a gun in 2003. From public school to prison: Paul Macklin, who has spent nearly a decade behind bars for armed robbery says his time at Gordonstoun School prepared him for prison . Macklin has been proclaiming his innocence since his arrest and recently failed to overturn his conviction, which had previously been shortened from 15 years on appeal. Speaking today, shortly after his release, Macklin said: ‘I never found prison particularly hard. It was just like Gordonstoun.' Fellow alumnus Prince Charles Prince of Wales has described his time at the school as ‘a prison sentence’ and the young royal was bullied by his peers. Macklin said: ‘I remember one disgraced aristocrat, who had been to Eton, was asked how he survived when he came home from prison. ‘He said that any man who had been to a public school or in the Army will be quite at home. For me, that’s how it was.' Institution: Paul Macklin attended Gordonstoun School in Elgin, Moray and, like fellow student Prince Charles, compares it to prison . Fellow student: Prince Charles, pictured last week, described Gordonstoun School as 'Colditz in kilts' and contemporary pupils say he was bullied during his time there . Not a fan: Prince Charles, pictured arriving at King's Cross Station to spend Christmas in London in 1962, attended the boarding school in Scotland from the age of 13 . He added: ‘You are living there eight months a year with around 50 to 60 other boys. ‘Obviously, there is not a lot of parental supervision and you have a culture of 13 to 18 year-olds who live among themselves and police themselves. ‘It creates a very independent child from an early age.’ Prince Charles attended Gordonstoun from the age of 13 and left after his A-levels. The Prince of Wales hated his time at the boarding school later describing it as ‘a prison sentence,’ and ‘Colditz with kilts.’ His contemporaries recalled that he was bullied and lonely during his years at the school. After rules on smoking and drinking were tightened ahead of the young Prince’s arrival, older students blamed Charles and tormented him as a result. It was Prince Phillip, an alumnus of Gordonstoun, who decided to send Charles there and Princes Edward and Andrew followed . It is thought that the Queen disagreed and would have liked Charles to attend Eton which is closer to home in Windsor. Macklin claimed he turned to crime after his love of adrenaline sports spiralled out of control. He said the turning point came . after he watched the 1991 action film Point Break, the story of . thrill-seeking surfers who commit a string of bank robberies. Macklin first hit the headlines in . 1994, when he and another former public schoolboy Robert Cadiz were . jailed for a total of 17 years after being convicted of conspiring to . stage a £300,000 armed robbery. The . pair attempted to snatch the cash from an Aberdeen City Council depot . in Kittybrewster while armed with guns, ammunition, wirecutters and . tools. He made his escape by . threatening police with a shotgun and holding the weapon to a passing . motorist’s face after jumping into his car. He . was jailed for eight years for his part in the robbery and for . threatening four police officers and the motorist with the firearm. Six . years later after his release, he was convicted of pointing a gun at . two police officers on three occasions as they followed him through city . streets. Now having served the time, he is now challenging the conviction through the courts. Macklin described Gordonstoun as '13 to 18 year-olds who have live among themselves and police themselves' Principal . of the Gordonstoun School, Simon Reid, said: ‘We do not recognise the . school that Paul Macklin is describing. Pastoral care is highly . structured at Gordonstoun and is at the heart of everything we do. ‘Every . student at Gordonstoun has a House Master or House Mistress and tutor . who are very involved with every aspect of their welfare. ‘Gordonstoun . works hard to make sure a culture of mutual support and kindness is . fostered in every member of the school community. ‘We . want our students to take full advantage of the huge range of academic . and sporting, cultural, community service and international . opportunities on offer and they can only do that if they are happy. ‘Gordonstoun is not the tough school that the myth would have you believe.’","Armed robber Paul Macklin attended Gordonstoun School in Scotland .

A picture circulating on social media appearing to show Syrian rebels butchering a zoo lion is the latest evidence that residents of the war torn country are starving, according to activists. The photograph, which has not been independently verified, shows three men standing around the body of a lion. One of them is holding the lion's head while another appears to be cutting meat from the animal's hind legs. A picture circulating on social media appearing to show Syrian rebels butchering a zoo lion is the latest evidence that residents of the war torn country are starving, according to activists . What appears to be a chunk of meat can be seen laying on the ground next to the emaciated looking lion. The animal is thought to be from the Al-Qarya al-Shama Zoo. While some reports suggest that the men are skinning the animal to use its coat to keep warm, others have suggested that the animal was already dead. Residents in areas hardest hit by the civil war, including the eastern area of Ghouta, were residents have reported desperate food shortages. Last month a cleric issued a fatwa to allow starving people in the region to eat cats and dogs. 'We issued a religious edict allowing people to eat dog and cat meat. Not because it is religiously permitted, but because it is a reflection of the reality we are suffering,' said Sheikh Saleh al-Khatib. 'People here have nothing for their children. I am on strike because I want to help save food for others.' Hunger: A boy eats maize as people shop in Aleppo but many others are said to be struggling for food in areas of Syria . According to the Daily Telegraph, the United Nations said today that civilians are going hungry in beseiged areas as they are inaccessible. The UN handed out food to 3.3million people in Syria in October. The World Food Programme added that the nutritional state of those trapped by fighting in parts of Damascus and rural areas has deteriorated significantly in recent months. The picture has emerged as a report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has revealed that a growing number of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon and Jordan are fast becoming primary providers for their families. With the Syrian conflict in its third year, the 61-page report highlights the plight of the children, who are growing up in fractured families, missing out on education and increasingly going out to work to help support extended families in exile. More than two million Syrians fled their homes because of the country's raging conflict, seeking shelter in neighboring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. At least half of the refugees - 1.1 million - are children. Refugees: A UN report has revealed that children are becoming the main providers for many refugee families at makeshift camps in countries such as Lebanon and Jordan. Pictured is a camp in Lebanon . Of those, some 75 percent are under the age of 12, the UNHCR report said. Children as young as seven work long hours of manual labor in fields, farms and shops for little pay, sometimes under dangerous or exploitative conditions, the report added. In Jordan's sprawling Zaatari refugee camp, most of the 680 small shops employ children, the report also said. A UNHCR assessment of refugee children living outside of the camp found that in 11 of the country's 12 provinces, nearly every second refugee household surveyed relied partly or entirely on income generated by a child. End of training: Islamist fighters hold up their weapons during their 'graduation ceremony' at a camp in eastern al-Ghouta, near Damascus . Combat ready: Islamist fighters demonstrate their skills during their graduation ceremony at a camp in eastern al-Ghouta . In Lebanon, hundreds of refugee children - many of them girls aged seven to 12 - are picked up daily at dozens of informal refugee settlements dotting the Bekaa Valley and border areas in the north, loaded onto trucks and taken to the fields where they work for six to eight hours and earn up to 6,000 Lebanese pounds per day. Many Syrian refugee children in Lebanon also fall into the hands of criminal gangs specialized in exploiting the most vulnerable victims of the conflict. They are seen begging on the streets of Beirut or more frequently selling flowers and gum for their often abusive patrons. Meanwhile, photographs emerged today of a sinister 'graduation ceremony' from a combat training camp in al-Ghouta. Islamist fighters were pictured carrying weapons and their freshly learned military skills as they marched during the ceremony near Damascus. The newly graduated fighters, who went through military training, will operate under the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham brigade.

Irritated by its beeping, 70-year-old Mr . Saatchi made enquiries. He was shocked to discover it had been waiting to take one of his personal assistants to a polo match in Berkshire. Mr Saatchi’s finance director at . Conarco, Rahul Gajjar, told the court that although he had noted . Francesca Grillo’s credit card spending creeping up – with her monthly . limit leaping from £25,000 to £100,000 – he had not yet thought to raise . the matter. Only when the taxi issue arose did he . investigate properly and tell Mr Saatchi that each month Francesca was . spending on average £48,000 and Lisa £28,000. Luxuy: Francesca spent £1,424 at Gansevoort . Hotel in New York (left) in June last year, the court heard. She also . used the credit card the same month to pay a £1,280 bill at the Ritz . hotel in Paris on the day she bought a Chloe dress for £723, it is . alleged . 'Spending spree': Elisabetta spent thousands of . pounds on designer clothes from Calvin Klein at Harrods (left) and . Harvey Nichols (right), both in central London . Miss Lawson was typically spending . £7,000, while three other assistants, Anzelle Wasserman, Alice Binks and . Zoe Wales, were on average spending £8,000, £6,000, and £3,000. Those bills totalled £100,000 a month or £1.2million a year. Mr Gajjar said of the massive credit . card bills: ‘It was on the back burner. We were dealing with more . serious corporate matters and Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson normally didn’t . have time for what we thought was trivial matters.’ It was, the court was told by . prosecutor Jane Carpenter, a tale of luxury goods and designer shops . from a group of people living the type of ‘high life’ usually only seen . ‘portrayed in glossy magazines’. Yet even as the scale of the sisters’ spending emerged, Mr Gajjar investigated in a surprisingly informal way. Credit card spending: Charles Saatchi, 70, arrives at Isleworth Crown . Court where he will give evidence against his two former PAs . who are accused of spending £685,000 . Evidence: Charles Saatchi is ushered into the court by security as he makes his way past press photographers yesterday . Appearance: Mr Saatchi is seen arriving at Isleworth Crown Court where . he will today give evidence against Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo . He told the court that he knew how . close they were to the family – with Lisa having worked for Miss Lawson . for 14 years, originally as a nanny, and Francesca for ten, at first as a . housemaid – and did not want to upset them. So he met them in the kitchen of the . large family home early last July to discuss their spending on the . cards. He said he ran through the bills for the Coutts cards they held . in their own names, and detailed masses of expenditure which the women . readily accepted had been for their personal benefit. Mr Gajjar listed the sisters’ personal expenditure in June last year alone. Francesca had spent more than £4,700 . on flights to New York, where she spent £1,850 at high-end fashion store . Miu Miu and more than £2,000 on hotels. She also used the card to pay a £1,280 . bill at the Ritz hotel in Paris on the same day that she bought a Chloe . dress for £723. On June 12 she spent £5,385 at Miu Miu London, and . £2,650 at designer store Prada. Departure: Charles Saatchi leaves the court yesterday after being . discharged by the judge. He will now give evidence tomorrow . Court hearing: Mr Saatchi gets into a taxi outside Isleworth Crown Court . yesterday after being sent home for the day just half an hour . after he arrived . 'Trivial': Mr Saatchi's accountant said he did not tell the millionaire about the credit card spending earlier because he considered it a 'trivial' matter . Lisa visited more high street shops . and fewer high fashion boutiques than Francesca – with Zara and John . Lewis among them – but still managed to rack up almost £5,000 personal . expenditure in the month, including cash withdrawals on her card. Among other luxury brands the women . blew thousands at Dolce and Gabbana, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Vivienne . Westwood and the Four Seasons hotel group. But other personal assistants not . charged with any offence also spent money – at Annabel’s nightclub, the . Babington House country venue and on Christian Louboutin shoes. Anthony Metzer, QC, defending Lisa, . said of the Grillos: ‘They believed they were authorised to incur this . personal expenditure.’ 'Slavery': Finance director Rahul Gajjar told Isleworth Crown Court yesterday that Elisabetta Grillo, 41, complained that she was being treated worse than Filipino slaves during conversations with her about credit card spending . Mr Gajjar said that at first both . women talked of wanting to move on – but their tone changed when he . asked the pair to sign letters admitting defrauding Mr Saatchi and Miss . Lawson, and promising to slowly pay it back while still working for . them. It was said that Francesca apparently . turned against her employers through outrage that Miss Lawson had phoned . the elite London private members club Soho House and cancelled her . membership. And the Grillos were also said to be . furious when one of the couple’s children said they had heard the . sisters had bought a house with money they stole from the family. The . Grillos deny buying any house with the cash. Claims: TV cook Nigella Lawson is expected to give evidence to the court next Wednesday against her former employees . Thanks to supporters: As Saatchi was arriving at court today, Nigella tweeted a recipe on Twitter . Mr Metzer told the court that the . Italian sisters worked long hours for ‘modest’ salaries – £25,000 for . Lisa and £28,000 for her sister – and suggested it was common practice . for assistants to be allowed to spend on themselves. He has told the court he plans to . claim Miss Lawson allowed them to spend like crazy in return for them . keeping quiet about her prolific drug abuse. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo 'spent £685,000 on company credit cards'

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers say prosecutors have failed to hand over evidence which could help them argue against the death penalty . Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev renewed their accusations on Tuesday that prosecutors are withholding evidence they need to defend their client against a potential death penalty. Tsarnaev's lawyers complained that prosecutors have failed to turn over several types of evidence they believe could help them argue against the death penalty, including information on a 2011 triple slaying in Waltham in which Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, is a suspect. Miriam Conrad, one of Tsarnaev's lawyers, told the judge that the defense has also been frustrated by the government's refusal to turn over the immigration files of Tsarnaev's family and friends, information she said could also be used to argue against the death penalty. 'The government could provide it, and has not offered a single reason why it won't,' she said. Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb countered that prosecutors have turned over 'virtually all of the mitigating evidence' they have. 'We have not withheld any favorable information from them,' he said. The judge set a January 31 deadline for Attorney General Eric Holder to announce whether he will seek the death penalty for Tsarnaev, the Boston Globe reported today. In court documents filed last month, prosecutors acknowledged that a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev told investigators that Tamerlan participated in the unsolved killings of three men who were found in a Waltham apartment with their throats slit and marijuana sprinkled over their bodies. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers argued in court papers that any evidence of Tamerlan's involvement is mitigating information that is important as they prepare to defend his brother in the marathon bombing. His lawyers haven't said why they consider the evidence to be mitigating, but legal experts have theorized that the defense may be trying to show that Dzhokhar fell under the murderous influence of his older brother and that Tamerlan was the driving force behind the marathon bombings. Conrad reiterated the defense request Tuesday and asked Judge George O'Toole Jr. to order prosecutors to turn over the records in the triple murder or at least review the file to see whether the information can be shared with the defense. Federal prosecutors have said they won't provide the records because state prosecutors are in the middle of an ongoing investigation into the killings and releasing details could jeopardize the investigation. Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev is suspected of involvement in three murders, evidence of which the defense team claim is relevant in his younger brother's trial . Authorities have alleged that the Tsarnaev brothers built and planted two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the April 15 marathon to retaliate against the United States for U.S. military action in Muslim countries. The explosions killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev, his parents and siblings, ethnic Chechens from Russia, came to the United States about a decade ago and lived in Cambridge. Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty to a 30-count federal indictment that includes charges of using a weapon of mass destruction. Seventeen of the charges carry a possible death penalty. Prosecutors said they are in the process of completing their written proposal to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who will make the decision on whether to seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. Holder is expected to decide by January 31. Tsarnaev's lawyers also asked the judge to ease restrictions placed on Tsarnaev in prison, arguing that they are inhibiting their ability to defend him. The measures, which are often used in terrorism cases, restrict a defendant's access to the mail, the media, the telephone and visitors. O'Toole took both defense motions under advisement and did not immediately rule. The judge rejected a request from prosecutors to schedule Tsarnaev's trial for next fall, saying it was too early to decide on a trial date. The next status conference was scheduled for February 12.","Judge today set a January 31 deadline for .

Meeting someone new isn't always the easiest of tasks, so spare a thought for China's young women who face intense parental pressure to find the right man. As a result, women terrified of returning home without a handsome other half resort to hiring 'boyfriends' for the duration of their visit. Now a shopping website, Taobao, has launched a new rent-a-boyfriend service which allows would-be fake other halves to advertise their services - complete with price lists. False romance: Women under pressure are resorting to fake boyfriends in a bid to impress their families . According to Chinese newspaper, the People's Daily, rent-a-boyfriends must be hired for a minimum of three days and offer a range of services including dinner (50 yuan, approximately £5) and shopping trips (30 yuan, approximately £3), on top of their 30 yuan hourly fee. Other services include seeing a film, although you will have to pay double if the movie is a thriller, and a 50 yuan peck on the lips, although hand-holding and a goodbye kiss on the cheek or forehead are free. 'I wanted to earn some pocket money when I had just graduated from university and started to work,' explains one advertiser, 27-year-old Matthew Fang from Chongqing. 'This rental business isn’t bad, especially during the Chinese Lunar New Year when there are family reunions.' End game: The women are searching for someone to marry but make do with a stand in while the hunt goes on . And business is booming for a reason. Chinese women in particular still face enormous parental pressure to meet a suitable man and rather than face a barrage of questions from nosy relatives, hire their men instead. According to Fang, the recruitment process begins with a preliminary meeting to discuss the client's requirements and to get their back story straight. Typically, the pair will exchange photos and will have a rehearsal before going ahead with the rental. Despite the detailed list of services and attempts - on both sides - to keep relations professional, some of the rent-a-boyfriends admit that it can, at times, be difficult. 'It all depends on how you look at it,' says another fake boyfriend, 26-year-old Xu Li from Yancheng City. 'If you look at it as a business, then it’s much easier.' The New York Observer has pinpointed a new phenomenon which sees wealthy Americans reject real friends in favour of a paid entourage. A fashion designer, who was anonymously quoted in The Observer’s piece much like rest of the article’s sources, told the paper: ‘There is a market, a currency for paid friends in New York. Some people need the money, and some people need the friends.’ But while being a paid friend might sound like an easy way to make a living, it's not always champagne bars and lavish dinners. ‘You’re always on someone else’s schedule — sort of like being a pet monkey,’ said one paid friend who lives between New York and LA. 'Being a paid friend is complicated,' he continued. 'When you’re in the presidential suite, it’s amazing, sometimes it can be emasculating, but I put my ego away a long time ago.’","Rent-a-boyfriends can advertise their wares on Taobao.com .

An incredible natural-colour image of Saturn, taken from space, shows the planet’s moons and rings as well as Earth, Venus and Mars all together for the first time. The image was taken by Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which shows the view as it would be seen by human eyes. Cassini’s imaging team processed 141 wide-angle images to create the impressive panorama. An incredible natural-colour image of Saturn, . taken from space, shows the planet's moons and rings as well as Earth, . Venus and Mars all together for the first time. The image was taken by . Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which shows the view as it would be seen by . human eyes . The picture, which was unveiled at the Newseum in Washington today, takes in 404,880 miles across Saturn and its inner ring system, including its striking rings out of the E ring, which is the planet’s outer-most ring. To give an idea of the vast scale of the image, Nasa said the distance between Earth and our moon would fit comfortably inside the span of the E ring. It is possible to see Earth as a bright blue dot to the lower right of Saturn, while Venus is a bright dot to Saturn’s upper left. Mars also makes an appearance as a faint red dot, above and to the left of Venus. Curiously the image makes it look as if the planets are in the wrong order in the Solar System, but it is a trick of perspective. A total of seven of Saturn’s moons are also visible, including Enceladus on the left side of the image. Cassini even captured the icy plume emanating from the moon’s south pole, which supplies fine, powder-sized icy particles that make up the E ring. The picture takes in 404,880 miles across Saturn and its inner ring system, including its rings out of the E ring, which is the planet's outer-most ring . Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer. Cassini has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the theory of relativity . Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013. The E ring shimmers like a halo around Saturn and the inner rings and is best seen with light shining from behind it so that the tiny particles are outlined with light because of the science of diffraction, Nasa's scientists explained. ‘In this one magnificent view, Cassini has delivered to us a universe of marvels,’ said Carolyn Porco, Cassini's imaging team lead at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado. ‘And it did so on a day people all over the world, in unison, smiled in celebration at the sheer joy of being alive on a pale blue dot.’ The professional mosaic forms part of Cassini’s ‘Wave at Saturn’ campaign, which on July 19, encouraged people to find Saturn in their part of the sky and wave at it, sharing pictures over the internet. Scientists examining Saturn’s rings use computers to dramatically increase the contrast of the images and change the colour so they can see material tracing out the orbits of tiny moons, such as Anthe and Methone, for the first time. ‘The . E ring in particular shows patterns that likely reflect disturbances . from such diverse sources as sunlight and Enceladus’ gravity,’ she added. The . reason why Cassini does not attempt many images of Earth, is because . the sun is so close to our planet that an unobstructed view would damage . the spacecraft's sensitive detectors. The professional mosaic forms part of Cassini¿s ¿Wave at Saturn¿ campaign, which on July 19, encouraged people to find Saturn in their part of the sky and wave at it, sharing pictures over the internet. This fun collage includes about 1,600 images submitted by members of the public as part of the campaign . Matt Hedman, a Cassini participating . scientist at the University of Idaho in Moscow, said: ‘This mosaic . provides a remarkable amount of high-quality data on Saturn’s diffuse . rings, revealing all sorts of intriguing structures we are currently . trying to understand. The team had to look for an opportunity when the sun would slip behind Saturn from Cassini’s point of view to get the shot. That opportunity arrived on July 19, when . Cassini was able to capture a picture of Earth and its moon, as well as . this multi-image, backlit panorama of the Saturn system. In addition to taking images, Nasa's Cassini spacecraft has a mass spectrometer on-board to look at the composition of atmosphere. It recently examined the composition of Titan's atmosphere, to find that propylene might be present in the upper atmosphere of the moon . Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ‘With a long, intricate dance around the Saturn system, Cassini aims to study the Saturn system from as many angles as possible. ‘Beyond showing us the beauty of the Ringed Planet, data like these also improve our understanding of the history of the faint rings around Saturn and the way disks around planets form - clues to how our own solar system formed around the sun.’ Launched in 1997, Cassini has explored the Saturn system for more than nine years and will continue to do so until 2017, with the aim of gathering more scientific data, and images of Saturn and its rings and moons. Images of the lakes near the north pole of Saturn's moon, Titan, pictured, were taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft as it entered its Spring season. This shot shows the outline of the different lakes and bright spots seen in the northern part of the land suggest the surface is unique from the rest of Titan .","Nasa's Cassini imaging team processed 141 wide-angle images to create the impressive panorama .

Taking action: Lucy Adams, BBC head of human resources, is taking suing a trade union which accused her of running a 'dirty tricks' campaign . The BBC has admitted spending the licence fee on lawyers to defend the reputation of its controversial human resources head. Lucy Adams, who earns £320,000 a year, is taking legal action against a trade union which accused her of running a ‘dirty tricks’ campaign at the corporation. She is set to leave the BBC in the spring after being accused of ‘corporate fraud and cronyism’ in the severance payoff scandal. But she said accusations by the National Union of Journalists that she hacked into staff emails and bullied employees into spying on employees were ‘highly defamatory’ and ‘false and without foundation’. She later revealed she had instructed libel lawyers to ‘take matters further’ and seek damages for defamation from the NUJ. Last night, it emerged the BBC had agreed to pay her legal bills, prompting fury from MPs. In a response to a Freedom of Information request, the BBC told the Independent newspaper: ‘As the NUJ article made serious and damaging allegations against Lucy Adams in her role as the BBC’s director of human resources, the BBC has agreed to fund the reasonable costs of Miss Adams seeking external legal advice.’ The BBC said Miss Adams could receive further financial support if she decided to proceed further with any legal action. It said: ‘The funding currently covers the provision of legal advice to Miss Adams prior to the issue of proceedings and her lawyer’s costs must be approved by the BBC in advance in incremental caps, with an explanation of the work that needs to be undertaken.’ Tory MP Stewart Jackson, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘The BBC seems to have learned nothing from the recent exposure of its largesse and profligacy with license fee-payers cash and culture of corporate greed and cronyism. ‘If this is the case, I will press for the senior management and Trust Board to return to the public accounts committee and fully account for this inappropriate expenditure.’ Not the first time: The BBC also contributed towards legal costs of its former director of news Helen Boaden, left, and for personal lawyers and public relations advisers for former director general George Entwistle, right . It is not the first time the BBC has provided licence fee money to pay for senior executives to defend their personal reputations. During Nick Pollard’s review of the BBC’s handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal, the corporation spent £101,000 of the total £2.4million cost on paying the ‘legal and related costs’ of embattled director of BBC News Helen Boaden, despite the fact she was heavily criticised in the report. The BBC also paid personal lawyers and public relations advisers for its former director general, George Entwistle, when he quit his job over the Savile and Lord McAlpine scandals.","Lucy Adams suing National Union of Journalists over hacking allegations .

While Nathan, 34 and wife Charlotte, 31, who live on a farm in Stow, Staffordshire attempt to have a nice civilised breakfast with their two sons, Reuben, 3 and Beau, 2, the family barely have the chance to sit down before Joe pokes his head through the window and helps himself.

Joe, who stands at 5.83 feet is not particularly picky and will happily chow down on bread, cereal and fruit, but does turn his nose up at cheese. Although Joe lives with three other female camels, he is the only one lucky enough to share breakfast with his owners. The others have to eat hay, barley, straw and corn mix in their stable. Mr Anderson-Dixon, said: 'The first time Joe joined us for breakfast he was uninvited.'He leaned in and rudely helped himself to the fruit bowl. But I wasn’t surprised because he’s very good at persuading all the other animals to give him their food too.” 'Now he comes over whenever he feels like it and hovers around in anticipation.

The couple look after and train 74 other creatures which are used in TV, films and commercials . 'He is eating us out of house and home, but we can’t get angry at him. He is like a big soft giant teddy bear and has become part of the family.' Although the family have gotten used to Joe’s freeloading, the family were initially frustrated at first with his lack of table manners. Mr Anderson-Dixon said: 'Despite his regular visits, Joe hasn’t mastered a knife and fork yet. 'He is a messy eater, and the mess he leaves takes ages to clean up. He has no table manners.' The couple run The Animal Company, a business that supplies animals to big events, commercials, film and TV shows. Joe is their star worker and has appeared in camel races, commercials and events around the country. He has even starred in a desert scene for a famous hair brand. The cheeky camel invited himself to breakfast one morning, and now the family have made it a regular thing . Mr Anderson-Dixon admits Joe is his favourite and has even bought Joe his own lorry so he can be transported in style. But their relationship hasn’t always been a good one. At first, when he brought Joe back from Russia as a calf, training him to follow commands was a tough job. It took 12 months to teach Joe how to follow instructions and Mr Anderson-Dixon had to quickly learn to dive out of the way when a ball of spit was aiming for his face. He said: 'Joe needed to get used to having a head collar on him, we used food to train him and this worked well. The hardest part was to teach him how to cush (kneel down). 'He spat at me most of the time showering we with camel dribble and regurgitated food. It wasn’t the most pleasant of things, but I don’t blame him for doing it. If camels are stressed or agitated then they will spit at you.' Luckily for the family, Joe doesn’t spit anymore and is the best behaved animal on the farm.

Will not stand: Laura Sandys MP for South Thanet, says she is leaving in 2015 - despite having a majority of 7,000 . Conservative HQ is braced for half a dozen MPs who only entered Parliament in 2010 – including rising female stars – to step down rather than fight the next election. Laura Sandys, the party’s MP for South Thanet, yesterday announced that she is quitting in 2015 despite having a majority of more than 7,000. The UK Independence Party accused her of running scared after its leader Nigel Farage floated the idea of standing in the seat. Louise Mensch, the former MP for Corby, triggered a byelection which the Tories lost having decided to quit halfway through Parliament, while the Conservative MP for South Ribble, Lorraine Fullbrook, has also announced that she will stand down rather than fight to hold her seat. One Cabinet source said it was feared that ‘half a dozen’ of the 2010 Conservative intake would opt to leave Parliament in what Labour was bound to call a ‘chicken run’. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the independent-minded Conservative MP for Totnes, said she was ‘so sorry to see yet another talented female colleague stepping down’. She added: ‘We need to detoxify this role. it’s both the aggressive atmosphere within Parliament and party politics and the indiscriminate, relentless hostility to MPs.’ Miss Sandys, whose father Duncan was Defence Secretary in Harold Macmillan’s government and the son-in-law of Winston Churchill, said she had taken the ‘heart-wrenching’ decision due to ‘a wide range of family demands’. In a statement on her website, the 49-year-old said: ‘It is with great sadness and regret that I wish to announce that I will not be standing at the next general election in 2015. ‘For the last six months I have been considering my future in light of a wide range of family demands and have decided that I cannot combine the level of dedication and service needed for the constituency with my growing personal responsibilities to those closest and dearest to me. ‘It has been a difficult and heart-wrenching decision to make as there is no greater honour and privilege than representing the constituents of South Thanet. ‘I wish to assure you that between now and the next election I will work tirelessly to achieve more for our wonderful area, making representation for our causes, supporting community groups and taking on individual cases on behalf of residents.’ Rumours: It is speculated that UKIP Leader Nigel Farage could mount a challenge in the Kent seat . Her move will fuel speculation that Mr Farage could mount a challenge in the Kent seat. He previously stood there unsuccessfully in 2005, but the Eurosceptic party has surged in the polls since then. Told of Miss Sandys’ decision, a spokesman for Mr Farage said: ‘She knew if he did pick Thanet South she would lose.’ Tris Osborne, a Labour councillor standing in 2015 in nearby Chatham and Aylesford, said: ‘Laura Sandys knows what every marginal Tory MP knows. UKIP will squeeze 3,000 to 4,000 of the vote on current percentage in Kent.’ Conservative chairman Grant Shapps paid tribute to Miss Sandys, hailing her as ‘one of the nicest people in politics’.","Laura Sandys MP for South Thanet announced she is quitting in 2015 .

Mairead Philpott, pictured with husband Mick, today lost her second appeal to have the length of her sentence changed . A mother jailed for 17 years for killing her six children in a house fire has today lost a second bid to challenge the length of her sentence. Mairead Philpott, 32, was jailed alongside her husband Mick at Nottingham Crown Court in April after being found guilty of the manslaughter of Jade Philpott and her brothers John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayne. There was applause from the public gallery as Court of Appeal judges sitting at Nottingham Crown Court dismissed a renewed application by Mairead Philpott to challenge her jail term. Mick Philpott was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years after being branded a 'disturbingly dangerous' man. His wife, who is likely to be released after serving half of her 17-year term, took part in a plan to set fire to the couple's home in Victory Road in an effort to frame his former mistress. The children were aged between five and 13. Members of Mairead's family including her mother Vera, father Jimmy and sisters Bernadette and Jennifer, were in the public gallery for today's hearing. Mairead Philpott was not in court. Setting out Mairead's grounds of appeal, her barrister Shaun Smith QC said: 'The essence is the utter dependence of Mairead Philpott on Mick Philpott, whilst not excusing culpability, legally or morally, was not given sufficient weight in assessing the length of her sentence.' He said Mairead was 'particularly vulnerable' to a man like Philpott who specialised in taking advantage of young girls with no family support or self esteem. Mr Smith said Mairead, who had been a loving mother, would forever be known as a child killer and that her sentence would be 'a lifetime reminder of her inability to stand up to a disturbingly dangerous man'. Scroll down for video . The Philpott's house was destroyed earlier this year following the fire that they started deliberately . The court heard co-accused Paul Mosley had abandoned an appeal of the length of his sentence. Dismissing the appeal today, The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, sitting with His Justice Flaux and Justice MacDuff said there was 'no doubt' Mairead Philpott had loved her children but that as their mother she had a responsibility to them. Lord Thomas dismissed Mr Smith's claims that she could not stand up for herself against her husband. 'This was not a spur of the moment plan. The risks of pouring petrol inside a building must have been obvious. She participated in the setting of the fire as petrol was found on her clothes. 'Her conduct after arrest was one . where she continued to maintain the lie that others were responsible. It . may be that she was under the continuing domination of Michael . Philpott.' He continued: 'It . is extremely difficult to understand that during that custody time and . the lengthy trial she did not admit the truth, expose the lie and own up . to abusing her responsibilities. There was applause from the public gallery as Court of Appeal judges dismissed a renewed application by Mairead Philpott, pictured at a press conference after the fire, to challenge her jail term . 'She was capable of standing up. She could make a choice. She had a responsibility that was not overborne by the will of Michael Philpott.' The decision comes after she lost the first round of a bid to challenge the length of her sentence in July. The hearing was the first to be held outside London since legislation was passed to allow Court of Appeal hearings to be broadcast. Philpott's father Jimmy Duffy said outside court that he believed his daughter should have been given a life sentence. He also told reporters his daughter had ignored his last letter and 'has nothing to do with us'. Mr Duffy said: 'There is love there because she is my flesh and blood, but I'll never forgive her for what she's done.' He added: 'At the beginning I said that the whole trio should've got a life sentence.' Duwayne Philpott's organs have been donated to help save the life of a 30-year-old man in hospital . The organs of one of the six Philpott children killed by their parents have been used to save the life of a dying man. Duwayne Philpott's organs were donated to help save the life of a 30-year-old man in hospital. His older siblings David, 27, Richard, 26, and his sister, 22-year-old Michaela, were invited along with other family members to a special ceremony at which he was posthumously honoured for his gift of life. Self-employed bricklayer Richard said: 'All of us feel thankful that we had the kids in our lives. 'It was a very hard decision to make when we agreed to turn off his life support machine. 'It is something I will never forget. The pain was immense. David and Michaela were with me. There were eight of us in the room. 'We talked to the organ donation team and we agreed that something good should come out of something so tragic and sad.' He added 'It's a nice feeling to think that part of Duwayne is still in this world. I just wish we could have donated organs from our other brothers and sister to help more people. David said: 'Some things are still very vivid in my mind, like when we all sat in the hospital chapel and a doctor came to tell us that Duwayne wasn't going to make it. 'We were all hoping that he would survive. By then, we knew that all the other children had passed away. 'We told him stories that we had shared with him, like when Michaela was cutting his hair and forgot to attach the grader and he had to have all hair shaved off, although he was very forgiving and saw the funny side. 'Duwayne looked alive and the nurses encouraged us to talk to him in case he could hear us without being able to respond. He was attached to a machine and we prayed that he would make it. 'It felt like once Duwayne knew that his younger brothers and sister had gone he would then be able to join them. 'He was very close to the younger ones and would not want to be without them. 'We think he decided to go with them so they wouldn't be on their own.'","Mairead Philpott jailed alongside husband Mick in April for manslaughter .

Victim: Damian Chlywka, 32, was murdered and bound up before being dumped down a well in a garden in Warlingham, Surrey, police say . Police have identified a murder victim who was assaulted, tied up and dumped down a well about two years ago. Workmen discovered the decomposing body of Damian Chlywka, 32, when they began renovating a garden at a detached home two weeks ago. They peered into the well in an unkempt garden in Warlingham, Surrey and saw skin and hair of the victim. Eventually the body of Polish national Mr Chlywka was pulled to the surface. A post mortem examination failed to reveal a cause of death but police said it was believed to have been in the well for two years. It is thought that Mr Chlywka was murdered at the address - where he had lived previously. His body was then tied up before being thrust down the well, police believe. Detectives confirmed this morning that two more men, aged 41 years and 31 years, had been arrested and were being held in a south London police station for questioning. They been bailed until the middle of January. Seven other men, all previously arrested over the death, have since been released on police bail pending further inquiries. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that the victim's relatives in Poland had been contacted and told of his death. He was believed to have come to the UK in 2008. A police spokesman said: 'Police were called after workmen discovered his body in a well outside an address in Warlingham at around 13:50hrs on November 15,' 'Specialist officers, including Metropolitan Police divers, attended the scene and recovered Damian's body which had sustained injuries consistent with an assault, prior to being placed in the well.'

A 12-year-old boy has been killed and three of his young friends have been injured after a 13-year-old girl allegedly took them for a joyride and smashed into a tree at high speed. Armani Kreamer, 12, was one of the four children in the car as it drove through Olympia Fields in Chicago, Illinois on Wednesday - even though he was supposed to be grounded. The driver, who has not been named, had taken her mother's car, Kreamer's mother said. Other neighbors told WLS that the girl had previously claimed her mother allowed her to do this.

There are still indents in the grass on the quiet suburban street where she hit the bank. Kreamer's mother said he was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash, but he was pronounced dead at a Chicago Heights hospital at 2.21pm. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday.

Anxiang Du, 54, is accused of murdering former business partners Helen and Jifeng 'Jeff' Ding and their daughters Nancy, 18, and Alice, 12 . Jurors wiped away tears today after listening to a horrific 999 call made as a businessman is believed to have been massacring an entire family of four. Anxiang Du, 54, is accused of murdering former business partners Helen and Jifeng ‘Jeff’ Ding and their daughters Nancy, 18, and Alice, 12, in ‘simple revenge’ over losing a seven-year legal dispute. Mr Ding, a 46-year-old lecturer in polymer science at Manchester Metropolitan University and his wife, a translator, 47, were stabbed to death with ‘ruthless efficiency’ in the kitchen of their executive home. A court heard how police followed a trail of bloody footprints upstairs to a bedroom where their daughters had been attacked in similar fashion. In the 20-second emergency call, made from Alice’s mobile phone, two females were recorded delivering repeated, blood-curdling screams, as the operator attempted to ask if fire, ambulance or police were needed. The call handler is then heard trying to pass the call on to police before the line abruptly falls silent. Throughout the recording, one woman juror kept her face covered by her hands, as Du stared at the floor. Relatives of the Dings, who have travelled from China for the trial, stared ashen faced from the public gallery. After the clip was played, Mr Justice Flaux asked the jury panel of eight women and four men whether they were able to continue, as one of their number dabbed at tears with her handkerchief. Prosecutor William Harbage QC had earlier warned the panel would have to ‘steel themselves’ to listen to the clip. The jury has been told that the catalyst for the horror was an injunction which had been served on Du the night before the killing spree, which prevented him from disposing of his assets. Mr Harbage said Du realised he ‘faced ruin’, and planned the attack that night, travelling to the home ‘like a man on a mission’ and armed with a kitchen knife. Du is accused of murdering the Ding family in 'simple revenge' over losing a seven-year legal dispute . The court heard Mr Ding and his wife were stabbed to death in the kitchen of their home. It was told police followed a trail of bloody footprints upstairs to a bedroom where their daughters had been attacked in similar fashion . Yesterday the court heard from the neighbour who raised the alarm, after initially becoming concerned that the Dings had, ‘unusually’, left a garage door open. Jason Horsley told the court he walked around to the rear of the Ding family’s £350,000 home in Wootton, Northampton, and, when he peered through a rear window, saw ‘what I thought was brown paint on the floor’. When he looked more closely, Mr Horsley ‘saw a pair of legs (on the floor).’ He added: ‘It was then that I realised it was actually blood on the floor.’  Shaking and trembling, the neighbour asked his wife to call police. Mr Ding (left) was a lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University while his wife Helen (right) was a translator . Officers forced entry and discovered Mrs Ding behind the kitchen door, in her dressing gown, while her trouser-clad husband lay under a radiator. There was ‘blood spatter up the walls and around the kitchen’, while the blood on the floor was ‘black and dried’, the court heard. Alice was discovered ‘curled up’ on a bed, while her sister lay on the floor, partially ‘tucked’ behind the headboard in a ‘prayer position’. The ‘massacre’ unfolded on the day of the Royal Wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011, the jury heard. Afterwards, Du, who like Mr and Mrs Ding moved to the UK from China, fled in the family’s car. He was eventually tracked down to Morocco more than a year later, and was extradited back to the UK earlier this year. Sisters Xing 'Nancy' Ding (left) and Alice (right) were also killed in the attack, the court heard . The jury at Northampton Crown Court have been told there is no dispute that Du carried out the attack. But Mr Harbage told them he is expected to claim that he should be found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder, on the basis of either diminished responsibility or loss of control. But Mr Harbage said: ‘The prosecution does not accept that this is anything other than the clearest case of murder, with the obvious motive of revenge, and any claim otherwise by Du is simply a blatant and transparent attempt to avoid his full responsibility for these grotesque killings.’ Du, from Coventry, denies four counts of murder. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Anxiang Du 'murdered former business partners and their children'

Labour accused David Cameron of performing a U-turn on a U-turn after ministers dramatically revived the prospect of forcing manufacturers to sell cigarettes in plain packaging. The Prime Minister caused fury in July when he appeared to kill off earlier plans to impose plain packaging, saying further evidence was needed to show whether it would be effective. But in a surprise move, public health minister Jane Ellison yesterday announced that eminent paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler has been asked to carry out a rapid review of the evidence by March – meaning plain packs could be brought in by the time of the 2015 election. The change of heart was warmly welcomed by health campaigners, but tobacco companies said a ban would have no impact on legal smoking levels and would lead to an increase in smuggling and counterfeit products. In the Commons, Miss Ellison said the Government had ordered the review in response to evidence emerging from Australia, which last year became the first country to introduce plain packaging. She said standardised packages would be brought in if ‘we are satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to proceed, including public health benefit’. The options would then be considered including packs having a uniform colour or using graphic images of smoking-related diseases. Miss Ellison insisted that the Government had made clear in July that it was simply taking a ‘pause’, following a public consultation in 2012, to consider the evidence from Australia. But Shadow health minister Luciana Berger said ministers had been forced to act by the prospect of a ‘humiliating’ defeat in the House of Lords on an amendment to the Children and Families Bill tabled by a cross-party group of peers. Labour accused David Cameron of performing a U-turn on a U-turn after ministers dramatically revived the prospect of forcing manufacturers to sell cigarettes in plain packaging . ‘Only a Government as shambolic as this one could now be U-turning on a U-turn,’ she said. ‘The minister says we need another review but the Government have already had a review and the evidence is clear for all to see. Standardised packaging makes cigarettes less attractive to young people. We should be legislating now, not delaying.’ Some Conservative MPs accused the Government of caving in to the ‘nanny state brigade’. Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: ‘What we expect from Conservative ministers, who believe in individual freedom and individual responsibility, is to stand up to the health zealots and nanny state brigade who would ban everything and have everything in plain packaging if they could.’ Yesterday, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman denied the change of heart was a ‘U-turn’. Shadow health minister Luciana Berger (pictured) said ministers had been forced to act by the prospect of a 'humiliating' defeat in the House of Lords on an amendment to the Children and Families Bill tabled by a cross-party group of peers . ‘What the Government said in the summer was that we would keep this under review, that we would be looking at the emerging evidence – and that’s exactly what the review we’ve announced will do,’ he said. Last night Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, praised the Government for ‘great leadership’ and said the move would save thousands of lives. He added: ‘Stopping cigarettes being marketed to children as a glamorous and desirable accessory is one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation. ‘Tobacco is a unique product. It is the only consumable that, when used in the way the manufacturer intends, kills half of its users.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday admitted that he was an underage smoker who illegally bought cigarettes. He told listeners to his LBC radio phone-in show that his early take-up of smoking was a result of peer pressure. He added: ‘It was all the boys and girls in my year [who] were smoking.’","Branded cigarette packets to be banished from shelves by May 2015 .

'Suing God': Rev Mark Sharpe, 47, who has been given permission to take legal action against the church after he was 'hounded out of his parish' A village vicar who says he was bullied by parishioners for four years and forced out of his job has won permission to 'sue God'. Reverend Mark Sharpe, 47, claims his dog was poisoned, his telephone lines were cut and his tyres slashed because he was considered an 'outsider'. The vicar, who likened local residents to characters out of the League of Gentleman, accused the church of failing to support him in the remote country parish in Teme Valley South, near Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire. In a move reminiscent of the Billy . Connolly film ‘The Man Who Sued God’, Rev Sharpe tried to . sue for constructive dismissal. He was refused permission to take legal action against the church when a tribunal judge upheld centuries old ecclesiastical laws which say the clergy are not employees but office holders ‘employed by God.’ But the decision was overturned yesterday by a judge yesterday at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in London - paving the way for Rev Sharpe to sue the church. The vicar claims that animal excrement was smeared on his car, glass was smashed on the driveway, heating oil was stolen and he was threatened on the doorstep of the rectory by a parishioner. He says he was forced to install CCTV cameras at the rectory with his wife Sara after being constantly plagued by prowlers following their move with their four children in 2005. One church warden even objected to Rev Sharpe’s beard, warning him that locals wanted a ‘clean shaven clergyman’, he claimed. He took sick leave in April 2006, which continued until he resigned in 2009 and he is not currently working.The former Royal Navy chaplain - who once . successfully sued the Ministry of Defence after just 24 days at sea - . is now taking action against the Bishop and Diocese of Worcester. The reverend joined the priesthood when he left his former job as a police dog handler in 2001. His next role was with the Royal Navy as a chaplain but he quit and later won a sexual harassment tribunal. In that case he said he was forced to turn a blind eye to widespread use of porn and was awarded a five-figure pay-out. Rev Sharpe, who is being supported by the . faith workers section of the Unite union, claims he was effectively . forced out of his parish and that the bishop and diocese of Worcester . did nothing to protect him. Legal action: Rev Sharpe is pictured here with his wife Sara and children Naomi (right), Lydia (left) and Thomas (second from the right) outside his home in the parish. He took sick leave in 2006 before resigning in 2009 . Parish: Teme Valley South All Saints Church in Hanley Broadheath, Worcestershire, where Rev Sharpe was the vicar until he was 'hounded out by parishioners' The church initially admitted in 2008 that Rev Sharpe was a worker entitled to bring a claim, but changed their mind in 2012 and asked for permission to withdraw that concession. Judge Alan McGarry ruled in favour of the church at an employment tribunal in Birmingham. However that ruling was overturned by Mrs Justice Cox on appeal and the case will now have to be reheard by the lower tribunal, if a settlement is not reached first. Speaking after his victory, Rev Sharpe . said: 'This decision has come as an immense relief.

Second time around: A judge has issued an order for Austin Clem, 25, to be resentenced . A judge under fire for sparing a triple rapist prison time has agreed to reconsider the sentence. Alabama Circuit Judge James Woodroof filed an order on Tuesday for 25-year-old Austin Smith Clem to be resentenced. Clem was convicted this month of raping a teenage girl three times, but the judge suspended his 40-year prison sentence in favor of a community corrections program that allowed him to skip incarceration. The decision sparked a national outcry, with the victim Courtney Andrews saying she was 'livid' and 'baffled'. Andrews, now 20, told MSNBC she was grateful her attacker would be resentenced, but was not hopeful. The judge was a childhood friend of the perpetrator’s attorney, Dan Totten. 'It’s hard for me to put a lot of hope in it, because I don’t want to be let down again. I thought he was going to get prison time before and he didn’t,' Andrews said. A jury in September convicted Clem on . three counts of rape in a series of sexual assaults on his neighbor and . one-time family friend. Andrews testified that Clem sexually abused her at age 13 and then again when she was 14 and 18. The defense argued there was no evidence of assault and characterized the victim as a 'scorned woman.' Victim: Courtney Andrews has taken the unconventional step of publicly identifying herself and slamming her attacker's sentence . Clem . could have faced decades behind bars. Instead, Limestone County Circuit . Judge Woodroof sentenced Clem to spend two . years with a community-based corrections program that will allow him to . continue working and living at home, plus spend three years on . supervised probation. He . was ordered to pay $1,631 in restitution, to stay away from the victim . and her family, to register as a sex offender, and to complete . counseling. The judge did not explain his decision in his order. Limestone . County District Attorney Brian Jones filed papers last week . asking the Court of Criminal Appeals to intervene in Clem's case. Convicted: Clem could face prison time when he is resentenced . Jones also asked a judge to delay the no-prison sentence and temporarily incarcerate Clem. A . petition filed with the appeals court argues the lenient sentence was . illegal under state law because Clem was convicted of first-degree rape . and two counts of second-degree rape. Clem . should have been sentenced to at least three years in prison under the . type of sentence the judge ordered, the prosecutor argued.","Austin Clem, 25, avoided jail time after being convicted of raping a teenage girl three times .

Viewers of Channel 4 word game Countdown were left gasping when it hit a peak with a near-the-knuckle answer. Letters chosen during one round of the long-running show were capable of spelling the word 'orgasmed', with the eight-letter contribution then displayed by the programme’s Rachel Riley who posed next to it. Contestants had to find the longest word possible from the selection of nine letters which had been chosen - E, A, S, R, P, G, O, M and D. Satisfactory result: Rachel Riley next to the eight-letter word 'orgasmed' on popular quiz show Countdown . The best efforts by the players were the six-letter 'grapes' and seven-letter 'grasped' in the edition of the afternoon show screened yesterday. But the team in dictionary corner - lexicographer Susie Dent and impressionist Alistair McGowan - were able to come up with something better. McGowan suggested: 'There’s a seven (letter word) in ""dampers"", another one, and Susie ""orgasmed"".” Show host Nick Hewer responded: 'Oh, well done. Very good.' Lexicographer Susie Dent and impressionist Alistair McGowan were able to come up with the eight-letter answer . Cheeky: Impressionist Alastair McGowan barely suppresses a smirk as he comes out with the cheeky answer . Riley - recently a contestant on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing - then arranged the letters on the board to spell it out. 'Orgasmed' has had multiple appearances, occurring in the final as the series climaxed three years ago when Jeff Stelling was the presenter. In 2010 the hosts of the long-running show were left with red faces when the F-word popped up by surprise. Riley cringed as the letters U, D, F, C, K, E all came up in the contestant's selection - and host Jeff Stelling gave a wry smile. Flustered: Show host Nick Hewer responded: 'Oh, well done. Very good' Viewers sat with bated breath in case the two contestants decided to go for the obvious six-letter word - and trigger a flood of complaints. But instead of putting the six letters together for the ancient Anglo Saxon expletive, the contestants went for 'caged' and 'faced'. Later that year Countdown raised giggles again when producers settled on a very suggestive final word scramble. Eyebrows were raised on the afternoon show when the clue letters spelled out 'LARGEBAPS.' And again in 2010 TV bosses had to axe a round after a contestant offered up an expletive during filming of an edition. Competitors were given DTCEIASHF, but they were given a new set of letters and asked to try again when Cambridge University student Jack Hurst produced the word ‘s***face. Dictionary corner expert Susie Dent told presenter Jeff Stelling the term for a ‘rude or obnoxious person’ would have been acceptable. However the station decided it was not suitable and a fresh selection of letters was used. Channel 4 said at the time: ‘Countdown is a daytime programme and this particular word was not deemed appropriate for a daytime audience so not included in the show.’ A racier version of the programme - 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown - has recently been screened on Friday evenings with more adult themes.","Dictionary corner reached 'Orgasmed' after grappling with conundrum .

A 12-month-old baby is presumed dead after a girl obsessed with TV crime shows threw him into a sewage drain to see if police could catch her. The 14-year-old girl took Sumit Singh as he played outside his home in India last month and casually dumped him in a nearby drain. A female neighbour saw it happen and reported it to the police but the boy has never been found. Sumit Singh was picked up and thrown into a sewer by a 14-year-old girl who wanted to see if the police could catch her after becoming obsessed with TV crime shows . His devastated parents Santosh and Urvashi Singh said they can only hope he is still alive one month after he was kidnapped from outside his home in Indore, Madhya Pradesh . Santosh Singh, 34, and his wife Urvashi, 29, from Indore, Madhya Pradesh, in central India, are devastated at losing their only child. Santosh, who works at an elastic company, said: ‘Almost a month has passed since Sumit was taken. It’s been a long time, we just don't know what to think. 'But we haven’t seen his body yet so we have to remain hopeful that he’s alive. 'We have to believe he survived the fall and was swept down river. Maybe he’s being looked after somewhere.’ Sumit had been playing outside his house when his mother Urvashi turned her back for a moment and he was gone. A neighbour spotted the teenage girl wrapping him in a cloth and then dropping him into the nearby sewage drain. Volunteers and police searched for Suimit for four days in the sewer drain but he has not been found . Mr Singh said the family think he was swept down river and hope he is 'being looked after somewhere' Investigating officer, Surendra Singh, said the girl denied her actions for days claiming she only threw garbage into the drain but eventually confessed to copying a TV show. ‘Initially she denied everything but after a few days she finally admitted dropping the boy,’ Officer Singh said. ‘She said she did it because she had watched a TV programme in which a woman had thrown a baby in a drain. She said she’d wanted to see if the police could catch her because the police never caught the woman in the programme.’ Officer Singh confirmed the police, the fire brigade and many divers from the local municipality had tried searching for the boy for four days but found nothing. The National Center for Children Exposed to Violence (NCCEV) has warned that children exposed to violence and crime on TV are at a higher risk of becoming involved in the juvenile justice system. Shocked residents gather around Sumit's parents as police update them on the search . Their report also warned ‘violence and crime can reduce self-esteem and can lead to self-destructiveness and aggressive behavior towards others’. Police said the teenage girl is now in a juvenile centre until her trial reaches court. But she has shown no remorse and is generally aggressive. Her family has confirmed she used to sit in front of the TV for hours watching Indian TV programmes such as Savdhaan India, a Hindi-language crime show that focuses on real-life crime stories in India. ‘She used to go mad and hit anyone who tried to change the TV channel,’ her father said. Santosh and Urvashi now have to accept the devastating possibility that their son may never be found. ‘Police searched a stretch of 15km but there was nothing. No one is looking now,’ Santosh added. ‘We’re lost, we just don’t know what to do.’","Sumit Singh has not been found one month after being thrown into sewer .

Parts of Britain are to be lashed by torrential downpours this weekend as almost half a month's worth of rain is expected to fall in just one day. The Met Office has given an severe weather warning for tomorrow and Saturday in the south of England, where some areas are to expect more than an inch and a half of rain. Forecasters predicted that 1.57ins of rain could fall in southern counties including Essex, Hertfordshire, Devon, Somerset, Sussex and London - just short of half the average expected rainfall for November, which is 3.46ins. Downpours: This forecast shows the heavy rain in the south of England, expected to fall mostly on Friday . Dusk: The sun sets last night over the Albert Bridge in west London. There have been warnings of heavy rain in the area for tomorrow . Scenic: St Mary's lighthouse in Whitley bay, near Newcastle, was pictured last night. The north of the country will escape the worst of the wet weather . People on a bleak and deserted Brighton Beach today. The country is bracing itself for two weeks worth of rain . Weather experts also warned of small-scale flooding and disruption to transport services. Helen Chivers, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'We've put out a warning for southern England, particularly towards the south coastal counties - from Devon eastwards across those southern counties of England. 'We're talking about 0.6ins to 1.2ins quite widely, with as much as 1.6inches in some places - though we wouldn't expect this to be widespread.' The torrents, which have the potential to bring with them gales of up to 60mph in coastal areas, could make for choppy conditions on the English channel. Warnings: This map from the Met Office shows the areas which will be most severely affected by the rain tomorrow and Saturday . Minor flood warnings have also been issued by the Environment Agency in light of the expected rain. A spokesman said: 'There is a medium likelihood of river and surface water flooding in parts of south and southeast England on Friday. 'Typical disruption could include localised minor flooding of land and roads and also localised travel disruption.' In contrast to the downfall to come, the weather today will be only slightly unsettled across the country, with a mixture of rain and sun. A Met Office forecast said: 'Today, in the southeast corner of England we've got some fairly patchy rain, which will gradually clear in the course of the day,. taking until mid-afternoon to clear in the very far southeast. 'To the northwest of Scotland in particular there are blustery showers, with the potential for thunderstorms. 'In the rest of England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are sunny spells with some blustery showers. 'Into tomorrow we start to see this weather system pushing up into the south, which we have the alert for. That will probably give rainfall across a good portion of England and Wales, but it's really the southern counties that are expected to bear the brunt of the heavier rain. Destruction: St Jude's storm pulled down this two-storey scaffolding in Leyton, east London, crushing cars and blocking 100m of road . Powerless: Monday's storm pulled down electricity lines, including the one pictured in Brentwood, Essex, leaving thousands of homes without power . People watch the waves batter into the sea wall of a marina in Brighton, south England on Monday . 'To the north of that, still blustery showers to northwest Scotland, but northern Ireland, southern Scotland and north-west England should see a fairly decent day. 'And then into the weekend the system that's bringing tomorrow's rainfall moves away out into the North Sea, but we have another one pushing in from the West for Saturday. 'It's looking like a decent start for Saturday in much of the UK, and Eastern areas will hold on to fine weather for most of daylight hours. 'But there will be some wet and windy weather from the west on Saturday - probably in showers rather than persistent rain. Expect quite windy conditions in the west, and probably the south-west. The continued wetness will come as an unwelcome follow-up to St Jude's storm earlier this week, which tore a trail of destruction across the country which left as many as five people dead, and thousands of homes without power.

A 20ft long photo montage of the Normandy coastline taken by daring RAF pilots two months before D-Day has sold for more than £3,000. The brave airmen risked death to take the pictures, which were all snapped in broad daylight while flying just 10ft above the ocean. The annotated images show Gold beach, which was one of the three beaches stormed by British troops as part of the attacks on June 6, 1944. The 20ft long panorama is made up of 21 plates each measuring 8in by 11in and shows Gold beach, one of three beaches stormed by British troops on June 6 1944 . The annotated pictures picked out important landmarks, towns, German gun emplacements and beach exits . The archive is made up of 21 plates, each measuring 8in by 11in. When pieced together they make a panorama that is almost 20ft long. Officers studied them to familiarise themselves with the landscape and to look for where German gun emplacements and beach exits for the soldiers were. They would also have been used to create highly detailed maps and three dimensional models of the D-Day landing zones. RAF pilots were forced to photograph the entire coastline from Normandy all the way up to Holland in order to keep the eventual location of the landings a secret . The montage was used to prepare for when British troops landed on Gold beach during Operation Overlord (pictured) This set of photos shows the town of St Come de Fresne which was part of the British landing zone . Marked on the pictures, which cover the coastline from Arromanches-les-Bains to La Riviere, are landmarks including a tower, a lighthouse and a coastguard station. They have now been sold by the son of Captain Alexander Rodger, commander of infantry landing ship HMS Empire Crossbow during D-Day. The ship carried two companies from the Royal Hampshire Regiment onto Gold beach, where they went on to capture their targets of Arromanches and La Hamel. The small town of Arromanche sits just north of Bayeux and was captured by British troops on the day of the landings . Gold beach was just one of five target zones, including Juno, Sword, Omaha and Utah. Here Royal Marines land on Utah . The collection belonged to the son of Captain Alexander Rodger who landed troops onto Gold beach in this ship during the attacks . The pictures would have only been seen by the highest ranking generals and used to make 3D models . Ian Carter, curator of the photographic archive at the Imperial War Museum, said the spy photos were taken in March 1944. Mr Carter said: 'Highly-skilled pilots would fly very low level missions in Spitfires, Mosquitos or F5 Lightning planes to get the photos needed.They were very dangerous sorties. 'The pilots not only faced the possibility of attack from German planes and flak from ground troops but also the inherent dangers of flying 10ft above the waves. The 20ft long sequence fetched eight times its estimated value when it went on sale . Operation Overlord, or D-Day as it has become known, is the largest invasion ever to have taken place and required a huge amount of planning . 'The planes had cameras mounted in the noses and it was vital the pilots got pictures of every inch of coastline. 'To avoid arousing suspicion among the Germans as to where the landings were going to take place, photos were taken of the coastline from Normandy right up to Belgium and Holland . 'These particular photos show the Gold area from Arromanches-Les-Bains to La Riviere. 'They would have been seen by only the highest ranking officials and from them highly detailed maps and 3D models were drawn out and handed to officers. 'These photographs formed a very significant part of this historic mission.'

The average price of regular gas has fallen to $3.19 a gallon, with drivers in eight states now able to fill up their cars for less than $3. Prices have been dropping by about a penny a day, according to AAA, with another six states close to falling below the $3 mark soon. The fall in prices has been credited to a strong flow of cheap crude coming from Canada and North Dakota. Falling cost: A Valero worker in San Antonio changes prices at a gas station on Tuesday . 'In almost half the states, you don't . need to make a great effort to find gas at $3 or less,' Tom Kloza, an . oil analyst, told CNN Money. Drivers in eight states already pay less than the $3 per gallon average, according to GasBuddy.com. They are: . Missouri                      2.842 . Oklahoma                    2.868 . Arkansas                     2.914 . Texas                           2.922 . Kansas                        2.927 . Louisiana                    2.966 . New Mexico                2.977 . Mississippi                 2.995 . Drivers filling up on regular fuel in eight states, including Missouri, Kansas and Texas, are already benefiting from pump prices below the $3 average. It is estimated that nearly 20 per cent of gas stations across the U.S. are already charging less than $3 a gallon, according to the Oil Price Information Service. Mr Kloza believes the drop in prices will continue until the end of the year, with more than half the states coming in below the $3 mark by Christmas. The drop is in part because of a steady and cheap supply of oil, described as 'the cheapest crude on the planet' by Mr Kloza. Refineries have benefited from a quiet hurricane season and few disruptions. If the supply continues uninterrupted, the national average price per gallon could fall to its lowest since 2010. 'It’s been a favorable confluence of . global and domestic factors that have brought us to this point and all . of them suggest incrementally lower prices at the pump in the weeks . ahead,' Patrick DeHaan, senior analyst with GasBuddy.com, said. However, drivers in states such as New York and California, which both have an average of . around $3.50 at the pump, and Hawaii which has the highest average at 4.020, are unlikely to benefit from a drop in prices.

Wealthy Chinese couples are outsourcing their pregnancies to American women for upwards of $120,000 in order to secure citizenship for their children - and a shot at an Ivy League education. Jennifer Garcia, case coordinator at California-based surrogacy service Extraordinary Conceptions, says about 55 per cent of her clients are Chinese. 'I've heard Harvard mentioned, Yale, Princeton. They just want them to come here and get a great education,' Ms Garcia told Today, 'and by them being a United States citizen they're not going to have a problem to come back and get accepted to those colleges.' Scroll down for video . Happy family: Linda (left) and her husband are one of the many Chinese couples paying American surrogates to have their babies, a process which can cost upwards of $120,000 . Chinese-American: One surrogacy agency reports that 55 per cent of their clientele are Chinese nationals. Above, Linda and her husband's American born baby . All this is possible thanks to the fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution which guarantees citizenship to any child born on American soil. Surrogacy also allows parents to 'design' their babies. For mothers whose eggs are unusable, parents can chose a surrogate with specific physical traits. Garcia says tall, blonde women are popular among her Chinese clients. Jennifer Garcia is a case coordinator at surrogacy agency Extraordinary Conceptions. She says that many Chinese are turning to American surrogacy as a way to increase the odds of getting into an Ivy League school . Parents can also chose the baby's gender, a big perk for Chinese parents who generally prefer boys due to the country's one-child policy. Surrogacy is also a way to get around that one-child policy. Some Chinese who already have a child of their own are turning to surrogacy as a way to grow their family without drawing the ire of the Communist Party. While having a baby through surrogacy is still a violation of the one-child rule, the government is having trouble enforcing the rule. When the baby is finally born, most agencies work to secure American birth certificates, social security cards and passports for the bi-national infant before their leave the country. Altogether, Ms Garcia estimates that it costs anywhere from $120,000-$140,000 for Chinese couples to have an American surrogate baby, meaning it's still only an option for the very wealthiest. Which explains another reason why Chinese are turning to American surrogates specifically as opposed to surrogates in other countries. Some wealthy Chinese fear they will be targeted if there was ever social unrest in the country again. They believe an American baby will give them a way out of the country. Americans can apply for green cards for their parents once they turn 21. But for many Chinese, American surrogacy isn't about citizenship options - it's a shot at parenthood for those who can't have children. Parenthood: Surrogacy is illegal in China, so after Linda figured out that she couldn't have a child herself - American surrogacy was one of the only options . Since surrogacy is illegal in China, infertile Chinese don't have many options for having a biological child. A Chinese woman named Linda had a disease four years ago which resulted in her loss of fertility. Linda and her husband then decided to turn to U.S. surrogacy and now have a child of their own. 'Without her, we can't get our baby,' Linda said of her surrogate. Some of the American women who have served as surrogates talk about feeling 'fulfilled' in giving a child to a couple who wouldn't have had one otherwise given their country's strict population-control. 'I could not live me life without my three children and the thought of giving that to somebody else is really the main reason why I did it,' a surrogate named Janice said. Service: American surrogate Janice is proud to be able to provide a child to a Chinese couple who wouldn't otherwise be parents due to the country's trick population policies .","Chinese couples are paying $120,000-$140,000 to have their children born through American surrogates .

Just one month after raising eyebrows by kissing in public, Smash star Katharine McPhee and her director Michael Morris - who are married to other people - are already on a break, according to People. 'Katharine is no longer seeing Michael - at least for now,' a source tells the weekly. Katharine, 29, has been separated from Nick Cokas, her husband of four years, for seven months and their relationship reportedly remains 'in limbo.' The status of Michael's marriage to actress Mary McCormack, 44, with whom he has three children, is not known. Katharine's and Mary's representatives did not return calls to MailOnline. The end of the affair: Katharine McPhee (left) reportedly has split with her Smash director Michael Morris (right) who she was spotted kissing just last month . 'Katharine still has no plans to move forward with divorce at the moment, though they are not living together,' adds People's source. The brunette beauty has looked to be in OK spirits lately. On November 2 she appeared upbeat in jeans and a black top as she headed out for errands and on November 5 the LA native showed off some leg in playful, come-hither over-the-knee boots. But People's insider insists, 'This is an incredibly hard time for Katharine.'

She used to have something to sing about: The actress with Jennifer Hudson on Smash, which is now canceled . Smash fans were shocked to see photos of Katharine passionately kissing Michael on October 22. The the former American Idol finalist looked madly in love with the handsome director as she made out with him by a car. Prior to the PDA, few, if any, people were aware the two were linked in any other way than professionally. The two had worked together on NBC's musical series Smash which is now canceled. People reports that Mary, who was on the hit show Plain Sight, 'prefers to keep her focus on her daughters' Lillian, aged two, Rose, aged six and Margaret, aged nine. 'Mary is a strong woman,' another source tells People. 'Her dedication to her children will remain her focus and gift.' In late October Mary and Michael were spotted looking downcast as they left an LA office building side by side, but not showing any signs of affection. Mary had reportedly kicked Michael out of their home after she saw the smooching photos. Not divorcing: The former American Idol beauty and her husband Nick, who are seen together here in 2007, are 'in limbo,' per a source . Katharine, who reportedly was 'very upset' about the kissing photos getting out and 'didn't mean for anyone to be hurt,' doesn't seem to have landed any new projects lately. In May Deadline said she would star in the thriller Depravity but no start date has been listed. Last month Jamie Krauss - PR Director at the Narrative Group - told FOX411, 'This probably won’t affect Katharine’s sales or her ability to get roles in the near future but her likability factor will be seriously tarnished. 'When female stars act as home wreckers, the American public, but particularly women, tend to sour to them very fast. Look at Kristen Stewart or LeAnn Rimes or even Angelina Jolie. All of them took a lot of heat for their famous affairs,' added the publicist.

But tucking into carbs could actually help us with our healthy eating plan thanks to a new loaf which claims to be 'revolutionary'. Protein Bread, which has just launched in the UK, contains seven times as much protein as normal bread and the carb count is 3g lower per slice. A dieter's dream? Protein Bread, which is made in Britain from wholemeal flour, took almost three years to develop . Protein Bread, which has just been launched in the UK and is made in Britain from wholemeal flour, took almost three years to develop with the formula going through more than 80 recipes before its manufacturers, Dr Zak's, deemed it good enough. It is much denser than normal bread too. One loaf weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than sliced white . bread - yet its makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread but . without the excess carbs. It includes more than 15 grams of wheat and pea protein in every slice - regular breads contain only around two grams of protein - which aims to make consumers feel fuller without feeling bloated. The bread is high in Omega 3s too, so eating it claims to keeps you fuller for longer than conventional high fat bread. And while there's no doubt it does the trick (see the review below), this is not a diet food for those avoiding carbs completely. A piece of Warburtons wholemeal bread contains 16g of carbohydrates, for example, whereas a piece of Protein Bread contains 13.9g. So while the balance of protein is in the favour of the fitness enthusiast, High Protein Bread is not intended as part of a carb-free plan. The company who make the bread hope that it will be a hit with fitness fanatics because it allows them to enjoy toast and sandwiches while still maintaining a high protein diet – ideal for muscle gain. No excess carbs: A loaf of the bread weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than white bread - yet makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread without the excess carbs . The bread (pictured), which is made in Britain from wholemeal flour, took almost three years to develop with the formula going through more than 80 recipes to perfect . A spokesman for MuscleFood.com, who created the bread, said: 'Everyone knows that a high protein, low carbohydrate diet is ideal for losing weight and building muscle and thousands of athletes and keep fit enthusiasts try to maintain this type of diet. 'But avoiding carbs isn’t easy, particularly bread. So we saw a gap in the market for a new kind of bread, one with a much lower carbohydrate content than normal bread and a much higher protein content. 'The best bit is it actually tastes like gorgeous bread, not cardboard but proper, freshly made bread. The brand knew that avoiding bread was hard so saw a gap in the market for a new kind of bread, one with a much lower carbohydrate content than normal bread and a much higher protein content . 'It is more expensive than high fat bread but you wouldn't compare the cost of a chocolate bar to a protein bar, so you shouldn't compare the cost of Protein Bread with high carb, high fat, low protein traditional bread. 'In fact, our Protein Bread is better value than Protein Shakes and Protein Bars on a per gram of protein basis. 'At the current offer price, just 18.6p per 10 gram of protein compared to £1.00 per 10 gram for Protein Bars and 71p for pre-mixed Protein Shakes. 'We have already been amazed by the demand for the product and we really think it could lead to a revolution in weight control.' Tim Hart, Personal Trainer and Nutritionist (BSc Nutrition) at Reebok Sports Club, said: 'The protein bread does contain a much higher protein content than normal bread. 'This offers some advantages such as slowing down digestion time compared to wheat bread alone, as well as providing an additional source of protein. 'However it is important to remember bread is not an unhealthy food and the £5 per loaf price tag means there are many cheaper ways to obtain a quality protein source.' Celebrity nutritionist Patrick Holford added: 'Protein slows down the release of carbs effectively making this bread a source of ""slow-releasing carbohydrates"". 'The net effect should be feeling fuller for longer. 'The ideal sandwich combines protein with carbohydrate, plus lots of vegetables. 'Using this bread, being higher in protein, together with another source of protein, such as lean meat, fish, eggs or beans (e.g. hummus) plus lots of greens such as lettuce, watercress or spinach, would be an ideal lunch in terms of giving you sustained energy.' Healthy option: A loaf of the bread weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than white bread - yet makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread . We immediately noted that the bread felt much heavier than a regular sliced loaf. The packaging of bread was not exactly appealing - it focused on conveying nutritional information, which is no bad thing, but the way the blueish green tinge crept down the sides of the bag was a tad reminiscent of mould - never a good look when it comes to bread. The bread itself tasted and felt dense and was firmer than a slice of normal bread, but also a touch more moist. It had a pleasant aroma to it - slightly sweet and nutty. It had more depth of flavour than a regular sliced loaf, and seeds gave it a pleasant texture. It left us feeling full and satisfied after just one slice. We later tried it toasted and found the texture and flavour to be very good. The bread kept its form and texture once toasted, even with oil drizzled over it. And it went very well with cheese, though maybe that is defeating the point! The protein level is ideal for people on a high protein body-building diet - though with two slices adding up to almost 250 calories, this is not a low-cal option for those looking to lose weight (maybe we should have stuck to one slice?). There's wheat flour in there as well as the pea protein and wheat protein - so you won't be cutting back on carbs entirely. But it is definitely a better option than regular sliced. Overall, it's a better buy for those who adore bread but need to keep protein levels high (a regular slice has 2-4g of protein; this has 15g), or the casual healthy eater who loves bread but is keen to go for a product with a slightly lower carb count. Unfortunately though, the £5 price tag is a big deterrent.

A little boy who has a rare condition which means he cannot distinguish between edible and inedible objects has been given a new, inedible garden - after the ate the old one. Zach Tahir suffers from pica, an eating disorder which causes him to eat inappropriate objects, and with moss being one of his favourite snacks, his family garden in Salford, Greater Manchester, has until now been out of bounds. In the past, the six-year-old has been known to eat stones, paper and even the blinds in his bedroom. Scroll down for video . Zach Tahir, six, cannot tell the difference between edible and inedible objects. His mother, Rachel Horn, 32, raised £7,000 to pay for a new, inedible garden for him to play in . However, he now has a newly-landscaped outdoor area, which cost £7,100, and comes complete with artificial grass, a submerged trampoline and play equipment with rounded edges which are impossible for Zach to get his teeth into. His mother, Rachel Horn, raised the funds for the garden by organising a charity comedy night. Ms Horn, 32, said: ‘It’s great. Zach loves it and it’s so much safer for him. ‘Before it was slushy and muddy so we couldn’t go out there, particularly as Zach is particularly keen on eating moss. ‘He can’t eat anything in it, which is the most important thing. ‘If a leaf falls down before I’ve had time to get rid of it then he might try and eat that but otherwise I can feel so much happier about him being outside.’ Zach (pictured with his mother in his new garden) has pica, an eating disorder which means he eats inappropriate objects. He is also autistic and cannot speak . Zach has been known to eat moss, stones, paper and even the blinds in his bedroom. Before the new garden was built, he could not be let out alone as he would eat mud and grass . Zach’s new garden was built just months after he was given an inedible bedroom, costing £36,000, after his cravings reached a whole new level and he gnawed through the walls. ‘There’s no limit to what he will try and eat,’ said Ms Horn. ‘He likes things that are textured, and moss has always been his favourite, as he can mull them around and chew on them for a while. ‘It’s very worrying for me as a parent, because you never know what kind of germs he could be taking in. ‘But in the garden, he can’t get to the street and he’s completely safe.’ Zach also had to have a new, £36,000 bedroom because he started eating his way through the walls. The new bedroom has been specially designed to stop him gnawing on it . The garden is believed to be the first of its kind for pica sufferers, and contains lots of other sensory features for Zach, who is also autistic and cannot speak.

An intimate photograph of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton at the beginning of their love affair is to go on show in a new exhibition. The behind-the-scenes and previously unexhibited photograph is to be included in a display of 10 photographs by Michael Peto in September, it was announced today. The photograph shows Elizabeth Taylor in a hat and necklace passing Burton a lit cigarette while the Welsh actor writes notes during the critically acclaimed BBC radio recording of Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk Wood in October 1963. Candid: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton captured off duty by Michael Peto, 1963, in a photograph set to go on show at the National Portrait Gallery in September . The couple had met the previous year during the filming of Cleopatra, which was released in June 1963. Peto’s photograph depicts the couple before their first marriage in March 1964. The two had a famously tempestuous relationship and, after their first marriage broke down in 1974, went on to wed again the following year. They were divorced a second time a year later. Sixteen months after their divorce, Burton said of their fiery union: 'You can't keep clapping a couple of sticks [of dynamite] together without expecting them to blow up'. The portrait is one of ten photographs by Michael Peto (1908-1970) taken in London during the 1950s and 1960s to go on display from 17 September 2013 at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Selected from The Peto Collection at the University of Dundee, the display will include photographs of famous figures such as Samuel Beckett photographed in his Paris apartment in 1961, Jennie Lee photographed near the Houses of Parliament in 1965, and Paul McCartney with The Beatles during the making of the Richard Lester directed film Help! (1965). In love: A photo of the couple taken in 1964 - the year they married for the first time (this photograph does not feature in the exhibition) One of Peto’s last sittings featured . in the display shows a young Ian McKellen at the time of his success in . the Prospect theatre production of Richard II in 1969. Michael . Peto was born in 1908 in Bata, Hungary, the son of a village shop . keeper. He moved to Budapest in the 1930s, and it was his work in . exporting Hungarian crafts which enabled him to flee the country in the . summer of 1939 as the shadow of Nazism fell across Europe, escaping just . before the borders closed. Aged 31, he found himself in London, a . refugee needing to build a new life. Peto took up photography in 1947 . mainly to illustrate his own stories. Union: Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor married in a secret ceremony in Montreal in 1964 . Second chance: The two remarried in 1975 after divorcing a year earlier - but their second marriage was only to last a year . His . work was first published in The Observer in March 1949, and he . subsequently became a regular contributor alongside other celebrated . photojournalists including Jane Bown, Peter Keen and David Sim. During the 1960s, as well as documenting social issues and key cultural and political figures, Peto became involved in the London ballet scene, and is especially known for his portraits of Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. Passionate: The couple were famously fiery-tempered and their two marriages were full of fire and passion . Peto’s celebrated publications include A Dancer’s World (1963) and About Britain (1967) with Kenneth Harris and his work also appeared widely in newspapers and periodicals including The Tatler and The Times. Following Peto’s death in 1970, his archive of 130,000 original negatives and vintage prints was donated by his family to the University of Dundee. The ten exhibition prints featured in this display have been printed by master printer Robin Bell from Peto’s original negatives and have been gifted to the National Portrait Gallery by the University of Dundee to celebrate Peto's remarkable contribution to portrait photography. Terence Pepper OBE, Head of Photographs Collection, National Portrait Gallery, London says: . 'When we were first approached in 2011 about a collaboration with The Peto Collection, I was immediately excited at the prospect of viewing at first hand as many as possible of the 130,000 negatives and prints in Dundee that survived and had largely been unexplored. Picking out this selection of important images will we hope be the start of writing Peto back into the annals of important photographers whose work can be re-evaluated and appreciated more widely.’ Co-stars: Taylor and Burton in the 1965 film Sandpiper - one of 11 films they starred in together . University of Dundee Rector and actor Brian Cox CBE, Patron of The Peto Collection says: . 'From humble beginnings, Michael Peto grew into an incredible artist and photographer. With an intense interest in the variations of human form he had a talent for capturing his subjects in their natural environment – ordinary people, Olympic athletes, The Beatles. 'He was able to do it all with a keen eye and subtle sensitivity. This collection is an extraordinary gift he has left us, so please, learn, appreciate, enjoy and, above all, support its future.’This display, which visitors can see free of charge, will form one part of a season of exhibitions of Peto’s work, which will include displays at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at The Lincoln Center in New York from 2 October 2013 until 4 January 2014 and at The Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh in 2014.","Photograph taken by Michael Peto in October 1963 .

Chief Trunk bags, a luxury luggage purveyor that was considered the American Louis Vuitton of the early 20th century has now been relaunched with a new generation in mind. Following a 50-year hiatus from public consciousness, the label is now poised to restore its famous 'Chief' canvas stripe to the glory it once held during the 'golden age of travel.' The brand has been painstakingly reconfigured by new owners who have translated its formal, pre-aviation-friendly trunks into a range of tote and weekend bags for the modern traveler. The chief: Konrad Duchek and Michael Sambrano have relaunched the Oshkosh Trunk Company as Chief Trunk bags, with duffle bags (above), weekenders, and totes for all-American travelers . In its heyday, Chief Trunk was actually known as The Oshkosh Trunk Company, named for its origin hometown of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, an early 20th century hub for creative manufacturing. The brand was revered for its trunks: wheel-less luggage, that while now considered clunky and unrealistic, were once a necessary component of luxury travel in its early days. Their distinctive red and yellow 'Chief' stripe, first introduced in 1898, served in lieu of a monogram. The label honed its prestige at a time when international travel was just finding its footing among society’s elite, whose extended trips on luxury ocean liners required large, and equally lofty luggage. New owners Konrad Duchek and Michael Sambrano, New York businessmen with deep roots in the fashion industry and affection for elevated travel, see the label as a prime example of the era's travel fever. ‘The brand grew up during the golden age of travel when people were traveling around the world, and what [brand] your trunk was said something about you,’ Duchek told MailOnline by phone. ‘It’s kind of the same idea as what your bag says about you now.’ Sambrano added that in its peak, Oshkosh embodied the early, ‘romantic concept of traveling the world.’ The original: The Oshkosh Trunk Company made its name with classic luggage baring its signature 'chief' stripe . It was considered America’s own answer to Louis Vuitton, with . trunks selling for up to $600 (or approximately $10,000 today, with inflation). The brand maintained independent boutiques in New York, Paris, and . London. ‘Among the American population Oshkosh likely had a better reputation than Louis Vuitton, as there was not as much globalization then,’ Duchek said. That influence peaked in the early 1930s, and the brand closed soon thereafter in the early 1960s. While traveling for work as Chanel’s U.S. director of business and planning, Duchek discovered bits of Oshkosh remnants in a vintage luggage stall at Paris’s famous flea market, Marché aux puces de Clignancourt. But his run-in with the Oshkosh relics was somewhat of a nostalgic blast from the past. ‘My parents had two of the old suitcases and I sort of grew up with the brand around as a kid,’ he told us of his history with the label. ‘I was in Paris and suddenly saw this striped trunk and thought “Wait a minute, I know what this is.” His reintroduction to the label soon turned into ‘a person quest’ to restart Oshkosh. ‘There was such a rich history of design, I was like, “Wait, why hasn’t anyone dealt with this?”’ he said. For everyday: Duchek and Sambrano have also created classic carry-all (L) and zip-up (R) tote bags for their shoppers' everyday needs. The label’s intellectual property . rights had expired, rendering its 'Chief' stripe, among other signatures, . as public domain. Duchek ventured to Oshkosh ‘to see if there was a . viable business,’ and re-trademarked all of the brand’s associated . signatures, as well as its name. He decided that Oshkosh was the perfect opportunity to link up with Sambrano, who he had already worked together on multiple fashion and luxury goods projects in the past. But rather than reestablish Oshkosh as a . luggage brand built for trips on chartered yachts and steam locomotives, . Duchek and Sambrano ‘reinvented the brand as it would exist today, . revolving around the American good life,’ the latter partner said. ‘’It’s not a jet set life, but it’s something we all aspire to—the idea . of journeys and jaunts, more weekend destinations that revolve around . social circles of friends.’ Positioning: The original Oshkosh luggage was 'inconspicuous in circles where essential niceties are taken for granted and only shortcomings are remarked,' reads an advertisement dating back to the early 20th century . They renamed the label ‘Chief Trunk . Brands’ to avoid confusion with children's retailer Oshkosh B'Gosh, which is considered Oshkosh, Wisconsin’s best-known surviving export. The label’s nucleus, its distinctive red . and yellow ‘Chief’ stripe, took nearly a year to redevelop. ‘We . basically pulled it apart thread by thread to match the weight and . color, it was a whole process,’ Sambrano said. Taking . direct inspiration from the ‘Chief’, the duo has created . a range of carry-all’s, totes, weekenders and duffle bags fit for . seersucker-wielding, Duke graduates on a quick weekend journey to Rhode . Island’s foxtail-strewn coastline. The bags-- manufactured in the Brooklyn Navy Yard of mostly American-made materials--range in price from $65 for a change purse to $1,095 for a leather-trimmed weekender. At present, they are exclusively retailed through Chief Trunk's own e-commerce site. Comparative work: At the height of its popularity, Oshkosh Trunks had an American cachet comparable to that of Louis Vuitton luggage in France . But . what sets the Chief designs apart from other weekenders is their . decidedly tailored feel. Unlike many canvas rucksacks on the market, the . designs feel like they would fit in better at an inn on Newport’s Bowen . Wharf than at a quaint motel near the Brooklyn population’s favorite . artsy upstate weekend destination, the Dia:Beacon galleries. ‘We . didn’t want something too hipster or too young for it to have some . heart to it,’ Sambrano elaborated. ‘We definitely did want to be . different and bring back the glamour.’ Duchek summed it up, adding: ‘We want to be a modern brand that has great heritage rather than just a heritage brand.’","Chief Trunk bags is the revived version of a luxury luggage brand once known as The Oshkosh Trunk Company .

Feeling festive: Holly says she will be spending Christmas at her mother's house and eating lots and drinking mulled wine . 'The three main important beauty aspects for me during the festive party season are my lips, lashes and teeth. 'I smile a lot, especially at Christmas, so I like to have a nice natural white smile which is why I use Oral-B 3D White Luxe – it really looks after my teeth and helps keep them looking shiny, healthy and removes stains. 'I also think a red lip at Christmas is really nice - I love MAC RED. 'Combine this with tonnes of Max Factor Clump Defy mascara and a slight shimmer - a wash of bronze across the eye can look lovely.' Lady in red: Holly says she swears by crimson lips and a staple red dress over the festive period . Holly, who remains unflappable at all times on This Morning (even when dealing with the likes of Katie Hopkins), has shared her advice on staying calm over the Christmas period. She said: 'You can take the stress out of Christmas by trying to be as organised as you possibly can. 'I try and get all my shopping done before December so all the presents are wrapped in my lounge and ready so I can really relax and enjoy Christmas. 'If I see things throughout the year that I think someone will like then I buy them then and there. 'Around October/November, I really start cranking it up with shopping; otherwise Christmas turns into a panic! 'I do a lot of shopping online as it’s so easy. I don’t always get much of a chance to browse around the shops, and I love the fact that you can click ""gift wrap"".'In bed with Holly: Miss Willoughby has also unveiled a range of vintage-inspired bedding for BHS . 'This is originally Philip Schofield’s top tip, but…my top tip is to hire in all of the plates, glasses, pots and pans. 'The moment something is used, it gets put in a box in the garden which then gets collected after Christmas. Isn’t it a brilliant idea? Particularly if you’ve got a big family!'. Holly has been busy in the run up to Christmas and last week unveiled her new bedding range for BHS. Face compact - RMK do a really beautiful one. It’s got a bit of foundation in it, but it’s more of a powder. It’s a nice, neat compact that’s great to have in your handbag.

Dental Floss - I have a bit of a thing for flossing, I always carry Oral-B Pro-Expert Premium floss with me and I love it. Once you get into it you get addicted! Lip balm - I really like Sisley as they do a lovely lip balm in a little pink pot and that’s perfect. It’s brilliant in the winter for when you get dry lips. Mascara - I get through tonnes of mascara. I’m not one of those girls who just puts on a tiny bit. I like to layer up mascara, so love a brilliant mascara like Max Factor Clump Defy. Eyeliner – Lancôme do a really nice one with a felt tip end, it’s called Plume in noir.

As her husband George tore into the wrapping paper of his 50th birthday present, Anita Rydzinski tried to suppress a giggle. She had spent weeks racking her brain over what to buy him. But how do you surprise your husband after 15 years of marriage? A unique piece of artwork was just the thing, Anita decided. But as George pulled off the bubble wrap, it quickly became clear this gift was not your run-of-the-mill watercolour. It was a life-sized bronze cast of Anita's bottom, in suspenders and a tiny thong. Cheeky: Anita Rydzinski with the bronzed bust of her bottom that she gave to her husband as a birthday present . 'George's mouth dropped open, then spread into a huge smile,' says Anita, 40. 'He couldn't believe it, but he did look at me and say, “Very nice . . .” Our daughter Chelsey, 19, thought it was fantastic, but our 13-year-old son George just stared and said, “What is that?”' So what possessed Anita to commission such an intimate portrait of her posterior? Anita, who lives in Wraysbury, Middlesex, and runs a turbo engine manufacturing company with her husband, says: 'George is very difficult to buy for, so when I spotted Brighton Body Casting, it gave me an idea. 'I wanted something a bit naughty, so decided on a cast of my bottom.' Turning body parts or personal objects into art is becoming a major trend - over the past few years it has rocketed in popularity, particularly in showbusiness. Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden recently admitted she has a cast of her bottom hanging in her bedroom - which was made at the request of her husband Chris in 2006. Bottoms up: Anita with a brass cast of her impressive derriere. Turning body parts or personal objects into art is becoming a major trend . Myleene Klass posted pictures of herself on Twitter in 2011 plaster casting her own baby bump when she was pregnant with daughter Hero, now two. Casting finally went A-list when the Beckhams reportedly spent £1,000 having daughter Harper's tiny hands and feet cast and plated in gold after she was born. Sir Elton John, Joanna Lumley and Helena Bonham Carter are also said  to be fans of the technique and are all thought to have commissioned their own or their children's plaster casts. Plaster casting has been used since the 19th century to create exact replicas of ancient sculptures, but it has now been replaced by alginate, a blue seaweed-based substance similar to the putty used by dentists to take moulds of your mouth. It sets in two minutes, then turns rubbery, so you just pop a baby's foot - or a woman's bottom - into it then pull it out when it's firm to form a mould. This is then filled with the chosen material: brass, plaster, bronze, glass, fibreglass, silver or, if you have the cash, gold. Anita opted for fibreglass, to make it light enough to hang on a wall, which was then covered with powdered bronze. The entire thing cost £2,000. Eternal connection: Angela Jarman (with daughter Flora, 2) wearing a silver pendant replica of the end of her daughter's umbilical cord . For the process itself, Anita had to strip down to her undies before Vaseline and then alginate was spread over her bottom, lower back and legs while she stood stock-still for 40 minutes. Her mother and daughter kept her company throughout. 'I was very nervous beforehand, so it really helped to have them there. It turned out to be fun once I got over my nerves, although it was agony, as I couldn't move an inch or it would spoil the cast.' The result, she said, was a pleasant surprise. 'I was paranoid it would look awful, so I couldn't believe how much I liked it,' she says. 'It's not obscene, just cheeky, and George loves it. I think we're going to hang it in the lounge. I can't wait to see people's reactions at our next dinner party.' Judy Wiseman has created casts for numerous celebrities through her company First Impressions - she's rumoured to be the creator of Harper Beckham's golden feet - and has seen many unusual requests. 'One client's husband proposed to her with a ring woven from grass, so she had it cast in silver as a permanent reminder. Another has a piece of bubblegum that she was chewing when she first kissed her husband when they were 14 - that's now mounted on a silver ring. 'I've even cast a shard of wood that was stuck in a man's knee after an accident: he wanted a reminder of how lucky he was to be alive.' One of the most unusual requests came from 42-year-old artist Angela Jarman, who came up with an unlikely memento of her daughter Flora's birth two years ago. She asked Judy to create a silver pendant replica of the end of Flora's umbilical cord, still in its medical clip. Family link: Angela's umbilical cord pendant . 'It's individual to us, which makes it all the more precious,' says Angela, who lives in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, with her partner David, 41, an insurance broker. 'The cord was a bit gruesome, it shrivelled up and turned black, but I kept it because it represented my life flowing into our daughter. Cast in silver, it really has a magical quality. It's all about capturing a moment in time.' This seems to be the key to the popularity of casting - preserving a physical memory for ever. Perhaps that's why body casting has become so popular with women in their 30s, 40s and 50s, eager to capture an image of their body before age takes its toll. British body caster Jamie McCartney, who opened Brighton Body Casting in 2006 after working in special effects on films such as Casino Royale, says: 'Ninety per cent of my body clients are female. They tend to be slightly older, partly due to having fewer body hang-ups, and partly down to cost. 'The average spend is probably £1,000. You can spend £25 on a pair of lips, but the full body cast I'm doing for an American client will cost more than £10,000.' Trained sculptor Jamie says breasts, bottoms and female torsos are favourites with customers, but he is keen to point out that casting is not all salacious or sexual. A moment captured: Body caster Jamie McCartney with Karyn, holding the plaster cast of hands clasping each other . He says that he provides as a 'cradle to grave' service. 'The most disturbing thing I ever cast was the hand of a baby who had been stillborn at full term,' he says. 'I never met the family - it was done in the funeral parlour with just me and the funeral director. 'It's become increasingly common for families to ask for casts of loved ones who have terminal illnesses. I cast my own father's hand holding a wine glass before he died of prostate cancer, so I can still say “cheers” to him now.' Another moving experiences involved casting the clasped hands of a husband and wife while she was in a hospice dying of cervical cancer. Her widower, Chris Cutmore, 42, is a community psychiatric nurse who lives in Maidstone, Kent, with his daughter Rebekah, 17, and son Jamie, seven. His wife Karyn was diagnosed aged 34 with a rare, aggressive form of cancer in October 2007. She died a year later. During Karyn's final days, Chris heard Jamie talk on local radio about body casting and arranged for him to visit. Precious memory: Jamie McCartney showing Karyn the finished product, the bronze-plated cast . 'It was such an overwhelming experience,' says Chris. 'It was so tactile, our hands clasped together - it felt like getting married again. It was a little moment of light in an awful year.' He says that he still remembers the look on Karyn's face when she received the bronze-plated cast the next day. 'The smile that lit up her face was unbelievable,' says Chris. 'The cast sat by her side until she slipped away a day later. 'People take it for granted, holding hands, but sometimes there is nothing more powerful.' Five years on, the cast is in Chris's living room in a display case, next to glass casts of his two children's hands. 'It's a comfort to have them there,' says Chris. 'Looking at them transports me back to that moment with Karyn more than a picture ever could.' 'Moment of light': Karyn saw the bronze cast a day before she died. Now Chris has something to remember her by .","Getting casts of body parts or personal objects is increasingly popular .

Making a difference: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announced all data will soon be encrypted after revelations unencrypted data was accessed by NSA spies . Web giant Yahoo announced Tuesday the details of a plan to encrypt all data flowing through Yahoo data centers. Yahoo follows in the steps of Google, which moved to encrypt all data after it was revealed earlier this year that NSA spies were able to access unencrypted user information. CEO Marissa Mayer wrote in a post to Yahoo’s Tumblr that most data should be encoded in 2048-bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption within the first few months of next year. Ms Mayer first took the opportunity provided by the announcement to assure users that ‘Yahoo has never given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency. Ever.’ An initiative announced earlier this year to make Yahoo Mail more secure through the use of SSL encryption will be complete by January 8 has now been extended across all other Yahoo products, Ms Meyer continued. NSA spooks ‘hacked’ into Yahoo by accessing the unencrypted data flowing between data centers, that will be encrypted no later than March 2014. The web portal will also make available to users to ability to encrypt all data flowing to and from Yahoo, as well as ensure that local co-branded variants of Yahoo mail are encrypted within the same time frame. SSL encryption creates a secure link between both the user and, in this case, Yahoo. The connection allows information to travel only between designated parties and appears as unintelligible gibberish to anyone else. 2048-bit encryption is hard to crack because the security keys are 617 digits long, according to DigiCert, which estimated it would be virtually impossible for a desktop computer to break.

A billionaire oil magnate from Texas is embroiled in a bitter court battle with his son over a tell-all blog chronicling his drug and alcohol abuse and family rows. Thomas Boone Pickens, 85, is taking legal action against his 58-year-old son Michael Pickens over his blog, 5 Days In Connecticut, in which the younger man denounces his family, accusing them of abuse and theft. Mr Pickens Sr, who made a $1.4bn fortune buying and selling oil companies, is said to have launched legal proceedings after what began as a blog about Mr Pickens Jr's health problems became more personal and offensive. Entrepreneur and philanthropist T. Boone Pickens is suing his son Michael for alleged defamation and cyberbullying . T Boone Pickens, seen her with his wife Madeleine Pickens, is suing his son Michael Pickens Sr, on the right . The father, along with three of his children, is said to be suing Mr Pickens Jr over alleged defamation, invasion of privacy, libel, harmful access by computer and extortion. Court documents are said to show Mr Pickens Sr, universally known as T. Boone Pickens, is concerned about damage to his family's reputation, and accuses his son of lying in a bid to extort $20m out of him. In the blog, which he began in October last year, Mr Pickens Jr portrays himself as the victim of years of emotional abuse, writing about poor parenting, petty fighting, and drug and alcohol abuse. Its author writes: 'I was clinically depressed at age 10. 'I began drinking beer and whiskey when I was 12 - by the time I was 17 I was a drug addict and an alcoholic smoking pot every day before and after school, eating my mother's valium and darvon and snorting cocaine and tripping on LSD. 'I drank until drunk five nights of every week of my life. I lived this way for 40 years - by the time my life imploded I had been physically addicted to Benzodiazepines and Opiates for 10 years. 'I was dead.' The controversial blog: Michael Pickens Sr's 5 Days In Connecticut blog began last year and soon became inflammatory . Pam Pickens, seen here in a grab from YouTube, is suing her brother Michael with her father, brother Tom and sister Elizabeth . Unimaginable wealth: T Boone Pickens' luxurious Alva Court estate in Preston Hollow is for sale for $7m . Some posts describe Mr Pickens Jr's own drug and alcohol use, but others attack his family, accusing his siblings of drug dependence and stealing from their own mother, and accusing his father of being uncaring and unkind. The family, which is based in Dallas, accuses Mr Pickens Jr of lying in a bid to extort money from his family. A written testimony from Mr Pickens Sr quoted in the Daily Telegraph says: 'I am suffering physical manifestations of distress, including elevated blood pressure, which is very unusual for me. 'I am deeply embarrassed by Mike’s statements and actions.' Meanwhile Mr Pickens Jr's son, also called Michael Pickens, who is not involved in the court battle, told Forbes: 'I love my father dearly, and I know he loves me. 'But this blog stuff is out of control, it’s not accurate in the least.' Michael Pickens Jr has a long history of substance abuse, and in 2007 he was given probation for fraud.  His father paid $1.2m restitution to his victims, and paid for his son to go to rehab.","T.

They look like two teenagers who are besotted with each other. The girl is Guadalupe Shaw, the 14-year-old 'bully' charged with a cyber hate campaign that drove schoolmate Rebecca Sedwick to her death. And the boy is John Borgen, the teenager at the center of a feud between the two girls ultimately resulted in 12-year-old Sedwick's tragic suicide. In an interview with MailOnline 13-year-old Borgen said he believed his continued affection for Sedwick could have been to blame for much of the bullying. Rebecca Sedwick's former boyfriend, John Borgen, then went out with one of the accused Guadalupe Shaw, who he is pictured with here . Jealousy: Borgen had dated Rebecca when they were classmates at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida, and had known her since she was eight years old . Young love: John Borgen posted these images of him and Shaw on his Facebook page. He has urged victims of bullying to 'speak up' in light of Rebecca's suicide . He had dated Sedwick when they were classmates at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida, and had known her since she was eight years old. After they split up he began dating Shaw - but said she was consumed with jealously because he made no secret of his affection for Sedwick. 'Guadalupe did not like the fact that I still liked Rebecca,' said Borgen whose cover photo on his Facebook page shows him holding Shaw. 'She was didn't that I still liked Rebecca and that I'd talk about her.' Speaking with the permission of his parents Pablo and Yolani at his home in Lakeland, Florida, the teenager said he was devastated that he did not know the full extent of the bullying suffered by his ex-girlfriend. Sedwick took her own life on September 10 after jumping from a disused cement tower. Prior to her death her computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl'. Accused: Katelyn Roman, 12, left, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, right, were arrested and charged with aggravated stalking in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick . Victim: Rebecca Sedwick jumped to her death on September 10. She would have been 13 this weekend . One of the teen's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track and she changed her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' Borgen, who told police Shaw had often verbally abused Sedwick, said he wished she had spoken up about the bullying. 'She never said anything to me, not a word. The only person she told was her mother. 'If I'd have known I could have said something. I miss Rebecca.' Police believe Sedwick suffered a sustained hate campaign waged online and in social media by Shaw and her once closest friend, 12-year-old Katelyn Roman. Both girls were identified by Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd as being responsible for the hate messages sent to Sedwick in the months before her death. The two girls have been charged with stalking and Judd took the unusual step of 'naming and shaming' the pair despite both being juveniles. He is also looking into charging their parents as he believes they share part of the blame for allowing their children to post vile messages that drove Sedwick to kill herself. In the middle: John Borgen previously dated Rebecca and her alleged tormentor Guadalupe Shaw . Shaw was arrested after she posted a message at the weekend confessing to bullying Sedwick and adding IDGAF -- teen speak for I don't give a f+++. When Roman was interviewed by police she allegedly admitted to bullying Sedwick and said she was sorry. Police said Roman had been Rebecca's best friend but had been turned against her by Shaw. Shaw also intimidated other girls into ending their friendship with Sedwick. Friends of Sedwick said they were intimidated by Shaw into not talking with her while she was at Crystal Lake Middle school in Lakeland, Florida. Makayla Valentin told police said she saw Shaw verbally abuse Sedwick telling her to 'go kill herself.' She also said Shaw told her love rival she 'should die'. Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is believed to have jumped from an abandoned cement silo . An arrest affidavit for Shaw released by Polk County Sheriff's office points to how Shaw made Sedwick's life a misery. It says:'Valentin also stated Shaw would ""bully"" anyone who was openly friends with Sedwick, and would attempt to convince others not to be friends with her. 'For this reason Valentin stated ""no one"" wanted to be friends with Sedwick for fear of being bullied by Shaw. Valentin said she kept her friendship with Sedwick secret from Shaw.' Tricia Norman, Sedwick’s mum, claimed in an interview with MailOnline that Shaw was the behind the bullying campaign and the reason she pulled her daughter out of the middle school. 'Shaw would call her ugly, call her fat,' said mother of three Mrs. Norman. 'The name calling kept on for weeks. Becca was friendly with a boy called Darren and Shaw sent him some very inappropriate messages. Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca . 'Becca told him they were not things a girl her age should be saying and the bullying started from there. Until the trouble at the Middle School Becca had not problems with either girl. 'Roman was her best friend, but that all changed.' Mrs Norman has been using her daughter's death to highlight the problem of bullying in schools. She told MailOnline she was ""relieved"" police had charged two girls with stalking and added that she was told Shaw could be charged as an adult which will result in a far harsher punishment than if she were a juvenile. Borgen said he had dated Sedwick for three months before she left their Middle School to be homeschooled. Sedwick's mother Tricia Norman had pulled her out of the school because of the bullying with her daughter suffering verbal attacks and once being set upon in corridor. Borgen said his relationship with Sedwick ended when she left the school and he started going out with Shaw. Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied . 'Guadalupe is cool. I liked hanging round with her. She is nice, but I had no idea what she was doing to Rebecca. 'No one should be bullied like that. When I found out what happened I knew it was so wrong.' Borgen,who turns 14 on January 1, said he planned to remove the photo of him hugging Shaw from his Facebook page. Guadalupe's neighbor George Conlon said the family had a fearsome reputation in Lakeland and he had been harassed by the teen's older brother. 'Mowing my grass, cleaning my yard and boy comes and gets in my face and yelling obscenities and calling me names,' said Conlon. Other school friends spoken to by MailOnline confirmed that Shaw was known as a bully. One girl, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone was scared of her. She was tall and strong and used filthy words all the time. 'Anyone who crossed her was in big trouble. Unless you were her friend she was just nasty.' In a TV interview the teen's parents denied that their daughter was a bully and claimed the taunting Facebook post that led to her arrest was because her account had been hacked. The couple, who have seven children, declined to appear on camera and were filmed from the back showing only their heads and the interviewer on ABC TV. They said they were angry over remarks by Sheriff Grady that their daughter was 'very cold' with 'no emotion' when arrested. 'My daughter don't deserve to be in the place she's in right now and I just hope that the truth comes to the surface so we can get out of this nightmare', her father told ABC News. The family declined to speak with MailOnline. Sheriff Judd dismissed their claim that their daughter's Facebook had been hacked and said they were in denial over her postings. Police sources said officers had been monitoring the social media accounts used by many of the teens who had been interviewed during the investigation. When the 'I don't give a F+++ ' post appeared he said they decided to make arrest to prevent further online bullying.","Rebecca Sedwick, 12, was bullied online by a gang of up to 15 school girls .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:42 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 9 October 2013 . Legendary TV host Johnny Carson once feared for his life from a Mafia hit after he drunkenly put the moves on a mob boss's girl at a celebrity hangout in Manhattan. The iconic funnyman hid at home and was 'holed up in his UN Plaza palace for three days, missing three shows' after an underworld figure put a contract out on his head in 1970. Carson's offense occurred at closing time at Jilly's Saloon on West 52nd Street and this colorful tale is the latest from the new biography written by his long-time confidant and lawyer Henry Bushkin. Legend: Johnny Carson hosts the Tonight Show with guests Richard Pryor and a chicken. But a mafia boss wanted Carson dead when he chatted up his girlfriend in a Manhattan bar . Carson was at the lounge bar often frequented by Frank Sinatra and other stars when he singled out one woman for special attention. 'An attractive brunette at the bar caught Carson's eye, and he was doing his considerable best to convince her to leave with him,' Bushkin wrote in the book. Unfortunately for The Tonight Show host, the object of his affections was not only spoken for but also seeing a shady character who was high up in the mob, as reported by the New York Post. 'And when her boyfriend – a major figure in the underworld – arrived, he was not grateful to Johnny for entertaining his ‘goomar' in his absence,' Bushkin continued. Famous faces: Jilly Rizzo (left), owner of Jilly's Saloon, stopped the mafia men doing anything else to Johnny Carson once they had thrown him down the stairs. Rizzo was a good friend of Frank Sinatra (right) who was often seen at Rizzo's bar where Carson got into trouble . The mafia man and his heavies lifted Carson off his stool and hurled him down some stairs before the bar owner, and Sinatra's friend, Jilly Rizzo stepped in to calm things down. But the jealous mob boss wasn't finished yet, and he put out a contract on the TV host. That's when Carson sensibly hunkered down at home for three days. The situation was only resolved when one of his agents made a deal with crime boss Joseph Colombo, who needed TV coverage of a Columbus Day rally by his recently formed Italian-American Civil Rights League. Bushkin explained that 'Colombo was deeply, deeply disappointed that so far all of the [TV] networks had refused to cover the rally.' Right-Hand Man: Henry Bushkin (left - now aged 70) is promoting his memoir that recounts his 18 years of work for late night legend, Johnny Carson . 'Soon an accommodation was reached. NBC News covered the rally, and Johnny could leave the apartment,' he wrote. Elsewhere in the book, Bushkin has revealed the moment the notoriously mercurial star broke down in tears when he discovered his wife was allegedly cheating on him. Having been roped into breaking and entering the secret Manhattan apartment of Joanne Copeland, Carson's second wife, attorney Bushkin and the entertainer discovered a virtual shrine of photographs to pro-footballer Frank Gifford - confirming Carson's greatest fears. As Carson began to weep, Bushkin, who was aged only 27 during the clandestine 1970 raid recalls that the multi-millionaire television host's raincoat had fallen open to reveal a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip. Agreement: According to the book the threat to Carson's life was lifted when one of his agents made a deal with Joe Colombo (center), founder of the Italian American Civil Rights League and alleged organized crime boss, over the televising of a Columbus Day rally (pictured) Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny Carson', that charts the 18-years he worked for the comedian as his lawyer, wingman and fixer. It hits bookshelves on October 15th. The pair were also great friends and Carson frequently referred to him as 'Bombastic Bushkin' in many of his opening monologues on The Tonight Show.","TV host Johnny Carson chatted up an 'attractive brunette' at a bar in 1970 .

An Arizona judge has freed a man who was charged with the first degree murder of his son nine years ago. Judge Sally Duncan cited 'a pattern and practice of misconduct' by prosecutors during the controversial trial of Jeffrey Martinson, 43, who was being held on a charge killing his five-year-old son, Josh, in 2004 while in the midst of a custody battle. Duncan dropped all charges against Martinson and ordered he be released at noon on November 26, saying the prosecution team acted with a ruthless 'win-by-any-means strategy'. Because of the theory double jeopardy, Martinson cannot be tried again on the same charges, according to UPI. The body of Martinson's son Josh was found by a neighbor on a bunk bed in Martinson's Ahwatukee apartment in August 2004 during a court-ordered weekend visitation with his father. Free man as of next week: Accused child killer Jeffrey Martinson will walk free from prison on November 26 after nine years after his first-degree murder charge, relating to the death of his son Josh in 2004, was dropped by a judge this week . Deceased: The cold body of four-year-old Josh Eberle-Martinson was found on a top bunk bed in the apartment of his father, Jeffrey Martinson, in August 2004. While Martinson said he found Josh floating in the bathtub and could not resuscitate him, an autopsy showed he had died of an overdose of muscle relaxants . Martinson claimed he had found the child floating in the bathtub and could not resuscitate him. The neighbor also found Martinson unconscious in his bedroom with a plastic bag over his head and superficial cuts to his wrists. Martinson claimed he was distraught and tried to kill himself but failed. However muscle relaxants were found in Josh's blood, with a medical examiner ruling he died of a drug overdose. On the night the boy died Martinson was in a custody dispute with his ex-wife. Prosecutors argued it was a case of murder and attempted suicide. In a 28-page ruling, Duncan said Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Frankie Grimsman charged Martinson with felony murder, on the grounds that Josh had died from child abuse inflicted by Martinson. However, when it came to the court case, Grimsman tried Martinson as if he were charged with premeditated, intentional murder. Grimsman had been warned by Duncan several times over the course of the trial not to treat the charge as premeditated. 'When viewing the totality of circumstances, the Court finds that during trial the Prosecutors engaged in a pattern and practice of misconduct designed to secure a conviction without regard to the likelihood of reversal,' Duncan wrote. Martinson, 47, has been in jail for nine years awaiting a final verdict. 'Mommy misses you so much': Kris Eberle (left), pictured with son Josh, keeps a blog about dealing with the death of her son. She alerted Phoenix police in 2004 after Martinson didn't return their son on time and wasn't answering his phone. After several years of changing defense attorneys, Martinson finally went to trial seven years after Josh's death, in July 2011. He was found guilty in November 2011, with the jury deciding there were aggravating factors that made him eligible for the death penalty. But before the jury could sentence Martinson, a juror came forward accusing the forewoman of browbeating other jurors into a guilty verdict. The verdict was thrown out in March 2012. In fall that year, Grimsman told the judge that the original indictment and the intent to seek the death penalty had been dropped and asked that another judge and defense team be appointed. In late 2012, The Arizona Court of Appeals ruled that Grimsman could indeed re-indict Martinson, unless Duncan found that Grimsman had done so in bad faith. On Tuesday, Duncan made that finding, in addition to the finding of prosecutorial misconduct. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office however still has options to appeal. 'We will review the Judge’s allegations as well as refer the record of the proceedings to our Ethics Committee and Appellate section for review,' County Attorney Bill Montgomery told The Arizona Republic. 'We will also review the conduct of defense counsel and that of the Judge for appropriate action.' Defending the case had cost taxpayers $2.97 million as of last July, nearly twice the amount paid for the defense of Jodi Arias, who was convicted of first-degree murder in May following the 2008 stabbing and shooting death of  her boyfriend, Travis Alexander, in his suburban Phoenix home.","Jeffrey Martinson, 43, was arrested and charged with the murder of his five-year-old son Josh in August 2004 in Maricopa, Arizona .

Britain is facing a shortage of goat's cheese following a slump in production across Europe, industry experts have revealed today. Middle-class kitchens and posh restaurants alike may have to go without following a decimation of stocks across Europe, it has been claimed. Low supply coupled with an increase in demand during the festival period will see prices of what is produced soar, some experts have said. Shortage: Many middle-class kitchens and restaurants could have to go without goat's cheese this Christmas period after a Europe-wide shortage . The shortage follows a cull of more than 50,000 pregnant goats . and sheep across Europe in 2010 to rid herds of the . disease Q Fever - which can spread from animals to humans, trade journal The Grocer reported. This not only meant an inevitable fall in stock, but many farmers stopped breeding the animals after they lost almost all of their livelihoods due to the cull. Experts said today that the situation is a 'perfect storm' of rising demand at a time when stocks are low. Goat's cheese is traditionally in high demand during the festive period, along with many other upmarket foods. 'Crisis': In 2010, 50,000 goats and sheep were culled in a bid to stop the spread of Fever Q - a disease which can spread to humans (library image) Last week it was announced the cost of chocolate would increase by up to a third. Crippling . rises in the price of cocoa butter could add 21p to the cost of every . 100g of milk chocolate by December, experts said. They added it would affect everything from expensive truffles to festive advent calendars and even chocolate coins. The . cost of producing chocolate has gone up by 33 per cent in the last year. This is thanks to a 70 per cent rise in the price of cocoa butter, a 50 per . cent rise in milk powder prices and a 15 per cent increase in whey . powder costs. So far, chocolate makers have sheltered consumers from some of the costs - but this may change with the Christmas rush. Howard Newmarch of specialist . cheesemaker Eurilait said: 'Inevitably there will be allocations to . ensure that customers are supplied in part, but not totally what they . would ideally want.' George Paul, director of rivals . Bradburys, added: 'Retailers would either need to pay more for goat . products or risk being left short. 'One or the other will give shortly - it'll either be price or availability.' It would seem that cheese is not the only item that may be too costly for the average kitchen in the run up to Christmas this year. Last week it was announced the cost of chocolate was set to soar by up to a third.

A 28-year-old father-of-two hanged himself following a trivial row with his girlfriend over dog food, a coroner heard today. Steven Eatwell flew into a rage at his partner Julie Napier over how much dog food to take with them on a trip away on holiday. The couple exchanged angry words before she left the house in her car. An inquest heard he then texted his girlfriend of four years saying he was going to kill himself and she rushed back to their home to find him hanging from the stairs. The tragedy happened the day after cannabis addict Mr Eatwell had decided to give up taking the drug. Miss Napier told a coroner she thought in hindsight Steven may have been suffering from depression before he took his life. She said that the couple were planning a trip away to Somerset when they started arguing about how much dog food to take with them for their pet. She stormed out of their house in Newbury, Berkshire, and the couple continued the row over the mobile phone and a number of texts. However, when Mr Eatwell threatened to commit suicide, Miss Napier rushed home and found him hanging. In a statement read out by the coroner, she said: ‘I found him hanging over the stairs. 'Steven was grey in his face and I thought he was already dead.' Miss Napier said she called for an ambulance and tried to cut him down but he was too heavy. Paramedics cut the man down and started resuscitation attempts before he was rushed to hospital. The inquest heard paramedics managed to restart his heart with a defibrillator. However, he suffered fatal brain damage and died in hospital two days later, on August 8. Steven Eatwell, who was a regular cannabis smoker, decided to give the drug up the day before he died . Miss Napier said Mr Eatwell was a regular cannabis smoker but had decided to give up the drug the day before he died. 'Him not smoking the cannabis may have made him irrational and led to him taking his life over an argument over dog food.' The inquest heard that Mr Eatwell had two children - one by Miss Napier and another from a previous relationship. The youngsters were in Miss Napier’s car on the driveway when she rushed indoors and found him hanging at their home in Newbury. A pathologist who examined Mr Eatwell’s body after he died at the Great Western Hospital, Swindon, Wiltshire, concluded that he died from hypoxic brain injury caused by self-asphyxia. Anna Burnside, assistant deputy coroner for Berkshire, recorded an open verdict after saying she couldn’t be sure Mr Eatwell intended to kill himself. She said: 'I’m not entirely sure whether it was possibly a cry for help rather than an act intending to kill himself.' Miss Napier and his relatives did not wish to comment after the inquest.","Steven Eatwell flew into a rage at his partner Julie Napier .

Tory right-wingers denounced Cameron ally Nick Boles as an ‘alien’ yesterday after the planning minister said the party was out of touch with young people. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Boles warned that Conservatives have no appeal to the under 25s because they view the Tories as ‘aliens from another planet’. He called for Mr Cameron to shout his support for gay marriage ‘from the rooftops’ and back the creation of a National Liberal party to attract young voters and those outside the rural heartlands of the South East, with Tory MPs running on a joint ticket at the next election. No 10 rejected Mr Boles’ plan. But right-wingers went further yesterday denouncing Mr Boles’ proposals, saying they would alienate voters further and called for a more robust Conservative message. Leading Tory traditionalist Stewart Jackson, the MP for Peterborough, said: ‘I see Tory modernisers as an alien tribe. ‘I simply wouldn’t even contemplate voting for them.’ Mr Jackson pointed to the decisive victory of right-winger Tony Abbott in the recent Australian general election. ‘Tony Abbott shows where you’ve [got] principled, strong, Conservative leadership [and] vision even against an endemic liberal Establishment, you’ll win.’ Fellow backbencher Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, accused Mr Boles of peddling the kind of trendy views prevalent in the Westminster village, rather than seeking to win over voters elsewhere. He called on the Prime Minister to give local people a stronger say in candidate selection by opening up the vote to local people in open primaries and consulting constituents using the internet. Mr Carswell said: ‘Real Tory modernisation means open primary selection and an iDemocracy structure, not following latest faddish thoughts of [the] SW1 gang.’ Mr Boles is a member of Mr Cameron’s inner social circle and his views are listened to by senior ministers. Douglas Carswell (left) accused Mr Boles of peddling the kind of trendy views prevalent in the Westminster village while Peter Bones (right) dismissed Mr Boles’ claims that his views would repel young voters . His speech, to the Bright Blue think tank, was significant since it amounted to an admission that Mr Cameron’s modernising project to make the Tories more attractive has failed after eight years. Mr Boles did win unlikely support from some Conservative right-wingers though, who are attracted by the idea of Conservative MPs being allowed to run on joint tickets with the UK Independence Party. Peter Bones, the MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘There are a number of people in the party who are attracted by these ideas since they want to fight the next election with the support of other parties. ‘A second party should be able to endorse Conservate candidates. Nick Boles seems to want to run as a Conservative and a National Liberal. I would like to run as a Conservative backed by Ukip. ‘I think there is much merit in this argument but I don’t think that is quite what Nick Boles had in mind. We used to run as Conservatives and Unionists, so this isn’t anything unusual.’ But Mr Bone, a committed Eurosceptic who also opposed gay marriage, dismissed Mr Boles’ claims that his views would repel young voters. ‘My views are just as attractive to young people as they are to anyone else,’ he said.","Mr Boles warned that Conservatives have no appeal to the under 25s .

Locals and tourists queue at Acapulco airport in the hope of catching one of the few flights to Mexico City . Two of Mexico's largest airlines were running about two flights an hour from Acapulco's still-flooded international airport yesterday, with priority for those with tickets, the elderly and families with young children. Everyone else who couldn't wait for the government's promise to reopen the roads within two days flocked to Air Base 7 about 20 minutes north of Acapulco, where a military air bridge made up of barely more than a dozen aircraft ferried tourists to Mexico City. The normally quiet beach-front installation was transformed into a scene from a conflict zone. Families in shorts and sandals waited for as long as eight hours outside the gates of the base, held at bay by rifle-toting soldiers until they were allowed to drag suitcases, pet carriers and red-eyed children across the tarmac, where they jostled furiously for a chance at one of the 150 seats on the next departing Air Force Boeing 727. Last night it was reported that at least six Britons, including  a teacher, remain stranded. The  Foreign Office said it was ‘doing everything we can to assist British nationals’.

If you think relations with unions are difficult now, take a look at this mansion which a millionaire businessman built with fort-like defences to keep out activists in the 1800s. The spectacular £1.95m home in Newport, South Wales, was built by a wealthy Victorian industrialist. Magnate John Jenkins put up the walls to keep out 'invaders' as he feared the rise of Chartists - the early trade unionists. Mansion: The home in the Welsh town of Carleon near Newport is on the market for £1.95m and comes complete with it's own fort and Stone defences . He wanted the defences around the mansion, the Mynde in Caerleon, to protect the property from any working class enemies. But today the stone fortications mark the grounds and gardens of the luxury family home. Current owner Terry Greenhaf, a successful engineer, said: 'The house has history and lots of it. 'We’ve brought our children up here and it’s also a very peaceful, relaxing home where owls and buzzards fly by, herons come and visit. 'You can just sit or walk in the grounds and think you’re right in the heart of the countryside.' Fort: The home was built in 1839 by wealthy trade unionist John Jenkins. He erected the stone defences to keep out activists . Luxury: As well as the fortified defences, the mansion has 20 rooms, a swimming pool and a bar nestled in the heart of the Welsh countryside . Defences: The home has a wall around it and fortified defences which were built to keep out 'invaders'. Current owner Terry Greenhaf, a successful engineer, says the house has lots of history and is a 'peaceful, relaxing home' The property’s stone fortifications were . built in 1839 by Mr Jenkins, who was a tin plate businessman turned . High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. He constructed the walls for protection against the Chartists - working class activists who campaigned for the right to vote. The Chartists were becoming increasingly belligerent and the sheriff built the wall to keep them off his land. Today the three and a half acre site is home to a 20 room mansion complete with it’s own swimming pool and a bar. The house also boasts seven reception rooms, five bedrooms, four bathrooms, sitting rooms and a triple garage. Secluded: The mansion, the Mynde in Caerleon, is up for sale after being owned by the same person for 35 years . Land: The three and a half acre site is home to lots of wildlife and is regularly visited by owls, buzzards and herons . Walks: The owner says you feel like you are completely in the countryside while walking through the grounds . But the property is now up for sale after the Greenhaf family, who have lived there for 35 years, said they want to 'downsize'. Peter Reilly, head of residential sales at estate agent Savills’ Cardiff office said: 'The property is spectacular. 'Ornamental plaster work, wooden doors and wide staircases add to the feeling of opulence throughout this most elegant property. 'The gardens have been beautifully landscaped with low walls, raised borders, ornamental railings and a lovely pergola-covered walk to side of the house. 'There are also far reaching views over the River Usk and the countryside beyond.' Picturesque: The house also boasts seven reception rooms, five bedrooms, four bathrooms, sitting rooms and a triple garage .

The suspected gunman . arrested for shooting a newspaper photographer in Paris had lived in Britain for several years before returning to France in July, the Paris prosecutor says. Abdelhakim Dekhar, also suspected of three other attacks, had written a 'confused' letter criticising media manipulation and capitalism and including a vague reference to Syria. Dekhar is in custody in a suburban Paris hospital after police detained him on Wednesday night, ending a two-day nationwide manhunt following an attack at the left-wing newspaper Liberation and a subsequent . shooting outside the offices of bank Societe Generale. Scroll down for video . Wanted: The image shows the alleged gunman walking at the Concorde underground station in Paris, France . A shoot-out that gripped France: Bodies at the scene of a gun battle between French police and Florence Rey and her boyfriend Audry Maupin in 1994. Dekhar was convicted of buying a gun used in the serial killing . Serial killings: Three police officers, a taxi driver and one of the shooters, Audry Maupin, were killed in the shoot-out in 1994 (above) France's 'Bonnie': Florence Rey was sentenced to 20 years in jail over the shootings. She was released in 2009 . Police later found him in a . 'semi-conscious state' after an attempt to kill himself with medication, . Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters. The . witness who led police to him said Dekhar had been staying with her and . that they had met while working in a restaurant together in London 13 . years ago. The new British link comes just a day after police revealed Dekhar had previously been . jailed for his role in a Bonnie-and-Clyde-style multiple murder that . gripped France two decades ago. Speaking on Wednesday police said his DNA matched samples from the scene of the attacks. Dekhar . was convicted in 1998 of buying a gun used in the so-called Rey-Maupin . affair which saw three policemen, a taxi driver killed along with . shooter Audry Maupin in in October 1994. In . a press conference late on Wednesday, Interior minister Manuel Valls praised . police for their handling of Dekhar's arrest, saying that 'all the . evidence today points to his involvement in the events that he has been . charged with'. He was . arrested around 7pm (6pm GMT) in a vehicle in an underground parking lot . in the northwestern Paris suburb of Bois-Colombes, after apparently . trying to commit suicide. Valls . said that 'everything appears to point to a suicide attempt' and . sources told the AFP news agency that Dekhar was semi-conscious when he . was found. Today the prosecutor confirmed Dekhar was being detained on suspicion of attempted murder and kidnapping in four offences including the shooting of an assistant photographer at leading daily newspaper Liberation on Monday. He is also being investigated about an incidents last week at the BFM-TV network in which he threatened staff with a shotgun, fired shots at the headquarters of French bank Societe Generale and briefly took a driver hostage at gunpoint and forced him to drive from a western suburb to central Paris. The head of the . Paris criminal police department Christian Flaesch said that although he was now in . custody, he was in a 'medical environment' and was not in a fit state to speak . to investigators. Wanted: Police are hunting this man, pictured on security cameras carrying a bag, red arrow on left, outside the Liberation newspaper office in Paris, France . Search: This CCTV image shows the alleged shooter sitting on a bench of a tramway station in Paris . Danger: The gunman aims his weapon and fires during an attack on a French television station BFM TV on Friday . Meanwhile the motive for the . shootings remains unclear. Valls said investigators would need more . information about the suspect's past to be able to 'understand his . motivation'. The arrest came . after a witness statement to police, who had on Tuesday released a new . photograph of the man suspected in the attacks and received hundreds of . calls from potential witnesses. After Dekhar's arrest, investigators found two letters he had left behind. One appeared to be a suicide note, and the other was described as a 'rather confused' letter evoking 'fascist plots.' In that second letter, the suspect accuses the media of 'participating in the manipulation of the masses, journalists are paid to make the citizens swallow lies with a little spoon.' He also criticises capitalism and government neglect of suburban housing projects, which he calls 'an enterprise of dehumanization of a population that the capital doesn't want.' Such projects, home to many disillusioned and jobless families with roots in former French colonies in Africa, erupted in riots in 2005, and tensions between project youth and police continue to erupt in sporadic violence. Mr Molins said psychiatrists who examined Dekhar in the 1990s described him as having 'storytelling tendencies' though 'no specific anomaly in the psychiatric sense.' He is to undergo psychiatric examination as well as police questioning. The shooting prompted cries of concern about attacks on the media. Security was tightened at media offices and on the busy Champs-Elysees. Intent: CCTV from inside the television station captures the moment the gunman, dressed in a black sleeveless top and carrying a large dark sack, calmly walks down the stairs towards the reception . Chilling: The gunman aims his pump-action shotgun at the man behind the desk and opens fire . Close range: The wanted man gets to within a few feet before firing the shotgun . Escape: The suspect, who is described as white, in his 40s, shaven-headed, fled scene and is now being hunted by police . The . man opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun at the offices of Liberation . early on Monday, shooting a 23-year-old photographer's assistant as he . hauled gear in the lobby, then firing another blast that hit the roof . before leaving within seconds. He . then crossed the city to the La Defense business district on its . western edge, where he fired several shots outside the main office of . the Societe Generale bank, hitting no one. He . hijacked a car and forced the driver to drop him off close to the . Champs Elysees in the centre of the French capital, before disappearing. Police . say he was the same man who on Friday stormed into the Paris . headquarters of a 24-hour TV news channel, BFMTV, briefly threatening . staff with a gun before hurrying out. Dekhar was suspected of being the third man in . the so-called Rey-Maupin affair, which caused a scandal in France, with . investigators comparing the Rey and her lover Audry Maupin to the infamous American . outlaws Bonnie and Clyde.

The London Underground will run a partial service overnight on Fridays and Saturdays, it was revealed today. But the vast majority of stops on the new night route map are north of the River Thames. Every ticket office on the Tube network is to be closed by 2015 under plans to fully automate ticket sales and run round-the-clock through-the-night services, London Mayor Boris Johnson announced. The move will lead to the axing of 750 jobs as the remaining staff are moved from behind ticket office windows to help passengers in the station as the Underground moves for the first time to run 24 hours a day on Fridays and Saturdays on some lines. The move will push more passengers towards buying electronic Oyster cards or pre-paid over the internet using smart-phones and iPads, or relying on buying tickets from machines in the stations for which additional staff will be on hand to help. Announcement: Mayor of London Boris Johnson (left) with London Underground Managing Director Mike Brown (right) as he revels there will be a new 24-hour Tube service at weekends and changes to station staffing . Transport for London (TfL) says the changes will be better for customers and help save more than £40m a year. But the RMT union said it was a ‘lethal programme of cuts’. The transport authority is facing a budget reduction of about £78m in the financial years of 2013 and 2014. TfL says six major central London stations will have special customer points to help tourists and that every station will be staffed while the tube is running. It is part of a series of initiatives that were announced, including improved ticket machines, contactless bank card payment technology from next year, extended Wi-Fi coverage at underground stations, and staff based in ticket halls and on platforms rather than in ticket offices. Changes: TfL says six major central London stations will have special customer points to help tourists and that every station will be staffed while the tube is running . All Tube stations will continue to be . staffed, and billions of pounds of investment will continue, said Mayor . Boris Johnson and London Underground managing director Mike Brown. 'It is time to take the Tube to the next level and so for the first time in London's history, we will provide a regular 24-hour Night Tube service at weekends' London Mayor Boris Johnson . But there was fury and threats of . retaliation from angry unions angered that the plans will also lead to a . reduction of around 750 jobs out of London Underground’s current total . of 18,000, which includes 5,500 station staff. London Underground said it was committed to delivering the reduction in operational staff numbers ‘without any compulsory redundancies. The plans aim to deliver savings of around £50million a year, or £270million over the term of Transport for London's business plan to 2020/21. Shut: Every ticket office on the Tube network is to be closed by 2015 under radical plans to fully automate ticket sales . Mr Johnson said: ‘For 150 years the . Tube has been the beating heart of London, its tunnels and tracks . providing the arteries that have transported millions of people and . helped to drive the development and economic growth of our great city. 'The Mayor of London has today ripped up his manifesto promise to the people of London' Shadow London minister Sadiq Khan . ‘Now . it is time to take the Tube to the next level and so for the first time . in London's history, we will provide a regular 24-hour Night Tube . service at weekends.’ He . said: ‘This will not just boost jobs and our vibrant night-time economy, . it will further cement London's reputation as the best big city on the . planet to in which to live, work, visit and invest.’ Mr Brown defended the job cuts. He said: ‘People are at the heart of this vision - our customers and staff. Opening hours: Mr Brown with the Night Tube map, at Piccadilly Circus Underground station in London . 'My commitment to London is that all Tube . stations will continue to be staffed and controlled in future, with . more staff visible and available to help customers buy the right ticket, . plan their journey and keep them safe and secure.’ The Rail Maritime and Transport union warned of industrial action, adding that staffing levels will be 'decimated'. General secretary Bob Crow said: 'The Mayor must believe he is some sort of magician if he thinks he can slash jobs and still run safe services when everyone knows that staffing has already been cut to the bone while passenger demand continues to rise. 'Throwing in the plan for night time operation at the weekends is just a smokescreen to try and camouflage the real issue which is a savage cuts to jobs, access and safety. 'We will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and that means using every campaigning, political and industrial tool at our disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a strategy for that campaign, including a ballot for industrial action.' He . insisted: ‘We will continue to make the Tube more accessible and . provide assistance at stations for all our customers who need it.’ He . stressed there would be continued investment in stations and new trains . and promised ‘a better face-to-face service at our stations, a 24-hour . service at weekends, with easier and more personalised ways to plan and . pay for journeys, on and off our network.’ London .

As a result of his plans, Londoners will feel more . anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted.’ He . said: ‘Commuters will have nowhere to turn when their Oyster card is . lost, stolen or broken. It will make the daily commute more difficult . for everyone but, more worryingly, there are serious concerns about . whether there will be enough staff at London's busy stations to respond . in emergency situations.’ Cllr . Philippa Roe, leader of Westminster City Council and chair of the West . End Partnership, said: ‘When we first established the West End . Commission at the start of this year, one of the major recommendations . that came through was to run the tube at later times at the weekend. ‘We . are delighted that our work with businesses, Peter Hendy, and the TfL . team has now made that a reality. The West End Partnership may be in its . infancy but we are already getting results that will benefit the entire . West End of London.’ Experts . say London’s move towards scrapping ticket offices and switching to . automated ticketing will be replicated on rail services across the UK. Under the new Tube system, passengers will from next year be able to use their ‘contactless’ bank cards as Oyster cards, swiping them across automated readers just before they board and after they alight, with payment being taken automatically from their bank account. Customers will be further encouraged to pre-order and pay for their Oyster cards online. Thousands of Underground station staff will be given tablet computers holding up to date travel and train information to help passengers. Wi-fi coverage will be rolled out to  remaining Underground stations by 2014  just as experts predict that internet use by smartphones and tablets is about to overtake that on  traditional computers. Fewer than 3 per cent of travellers currently pay for their fares at a ticket office, said TfL, which is introducing 150 new ticket machines. TfL said London’s population is set to grow from 8.4million to 10million by 2030 – or the equivalent of a Tube train full of people every week. For that reason the capital required a system that ‘meets the needs of customers of the  21st century.’","Every ticket office on London Underground network to be shut by 2015 .

A letter from an astronaut shows his jealousy of John Glenn after he was not picked to be the first American to orbit Earth. In October 1961, Gus Grissom glumly confided to his mother in a letter that is now up for auction that he and his fellow Mercury 7 astronauts resented John Glenn after he was chosen for the mission. Within the famously competitive group, Glenn had emerged as the face of the space program, while Grissom was reluctant in front of the press. Gus Grissom: In this photo taken July 21, 1961, the astronaut is seen next to the space capsule Liberty Bell 7, for his departure from Cape Caneveral, Florida . When he wrote to his mother, Grissom was still stinging from his Liberty Bell 7 flight on July 21, 1961, that ended with a blown hatch, a sunken space capsule and accusations that the former Air Force fighter pilot had panicked. 'The flight crew for the orbital mission has been picked and I'm not on it,' he writes in slanting script, each line of blue ink climbing slightly from left to right on the Project Mercury letterhead. 'Of course I've been feeling pretty low for the past few days. 'All of us are mad because Glenn was picked. But we expressed our views prior to the selection so there isn't much we can do about it but support the flight and the program.' The letter is being auctioned online by RR Auction of Amherst, New Hampshire, which got it from Grissom's brother, Lowell. 'Those original seven Mercury astronauts were extremely competitive people,' Lowell Grissom said this week. 'If one was picked over another, they all thought it should be them. It's that kind of atmosphere; they all wanted to be first.' Virgil 'Gus' Grissom was the second American to make a suborbital flight. After splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean, his craft sank when the hatch blew open prematurely and it filled with water. Auction: The letter is expected to fetch $80,000 when it is sold in New Hampshire . Grissom narrowly escaped drowning and insisted until his death in a 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he did nothing to cause the hatch to blow. Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth in February 1962 and is the last surviving Mercury 7 astronaut. He did not return calls seeking comment. In the Oct. 7 letter to his mother Cecile, Grissom candidly shares his disappointment at being named a flight controller for the second orbital flight, to be piloted by Donald 'Deke' Slayton. Slayton was replaced by Scott Carpenter because of a heart condition. 'It's not a job I want,' Grissom writes. 'I have to do a great deal of the work, I'll be gone from home a lot and I don't get any of the credit, but if anything goes wrong, I'll get a good deal of the blame.'Grissom would later pilot the Gemini III orbital mission. There's a touch of mystery, too. Before he shares the flight crew information - which he cautions his mother to 'keep it under your hat' - Grissom drops a hint that someone may be listening in. Crew: In this photo taken Sept. 25, 1959 in San Diego, California, astronauts stand around models of the Atlas and nose capsule designed to carry them into space. From left are Walter Schirra, J.R. Dempsey, executive of Convair, maker of Atlas, John H. Glenn, Jr., Virgil I. Grissom, Alan Shepard, Leroy G. Cooper Jr. and Malcolm S. Carpenter . 'I probably would call you, because it's been so long since I've called or written, but I've got some news I don't think I should talk about over the phone,' he writes. Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, said the letter offers rare insight into the mind of a driven, talented man. He anticipates it could fetch $80,000 when the auction closes today; a letter from Alan Shepherd to his parents about trying out for the space program sold for $106,000. Lowell Grissom said the letter reveals a side of his brother away from the space program. He writes his wife, Betty, is 'getting pretty fed up' with him being away from home so much, and interrupts the letter midway through to take the family bowling. 'I kind of think that it shows that he was just a normal kind of guy; that he had deep involvement in the space program but also had a family to take care of,' he said . The letter had been sitting in a drawer and Lowell Grissom said he was selling it to 'keep Gus' memory alive and let people know what kind of man he was.' 'Another side': As well as talking about the space program, Grissom talks about his life away from the mission .","Gus Grissom glumly confided to mother in letter that is now up for auction .

Britain consumes more anti-depressants than almost all our neighbours in Europe, an international study has found. The UK has the seventh-highest prescribing rate for drugs such as Prozac in the Western world, with 71 daily doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011. This is almost double the 38 doses a day prescribed a decade earlier, according to the study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents the world’s industrialised nations. Trend: Britain has a rising rate of anti-depressant use for drugs like prozac (pictured) and is among the highest users of the drugs in Europe and the western world . The surge has led to concerns among some doctors that antidepressants are being overprescribed in Britain. Iceland                                106Australia                              89Canada                               86Denmark                             85Sweden                               79           Portugal                              78           UNITED KINGDOM             71Belgium                               70Finland                                70Spain                                   64Norway                                58 . *Defined daily dose, per 1,000 people per day . There has been a particular rise in the use of a family of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), like Prozac and Seroxat. There have been concerns that some of these drugs may be linked to suicide attempts among younger users. These SSRIs are taken by almost 4million people in the UK every year. The OECD figures show Iceland to have the highest prescribing rate, at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011, up from 71 a decade earlier. Behind Iceland is Australia, then Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. The lowest levels are seen in Chile and South Korea. Antidepressant use in the UK is far higher than much of mainland Europe. In France and Germany, for example, prescriptions are at only two thirds the level – at 50 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants. In Italy, the level is just 42 doses a day. A spokesman for the OECD said: ‘The consumption of certain types of prescribed drugs has increased significantly since 2000 in the UK, notably the consumption of antidepressants and antibiotics. ‘As in several other countries, the rise in consumption of antidepressants preceded the financial and economic crisis in 2008, but consumption has continued to grow rapidly since then: it nearly doubled in the UK between 2000 and 2011, and is now well above the OECD average. ‘Greater intensity and duration of treatments are some of the factors explaining the rise in antidepressant consumption in the United Kingdom and other countries.’ The increases in antidepressant use has caused concern because rates of depression have not risen to the same extent – indicating that doctors may be prescribing the drugs unnecessarily for people will only mild depression. Worry: Experts fear that the use of antidepressants has risen far higher that rates of depression in Britain (file picture) The OECD said that rising consumption levels could be explained by the use of antidepressants in milder cases. ‘These extensions have raised concerns about appropriateness,’ it said. Dr Mark van Ommeren, of the World Health Organisation's department of mental health and substance abuse, said: ‘The explosion of antidepressants you see in most countries reflects the fact that lots of people with moderate to severe depression are getting treatment – that's a good thing. ‘But the negative thing is that a lot of people are getting antidepressants who shouldn't be getting them. Doctors and healthcare providers should be able to recognise depression correctly so that those who need antidepressants get them and those with only mild cases do not get prescribed.’ Professor Tim Cantopher, consultant psychiatrist with the Priory Group in the UK, said: ‘Antidepressants are widely oversubscribed to get rid of unhappiness. ‘They were not designed for that. Unhappiness is part of the human condition. But real clinical depression does respond to antidepressants. And not to prescribe in these cases is to sentence an individual to a far longer illness than he or she need suffer.’ Professor Tim Kendall, director of the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health in the UK, said the rise was a ‘testament to the effective marketing by the pharmaceutical industry’. ‘I also wonder if, in better-off countries, we don’t have time to be depressed and seek chemical solutions to “get rid of it”.’ The OECD figures on antidepressants were contained in their Health at a Glance 2013 report, released yesterday. It also showed that Britain’s cancer survival rates are on a par with Eastern Europe, and that our GPs are the best paid in the Western world.","UK has seventh highest rate in the Western world for drugs like Prozac .

A plan to pay £1,000 ‘bonuses’ to  Special Constables has been branded ‘policing on the cheap’ and a cut-price way to fill the gap created by the loss of 10,000 full-time officers. At present Special Constables - volunteers often with other jobs - only receive expenses. The Home Office hopes that by allowing local forces to make the bonus payments it will help them recruit more Specials. Dispute: The chairman of the Police Federation Specials working group said the plan could be an attempt to fill gaps which should be taken by regular officers . But Andy Fittes, chairman of the Police Federation Specials working group, said: ‘Our fear is this could be policing on the cheap, trying to fill gaps which should be taken by regular officers.’ In some areas, Specials, along with civilian Police Community Support Officers, already make up the majority of key town centre patrols on busy Friday and Saturday nights. They are trained and have the power of arrest but are less experienced than regular officers, and may have work commitments that mean they have to cancel shifts at short notice. Mr Fittes added: ‘When you start to rely on a group of people who have day jobs, you could have a scenario where no one turns up. It’s nothing to do with them as individuals or their training – it’s just they have a job outside the force.’ Adam Simmonds, crime tsar for Northamptonshire, believes the bonus plan would transform policing, especially in rural areas. Replacements? The plan comes ahead of a report which will warn that cuts are threatening the survival of the traditional beat bobby . He said: ‘Specials are the only realistic way to bring the village bobby back as a familiar trusted face, stopping the police from being a remote bureaucracy for many rural people.’ But James Deller, secretary of the Association of Special Constabulary Chief Officers, said: ‘Specials are members of the public keeping their neighbourhoods safe. If you start paying people, will you get a different person coming forward?’ The plan comes as a major report due to be published tomorrow warns that cuts are threatening the survival of the traditional beat bobby. The study, commissioned by Labour and produced by former Met Commissioner Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, will say that 10,000 frontline officer posts have been lost as a result of a 20 per cent cut in force budgets since the 2010 Election. It will also say that police are only now reacting to crimes rather than preventing them, as ‘bobbies on the beat are disappearing’.","Special Constables could be paid a bonus under new Government plans .

Cheesy and proud: The Labour leader happily picked sing-a-long anthems to soundtrack his desert island . As he said himself, no one ever accused Ed Miliband of being cool. And after his appearance on Desert Island Discs this morning, that's not going to change any time soon. Unveiling his favourite eight tracks of all time, the Labour leader named A-ha, Robbie Williams and Neil Diamond in a pop-heavy playlist. It is a far cry from his political rival, Prime Minister David Cameron, who used his chance as a castaway to name-drop indie hits and student favourites by Radiohead, The Smiths and REM. He rebuked a suggestion by Kirsty Young, presenter of the BBC Radio 4 show, that politicians use the list to boost their image. Asked how many advisers had looked at the list beforehand, Mr Miliband, 43, said: 'It's absolutely my list. It's a list that is personal to me - some people will not like some of the songs and that's as it should be - but this is a list I chose.' He opted for stirring tunes such as the South African national anthem and Jerusalem and a personal tribute to his father with the left-wing anthem The Ballad of Joe Hill. To complete the collection, he requested sing-a-long anthems Take On Me by A-ha and Angels by Robbie Williams. He also reserved a spot on his island for . Je Ne Regrette Rien by Edith Piaf, famously sung by former chancellor . Norman Lamont in 1993 at a press conference when asked what he regretted . most: singing in the bath after Black Wednesday, or promising 'green shoots' of recovery. His desert island luxury was a regular chicken tikka curry takeaway and his book was Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Sing-a-long: Miliband named anthems by Robbie Williams (left) and A-ha singer Morten Harket (right) In his interview, Mr Miliband admitted . his relationship with brother David has still not fully ‘healed’ following his decision to stand against him for the Labour leadership. He . said their 2010 leadership battle was ‘really, really tough’ on those . close to him and that he had ‘possibly underestimated’ the emotional . impact his decision to stand would have on his family. The Labour leader, who is not religious, also described about the moment he prayed to God to save his dying father. Mr Miliband, 43, still regards older . brother David as his ‘best friend’ but says their relationship is . ‘healing’ rather than healed. ‘It has been incredibly tough. Really, really tough. I didn’t take this decision lightly. Healing: He opened up about his troubled relationship with brother David Miliband (right) pictured here in 2010 . ‘I . knew it would have an impact on my family, on him... It was hard for my . family. It was hard for David. It was very hard. But I suppose I felt . that it was the right thing,’ he said. Mr . Miliband adds that he and his brother avoided confronting each other . about their rival ambitions before the leadership contest, adding: ‘We . probably danced around it a bit because neither of us particularly was . desperate to confront it.’ Today's . list is a change from the one he compiled for Labour Uncut in the run . up to the party leadership election in 2010, when he picked an iPhone . for his luxury and the more high-brow Ulysses as his book. Although Robbie Williams, A-ha and The Ballad of Joe Hill appeared on his 2010 list, he has made some revisions. Cool list: As leader of the opposition, David Cameron requested student favourites such as Radiohead . Eclectic: His coalition partner Nick Clegg put Shakira alongside Prince and David Bowie in his 2010 interview . Josh Ritter's song Good Man has been replaced by his other track Change Of Time. Two 1980s hits - Billy . Bragg's song A New England and Caravan of Love by the Housemartins - . have gone, replaced by Jerusalem and the South African national anthem. And he now prefers Neil Diamond to early-2000s indie band Hard-Fi. His brother and competitor, David, also shunned current music in favour of Elton John, Sting and The Beatles. By . way of contrast, Mr Cameron - who was at the time heading the . opposition when he appeared on the Radio 4 show in 2006 - packed his . selections with tunes which made him look as though he was seeking the . cool vote. He included Bob Dylan, The Killers and Benny Hill's comedy hit Ernie as a novelty extra. But his cool list was chided by the bands themselves. Paul Weller and The Smith's guitarist Johnny Marr both spoke out to inform the then-leader of the opposition that they would rather not count him as a fan. Nick Clegg, who appeared on the show in 2010, had something of an eclectic selection, featuring Radiohead and David Bowie alongside 80s pop classic Prince and Shakira's World Cup anthem Waka Waka.

The contractor who oversaw a botched building demolition that killed six people in a Salvation Army thrift store in Philadelphia has been charged with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment after choosing 'greed' over safety. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Griffin T. Campbell was also charged with risking a catastrophe and criminal conspiracy in addition to the six counts of third-degree murder, six counts of involuntary manslaughter and 13 counts of endangerment. 'It would appear, bluntly, the motive was greed,' Williams said. In the collapse on the morning of June 4, an unsupported four-story wall crashed down onto a neighboring thrift store, trapping workers and shoppers for 13 hours and killing six people. Campbell was expected to surrender to detectives Monday afternoon. 'At the center of culpability': Demolition contractor Griffin T. Campbell has been charged with multiple counts of murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment over the June 5 building collapse in Philadelphia. He is accused of 'cutting corners to cut costs' Destruction: A four-story building being demolished collapsed on the edge of downtown Philadelphia, leaving six people dead. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said on Monday, Nov. 25, 2013, that contractor Griffin T. Campbell has been charged with third-degree murder, as well as manslaughter, in connection with the Market Street collapse . Rescue workers search through rubble following the building collapse in Philadelphia on June 5, 2013. The 40-foot high freestanding wall fell onto this Salvation Army store . The charges are the first since excavator operator Sean Benschop was charged this summer with six counts of involuntary manslaughter for allegedly operating heavy equipment while high on marijuana and painkillers. Williams said the collapse remains under investigation but called Campbell the person 'at the center of culpability for the collapse'. He told reporters that Campbell ignored an architect's warning the night before the collapse to brace the wall. 'The tragic and preventable collapse ... robbed our city of six amazing Philadelphians that perished in the rubble and left an additional 13 wounded,' Williams said. Campbell alone chose the demolition method, cutting corners to meet a deadline and cut costs, as he was being paid a flat fee, Williams said. He was also given the right to salvage floor joints and other material, so he pulled the valuable floor joists out first, destabilizing the exterior walls, Williams said. Trapped: Some of the victims were stuck under the rubble for up to 13 hours. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams on Monday, Nov. 25, 2013 said that contractor Griffin T.

Lord Stevens said the present system of 43 forces in England and Wales 'creates unnecessary duplication' A number of police forces should be merged because the present national police structure is inefficient and ‘untenable’, a former Scotland Yard chief said yesterday. Lord Stevens said the present system of 43 forces in England and Wales ‘creates unnecessary duplication’ and often gets in the way of joint ‘cross border’ operations by police. He outlined plans for a radical shake-up as he presented the findings of an independent review of the future of policing, commissioned by the Labour Party. Seven years ago Labour tried unsuccessfully - while in Government - to streamline the number of forces in England and Wales. But Lord Stevens, who headed the Independent Police Commission for Labour, said the time was right to reconsider the idea as his inquiry team could find nobody in favour of retaining the current structure of 43 separate police force. He added, however, that there was no consensus about a better alternative. He said: ‘The Commission makes a clear recommendation that change is essential and believes there are three serious options. ‘These are locally-negotiated mergers and collaboration agreements, a co-ordinated amalgamation into approximately ten regional forces, or the creation of a national police service.’ In recognition of policing scandals including Hillsborough and the Plebgate row involving former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, Lord Stevens also recommended a fundamental shake-up of professional standards in forces in England and Wales. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) would be scrapped and replaced by a new Independent Police Standards Commission (IPSC), he said. His report - much of which will feature in Labour’s next General Election manifesto - also recommended a new status of ‘chartered police officer’, in addition to the office of constable. The reform would bring the police into line with other professions such as nursing and accountancy, with officers registered with the College of Policing which could strike them off for failing to meet professional standards. The College of Policing would decide misconduct hearings in public, unlike the current, behind-closed doors, disciplinary process. Lord Stevens outlined plans for a radical shake-up of policing as he presented the findings of an independent review of the future of policing, commissioned by the Labour Party . The Stevens report said: 'The presumption should be for total transparency - with open, public hearings for decisions on serious misconduct - rather than the muddled regime of partially open hearings and judgments which currently prevails. 'Police officers found to have committed serious misconduct by the College of Policing board should be struck off from the register.' Lord Stevens - who was Met chief between 2000 and 2005 - said there were 37 'radical' recommendations in his report, including a commitment to neighbourhood policing as the 'building block of fair and effective policing'. His report, billed as the most comprehensive inquiry into policing for half a century, said: 'A spate of organisational failures and scandals over recent years has badly damaged public confidence in the integrity of the police. ‘It is vital this situation is put right. Recent experience has found wanting the existing system which separates the monitoring of organisational performance from the investigation of police complaints.’ Yvette Cooper said she expects her Party to implement majority of the commission's recommendations . The Stevens report also said the elected police and crime commissioner model is 'systemically flawed as a method of democratic governance’ and should be scrapped in 2016, at the end of the term of office of the 41 serving PCCs. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who was at the launch of the report with Labour leader Ed Miliband, said she expects her Party to implement majority of the commission’s recommendations for policing reform. She ruled out a national police force, saying: 'Our preference is for a voluntary and collaborative approach involving local communities and we also want more work done on savings that can be made to plough back into policing. 'We will not support a national force as we believe that would be too large, too centralised and the wrong approach.' The last police mergers plan followed a report published by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary in 2005 which highlighted ‘significant weaknesses’ in the 43 force structure. The report said larger amalgamated police forces would be better suited to tackling the modern threats of organised crime and terrorism. But amid huge embarrassment for the Labour Government, the plan proved deeply unpopular amongst police chiefs and fell apart the following year.","Lord Stevens said the present system often gets in the way of joint 'cross border' operations by police .

Helen Grant failed to name the FA Cup winners (Wigan), the England rugby captain (Chris Robshaw) and the winner of Wimbledon's women's tournament (Marion Bartoli) Sports Minister Helen Grant was left humiliated after she failed to get a single question right in a basic quiz – on sport. The Conservative MP did not know the name of the current Wimbledon women’s champion. She also scored an own-goal by not knowing who won this year’s FA Cup. Mrs Grant bungled her way through five questions and got every answer wrong, even when she tried to cheat by seeking help from an adviser. She was quizzed in a toe-curling exchange with ITV Meridian. Asked who won the women’s title at Wimbledon, she replied: ‘It’s not one of us. ‘I know Andy Murray did it for us, which is absolutely fantastic and that’s the important thing.’ The correct answer was Marion Bartoli of France. Next she was asked who the FA Cup holders were. A slightly anxious-looking Mrs Grant said: ‘Come on, help,’ before replying: ‘Manchester United because it’s my favourite club.’ Most football fans would know if their team had won such a coveted trophy. The correct answer was Wigan Athletic. Mrs Grant did not even attempt to name the England Rugby Union captain (Chris Robshaw) simply replying: ‘What about hockey?’ Perhaps . taking pity on her, the presenter asked her when the football team in . her constituency, Maidstone United, had left the football league. Mrs Grant conceded: ‘These are hard questions’ before adding ‘last year’. The correct answer was 1992. Finally, she was asked which Paralympian had won the most gold medals at London 2012. An . adviser whispered the answer which Mrs Grant parroted: David Weir. But . the correct answer was Australian swimmer Jacqueline Freney. Afterwards . Mrs Grant said: ‘I wasn’t told there was going to be a quiz thrown in . at the end of an interview. If I’d known I would have done some proper . revision. ‘My sports pub quiz knowledge may not . be encyclopaedic but I completely understand the positive impact that . participating in sport has on people’s lives.’ Last . month, the MP for Maidstone and The Weald said that sport was in her . DNA shortly after being promoted to Sports Minister. She had widely been . tipped for the sack in the reshuffle. Wigan beat Manchester City 1-0 during this year's final before being demoted out of the Premier League . Chris Robshaw (left) carried England's hopes of a Grand Slam through this year's Six Nations campaign before losing to Wales in the final, while Marion Bartoli beat Sabine Lisicki to take the Wimbledon women's title . During her youth, according to her Parliamentary website, she was captain of her school tennis and hockey teams and represented Cumbria at hockey, tennis, athletics, and cross country. She later became under-16 judo champion in the north of England and southern Scotland. Mrs Grant is not the only sports minister to be left floundering after being ambushed in a quiz. Labour’s Richard Caborn suffered a similar fate in 2001, when the BBC’s Clare Balding asked him a string of questions about sport. Mr Caborn did not know that Martin Johnson was the then captain of the British Lions rugby team, could not name a single jockey riding in that week’s Ascot and could not identify three of the four semi-finalists at the Queen’s Club tennis tournament. He made a gallant stab at naming England’s cricket coach, declaring he was ‘the Aussie’... but Duncan Fletcher was actually from Zimbabwe.","Helen Grant was given a surprise quiz during an interview .

David Cameron risks splitting the Conservative party if he abandons the green agenda, senior MPs have warned. The Prime Minister was confronted by more than 25 Tory ministers and MPs demanding he stick to his promises on the environment. It follows reports he told aides to ‘get rid of all this green crap’ amid warnings that abandoning the modernisation of the Tory party will cost him the next election. Pressure: David Cameron has been warned he risks splitting the Tory party if he abandons his modernisation programme . Mr Cameron has struck an increasingly strident tone on immigration, Europe and benefits, designed to appeal to Tory traditionalists who have defected to the UK Independence Party. At the same time some of the flagship policies of his early leadership including the environment and the Big Society have been quietly dropped. They want to hold Mr Cameron to his promise to lead the 'greenest government ever'. At a showdown meeting on Friday afternoon, more than 25 Conservative MPs packed into the Prime Minister’s office in the House of Commons to voice their dismay at the direction of the party. One MP who was there told The Times the meeting was an attempt to ‘flex our muscles’ in defiance at the higher profile right-wing of the party. The meeting was organised by Laura Sandys, the MP for South Thanet who yesterday announced she will quit the Commons at the next election after being first elected in 2010. She follows Louise Mensch, who left Parliament last year, and Lorraine Fullbrook who has also announced she will not contest the South Ribble seat again. Downing Street expected at least half a dozen of the MPs elected in 2010 to quit, citing family pressures and frustrations at the way the party system works. Critics: (left to right) Former minister Charles Hendry, South Thanet MP Laura Sandys and energy minister Greg Barker were among more than 25 MPs who confronted the Prime Minister . Environment campaigner and MP for Richmond Park Zac Goldsmith has been critical of the coalition's stance on green issues . At Friday’s meeting normally loyal MPs made clear to Mr Cameron their growing anxiety about the direction of his leadership and the risk it poses to hopes of winning an outright majority in 2015. It included energy minister Greg Barker, an early Cameroon, and strident green campaigner Zac Goldsmith. Also there were former minister Charles Hendry and Oliver Colville, who was elected in 2010. One MP said: ‘You could see that he was taken aback that this wasn't just half a dozen usual suspects but MPs representing many different wings of the party.’ Another person at the meeting said: ‘It got quite feisty, with some quite interesting interventions from people you don't normally see stepping out of line. ‘There were some MPs representing constituency interests saying that most of the jobs in their patch were green jobs and that his loose talk on the environment risked giving investors the jitters.’ Another MP said: ‘The real significance was that the “other side” those who are sceptical — have tended to act as a bloc and have been quite rebellious, while those of us who support the green agenda can and have been taken for granted. This was the first time we have flexed our muscles and that will have come as a shock.’ Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use next week’s Autumn Statement to announce cuts to the green levies imposed on energy bills, which would instead be funded from general taxation. He will promise to save customers more than the £120 over two years promised by Ed Miliband’s freeze in bills which has seen Labour take the lead in the cost of living debate.","Prime Minister confronted in Commons office by MPs and ministers .

Her husband Keith contacted police on the evening of October 25 after the mother-of-four failed to return to their home in Chatham, Kent. Sally Hann's family were told only last week that she boarded a plane at Gatwick on October 29 and flew to Cancun in Mexico (file picture of Cancun International Airport) She had told him she was going shopping in the local town centre but did not come home. Four days later the family were told by police that Sally had been found safe and well and that she would contact them in three weeks. But officers said they could not give them any more details - not even where she was. It was only some time later, last week on November 20, the family were finally told she had boarded a plane at Gatwick on October 29 and flown to Cancun in Mexico. Her daughter Kirsty Fraser said she is 'worried about her state of mind' because she suffers from depression. She said when the family asked police questions about her whereabouts, they were told officers could not tell them due to data protection laws. Ms Fraser said her mother had left her mobile phone at home and her disappearance was 'out of character'. She said she was 'going out of her mind' with worry and that 'nothing had happened at home' to give her mother a reason to leave. She said: 'I’m assuming she’s on her own; I’m just worried about her state of mind because she has depression and other things.' Mrs Hann used to work as a care assistant, but had been off work sick for two years. Ms Fraser appealed to her mother: 'No one’s angry with you, no one’s upset. We just want to hear from you.'

One of the judges, Lebanese singer Najwa Karam, told her: 'You don't speak a word of Arabic, yet you sing better than some Arab singers!', Morocco World News reported. 'We have for so long imitated the West, and this the first time that a person who has no whatsoever link to the Arab world, an American girl who does not speak Arabic, sings Arabic songs.' Jennifer - from Cambridge, Massachusetts - was raised singing in choirs and playing the violin. But in 2010 she found a video by the Lebanese singer Fairouz and got hooked on Arabic music, buying a traditional lute-like instrument called an oud. She asked for a one-way ticket to Morocco for her college graduation gift and she has been living there since last year. Come again?

She said she wanted to rap not 'about any old thing but something with value' Foreign singers have always learned English to conquer the pop market - but it rarely works the other way round. Swedish 1970s pop icons ABBA launched their career in English instead of their mother tongue to win over more foreign fans. Colombian diva Shakira (above) had a huge audience in Latin America but hit the big time when she released her fifth album Laundry Service in English in 2001. Spanish-American crooner Enrique Iglesias was born in Madrid but sang his hit single Hero in English, earning himself global fame. Puerto Rican singer Enrique Martín Morales had limited success in a boy band - until he adopted the stage name Ricky Martin for his hit Livin' La Vida Loca (the crazy life). Iceland's postmodern darling Bjork sings in English, earning her an eclectic audience all over the world. And radio stations in France have even tried to stop singers deserting their mother tongue - by dictating that at least 40 per cent of playlists must be in French. 'I've been working on it and practicing a lot and I listen to it all the time,' she told the show. 'I get a translation or I have one of my Arab friends do a translation for me. 'It was a little bit strange for my family in the beginning, but now they totally support what i do. They pushed me to come here to Lebanon to do the show.' She won over the audience on the talent show by singing Baeed Anak (Away From You) by Umm Kulthum, one of the most celebrated singers in Egypt's history. She also sings in the Berber dialects of traditional communities in Algeria, Morocco, Lybia, Mali, Niger and Tunisia. She told Good Morning America: 'About 30 seconds into it, I think everybody was very surprised. I felt really proud, because the audience went from not taking me seriously to like, wow she's good.' Jennifer is now up against top performers from across the Middle East and North Africa including one of the world's first hijab-wearing rappers and a Saudi stand-up comic. The rapper, Egyptian Mayam Mahmoud, 18, could pose stiff competition - as she has been praised for standing up for women's rights in the conservative Middle East. The show is in its third season and is a spin-off from Britain's Got Talent and America's Got Talent. Her success is so great, there are even rumours she is not actually from the West. Professor Virginia Danielson, Umm Kulthum's biographer, told The Guardian: 'Her resonance – that slightly nasal sound – is particularly compelling and very expressive in this style of singing. 'Her voice is strong, very pretty and she commands the style of the repertory very well. 'If I were going to criticise, I'd say the rhythmic structure of the piece escapes her a bit, but otherwise she sang very well, I thought.'

I joined up in 1935, four years before Fred. 'I served with him in Scampston near Malton in North Yorkshire.

On April 28, near the town of Otta, the battalion was attacked by about 200 Stuka dive bombers.Speaking in 2005 to a local newspaper, Frederick told how he remembered being by a shallow dugout on a hill-top when the planes attacked. A comrade jumped into the dugout, leaving Frederick outside, with only the thickness of his greatcoat to save him from the flying bomb splinters. Despite being heavily outnumbered and almost hopelessly out-gunned the Green Howards held their line against the Germans. Mr Leach was the last surviving Green Howard from the battle when he was invited to meet King Harald, of Norway, on the 60th anniversary of the country’s liberation. The Duke of Edinburgh was also in attendance at the formal event in Buckingham Palace that required the other guests to wear a lounge suit while Mr Leach was granted special dispensation to proudly wear his Green Howards blazer.","War hero Frederick Leach, who was commended for his part in liberation of Norway, died on November 6 without any close family .

They may have enchanted generations of young readers, but it seems some of our greatest children’s classics would be better off ranked in the library’s thriller section instead. A new list of the scariest kids’ books of all time has celebrated tales such as Mary Poppins and Black Beauty for their spine-tingling qualities rather than their ability to warm young hearts. According to writer and presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell, who compiled it for the Radio Times, the well-known stories appeal to children precisely because they hint at the world’s hidden darkness. Victoria Coren Mitchell has complied a list of the scariest children's books, naming Mary Poppins at the top. In the original the nanny uses her powers to bring joy, but also to inflict sinister punishments on the children . She said: ‘There is something I have never forgotten about children: that they sense darkness. However much you protect them (and I had a pretty protected childhood), they know the world is jagged and shadowy. ‘Seeing this reflected in stories, transformed into magical versions through which they glimpse an underlying truth, they are captivated.’ 1. Mary Poppins, by PL Travers.She said: ‘The Mary Poppins series of novels, by PL Travers, is filled with such sinister imagery. There is the character of Mrs Corry, for example, who mentally abuses her troubled daughters and eats her own fingers.’2. Grimm’s Fairy Tales, by the Brothers Grimm.She said: ‘These are shockingly dark for anyone familiar with the happy-ending Disney versions.’3. The Phoenix and the Carpet, by E NesbitShe said: ‘E Nesbit’s stories (also including The Railway Children and Five Children and It) always involve children separated from their parents, never quite understanding why.’4. Black Beauty, by Anna SewellShe said: ‘Probably the most heartbreakingly nostalgic novel ever written, for children or adults.’5. The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeShe said: ‘A religious allegory, the death of Jesus is told in a country of snow, lions, English children and poisoned Turkish delight.’ Mrs Coren Mitchell – who married comedian David Mitchell last year – topped her list with the original Mary Poppins series, the first of which was written by PL Travers in 1934. She contrasted the darker tone of the books with the 1964 film adaptation, starring Julie Andrews. She said: ‘Julie Andrews’ Mary Poppins is a beautiful, smiling, singing-and-dancing miracle of a person; starchy, but essentially sweet-natured. The Mary Poppins of the books is a far darker character. ‘She is prim, vain, chilly and full of unpredictable anger. She snaps and threatens; she uses her magic to create wondrous scenes, but also to mete out bleak and sinister punishments.’ The 41-year-old singled out one Mary Poppins tale – in which one of the children is transported into the picture on a china bowl and told she can never escape – for particular praise. She said: ‘In the 25 years since I first read that story, I have never read or seen another that has chilled me as much…Walt Disney clearly felt that this darkness, sadness and horror would not play well to a cinema audience. 'For the screen version it is wiped clean, replaced with flying kites and cartoon penguins.’ Suggesting children are secretly fascinated with death, Mrs Coren Mitchell added: ‘Her dark punishments are about danger and injustice: things that children sense deeply, even before they understand them.’ Perhaps a more obvious candidate for her list, her second choice was Grimm’s Fairy Tales, first published by the German Grimm brothers in 1812 . CS Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (left) also made the list, as did Grimm's Fairy Tales by the Brothers Grimm (right) which Mitchell says are 'shockingly dark for anyone familiar with the Disney versions' She said the classic stories – which include versions of the Pied Piper and Cindarella – were depict ‘the sadness and inevitability of growing up’, adding: ‘Filled with lonely children and wicked stepmothers (thought by psychoanalytic critics to represent little girls’ fears of alienation from their mothers), these are shockingly dark for anyone familiar with the happy-ending Disney versions’. The final three books on the list were 1904 classic The Phoenix and The Carpet, by E Nesbit, Black Beauty, by Anna Sewell, and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, by CS Lewis. Black Beauty – which recounts the tale of a horse that is cruelly mistreated by a series of owner – is one of the best-selling books of all time, with over 50 million copies sold. Mrs Coren Mitchell said: ‘This is probably the most heartbreakingly nostalgic novel ever written, for children or adults.' On Saturday, the presenter will host a BBC2 documentary looking at PL Travers’ life, called The Secret Life of Mary Poppins. Although none of the children’s books in her list were published before 1950, she singled out the bestselling Harry Potter series, by JK Rowling, as a modern-day scary classic. She said: ‘It was…about a small, unhappy, lonely boy who suffered from the cruelty of fate (and adults). Alongside a fantastical world of midnight flights and talking creatures, the books told of loss, fear, threat and death.’","Victoria Coren Mitchell names her five scariest children's books .

The images of the officer started appearing in November 2011 before the scheme was later extended. In total, 52 of the cut-outs have been made at a cost of more than £13,000. Cut out crime: Police have spent more than £13,000 buying 52 pictures of police officers in a bid to reduce shoplifting . A Gwent Police spokesman said: 'They have been distributed throughout our force area and teams use them tactically to deter shoplifting. 'We are not prepared to say where they are at this moment as they are often moved about to tackle a particular problem.' The cut-outs have cost £255 each. One store manager, Lee Hillier, who has one of the cardboard cut-outs in his store for the past three months, said he felt it had reduced crime. He said: 'It’s right by the front of the door and people look up at it as they walk into the store.'

Two million Britons regularly lie about their weekends to make them sound more interesting, a survey has found. Most of us waste our weekends, only making the most of 20 of them a year, according to a survey released today. And around 2.5 million lie about their weekend plans to sound more interesting, rather than tackling the problem head on. Catching up on sleep: 2.5million Britains waste their weekends, then lie about what they did to make it sound more interesting . Two thirds of us say our weekends are a let-down and almost one in three regret that we have not done anything interesting come Sunday night. And respondents claimed, on average, to spend a whole day - nearly nine hours - of every weekend in front of a TV or computer screen and admit to a £600 yearly spend on weekend alcohol. This is in contrast to our European cousins, who can be found going to restaurants, parties, shopping, or soaking up museum culture at the weekend. One in five of us regret not having made the most of the weekend, rising to almost one third of people who live in London, yet it’s not disposable income that’s the problem, but how we choose to spend our well-earned cash.

Mark Maddock, Managing Director of lastminute.com UK and Ireland, which carried out the survey, said: 'We all enjoy relaxing and doing nothing from time to time but it’s clear that too much down time leaves people looking back on their weekends with regret.

Taxpayer-funded electric-car subsidies worth £5,000 per vehicle are still failing to spark real interest from drivers in ‘green’ motoring, a new report says today. Only 1 per cent of UK drivers currently own an alternative fuel vehicle (AFV), it says. And ‘green’ concerns such as low CO2 emissions are at the bottom of the checklist when Britons are shopping for a new car, says the poll of more than 3,000 motorists by Auto Trader. Unpopular alternative: Only 1 per cent of UK drivers has an alternative fuel vehicle such as the electric Nissan LEAF . Subsidy: More than a third of drivers were unaware of the £5,000 Government subsidy for new electric cars . Since January 2011, motorists have been eligible for a £5,000 Government-backed subsidy on the full purchase price of a new electric vehicle, such as a Nissan LEAF, a BMW i3 or a Vauxhall Ampera. But the Auto Trader survey showed that 35 per cent of drivers were unaware of this grant. While 32 per cent of 17 to 24-year-olds said they were likely to buy an AFV, only 18 per cent of those aged 65 or over were likely to. The survey also showed that while 62 per cent of women said they cared deeply about the impact their cars had on the environment, only 39 per cent of men did. The poll also found that 79 per cent of motorists believe the Government should be doing more to make ‘green’ cars more affordable . None near me: 80 per cent of drivers surveyed said there was not a charging point near them, such as the one being used by this BMW i3 . Some 89 per cent would like their vehicle to be more environmentally friendly - but only if it did not cost any extra. When it comes to powering electric cars, 80 per cent say they have not seen a charging point within five miles of their home and 73 per cent want more charging points. And 73 per cent said national TV campaigns would help spread the word about alternative-power  vehicles, while 52 per cent said they should be a compulsory section in the driving theory test. Auto Trader group marketing director Jonathan Williams said: 'The good news for car manufacturers is British motorists are taking an interest in electric vehicles - when made aware of the benefits and cost savings. However, we're still a long way from convincing motorists to make the switch. 'Put simply, going green is not currently an attractive package. UK motorists are being asked to make huge compromises on aesthetics and the investment of their time finding and charging their vehicle. 'It's no wonder why, on top of all of these factors, a higher upfront purchase price is too much of an ask. ’Despite a £400million investment and a further £500million on its way in 2015 from the Government, motorists are still lacking information on costs, efficiency and effectiveness of owning electric vehicles - and, simply, choice. 'Clearly not enough is being done to incentivise both manufacturers and consumers.’","Auto Trader polled more than 3,000 British drivers .

AQA Chief Executive Andrew Hall, above, said time saved doing less GCSEs could be used to do extra curricular activities . Teenagers pressured into taking up to 15 GSCEs are being given an education of quantity rather than quality, according to the head of the country’s biggest exam board. Pupils who are led to believe that taking more subjects is a ‘good thing to do’ are being misled, said Andrew Hall, chief executive of the AQA board. Instead of having more subjects on offer for testing, schools should provide more time for extra-curricular activities, community volunteering and work experience, said Mr Hall. And pupils should sit a maximum of eight GCSEs, suggested Mr Hall, so that a greater focus can be given to developing life skills and preparing teenagers for work. His comments were made as AQA launched a project predicting how the country’s education system will evolve over the next 12 years. Mr Hall said that if the number of subjects students are examined in is reduced, education standards will improve. He said there is ‘nothing wrong with a rigorous, solid education system, but not exams for exams sake. ‘Some students without doubt think – or are encouraged to think – that 14 or 15 GCSEs is a good thing to do. ‘My personal opinion is that it’s not. Look at the current Government’s accountability measure – the best eight, with double weighting for maths and English. ‘To me, that doesn’t sound like a bad volume. What the eight is I don’t want to get into, but that leaves space in the curriculum for the other things. Educationally it will be better. Mr Hall said that if the number of subjects students are examined in is reduced, education standards will improve . Mr Hall criticised the obsession with achieving high results, and said that little time is given to developing other important skills at school. ‘What’s missed when you are doing these extra GCSEs? I think working in the community is an important part of developing social life.’ ‘It’s a middle-class way of describing it, but I think things like leading a Brownie pack is an important life skill for young people.’ A spokesperson for Michael Gove's Department for Education said it should be left to individual schools to decide how many exams their students will take . His speech somes as the Department of Education is redesigning league table to track pupil’s progress in their best eight subjects rather than the number of students getting C grades in five GCSEs. Mr Hall said the average pupil currently sat around 10 exams but some took up to 15. He said a more innovative approach to teaching using digital technology will stop schools from becoming ‘exam factories’. He acknowledged that some teachers had lost faith in the examining process because of poor marking saying: ‘On occasions every exam board gets things wrong.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It is down to schools to decide how many GCSE subjects their pupils should study – but it is vital that however many pupils take, it is in their best interests.’ ‘Our new 'best eight' accountability measure will ensure that secondary schools will focus on the progress and performance of pupils in a broad range of eight key GCSE subjects, including core academic subjects.’","Andrew Hall, head of AQA said taking more subjects may not be better .

Grand plans: Mr Bercow will call upon Silicon Valley giants to help form a 'blueprint' for the introduction of online voting . Technology giants Facebook, Google and Twitter are to help plan a digital revolution in the British democratic system, which could see people casting their votes online. The radical plan is the brainchild of the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow MP, who has revealed his ambition to pioneer one of the biggest shake-ups in the history of our electoral process. In a speech to the Hansard society yesterday, Mr Bercow said he will ask leading figures from Silicon Valley technology giants such as Google and Facebook to draw up a blueprint for the implementation of digital ballots in the UK. He will chair the first ever Speaker’s commission on 'digital democracy', which has set itself the task of modernising the voting system in a bid to boost turn-out figures and make the democratic process more inclusive. In his speech, Mr Bercow said: 'What we are talking about here is nothing less than a Parliament version 2.0.' Revealing plans to heighten levels of scrutiny and accountability using technology, Mr Bercow also said a new system should include 'e-dialogue' between MPs and their constituents. He even hinted that a digital revolution could loosen current election timetables, seeing ballots  become more frequent. According to the Speaker's office, the commission will 'embrace the opportunities afforded by . the digital world to become more effective in representing the people, . making laws and scrutinising the work and performance of government. 'It . should also consider how Parliament can become more relevant to the . increasingly diverse population it seeks to serve'. Work will start at the beginning of next year with the aim of outlining an action plan for the implementation of the proposals by 2015. That deadline falls in line with the 750th anniversary of the founding of Parliament. Inclusive: According to Mr Bercow, one of the benefits of e-voting is that it will make casting a vote more convenient for those who may not be able to easily access a ballot box . The Speaker plans to use the example of Estonia to champion his cause. The Baltic state was the first in the world to introduce internet voting. It proved a popular alternative for citizens in their 2011 ballot, with around a quarter choosing to cast their votes online. Estonians are now able to vote digitally using just their national identity card. They can also register a vote via mobile phone with a Pin code. The Speaker said he plans to consult global internet powers such as Facebook so that the ideas are not just those of people inside Westminster . Initial reaction to the idea of internet voting in Britain has been luke-warm from sources inside the three major parties. One told the Independent: It may happen one day, but not yet. There would be big questions about security. Our system is one of the least corrupt, but there have been a few problems with postal voting and that highlights the potential danger of moving to online.' But Mr Bercow said the idea of introducing the online community  into the very heart of British Democracy should be  'unpredictable, potentially anarchic' and 'quite fun.'","John Bercow MP wants parliament to consider 'e-voting' by 2015 .

Students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a tangible display platform that allows users to touch things through their computer screens. Daniel Leithinger and Sean Follmer, PhD candidates at the MIT Media Lab in Boston, are the creators behind inFORM, a machine that uses a camera feed to turn things into 3D objects in real time. It works just like a pin-screen toy - as in the kind you find in museum novelty shops - except that under each pin is a motor that reacts to a ‘kinect’ depth-sensing camera made by Microsoft, which is usually used in games, according to CNN. The camera is able to capture depth data and transmits it to the table, which then forms a physical object. What we can expect in the future? A demonstrator shows how, by using camera footage of his hands, he is able to pick up a ball using the inFORM grid . Remember these? The inFORM grid uses the same principles as an old-school pin board toy, however instead of a physical touch, it just needs a camera feed, which the machine then mimics. Pictured is one of the inFORM creators, Daniel Leithinger . The MIT students who created the screen say it is only very early days in the technology, with the grid pins only able to move up and down to form an object . Essentially inFORM is just mimicking what the camera sees, thanks to a grid of 900 columns arranged in a 30 by 30 grid, which adjusts in height based on the image it receives. Follmer said the idea was borne out of frustrations with modern touch-screen technology. 'If you think about things like Skype or video conferencing tools, it misses out on some of the ways we naturally interact,' he told ABC News. 'Things like hand gestures can be lost when you're collaborating at a distance.' The pair hope the idea will one day apply to smart phones, rendering buttons and menus when they are needed. 'We see a need for displays to become more physical again,' said Leithinger. The next step: It is hoped the technology will one day apply to phones, with the device being able to become another object and create buttons for users . Developers use a ball to show how physical the inFORM machine becomes when forming an object . 'This could make future smartphones and tablets much more intuitive and satisfying to use.' The team has already attracted the attention of several businesses, 'musicians who want to create new musical instruments, or people who want to make an interface for blind users', according to the South China Morning Post. 'It’s inspiring people and we’re glad so many ideas are coming in,' Leithinger said. However there is a long way to go until inFORM is a consumer product, with its creators acknowledges these are very early days. 'In the future, more and more devices will be able to change their shape,' Follmer said. 'I envision a future where a device changes shape to better interact with its owner.'","Two students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a display grid that is able to mimic the vision of a camera feed and form 3D objects .
The machine, called inFORM, uses principles similar to that of an old school pin-screen toy, only without the need for physical contact .

Mafia boss Dominco Rancadore, who spent 20 years evading Italian authorities, has been told he will not be released on bail . A fugitive Mafia boss who spent 20 years on the run from Italian police has been told he will not be released on bail despite having a heart condition. Domenico Rancadore, also known as 'The Professor' was arrested in London after evading Italian authorities for two decades. The High Court today overturned a decision to grant the 64-year-old bail, with Lord Justice Goldring saying there was a risk he might abscond. Rancadore had been granted bail at a hearing on Monday, but was ordered to remain in custody following an immediate appeal by prosecutors. The appeal hearing was delayed yesterday after judges heard that Rancadore had been taken to hospital with heart problems. Today Lord Justice Goldring, sitting at London’s High Court with Mr Justice Ouseley, said it was clear that Rancadore had a heart problem and it was something which should be kept in mind. However, the judge said there was 'a real risk - indeed a very real risk - that he would abscond if granted bail'. Lord Justice Goldring added: 'In my view this appeal should be allowed and Mr Rancadore remanded in custody.' Rancadore is wanted in Italy to serve a seven-year jail term for his role as 'a man of honour' in the Sicilian Mafia, also known as Cosa Nostra, collecting bribes from builders in Trabia, near Palermo. He was found guilty of being part of the gang between December 1987 and April 1995, and in 1999 was convicted of Mafia . association and exortion in his absence. Rancadore, shown in a court sketch, is wanted in Italy to serve a seven-year jail term . Italian prosecutors claim that he . received around £3,500 in bribe money, and 'ensured strict compliance . with the rules of the organisation', Westminster Magistrates' Court has previously heard. He came to . live in the UK with his family in 1994, and has never returned to Italy. Chief magistrate Howard Riddle granted him bail at the Westminster court on Monday, but he was not released after prosecutor Hannah Hinton said there would be an appeal. Rancadore was arrested on August 8 at his upmarket semi-detached home in Uxbridge, west London, where he lived under the false name Marc Skinner with his wife Anne, 64, and children Daniela, now 33, and Giuseppe, 36. The family moved to London after two acquittals for Mafia activity in 1987, saying he wanted to 'get away' from their surname, which is infamous in Italy as Rancadore's father was a feared Cosa Nostra boss. Rancadore was arrested at his home in Uxbridge, where he lived under the name Marc Skinner with wife Anne, pictured with their daughter Daniela . The court had heard that Rancadore told officers upon his arrest that he was not going back to Italy because 'they will kill me'. The conditions of bail set out by the chief magistrate included £50,000 security, residency at his home, a curfew, reporting to a police station twice daily, providing his phone number, keeping his mobile switched on and not applying for foreign travel documents. The court has previously heard that Rancadore was a leader in a murderous gang that 'spread terror in Sicily'. Rancadore was acquitted of previous Mafia charges in 1993 after spending months in custody and more than two years under house arrest. Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere). Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections. The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy.

Helpless: The collision between the two cars sends the taxi careering into the 64-year-old's path . Recovering in her hospital bed after Tuesday's crash, the pensioner said: 'All I remember is that I was being very careful about crossing the street. 'I stopped at the zebra crossing and the lights changed for me to go across. I just can't figure out how this happened to me, but I am amazed that I am still alive.' The doctor who attended the elderly victim said the car hit the left side of her body. 'The impact was mainly distributed between the arms and legs and luckily did not damage her spine and head,' Dr Denilson Dalleffe explained. 'Nothing in my medical training can explain how she survived. The trauma to her body was huge. It is a miracle and she will make a full recovery in six months,' he added.

Drunken Cambridge University students in fancy dress ‘inundated’ an accident and emergency department making it difficult to treat other patients, a hospital has complained. Doctors at Addenbrooke’s Hospital have written to the university to protest about the ‘disruptive’ behaviour of members of a college sports team. They say the students, who were admitted in varying states of consciousness and with injuries from fights, wandered around the hospital and were rude to staff. The trouble started at 6pm on Tuesday when students who were already extremely drunk started to arrive at the Cambridge hospital. It is believed the hospital continued to treat students until 4am. Complaint: Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital have complained to Cambridge University after its students 'inundated' the A&E unit, making it difficult for doctors to treat other patients . In a letter of complaint to the students’ college, the hospital wrote that ‘a selection of drunken students in fancy dress’ were admitted on ‘an already busy night’ It said that other patients were affected and complained as the ‘students and their friends were disruptive, rude and frequently had to be told to stop wandering between the different areas of the department as they shuttled between their friends in different cubicles.’ ‘From what [hospital staff] could gather there had been either a rugby or rowing drinks event,’ it added. The letter described some students as semi-comatose through alcohol and others with injuries consistent with fights. Last night Cambridge University said that it was launching an investigation into the incident. A spokesman said: ‘The University deplores this reported unacceptable behaviour. An investigation is under way.’ Dr Adrian Boyle, consultant at Addenbrooke’s A&E, said: ‘We can confirm that we have written to a Cambridge college to raise concerns about a small number of students who were behaving irresponsibly and causing operational difficulty in the Emergency Department. Probe: A spokesman for Cambridge University, pictured, said an investigation is being launched into the incident . ‘This is a relatively unusual occurrence but it did cause problems for staff on the night in question.’ Students at Cambridge University have developed a reputation for their rowdy behaviour and heavy drinking, as well as their academic prowess. In May, drunken students wrecked a curry house in the city when a mass brawl broke out between two rival groups. More than a dozen students - many of them bare-chested - bombarded each other with food, plates and cutlery. Some of the students used their shoes as missiles and a glass bottle hit a girl on the head. A male student was thrown from his chair and pushed down the stairs and a table was broken in half. There are several annual student rituals at the university that involve binge-drinking. Caesarean Sunday is seen as the start of the drinking parties for the summer term. It historically takes place at a park in Cambridge’s city centre, on the first bank holiday of the summer term. Local residents have previously complained about students stripping off, vomiting and urinating in public.","Students started arriving at the Cambridge hospital at 6pm on Tuesday .

"By . Richard Shears and Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 11:17 EST, 28 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:25 EST, 28 November 2013 . The girlfriend of the Australian businessman who murdered his fiancée by throwing her from a 15th-floor balcony has revealed that she's writing a script about the case. Rachelle Louise, 24, who stood by killer Simon Gittany, 40, throughout his trial in Sydney, said she has given up a career in banking to become an actress and screenwriter. The story of the death of Canadian former ballerina Lisa Harnum at the hands of Gittany is to be her first project. Although, with Miss Louise maintaining the innocence of her boyfriend, it is likely to be a revisionist account. Rachelle Louise is surrounded by reporters as she smokes a cigarette outside court following her boyfriend Simon Gittany's conviction for the murder of his fiancée Lisa Harnum by throwing her from a balcony in 2011 . Cashing in? She later told Australia's Daily Telegraph that she plans to write a film script about the case . Miss Louise is comforted by supporters outside the court: As Justice Lucy McCallum read out her verdict she had shrieked 'You're wrong' and had to be led from the courtroom in tears . Gittany was just yesterday found guilty of murdering Miss Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row during which a security camera had shown him dragging her back into the apartment they shared with his hand across her mouth. Just over a minute later, she had . plunged to her death - and Justice Lucy McCallum, in a damning . assessment of Gittany’s character, said she did not believe his story of how his fiancée had fallen from the balcony. Miss . Louise, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Miss Harnum, was . one of 17 supporters who had accompanied Gittany to her the verdict read . out. 'You're wrong,' the . slim brunette shrieked as Judge McCallum said she was satisfied 'beyond a . reasonable doubt' that Gittany had hurled his girlfriend to her death. Verdict: Gittany pictured arriving at court with Miss Louise for an earlier hearing. She played the role of devoted partner throughout the businessman's trial . Led . from the court in tears, she refused to answer questions as she was . engulfed by reporters outside the building, merely asking in response: . 'Has anyone got a light? You're journalists, someone's got to have a . lighter.' But following . yesterday's verdict, Miss Louise told Australia's Daily Telegraph that . she now hopes to cash in on her notoriety following the case. 'I'm . actually writing a movie script about the whole case. I thought it made . sense, because obviously it's something I'm very passionate about,' she . told the paper. But . according to the account of Gittany given by Judge McCallum as she read . out her verdict yesterday, Miss Louise has had a lucky escape. She stated that Gittany was 'controlling, dominating and, at times, abusive' of Ms Harnum. She found he lied 'with telling ease' and distorted the truth when he took the stand. 'At . many times in his evidence the accused struck me as being a person . playing a role, telling a story which fit with the objective evidence . but which did no more than that,' Justice McCallum  reported News.co.au. 'His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail. 'It lacked originality and the subtlety of actual experience.' The . Crown had told the court that Gittany was domineering and had tried to . control everything his fiancee did, even the way she wore her hair and . what clothes she chose to go out in. Gittany had admitted during the trial that he was a ‘jealous partner.’ ‘She . would wear revealing clothes, sometimes with no bra. I would tell her . she should continue to look beautiful but just to tone down how much she . was revealing of her body so she didn’t attract the wrong attention and . give out the wrong signals,’ he told the court. Guilty: Gittany had denied murdering Canadian former ballerina and aspiring model Lisa Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row at their 15th-floor home in Sydney, claiming instead that she could have jumped to her death . His . defence team had claimed that Miss Harnum’s struggle with an eating . disorder may have been the reason she jumped to her death. The . judge began her summing up by examining the relationship between . Gittany and his fiancee, saying she had sought to avoid being influenced . by the ‘shocking and tragic’ nature of Miss Harnum’s death. There was . no doubt, she said, that the couple loved each other. But the judge said that ‘by the time of her death, Lisa Harnum had no friends except a personal trainer and a counsellor. Gittany, . she said, had used CCTV cameras to monitor Miss Harnum’s movements in . their 15th storey apartment and the scrutiny she was subjected to was . ‘intrusive and overbearing.’ Judge . McCallum said the relationship reached the point when Miss Harnum . changed her Facebook status to ‘single’ and had signed a contract to . store her belongings in Bondi as she prepared to leave her controlling . fiancé. Struggle: The prosecutor asked Gittany if he had used his 'superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression' when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit before her death (above) On the day that . Gittany found Miss Harnum had packed her bags, said the judge, he . reacted ‘with nothing short of rage’ and she did not accept his denial . that he had made enraged threats. ‘I have no hesitation accepting . evidence of…rage,’ said the judge. His denials were ‘manifestly implausible…he was controlling and abusive…out of control,’ she added. Gittany . sat in the dock clutching a small cup of water as the verdict was being . delivered, his new girlfriend, brunette Rachelle Louise sitting in the . public gallery. By the end . of July Gittany’s relationship with Miss Harnum had reached crisis . point, the judge noted. ‘I do not think there can be any doubt the . accused was controlling, dominating and at time abusive.’ The . night before her death, the couple had watched Romeo and Juliet in bed . before he got up to watch porn on the morning of his girlfriend’s death. ‘I . find it difficult to believe he was watching porn on the morning of the . death,’ said the judge, adding she assumed he had instead got up to . monitor her emails and text messages. 'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge. She . referred to a witness, Josh Rathmell who had told the court of seeing . Gittany throwing something from the balcony, evidence, she said, that . was ‘compelling’. Evidence: CCTV footage shows Simon Gittany holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he  threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th-floor balcony of their Sydney apartment . Gesticulating: Gittany throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street . The judge . did not believe Gittany’s account of how Miss Harnum fell to her death - . he had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto . the balcony but had failed to stop her falling. ‘It’s difficult to . articulate my impression of that evidence except that I found him . unconvincing,’ said the judge. 'At . many times in his evidence, the accused struck me as being a person . playing a role, telling a story which fitted with the objective evidence . but which did no more than that. ‘His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail.’ As . Justice McCallum’s verdict details entered their fourth hour, Miss . Louise began to sob, while her boyfriend stared straight ahead at the . judge. The judge had up to that point said little that gave him any hope of walking away from the court a free man. She . said Miss Harnum could not have behaved in the way Gittany said she had . - clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints. She said it was likely that Miss Harnum was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death. 'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge . Speaking outside court, an emotional Joan Harnum told reporters 'there are no winners in this case'. 'Two families have had their lives dramatically changed forever,' she said reported Nine News MSN. 'We . will always mourn the loss of our beautiful Lisa Cecilia and are . working towards making her legacy a powerful wake-up call to young . women. 'My daughter used to say people can ask for help but children and animals cannot. 'And now young women who are caught up in situations like my daughter found herself in need a voice as well.'

Harassment: Walter Kershaw, 72, has admitted to stalking his ex for five years after she dumped him . A street artist dubbed ‘Britain’s original Banksy’ stalked his former partner for five years after she broke up with him. Walter Kershaw, 72, admitted to harassing Catherine Mitchell with gifts and phone calls, leaving her fearing for her safety. Celebrated painter Kershaw, of Littleborough, Rochdale, also admitted to stalking Ms Mitchell's mother after he became infatuated with her daughter. Bury magistrates’ court heard how Kershaw would wait for Ms Mitchell and her mother Marjorie while they attended their local church and trail them around the supermarket. He would also regularly turn up outside Mrs Mitchell’s house to get in touch with her daughter. The court heard that Kershaw would blow the women kisses in the street and follow Ms Mitchell while muttering ‘you look beautiful today’ under his breath. Kershaw and Ms Mitchell began a relationship several years ago, after she requested the artist paint her portrait, the court was told. The relationship ended after 12 months when Ms Mitchell was involved in a serious accident, which left her with brain and leg injuries. Robin Lynch, prosecuting, told the court that Ms Mitchell found Kershaw to be unpredictable and controlling during their relationship. She also said he had been violent on a number of occasions, including one altercation where he slapped her. In a statement read out in court, Ms Mitchell said: ‘I honestly believe he is capable of anything. ‘I worry for my own safety. From what he’s said to me I know he has no respect for authority. I want him to stop so I can live my life in peace.’ Kershaw admitted to being smitten with . Ms Mitchell but said he felt members of her family had been influencing . her decisions since the accident. Celebrated: Walter Kershaw has been dubbed 'the original Banksy' for his street art and distinctive murals, such as 'The Inside Out House', painted in Rochdale in 1976 . The court heard that he had promised faithfully to stop the harassment and said it would never happen again. The . painter, who is a father to 11-year-old twins, reached international . fame as a pioneer of street art and is still in work today painting . large-scale, outdoor murals. Paul Kidd, defending, said Kershaw had received verbal warnings from the police twice in 2009, and twice in 2010. He suggested that if the police had gone further at this point, the harassment may have been stopped earlier. In . a statement read out in court, Mrs Mitchell said that she and her . daughter had been forced to cross the road and even plod across muddy . fields to avoid Kershaw.

We want assurances that the years ahead are free from this predatory man so we can live our lives with freedom.’ District Judge Mark Hadfield said he was concerned the harassment had continued over such a long time. He added: ‘It is worrying that despite numerous warnings from the police he doesn’t heed them. I would hope that at 72 he would understand that this relationship was over.’ The case has been adjourned for sentencing until December 16.","Walter Kershaw harrassed Catherine and Marjorie Mitchell for five years .
