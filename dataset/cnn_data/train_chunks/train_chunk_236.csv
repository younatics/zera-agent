"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama pressed ahead Saturday with a pledge to sanction Syria and support its rebels by speaking with European leaders by conference call about Damascus' chemical warfare. Obama's talk with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany came before next week's Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland. The five leaders discussed ""ways to support a political transition to end the conflict"" in Syria, the White House said. British Prime Minister David Cameron told CNN that during the video conference, Obama said further intervention into Syria ""should be done on our own timeline."" ""We have already taken some decisions in that Britain is helping to give technical assistance, training, advice, help, shaping, to the Syrian opposition, and we do that along with the Americans, French and others and will continue to do that, and we will take time to make these decisions with our allies,"" Cameron said. One G8 member, Russia, was not part of the call Saturday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said any attempt to enforce a no-fly zone over Syria using F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missiles from Jordan would violate international law, according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today. Russian television reported that Lavrov's comment followed speculation in the media that a no-fly zone could be imposed through the deployment of the missile systems and fighter jets sent by the United States to global military drills in Jordan. Also Saturday, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy announced that he has cut diplomatic ties with Damascus, the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported. ""We have decided to close down the Syrian embassy in Cairo,"" Morsy told a conference in support of the Syrian opposition at a Cairo stadium. ""The Egyptian envoy in Damascus will also be withdrawn."" Morsy told CNN in January that he supported calls by people in Syria for President Bashar al-Assad to be tried for war crimes. Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki dismissed media accounts Friday about Obama having decided on establishing a no-fly zone. Those reports are incorrect, she said. U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes also addressed the matter Friday when he was asked how difficult it would be to establish a no-fly zone. ""In Syria, when you have the situation where regime forces are intermingled with opposition forces, they're fighting in some instances block by block in cities. That's not a problem you can solve from the air,"" he said. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called again for an on-the-ground investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria and asked Damascus to grant a U.N. team long-sought access. ""The validity of any information on the alleged use of chemical weapons cannot be ensured without convincing evidence of the chain of custody,"" he told reporters in New York. The Russian foreign minister also expressed doubts Saturday that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons against the opposition. Lavrov said that U.S. military aid to the Syrian rebels may lead to an escalation of violence in the country, according to Russian news agency Ria Novosti. The Obama administration has not detailed what military support it plans to give the rebels, but Washington officials have told CNN that support includes arms, ammunition and, possibly, anti-tank weapons. What concerns many about supplying arms to the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al Qaeda sympathies, the same stripe of militants America has battled in Iraq and Afghanistan. They include the al-Nusra Front, a rebel group with ties to al Qaeda. Friction within al Qaeda? There were signs Saturday of a schism in al Qaeda's top leadership over control of al-Nusra. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of al Qaeda in Iraq, may have defied an order from the terror organization's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, to stop trying to claim control of al-Nusra. That's according to an audio recording purportedly from al-Baghdadi that was posted on jihadist websites and by the SITE Intelligence Group on Saturday. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the recording. In the recording, al-Baghdadi said al Qaeda in Iraq and the al-Nusra Front will operate as one, under the title ""The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant."" The Levant is a term that dates back to the 1500s. It was once used to describe the region that today consists of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and parts of Iraq. The recording follows a statement released this month by al-Zawahiri that said al Qaeda in Iraq and al-Nusra will operate as separate entities with separate leadership. It's unclear what al-Baghdadi's statement means for al-Nusra's operation in Syria. Meanwhile, rebel and government forces once again clashed at hotspots around Syria on Saturday, with the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reporting 79 dead. Twenty-four of those deaths were in and around Damascus, 17 were in Aleppo province and 12 were in Homs. The rebel army has suffered a number of setbacks in recent weeks that in large part have coincided with the arrival of thousands of Hezbollah Shiite fighters, backed by Lebanon and Iran, to reinforce al-Assad's forces. After months of gaining ground, the rebels this month lost Qusayr -- one of its strongholds near the Lebanese border -- that was considered essential for its supply route. Syrian forces and Hezbollah fighters have now turned their focus on retaking Aleppo. Black flag over mosque draws scrutiny . On Friday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah criticized Arab networks Al-Arabiya and Al Jazeera for their portrayal of Hezbollah's involvement in the takeover of the strategically important border city of Qusayr, Syria. When Qusayr fell, a video surfaced online showing Hezbollah fighters raising their black banner over a mosque in Qusayr. A sectarian dispute has arisen over whether the mosque was Sunni or Shiite. Hezbollah is the powerful Lebanese Shiite militia backed by Iran and the Syrian government. In a Friday speech, Nasrallah defended fellow fighters. ""Yes, there were some young men in Qusayr who, yes, I have to admit -- and there is a room to discuss whether this was right or wrong -- the young men may have gotten too excited and overwhelmed by the events when they climbed to the top of a mosque and raised a black flag that had the writing of O Hussein on it,"" Nasrallah said. ""The video was then posted online and Arab TV networks like Al-Arabiya, and Al Jazeera grabbed the video and distorted the facts by saying that Hezbollah fighters raised the flag on a Sunni mosque under the pretext that they want their audience to know more. Know what? They are feeding their audience lies, distortions, fabrications,"" Nasrallah said. Shortly after Nasrallah's speech, Lebanon's National News Agency reported that ""five rockets fired from the Syrian side of the borders landed in Baalbek city in the Kayyal area that were later followed by four other rockets injuring two Lebanese citizens."" The Kayyal area is predominantly Shiite. Earlier, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian rebels in Aleppo fired five rockets at Fawaa village in Idlib, which is mostly inhabited by Shiites, and the rebels said in a statement that the shelling on the Shiite village was a response to Nasrallah's speech. The human rights group couldn't say whether the rockets landed in the town or whether there were any casualties.

"(CNN) -- The director of the Peace Corps, Aaron S. Williams, announced Tuesday that he is stepping aside after three years on the job. ""This has been a difficult choice because serving in this position has been the highlight of my public service career,"" he said in his message to colleagues. ""It has brought my personal journey in government full circle - from Peace Corps Volunteer to Director. It is time, however, for me to shift my focus to my family."" Williams, who leaves effective September 17, served as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic from 1967 till 1970. He was sworn in to the organization's top job in August 2009 and immediately found himself dealing with security issues related to the volunteers. Four months earlier, 24-year-old volunteer Kate Puzey had been killed in Benin. And last year, an ABC News investigation reported that more than 1,000 young Peace Corps volunteers had been sexually assaulted during the prior decade.

Also last year, a Connecticut man pleaded guilty to traveling to South Africa to engage in illicit sexual conduct with children while he was a Peace Corps volunteer there. At the time, Williams said, ""The Peace Corps has no tolerance for abuse of any kind, and our deepest sympathies are with all the victims involved."" He vowed that the Corps would ensure that the victims were properly cared for and treated. In congressional testimony in March 2011, he said, ""While the Peace Corps cannot eliminate every risk volunteers face during their service, I am committed to making sure that we do everything we can to protect volunteers and provide effective support to them and their families when a tragedy occurs."" Williams has worked with Congress to codify reforms and increase support to volunteers in the field, including hiring a victim advocate; enhancing safety and security, as well as support and response for volunteers; and improving training for volunteers and staff, the organization said. In a statement on Tuesday, President Barack Obama credited Williams with having helped ""in reforming and modernizing the agency."" Deputy Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet will serve as acting director upon his departure. In all, more than 9,000 volunteers serve in 75 host countries, according to the Peace Corps. Since its establishment in 1961, more than 200,000 Americans have served.

"(CNN) -- The surprise on 3-year-old Grayson Clamp's face in the video is priceless. His mouth opens wide as he points to the person in front of him speaking. It was the first time Grayson had heard sound. He was born without a cochlear nerve, which connects the brain stem to audio waves in the outside world. His parents had him fitted for a cochlear implant at a young age, but the device didn't help. Last month, Grayson became the first child in the United States to receive an auditory brain stem implant. See also: Miracle children survive against the odds . Len and Nicole Clamp were Grayson's foster parents when he was a newborn. They adopted him as soon as they could, believing God had called them to care for the medically challenged boy. Auditory brain stem implants already have been available for adults. When the Clamps heard about a Food and Drug Administration-approved trial for children at the UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, they jumped at the chance to participate. Grayson now has an external speech processor containing a microphone. The processor breaks up sounds into their frequency components and sends that information across Grayson's skin to an implanted device, said his surgeon, Dr. Craig Buchman. The device then stimulates electrodes on his brain's cochlear nucleus. The electrodes are placed where his cochlear nerve would be, if he had one. ""He's sound aware, but we don't know what exactly he hears,"" Buchman said. ""We're relying on the plasticity of brain to start to sort this out."" The implant is powered by a battery that's outside Grayson's body. The procedure has been done mostly in Europe up to this point. The FDA approved the implant in the United States for only 10 children -- five who, like Grayson, were born without nerves and five who suffered traumatic damage. These cases will be used to determine whether a bigger trial that includes more children is safe and whether the device may one day be available across the country. See also: Deaf sisters, adopted from Ethiopia, hear for the first time . The biggest risk occurs during surgery, Buchman said; the brain can be bruised when doctors place the device. Len Clamp said Grayson is discovering all kinds of new things about his world now. He's drawn to music, Clamp said, often running over to turn on the radio. Clamp said he hopes other children with hearing loss get the same opportunity as Grayson. ""It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen,"" he said. ""(There are) no words to describe how excited we were, how validated we were, for all of the challenges. ... He's got a long way to go, but he's going to get there.""","Grayson Clamp, 3, was born without a cochlear nerve .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate signaled its support on Monday for a bipartisan measure strengthening border security in the comprehensive ""Gang of Eight"" immigration reform bill, a sweeping blueprint that promises to overhaul America's immigration policies for the first time since 1986. The 67-to-27 vote was considered a key test of support for the bill as a whole, as the measure also includes language echoing most other parts of the legislation. The Senate kept the vote open for a significant amount of time for lawmakers who experienced travel delays due to bad weather in Washington. Some senators did not make it in time. Supporters needed at least 60 votes to move forward with the revised border security provisions, which were drafted partly to boost GOP support for the overall package. Backers of the bill were hoping to win about 70 votes to demonstrate growing bipartisan momentum for the larger proposal as it nears final passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate and heads to the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. Senate leaders are currently on track to hold a final vote on the bill itself before Congress breaks for its July 4 recess at the end of the week. If enacted, the bill would create a path to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. ""When the immigration bill passes, (GOP Speaker John Boehner) should bring it up for a vote in the House of Representatives quickly,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""Mr. Speaker, rather than twisting the arms of tea party extremists, just work with moderates from both parties to pass bipartisan legislation."" Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, a strong opponent of the bill, condemned ""Republicans eager to go along with the Democrats in a mad rush to pass this bill."" ""What is the rush?"" he asked, noting that the legislative language for the changes was released last Friday. ""Why are we proceeding gangbusters?"" The White House welcomed the vote. ""We are pleased the Senate continues to work together on commonsense immigration reform,"" White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne said. ""As the president said today, this is a strong bipartisan bill that meets his principles, and now is the time to get it done."" Among other things, the border security amendment would require 20,000 more border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and border entry-exit controls. Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security. GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the compromise amendment last week, saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system. The staunchest critics of the plan produced by the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators, however, have remained skeptical. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, said last week that the compromise means ""amnesty will occur,"" and argued that the Hoeven-Corker amendment was only drafted in reaction to revelations about shortcomings in the original bill. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, announced Monday that he would oppose the Hoeven-Corker changes, declaring that he ""cannot support an amendment cobbled together at the eleventh hour that doubles the border patrol without knowing how much it will cost or whether it is even the right strategy."" ""Unfortunately this measure still omits a real trigger or objective measure to see if the proposed strategy is working,"" he added. ""At a time when the trust deficit with the federal government is so huge, we do not need more promises from the government - we need measurable results."" Last week, the Senate rejected a measure drafted by Cornyn that would have required much stricter border security standards. Democrats warned that his proposal was a ""poison pill"" that would have ensured defeat for the entire plan. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the ""Gang of Eight,"" told CNN's Dana Bash last week that he understands ""why conservatives are upset."" ""They've seen all these promises in the past that haven't been delivered,"" Rubio said. But the status quo on immigration ""is hurting America,"" he added. ""And if nothing passes, then this disaster that we have now, that's what's going to stay in place.""

"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) -- The firefighters are on the offensive. Over several hellish days, the Black Forest Fire singed more than 15,000 acres north of Colorado Springs. What's left behind, in some areas, ""looks like a nuclear bomb went off,"" according to El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa. Then came some rain, more clouds, less wind and -- very much related to all of that -- marked progress Friday. That continued into Saturday, as defined by a few simple measures: no more structures destroyed, no more area burned and more inroads corralling what's left. ""Today, we're optimistic,"" said Rich Harvey, the federal incident commander overseeing the fight. Then, as if addressing the fire itself, he added, ""We're ready for it ... Show yourself, we'll be there to fight right back."" In the first few days after the first broke out, for still unexplained reasons, crews had zero containment on the Black Forest Fire as it ravaged woods and neighborhoods. County spokesman Dave Rose told CNN it appeared to be the most destructive in the history of Colorado -- a state that's all too familiar with devastating wildfires. Residents hope for best, brace for worst . As of Saturday afternoon, authorities had counted 473 structures totally lost due to the four-day-old blaze, with another 17 partially damaged. Two people had died. The reason for that mix -- why, for the most part, homes were either destroyed or escaped unscathed -- was the speed and intensity of the flames, Maketa explained Saturday. In some areas, there's no number on the house, no mailbox and next-to-no other signs that someone had lived there, just a few days ago. Gallery: Wildfire photographer Kari Greer goes inside the inferno . ""You can't even recognize where there was a house or some other kind of structure,"" the sheriff said. ""That is the level of incineration and destruction that took place in some areas."" But things changed for the better Friday. In the morning, the blaze was 5% contained. By evening, it was 30%. That pivotal number continued to improve through midday Saturday, when Harvey said there was 45% containment. Video shows firefighters fending off fire from house's deck . Not just that, but authorities are noticing fewer hotspots and fewer flare-ups than they have in days. All of it is positive news, even as Harvey warns that there's still material sitting on the ground, waiting to be burned, if conditions suddenly change or firefighters let down their guard. The prospect of progress is all the more appreciated, given the other wildfires still burning in Colorado. The Royal Gorge Fire, southwest of Colorado Springs, was 40% contained after a week in which it scorched more than 3,200 acres -- including a beloved carousel and at least 20 buildings, according to Gov. John Hickenlooper. ""It's burned to a cinder,"" he said Friday of the area. The governor has declared a disaster emergency in Rocky Mountain National Park, northwest of Denver, due to the Big Meadows Fire that's burned hundreds of acres there. The latest flare-up is the Ward Gulch Fire in the western part of the state. No structures are reported destroyed yet in that blaze, but gusty winds, low humidity and warm temperatures have firefighters on edge. While all those fires pose dangers in their own ways, the Black Forest Fire is still by far the biggest and the most dangerous -- which is why thousands in that area remain evacuated, because their homes remain in areas where it is too perilous to return. ""It's been a pretty good emotional roller coaster,"" said Chris Schroeder, one of those who live in the Black Forest Fire evacuation zone and now has little to do except hope and wait. Woman records wildfire evacuation . Getting him and others off of that wild ride, by saving their homes, remains the primary mission of those on the front lines of the blaze. More than 1,000 personnel -- more than at any point this week -- were part of the firefighting effort Saturday. They included boots on the ground, as well as helicopters and tankers overhead. Said Maketa: ""We're hoping to gain inches each day to get people's lives back to normal, where it can be returned to normal.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live's CEO wrote two days before Michael Jackson died that a doctor Jackson was seeing ""scares us to death because he is shooting him up with something,"" court testimony shows. Randy Phillips' e-mail could contradict his earlier testimony that he had no idea Jackson was getting prescription drugs while he was preparing for his comeback concerts. Phillips is on the witness stand for a fifth day Tuesday in the Jackson wrongful death trial, which is in its seventh week. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos sent jurors out of the courtroom at one point Monday afternoon so she could lecture Phillips about arguing with Jackson lawyer Brian Panish and appearing to evade his questions. ""Arguing with the lawyers is not going to help,"" Palazuelos told Phillips. ""It's not going to help your case. It's not going to help anybody. It's lengthening your testimony. "" Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, saying the concert promoter is liable in Jackson's death because it hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Phillips and other AEG Live executives ignored ""red flags"" that should have alerted them that Jackson's health was at risk as they pressured him and his doctor to stop missing rehearsals as the ""This Is It"" tour premiere approached in the summer of 2009, Jackson lawyers argue. Jackson, not AEG Live, chose and controlled Murray, company lawyers argue. Although they negotiated a contract to pay Murray $150,000 a month to attend to Jackson, it was never fully executed because Jackson died before they signed, they say. AEG executives -- including Co-CEO Paul Gongaware, who had managed Jackson's last two tours -- had no way of knowing that Jackson was abusing drugs, especially the surgical anesthetic propofol, which the coroner ruled played the largest role in his death, AEG Live lawyers argue. Murray told investigators he was infusing propofol into Jackson nearly every night to treat his insomnia so Jackson would be rested for rehearsals. On Monday, Panish confronted Phillips about an e-mail exchange that he had two days before Jackson's death in which Phillips was asked if Dr. Arnold Klein was ""on the list of doctors that will help get us from today to the opening night."" ""He scares us to death because he is shooting him up with something,"" Phillips replied. Michael Kane, who was Jackson's business manager, shared with Phillips that Klein's office sent him a $48,000 bill for Jackson's frequent visits to his Beverly Hills dermatology clinic in the months before his death. Klein's invoice said Jackson had been treated with Restalyne, Botox and unidentified drug injections, Kane wrote to Phillips. ""There were a lot of bills for injections, I didn't know what it was,"" Phillips said in his deposition before the trial. Klein or his staff injected Jackson with 6,500 milligrams of Demerol during the last three months of his life, according to documents and testimony at Murray's criminal trial. ""Since we owe him $48K and he wants payment, maybe I should stop paying him so he would stop shooting him up,"" Kane told Phillips. ""I have the details of what he is doing."" It was unclear why Kane would share Jackson's medical records with an AEG Live executive since the company's lawyers insist they were not involved with and did not pry into Jackson's health care. Phillips' testimony differs from CNN interview . Phillips met with Jackson, Dr. Murray and show director Kenny Ortega on June 20, 2009, after production manager John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl sent an e-mail to producers titled ""trouble at the Front."" ""I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now,"" Houghdahl wrote about Jackson. Ortega sent Jackson home from a rehearsal the night before because of his strange behavior. ""He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt,"" Houghdahl wrote. ""The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive."" Phillips' testimony about the meeting this week contradicts what he told CNN's Don Lemon in 2010, just before the first anniversary of Jackson's death. He testified Monday that it was a ""highly charged situation"" because of producers' concerns about Jackson's readiness for the show just three weeks away, although he downplayed the drama in the CNN interview. Contrary to the production manager's e-mail, Phillips told CNN there was no concern about Jackson's dancing. ""You know, there was very little to worry about him performing."" ""Kenny felt that Michael was taking this show a little too nonchalantly,"" Phillips told CNN. Phillips testified Monday that the meeting with Dr. Murray and Jackson -- which he called ""an intervention"" in an e-mail -- was called to find out what was wrong with Jackson. But in the CNN interview, Phillips denied it was AEG Live who wanted Murray to be there. ""Michael brought him,"" he said. ""That was Michael's choice. He brought Dr. Murray into the meeting."" ""I didn't invite Dr. Murray into the meeting,"" Phillips said in response to a follow up question by Lemon. ""Michael brought Dr. Murray into the meeting."" ""Why would Jackson feel he needed his doctor to meet with the concert promoters?"" Lemon asked. ""Because he was using Dr. Murray like he would a manager or a representative,"" Phillips said. ""He wanted him to speak for him."" ""Did that seem odd to you?"" Lemon asked. ""No, nothing seems odd in Michael world,"" he said.

"Oakland Township, Michigan (CNN) -- The FBI -- working on information from an aging reputed mobster -- began digging in the waist-high grass of a Detroit-area field Monday in yet another search for the remains of former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. The information that sparked the latest hunt in the nearly four-decades-long search for Hoffa is ""highly credible,"" the source said. Agents were executing a search warrant for a field in Oakland Township, north of Detroit, based in part on information provided by alleged mobster Tony Zerilli. The paperwork filed under seal that accompanies the search warrant is described as ""several pages long,"" according to the source, and it explains why the FBI believes the search is justified. ""The information provided by Tony Zerilli is highly credible,"" the source said. By late afternoon, the search had been underway for several hours but there were no indications of any developments. The search was on private property, and media and curious onlookers were kept some distance from the search site. FBI Special Agent Bob Foley, head of the agency's Detroit office, told CNN at the scene that the information leading to the search ""reached the threshold of probable cause, which was sufficient to allow us to obtain a search warrant. ""If it didn't rise to that level then, certainly, we wouldn't be out here."" Earlier this year, Zerilli, now in his 80s, told New York's NBC 4 that Hoffa was buried in a Michigan field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen in 1975. The FBI has spent months looking into Zerilli's claims before seeking court authorization to excavate the field and look for evidence of a shallow grave, according to the source. Contrary to what's been previously thought for years, Zerilli said he was told Hoffa's disappearance was not connected to Genovese family New Jersey crime boss Anthony ""Tony"" Provensano who allegedly wanted to get rid of Hoffa. Instead, according to the source, Zerilli told the FBI Detroit mobsters wanted Hoffa dead. At the time, Hoffa was thought to be setting the stage to get back into a power position with the labor movement after he was released from prison. He was convicted in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971. Hoffa, then 62, was last seen on July 30, 1975, outside a Detroit-area restaurant. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and to the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Zerilli was in prison himself when Hoffa disappeared. Zerilli, according to the source, said he when he was freed, he asked a mob enforcer what happened to Hoffa. The mobster allegedly told Zerilli that Detroit's crime bosses ordered the Hoffa hit. They lured him to a meeting, then drove him to a farm owned by a mob underboss. The enforcer allegedly told Zerilli that Hoffa was killed and buried on the property, which covers several acres. The area being searched Monday was described as relatively small -- about the size of a small party tent, according to the source. Hoffa's disappearance and presumed death have vexed investigators in the years since his last sighting. As recently as October, soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban Detroit community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after Hoffa disappeared. The soil samples were tested, and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition. Zerilli, freed in 2008 after his last prison sentence, was convicted of crimes in connection with organized crime in Detroit. Keith Corbett, a former U.S. attorney, told CNN earlier this year that Zerilli headed a Detroit organized crime family from 1970 to 1975, but was in fact in prison when Hoffa disappeared. In an interview with CNN affiliate WDIV-TV, Zerilli denied playing any role in Hoffa's disappearance. Man convicted in mob crimes says he's 'certain' where Hoffa is buried .

"(CNN) -- Authorities found four human bodies abandoned in the Arizona desert Thursday. Initial indications point to exposure as the probable cause of death, said Victor Brabble, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. ""It is probable that they are immigrants attempting to cross into the U.S.,"" he said. ""However, we don't have enough to draw a conclusion on it now."" The bodies were found near Gila Bend, Arizona, about 70 miles north of the border. They have not been identified, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said. Immigrants often try to cross the Sonoran Desert's harsh terrain, and there are many heat-related deaths, Brabble said Thursday. Immigrant rights advocates have warned that even as border crossings decrease, deaths are on the rise as increased border security forces people to choose more dangerous crossing routes. Border patrol officials have argued that more security is necessary to stop smugglers. According to a recent study by the Binational Migration Institute at the University of Arizona, more than 2,230 migrants have died in the state's desert area along the border in the past 22 years. In the border region of Pima County, Arizona, deaths of unidentified migrants in the desert have become so common the Medical Examiner's Office has helped create a website to track the deaths and assist family members searching for their loved ones' remains. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators announced a proposal to add 20,000 more border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The proposed amendment, negotiated by a group of senators from both parties known as the ""Gang of Eight,"" is intended to ensure Senate passage of a major immigration reform bill with enough Republican support to persuade the GOP-controlled House to also take up the measure. Journalist Valeria Fernandez and CNN's Tom Cohen, Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","A border patrol spokesman says it's probable they are immigrants .

"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- A panel of judges Monday sentenced former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to seven years in prison for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute. Judges also barred the flamboyant former prime minister from holding public office. The high-profile case centered on an exotic dancer nicknamed ""Ruby the heart-stealer."" Berlusconi's attorney told reporters he plans to appeal the conviction. He said he was not surprised by the verdict, because the former prime minister had not gotten a fair trial. ""What happened today is very serious,"" defense attorney Nicolo Ghedini said, arguing that judges had not appropriately considered court proceedings. Prosecutors had argued that Berlusconi had sex 13 times with underage dancer Karima el Mahroug and abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from jail, where she was being held on charges of theft. Berlusconi, 76, has denied the charges and others against him. ""It is absurd to suggest I have paid for a rapport with a woman. It is something I have never done, not even once in my life. It is something I find degrading to my dignity,"" he has said. El Mahroug has said that she never had sex with Berlusconi and that she lied to him about her age, telling him she was 24. The underage sex trial verdict is the latest in a string of legal troubles the former prime minister has faced. Last month, an Italian appeals court in Milan upheld a four-year prison sentence for Berlusconi, who was convicted of tax evasion by a lower court last October. In that sentence, he was barred from public office for five years. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, is arguably one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. For years, he has been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached Italian courts. Berlusconi Fast Facts . In a 389-page document presented to a court in 2011, prosecutors alleged Berlusconi paid el Mahroug and scores of other young women for taking part in ""bunga bunga parties"" at his private residence. Using what they say are phone interceptions of the young women as evidence, prosecutors said the women performed stripteases and erotic actions in exchange for money and gifts. Berlusconi says the parties were normal dinner gatherings where no one misbehaved. Berlusconi denied the charges and accused prosecutors of conspiring against him in a left-wing plot. ""Communism never changes in Italy. There are still people who use the penal code as a weapon in their ideological battles,"" he said last year. Undaunted, Berlusconi has not only launched an appeal, but in December made two significant announcements: his engagement to 27-year-old Francesca Pascale, and then, his political comeback. In Italy's February elections, the three-time prime minister appealed to Italian voters by denouncing the unpopular austerity policies of technocrat Mario Monti. For all his critics, Berlusconi won almost 30% of the vote in February and remains an influential figure in Prime Minister Enrico Letta's fragile coalition government.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese authorities have released an American man who was jailed for allegedly trying to snatch back his children from his estranged wife. Christopher Savoie was jailed in Japan after trying to get kids back from their mother. Police in the rural southern town of Yanagawa let Christopher Savoie go Thursday without indicting him on charges of child kidnapping. Officials said the indictment was ""on hold,"" but did not elaborate. The prosecutor's office in nearby Fukuoka said Savoie was released after he promised not to take his children back to the United States ""in this manner,"" implying he could not have any contact with the children. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly grabbed his children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka, to try to obtain passports for them. Screaming at guards to let him in the compound, Savoie was steps from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested.  Watch how dad promised not to see kids » . Consulate spokeswoman Tracy Taylor said her office had been notified that Savoie would be released Thursday afternoon. ""We are pleased to learn that Mr. Savoie was released from police custody,"" she said. ""We hope that we can work with the Japanese government to come to a long term solution on the issue of international parental child abduction.""  Watch how Savoie's release was worked out » . Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before a bitter divorce in January. The couple lived in Japan but had moved to the United States before the divorce. Christopher Savoie remarried in February. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. On the day that the children were to start school in August, Savoie learned that Noriko Savoie had fled with them to Japan. After they went to Japan, Christopher Savoie filed for and received full custody of the children. Police in Franklin, Tennessee, issued an arrest warrant for Noriko Savoie. However, Japan is not a party to a 1980 Hague Convention law on international child abduction. Japanese law also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan because they never divorced here, police said. In addition, Japanese authorities say, the children hold Japanese passports. Foreign parents have had little luck in regaining custody, the U.S. State Department said. Noriko Savoie's mother did not want to talk about Christopher Savoie's release on Thursday. ""I cannot make any comment on this, for the sake of my grandchildren,"" she said. Upon hearing news of her husband's release, Amy Savoie told CNN, ""The elation lasted for a few minutes and now we're back to square one, where there's no closure. We don't have Isaac and Rebecca in a situation from which they were taken. Isaac and Rebecca had a very, very happy situation here in Tennessee. ... They have people who love them here.""  Watch what Christopher Savoie's second wife says about the case » . She said she did not believe the parties could work out an agreeable arrangement regarding the children. ""There are two parents who love these children and one of them has just been -- just cast aside."" She said other parents in similar situations have contacted her. ""I think the focus for us will be, you know, we'll become spokespersons, I suppose, for so many of these families."" Yasuhisa Kawamura, a spokesman with the Foreign Ministry, said the government may reconsider signing on to the Hague treaty. ""Japanese government is also considering seriously to conclude this treaty on the grounds that this treaty would provide one of the most effective measures to protect the children after their parents divorced,"" he said.","Indictment against Christopher Savoie ""on hold,"" Japanese police say .

"(CNN) -- The president of the Russian republic of Tatarstan declared Monday a day of mourning as crews continued to look for bodies in the wreckage of a Russian jetliner that crashed on landing a day earlier. All 50 people on board, including the son of Tatarstan regional President Rustam Minnikhanov, died in the crash in Tatarstan's capital, Kazan. Closed-circuit video, aired on Russian media outlets, shows the plane vertical to the ground as it crashes in the darkness, creating a large fireball and a wide fire on the ground. The victims ranged in age from 13 to 87, according to a list of names the airline posted on its website. Among them was Lt. Gen. Alexander Antonov, the regional chief of Russia's Federal Security Service, and a British national. ""Not all the bodies have been located,"" Deputy Emergency Situation Situations Minister Vladimir Stepanov told local media Monday morning. ""The main work will be completed today."" Officials do not know why Tatarstan Airlines flight 363 crashed. Authorities say they have confiscated documents and fuel samples from Tatarstan Airlines. Part of the answer may lie in the Boeing 737's flight and data recorders. Russian officials say they've found the flight recorders, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said Monday. Russia's Interstate Commerce Committee reports that the recorders' container was seriously damaged, the news agency said, but they've been sent to Moscow and could provide some information by Tuesday. Boeing is sending a team to assist with technical aspects of the investigation, the company said in a written statement that also offered its condolences to the families of the victims. The plane, carrying 44 passengers and a crew of six, took off from Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport, about 700 kilometers (435 miles) west of Kazan. The pilot tried to land once before the plane crashed on the second attempt, officials said. The jet was 23 years old and had been in service with at least eight airlines, including Air France, Uganda Airlines and Bulgaria Air, according to aviation industry websites. In a November 2012 flight, it was forced to cut short a flight to Moscow and return to Kazan after losing cabin pressure, according to the website AeroInside. Russia has tried to improve its checkered reputation for air safety in recent years. In 2011, then-President Dmitry Medvedev grounded two classes of Soviet-era aircraft after a pair of crashes that killed more than 90 people, including a charter plane crash that killed an entire professional hockey team. Medvedev said Russia would have to upgrade its aircraft fleet, step up safety standards and radically cut the number of airlines. 4 die in Bahamas plane crash . Plane crashes in Bolivia, killing 8 .

"(CNN) -- Butch Harmon could hardly believe what he was seeing. Two of the most recognizable faces on the planet were casually shooting the breeze as they swept down the fairway in Florida. While the White House press pack fumed outside the gates, President Obama enjoyed a leisurely 18 holes with the world's number one golfer Tiger Woods. If ever there was a powerhouse pairing, this was it. ""It was really amazing,"" renowned golf coach Harmon told CNN's Living Golf show about that momentous February day when he had a greenside view. ""If you'd have told me 20 years ago that a black man would be the President of the United States I would have said you're crazy. ""And if you'd have told me 20 years ago that a black golfer was going to be the greatest golfer that ever walked the planet I'd say you're crazy, and there they go."" Harmon is already more than familiar with Woods, having played an influential role in his formative years, sculpting the swing that would capture eight major championships by the age of 26. He has also coached other stellar names in the world of golf, such as fellow American Phil Mickelson and South African Ernie Els -- both with four majors to their name -- as well as Australians Greg Norman and Adam Scott, the current Masters champion. But never before in his illustrious career had he been afforded the chance to offer a few tips to the leader of the free world -- himself a golf fanatic. The U.S. President spent hours in a teaching studio at The Floridian resort, alongside Butch's son Claude -- also a coach to some of the game's leading lights -- as they fine-tuned a swing that by Harmon's evaluation needed some work. ""President Obama loves golf,"" he explained. ""He's not very good, he's probably an 18 or 20 handicap, plays left-handed, didn't hit the ball very far with a weak fade but we got him where he could draw and hit about 250, 260. ""When he gets out of office in another three years and he has a chance to play, he could probably get down to a 10 or 12 handicap -- but he loves to play and he knows so much about everything. He loved the place. He said 'Man, I'm coming back here.' ""We'd love to (have kept) the film of the lesson we gave him but as soon as he walked out the secret service took everything and they had to watch us delete it all from the computers. ""In this day and age with the multimedia stuff all over the world, he didn't want it to show up on YouTube. ""I said to this one secret service guy, 'I actually went on YouTube to look at the president's swing and it was terrible, you actually might want some of these shots because they're better than the ones you have. These look pretty good!' "" The President and a clutch of his closest friends bunkered down at The Floridian for a weekend's vacation -- his erstwhile secret service detail, naturally, in tow -- on the invitation of the resort's owner, Jim Crane. Crane, owner of the Houston Astros baseball team, and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk joined Obama for one of his two rounds on the Sunday, and making up the numbers just happened to be a 14-time major winner. Not that Woods is a stranger to the President. The 37-year-old delivered a speech at Obama's inauguration back in 2009, though he has always tried to stay away from politics throughout his career. But whether Woods is a Democrat, Republican, or apolitical, the invitation to play with the President is not one to be ignored, according to Harmon. ""In all honesty it doesn't matter what your politics are, if you get the chance to play golf with the President -- which is the highest honor in our country -- whether you voted for him or not or agree with the politics, it's a great honor. ""When the President drove up and he instantly went right over and said, 'Tiger it was great to see how well you played at Torrey Pines when you won the (Farmers Insurance Open) tournament.' ""He was into it, he wanted to play with Tiger, he was asking about his swing. It was great, it was fun to watch, and it was fun to see it and fun to be part of it."" The Harmons have a rich history of rubbing shoulders with Washington power brokers. Claude Snr. was the last club professional to win a major championship when he secured the Masters title in 1948. His four sons Butch, Craig, Bill, and Dick all became golf professionals and had a keen eye for teaching, just like their father. And from a young age they knew that Claude's golfing prowess opened some pretty special doors. ""My father played with so many presidents himself,"" Harmon explained. ""He played with Eisenhower and he played with Ford, Nixon, and I got to play with a lot of them too when I was younger. ""I think if my father was still alive he'd be very proud of all of us. He'd be proud of the four sons, he'd be proud of his grandson because in reality we're just carrying on what he taught us and what he did and we're a very proud family. ""He had the greatest eye I think of anyone that's ever taught and he saw things that other people didn't see and quickly, he knew how to fix them, he'd watch you hit five or six balls and he'd know exactly what you were doing wrong."" It was that wisdom passed down from father to son that led Harmon to believe that the 13-year-old kid presented to him in 1993 could go on to be one of the greatest players the game had ever seen. Woods' father Earl had noted the work Harmon had done with Greg Norman and asked if he could bring his son over to hit some balls. The session was filmed by Butch's young son Claude. ""You've seen the footage, he's a tall skinny kid in tennis shoes hitting balls and you just saw this natural talent that this kid had,"" Butch said. ""I asked him so many different kinds of questions about how do you do this? Why do you do that? He didn't know it at the time but I was giving him an examination, trying to find out really what ticked in his head, what he knew about golf. ""The kid was special, he was just a special person you could see it. It was no surprise to me that he turned out to be who he was.""","Butch and Claude Harmon relive the day President Obama played golf with Tiger Woods .

"(CNN) -- When Anne Moyer told her best friend, Diane Ritchie, she was going to lose weight a few years ago, Ritchie politely replied, ""Good for you. You'll have to let me know how it works out."" Clearly, Ritchie had heard this before. In fact, she could look in the mirror herself and see that her friend's history of starting and stopping diets with little success was similar to her own. The stay-at-home moms had been close since meeting in 2006 when their husbands were stationed in the Navy in Chesapeake, Virginia. Ritchie's family was transferred to Chicago in 2009, and that fateful phone conversation about losing weight took place shortly before Christmas 2010. Ritchie hung up and thought about her friend's pledge. She picked up the phone and called Moyer back. ""I'm doing it with you,"" Ritchie remembers telling Moyer. ""I'm going to start the same day you do, and I'm going to start to figure this out."" They began January 6, 2011. Moyer weighed 336 pounds and squeezed into size 30 pants. Ritchie was 260 pounds and wore a size 24. Leaning on each other as long-distance weight-loss ""sponsors,"" the women would go on to lose more than 200 pounds the first year. Big and beautiful . Their husbands always told them they were beautiful, no matter how big they got. Both women loved to eat and didn't think about exercise. Before they knew it, they were obese. Ritchie, 38, says she was chunky in high school, while Moyer, 42, was average size until she was about 20. Both women said their weight ballooned after their first pregnancies. ""I'd like to say it was some traumatic event,"" Ritchie says. ""I had a lot of fun in my 20s and 30s and just didn't pay attention. Before I knew it, I was way up."" Moyer tells a similar story. ""I gained some, then I'd lose some, but I wouldn't lose all of it, and then I'd gain more than I lost. It just kept creeping up and up ... and then I just decided, ""Well, this is me. I'm plus size."" Ritchie cooked healthy meals for her children but indulged on her own. Chicken without the skin removed, heavy pastas, wings and beer were all in frequent rotation. Moyer would make two 9-by-13 pans of white chocolate bread pudding at Christmas -- one for the family and one for herself. Physical and emotional difficulties . Being obese took a physical toll on both women and their families. For Moyer, just walking to the car from her front door caused her to break out into a sweat. If she went to one of her kids' sports games, she would watch from the car because the field was too far to walk. ""Say you go to Walmart -- I couldn't do both the grocery side and the regular side. I had to choose one side one day and the other side another day because I couldn't do the whole store and then get back out to the car, too."" Being overweight was also hard emotionally for Ritchie. Getting ready for military functions was torture. She would agonize over what to wear, needing her husband to hold her hand as she cried while getting dressed. Her lowest point came in fall 2010 when a stranger at a gas station -- heavy himself -- made a nasty comment about the size of her rear end. Months later, the comment still stung. The turning point . In 2010, Moyer developed sleep apnea, a disorder commonly associated with obesity in which breathing at night starts and stops. She was tired all the time, often fell asleep during the day and snored so loudly her husband had to sleep on the couch many nights. ""I thought, 'Oh my gosh, all the things I can't do anymore, and now I can't even sleep,' "" she says. Rather than go for more medical tests, she resolved to solve the problem herself. That's when she called Ritchie. After Ritchie pledged to lose weight too, the women agreed to start in the new year. They began doing research. Attainable goals . Moyer knew counting calories would work best for her. She used the iPhone app MyFitness Pal, which calculates how many calories to consume based on how much weight someone wants to lose per week. It adds calories back when you exercise. Moyer allowed herself to eat fruits and bread but cut out soda and enriched flour. For the first year, she plugged every single thing she ate into the app. Ritchie followed the South Beach Diet, a plan that encourages replacing ""bad"" carbohydrates and fats with ""good"" carbs and fats, lean protein and low-fat dairy. She ordered ""The South Beach Diet Supercharged"" book and two South Beach cookbooks, got rid of all the enriched flour and alcohol in the house, switched to whole grains and documented her meals and twice-weekly weigh-ins in a journal for the first eight months. They set goals they thought they could meet. Ritchie sought to get below 200 pounds, while Moyer wanted to sleep through the night. The first few weeks, it took all their willpower just to focus on their food. ""It was like I was coming down off drugs,"" Moyer says. ""Headaches. I literally had the shakes. The first couple of weeks were just absolute torture."" Once they adjusted to the new eating plans, they started thinking about exercise. First, they walked. Three mornings a week, Ritchie took her 4-year-old to the mall, and they did laps together. Moyer started with one block. She gradually added distance until she felt comfortable joining the YMCA. They were both realistic about what they could manage. ""I didn't say, 'I need to walk for an hour.' When I first went to the gym, I did the elliptical, and I could only do it for 10 minutes,"" Moyer says. ""And then I gradually would add to that time. Then I went to my very first group class, which I was absolutely terrified to do. I was constantly trying to push myself to do something more or longer or harder."" Eventually the women were running and working out regularly on machines and in classes. It took losing 75 pounds to stop Moyer's snoring. By that time, she says she thought, ""My gosh, if I could lose this, why don't I keep going?"" Some friends weren't supportive. Ritchie called them her ""saboteurs"" -- overweight pals who would try to tempt her into having ""one bite"" of cake, or who made her feel bad about spending her mornings at the gym instead of joining them for breakfast. But Moyer and Ritchie always had each other. The first month, they talked on the phone three times a day. Over the next several months, they would check in for twice-weekly weigh-ins and call whenever they slipped in their diets or needed to vent. They would treat each other to weekend visits in Chicago or Virginia, where they would marvel at how the other had shrunk. When Ritchie moved back to Virginia last year, supporting each other became even easier. They live close to one another and work out together most mornings at the YMCA. Besides taking Zumba, abs, boot camp and weight-training classes, they're training for the Wicked 10K race in Virginia Beach. And more than 280 pounds later, they still call each other when they fall off the wagon. The payoff . Moyer no longer has to bring a chair for her kids' sports events. She's even able to play an entire parents-vs.-kids soccer game herself. She also has a lot more friends. ""Before, I had to be at home a lot because going out anywhere was hard on me,"" Moyer says. ""And now, it's just like my world has expanded. I have more people and friends in my life now than I have in a long, long time."" And when Ritchie gets an invitation to a military ball these days, she's no longer self-conscious about how she looks. Both Moyer and Ritchie say they're heard from friends and gym acquaintances who say they've inspired them. ""I had somebody come up to me a few months ago and she said, 'I see you here all the time. Sometimes I do not feel like coming in here and working out, but then I think, well you know that girl's going to be there, so I'm going to go too.' That's been icing on the cake,"" Moyer says. The women know there's no end date. They say they will always be food addicts. Moyer is a pound away from her original goal of 165 pounds but trying to get down to 154. She still uses her MyFitnessPal app and has calorie counts memorized for everything she eats. Ritchie dropped 111 pounds in the first 10 months and at 149 pounds is now in maintenance mode. She still sticks to the major tenets of the South Beach Diet -- no enriched flour, light on carbs, heavy on protein and veggies. At parties, Ritchie will ""taste"" most things but fill her plate with healthier options. She says it's been a healthy change for her whole family. Her kids have learned to eat pancakes with whole-wheat flour and no-sugar syrup as well as brown rice and couscous, and her husband has lost 40 pounds. ""I will always worry about getting heavy again,"" Ritchie says. ""I am not saying I won't take a day off from the gym or eat food that is unhealthy, but I have to keep myself in check forever.""","Anne Moyer and Diane Ritchie helped each other shed 281 pounds .

"(CNN) -- Two people died Thursday when a fireworks plant exploded near Montreal, federal police in Quebec said. ""You could see the fireworks going off,"" said Stacey Hylen, who was bicycling with her husband and 5-year-old daughter to a nearby school to watch her 10-year-old participate in a mini triathlon. ""The kids thought it was fireworks for the start of their triathlon,"" Hylen, 41, told CNN in a telephone interview. The plant is located a mile north of the school in the town of Coteau-du-Lac, nearly an hour's drive southwest of Montreal. As the explosions continued, it became clear that was not the case. ""It was like a bomb,"" she said. ""It was so loud. Like, at first you were thinking it was dynamite. It just kept going on and on. And then, when you saw the mushroom cloud it was like, woah! It just freaked me out. It shook. I had friends tell me it shook their house, and they live miles away."" Soon after, thick black smoke emerged from the roof of one of the factory's two buildings, both corrugated-metal structures about 20 feet tall. The children were sent into the school gymnasium, she said. ""The cloud was really black and scary looking. You didn't want to breathe it."" Fireworks shot from one building to the other, about half a football field away, and both structures were soon in flames, she said. Across the parking lot, a store that sells fireworks and souvenirs was unscathed, she said. Soon, police and fire vehicles arrived, but firefighters were initially unable to approach the buildings, which continued to be rocked by explosions. Highway 20, which connects Montreal with Toronto, was shut in both directions for hours. Residents and businesses within a kilometer of the BEM plant were evacuated as a precaution, Quebec Provincial Police Sgt. Joyce Kemp said. An investigation was under way to determine the cause of the fire, she said. The triathlon was canceled.

"(CNN) -- One of the two people killed when a corporate jet crashed into a row of homes in northern Indiana Sunday was a former University of Oklahoma quarterback who helped the school win two national championships in the 1970s, a school official confirmed Monday. Steven Davis, the 60-year-old former quarterback, and Wesley Caves, 58, both of Tulsa, Oklahoma, were killed in the crash that also injured three other people in South Bend, said Randy Magdalinski, coroner of St. Joseph County, Indiana. Davis' former Oklahoma coach, Barry Switzer, said Davis wasn't a highly-regarded recruit, but excelled when he won a starting job. ""He went on to post a 32-1-1 record and help us win two national championships,"" Switzer said. ""Steve was surrounded by great talent on those teams, but he was truly an exceptional leader. I was proud of him. The entire state of Oklahoma was proud of him. We still are."" OU athletic director Joe Castiglione said, ""We extend our sympathies to Steve's family and others whose lives he touched. He was a great champion and someone who set a wonderful example for others. We will miss him very much."" The Hawker Beechcraft 390 that Davis and Caves were on slammed into a South Bend neighborhood, damaging three single-story homes. Davis and Caves died on impact. Two other people aboard were injured, as was one person on the ground, Assistant Fire Chief John Corthier said late Sunday. The plane was sheared in half -- its nose poking through the front window of a shattered home. It was attempting to circle back to the city's regional airport after a failed landing attempt. Moments earlier, the plane's pilot had radioed for help, CNN affiliate WNDU-TV reported. He was experiencing problems with the technical equipment, he said. The plane was almost on its back and was ""spiraling down,"" resident Theresa Futa told WNDU. ""I've never seen anything like that before in my life ever."" A representative of the National Transportation Safety Board arrived late Sunday to investigate the crash. The plane left Tulsa, Oklahoma on Sunday afternoon, and was scheduled to land at South Bend Regional Airport about 80 minutes later at 4:20 p.m. ET, WNDU reported. The troubled aircraft startled Shelby Ramirez, who was driving in the area. ""I happened to see the shadow and I said 'Oh my God. I've never seen a plane that low,'"" Ramirez said. ""And I would say if it was 3 feet above the top of the car it was something. It could have dropped on us."" 3 dead after small plane crashes in Fort Lauderdale .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The Bangladesh Awami League, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, won Sunday's parliamentary elections, which were marred by low turnout and violence and were boycotted by the largest opposition group and its allies. At least three people were killed in post-election violence Monday between supporters of two rival candidates in Dohar, on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, Dhaka district police Superintendent Habibur Rahman told CNN. In the Dohar district, Awami League candidate Abdul Mannan, a former land minister, was routed by Jatiya Party candidate Salma Islam. At least 18 people were killed over the weekend as opposition activists clashed with police as they tried to foil the elections. More than 150 voting centers were burned. According to the Election Commission, elections were held in only 147 districts Sunday. The candidates from 153 other districts were elected unopposed, as there were no opponents because of the boycott. On Sunday, the Awami League won 105 seats, while the Jatiya Party, led by former President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, won 13 seats, according to the Election Commission's unofficial results. Bangladesh votes amid violence, opposition boycott . Independent candidates won 13 seats, and other small parties won eight seats. The Election Commission will hold new voting in eight districts where it suspended elections because of violence Sunday. Including the results from unopposed elections, the Awami League has won 232 seats so far, and the Jatiya Party has won 33 seats. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and its allies boycotted elections and announced it would try to prevent voting with general strikes and road blockades. The party on Sunday urged the government to cancel the election results and announce schedules for new elections under a neutral caretaker government. Zia said she would not participate in elections unless they took place under a neutral caretaker government, but Hasina rejected the demand.","Awami League wins 105 seats; counting unopposed seats, it holds 232 of 300 seats .

"(CNN) -- The Fairfax County, Virginia, health department is investigating a tuberculosis outbreak at an area school after three people tested positive for the potentially fatal bacteria, officials said Thursday. The health department has contacted 430 people who may have been exposed and need to be tested as a result of exposure to the three, the officials said. Health officials declined to say whether the three were students or teachers. They also said they did not know what strain of TB the three contracted. The first case of tuberculosis at Robert E. Lee High School was diagnosed in December 2012, and the health department opened and completed an investigation, the agency said. But because two more people from the same school were diagnosed with it in June, the department re-opened the December case and is investigating whether they are related. TB bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also attack other parts of the body such as the kidneys, spine and brain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If not treated properly, TB can be fatal.","Three people tested positive for tuberculosis at Fairfax County school, officials say .

"(Parenting.com) -- ""What's that on her head?"" It was my daughter Chloe's second day on Earth, and already the mom anxiety had kicked in over what looked like a bruise just above her forehead. ""That's just a hemangioma birthmark. It might get a little bigger, but it will go away by the time she's 2,"" the pediatrician told me. Google gave me more details: A hemangioma, often called a strawberry, is a benign blood-vessel tumor. One in 10 babies (usually girls) will develop one. My husband, Justin, and I tried to laugh it off as we fell madly in love with our Baby Gorbachev. But as Chloe grew, the hemangioma showed no signs of shrinking. In fact, it had ballooned to the diameter of a golf ball, and was puffed ominously full of blood. Parenting.com: 10 secret mom confessions . People who knew Chloe saw a spunky, smiley, and beautiful kid; strangers just stared at that thing on her head. The pediatrician brushed off my concerns, saying it was just a cosmetic issue. But I couldn't help the nagging feeling that her birthmark would always enter the room before she did. I made an appointment with a plastic surgeon my pediatrician begrudgingly referred me to. Chloe and I sat in the waiting room surrounded by pamphlets for rhinoplasty and chin implants. It felt blasphemous. Shouldn't I be teaching my kid that you can't judge a book by its cover? Plus, I'd kill her if she ever got a boob job. Parenting.com: Should you put your kid on a diet? Then, through online research, we found the Vascular Birthmarks Foundation, and Milton Waner, M.D., who wrote the book on hemangiomas. (No, seriously. He wrote a book called Hemangiomas and Vascular Malformations of the Head and Neck.) He told me that most pediatricians don't know a lot about hemangiomas, which can actually take as long as a decade to resolve, plenty of time for it to do a number on a child's self-esteem. Chloe's was just past her hairline, so even after it faded, she'd be left with a large hairless section. I pictured bullies. My gut told me Chloe would not appreciate going to junior high with a bald spot. Parenting.com: Dear daughter, you are more than 'thigh gap' After discovering that insurance would cover some of the cost, we scheduled the surgery for May 3, 2007. Chloe was barely 2 years old. Surgery day was a mix of the mundane (keeping her distracted) and the awful (holding her down while the nurses put her under). When the surgery was done, we heard her scream from the recovery room. I ran in and cradled her, staring at the stitched gash. Seconds later, everyone was asking if I was OK. Chloe is now in second grade, with long blond hair. (When you part it on the right side, it hides the three-inch scar.) On a recent trip to the supermarket, she glanced at a magazine cover detailing a starlet's plastic surgery. ""Why do people do that?"" she asked. ""People are usually better off with what they're born with,"" I told her -- and hoped someday to find a way to explain ""usually.""

"(CNN) -- Smartphone competition isn't just about choosing the biggest screen, fastest processor or sleekest operating system. As phones continue to replace point-and-shoot cameras, a new battleground for smartphone manufacturers is camera quality. And the bar keeps getting raised. Nokia's new Lumia 1020 smartphone, which goes on sale July 26 through AT&T, features a whopping 41-megapixel camera. The Finnish company is fighting to stay competitive in the phone market, where it has been overtaken by Samsung as a top mobile phone vendor, and where Windows 8, its smartphone operating system of choice, is a distant third behind Android and iOS. Nokia has decided to focus on adding the best possible camera technology into its phones, a mission that started with its PureView 808 camera. Unveiled in early 2012, the 808 also featured a 41 megapixel camera but was bulkier and ran the now obsolete Symbian operating system. If 41 megapixels in a smartphone sounds too good to be true it's because in some ways it is. The beefed-up pixel count makes for an excellent marketing soundbite when you compare it to the competition. The iPhone 5's back-facing camera is just 8 megapixels, the Samsung Galaxy 4's is 13 megapixels and the Canon 5D Mark III DSLR camera, favored by many professional photographers, is 22.3 megapixels. A megapixel -- that's one million pixels, if you're counting -- is a broad measurement of image quality: The more megapixels, the sharper the image and the more you can enlarge a photo without it looking blurred or grainy. But there is more to a good image than megapixel count. Most amateur photographers don't need more than 8 or 10 megapixels. Some experts believe a better measure of a camera's quality is the size of its light sensor: The larger a sensor, the more light it lets in and can use to create an image. Large sensors can capture crisper photos in low-light settings. The sensor on the Lumia 1020 is larger than what's found in other smartphones, but smaller than compact cameras. Beneath the 41-megapixel number is some impressive proprietary technology, called oversampling, that combines data from a cluster of pixels for a single, more accurate final picture. The end result, typically a 5-megapixel image, benefits from improved zooming capabilities and better low-light performance, but the images are far from DSLR-quality. So is all this technology the start of a new battle over megapixels, this time between smartphone companies? Maybe not, says Seattle photographer and camera-phone evangelist Chase Jarvis. ""The idea of continuing to pack more and more megapixels into (phone cameras) will have diminishing returns,"" said Jarvis, who recognized the potential of smartphone photgraphy early on, writing a book and app around the idea that the best camera is the one that's with you. ""The megapixel wars are by and large moot."" The benefit of high-resolution photos from phones is limited. People who primarily upload their images to social media sites are already compressing their images, and their friends and family are increasingly viewing them on small smartphone screens. It's even possible make a decent 8-by-10 inch print from an iPhone photo. To upload pictures over Wi-Fi and cellular networks, the image file needs to be a workable size. There are also memory limitations on smartphones, where apps, songs and videos are already competing for limited space. Jarvis believes there are still plenty of other areas where smartphone cameras can improve. He cites better low-light performance, increased dynamic range (producing sharper contrast between an image's shades and colors), and external features like better flashes and lenses. Phone makers are moving fast to put the best features of compact cameras into smartphones. But the same is not yet true for camera companies. Traditional camera manufacturers have been slow to integrate connectivity features and app ecosystems into their devices, which would require entering a strange new world of relationships with wireless carriers. Samsung has started releasing cameras that run Google's Android operating system, but for most manufacturers, true integration is still a long ways off. Smartphones have another advantage in the battle to be your primary camera: a surplus of sensors tracking things like location and movement. ""What we're going to see accelerating dramatically is the contextualization of photography,"" said Jarvis. The additional metadata collected by the various sensors inside smartphones -- not just size and sharpness -- are what will add value to photos in the future, he said. Jarvis predicts being able to sort your past images based on such factors as your heart rate or how fast you were moving when they were taken. With big data, people will be able to make more sense and add context to all photos uploaded publicly. Imagine seeing what colors are trending in photos around the world in real time. If this is the future of amateur photography, smartphones already have the platform, the connections and the sensors in place. ""Images are not about dynamic range and megapixels, they're about stories and about moments,"" said Jarvis. Sensors, not megapixels, will help tell those stories.","Nokia's new Lumia 1020 smartphone will feature a 41-megapixel camera .
Smartphones have advantage over cameras because they allow instant sharing .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Coalition forces in Baghdad have killed the man believed to be the mastermind of recent bombings in the Iraqi capital, the U.S. military said. Mahir Ahmad Mahmud Judu al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Rami and Abu Assad, was believed to be the leader of one of al Qaeda in Iraq's Baghdad networks, the military said in a statement issued Friday. The military said intelligence reports led coalition forces to a building in Baghdad's Adhamiya neighborhood Friday. They surrounded the building and called on the occupants to surrender but were engaged by small arms fire, the military said. The forces returned fire and killed two people, Abu Rami and a female, the military said. ""Sadly, here again is a case where [al Qaeda in Iraq] has put innocent lives in danger in order to protect themselves and shield their terrorist efforts,"" said Rear Adm. Patrick Driscoll, a spokesman for the Multi-National Force in Iraq. Coalition forces had evacuated several children from the building before they detonated ordnance inside, the military said. The house caught fire, the military said, and the local fire department was called in for assistance. The U.S. military blames Abu Rami for masterminding numerous car bombings, including an October 2 suicide car bombing that killed eight people and wounded more than 30. The attack happened outside a Shiite mosque in Baghdad just as worshippers left early-morning prayers marking the end of Ramadan. Among the victims of that attack were several Iraqi soldiers who were part of an army patrol providing security for worshippers, Iraqi and U.S. officials said. Abu Rami was also responsible for numerous car bombings and mortar attacks in Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood in 2006 and 2007, including a car bombing in November 2006 that killed more than 200 people, the military said. That attack, which targeted Shiites, was one of the worst attacks in Iraq since the war began in 2003. Abu Rami was also believed to be a planner and participant in kidnappings and videotaped executions, the military said. A video from June 2006 shows Abu Rami shooting one of four Russian diplomats. The diplomats were taken hostage weeks before an al Qaeda-linked group said it had beheaded three of them and shot the fourth to death. Abu Rami also is said to have ordered and directed a car bombing May 1 that killed eight Iraqis and a U.S. soldier, the military said. Abu Rami was originally a member of the terrorist group Ansar al-Islam and joined al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004, the military said. He became the military ""emir"" of Baghdad's Rusafa district last year before taking over all terrorist operations there, the military said. Meanwhile Saturday, Poland ended its military presence in Iraq with a ceremony for its approximately 900 troops at Camp Echo in Qadasiyah Province. ""We can say the goals of the mission have been largely accomplished. Over the past five years, we have fulfilled our commitment,"" Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich said, according to a news release issued by coalition forces. The Polish army commanded Multi-National Division - Center South, which operated throughout Qadasiyah Province. Polish forces completed 10 rotations in Iraq, which ended October 1, and commanded 10 national contingents, including Armenia, Latvia, Mongolia, Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina. ""You came not to conquer but to liberate. You sought not personal gain but liberty, and you build not an empire but a sovereign nation. You created hope where terror reigned, and you have made history,"" said Gen. Ray Odierno, commander of Multi-National Force - Iraq. The operating area was transferred to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. Also Saturday, Deputy U.S. Secretary of State John Negroponte met with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani at his residence in northern Iraq, about 100 kilometers west of Kirkuk. The meeting focused on the ""strategic framework"" between Iraq and the United States to safeguard the Iraq's independence, Talabani said in a statement Saturday. ""During the meeting everyone discussed the political, economic and security issues and both sides addressed the most important developments related to the political process, national reconciliation and the aimed efforts to the success of this process from all aspects and at all levels,"" Talabani said. Earlier, Negroponte met with Arab representatives in Kirkuk to discuss a Kurdish-Arab dispute over the city's ethnic tensions. The Kurds want to incorporate oil-rich Kirkuk into their semiautonomous region. His visit comes at a time of growing tensions between the central government of Nuri al-Maliki and the Kurdistan Regional Government in the country's autonomous northern region. In August, Iraqi forces entered Khanaqin, a territory disputed between Arabs and Kurds that is secured by the Kurdish peshmerga forces. The crisis was resolved on a political level, but tensions remain high in the area and relations between the Shiite-dominated government and the KRG remain strained. Like Khanaqin, Kirkuk is disputed territory. Legislators overcame an impasse over a key provincial elections law last month by setting the problem of Kirkuk aside and deciding to exclude the province from a vote expected early next year.","Poland ends military presence in Iraq with ceremony Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Roy Moorfield and Lau Chi-sun are in charge of one of Cathay Pacific's most rigorous selection processes. Last week 140 candidates were brought before them and evaluated by appearance, body, character and even how bitter they are. ""Any flaws or problems here on the ground just get magnified in the air,"" said Moorfield in knowing tones. While it may sound like the way stewardesses were selected some 40 years ago, Moorfield and Lau were actually in Hong Kong to pick out new additions for the airline's wine selection. It's a job that's kept Moorfield busy for over 24 years as a consultant for the airline. ""It's a dark and lonely life,"" he quipped, ""but someone has to do it."" Each year around 3,000 glasses of wine are checked by the pair's educated palates, and through blind tastings with other connoisseurs they decide what vintages will thrive at 35,000 feet and appeal to discerning drinkers in each travel class. Tannins and bitter tones in wines are exacerbated by dry cabin air and some wines don't fare well with the vibrations from air travel and become ""bottle shocked,"" the experts say. It's often the delicate fruit tones that add a depth and richness to wines that are first to take a hit. White wines don't have such a problem, says Moorfield, and if you like the taste of a champagne on the ground it's more than likely to taste just as good in the air (regardless of how much you drink). Since reds are more delicate and sensitive to flight, Moorfield admits that the Economy Class offerings can't compare with a glass at a wine-buff's dinner party. However what those in First and Business Class are still some of the best around. Cathay's new line-up includes a selection of Grand Cru from some of the most renowned vineyards in the Saint-Emilion. Read more: How airlines stand out from the competition . The airline uncorked (or unscrewed for those in Economy) around 1.5 million bottles last year. For United, one of the world's largest airlines, that figure is more like 7 million bottles, according to the airline. As well as taking a sizable chunk of an airline's inflight catering budget, wines also contributes a large part to an airline's image, particularly among premium passengers. Wines are increasingly ""critical"" to the way an airline is perceived, believes James Ginns, Cathay Pacific's General Manger of Inflight Services. ""People expect very good wines onboard,"" he said, highlighting growing interest in wine in China and the enduring popularity of wines from France's Bordeaux region. For vineyards, being chosen as a First and Business Class selection is also good business. ""Wineries see the first class cabin as a really sexy place to be, as a place where they want their labels to be seen,"" said Doug Frost, master sommelier for United Airlines. Read more: Upcycling old aircraft . For those who don't get to taste the good stuff in the cabins at the front of the plane, Frost suggests a few tips when making a choice (if there is one) in economy cabins. ""The new world wines with their jammier fruits show a little bit better than older world wines, but that's painting with a broad brush and ultimately it depends on personal tastes,"" he says. Moorfield echoes that, eschewing any notions of wine snobbery: ""It doesn't matter what it is; you either like it or you don't."" Cathay's cabin crew are given tasting lessons by Moorfield and Lau so they can recommend wines with particular foods served on board, but they're absolutely forbidden from sampling the wine while flying or taking any opened bottles home at the end of a flight. So what does happen to all those opened bottles when inflight service ends? Oenophiles, get ready for a different kind of ""bottle shock"". ""They get poured away,"" says Ginns. ""It's to makes sure they don't reappear on board and get served by mistake.""","Wines are affected by pressurized, drier cabin air on planes .

"Kalamata, Greece (CNN) -- Throughout its history, Greece has been conquered by the Macedonians, the Romans, Persians and, in modern times, the Ottoman Empire and Nazi Germany. But now there is a new and different battle being waged against the Greeks, and the enemy is not wielding swords or guns but the threat of bailouts and default. For many, it's a modern-day tragedy that even the Greek classical writer Euripides would have a hard time envisioning. After reading all the bad economic news coming out of Greece, it's easy to lose sight of the fact that the Greek people are still carrying on their daily lives. Greeks may be cutting back on their vacations, but the country has seen a rise in the number of tourists. The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises expects more than 10.5 million visitors this year, a 9.6% increase from 2010. On a recent trip to my mother's hometown of Kalamata, I was curious to see how this seaside city on the southern part of the Peloponnese, best known for its luscious olives and as the birthplace of the New Age performer Yanni, was faring amid the country's economic crisis. As my flight descended over Athens, I couldn't help but think that I was flying from the heels of one storm -- Hurricane Irene had just ravaged the eastern U.S coastline -- into the throes of another. The sea of white marble buildings below offered no glint of the economic tempest that has produced fear, anxiety and scores of strikes and protests throughout the country. The uneventful three-and-a-half hour bus ride to Kalamata (about $30) is expected to get shorter with a new stretch of national highway from Athens. But how quickly will the work get done in the current economic climate? Only time will answer Greece's growing list of uncertainties. As in Athens, cigarette smoke is pervasive in Kalamata, and pedestrians yield to cars, whether you like it or not. But there the similarities end. Unlike Athens, which is home to more than 3 million Greeks, the images of protests and distress are nowhere to be visibly found in this sun-drenched town of just over 100,000. Here, the city seems to embrace the energy of the sun. Young people seem to outnumber the old. The origins of the city's name remain murky, but according to relatives, it's probably derived from the Greek words ""kala ommata,"" which means ""beautiful eyes."" Kalamata is hardly a destination most tourists consider when they think of a vacation in Greece. The islands of Mykonos and Santorini are usually the headliners in that fantasy. Kalamata, the 10th largest city in Greece and the capital of Messinia, is built on the foot of the Tavgetos and near Messinia Bay. It draws mostly Greek vacationers, as it's a good home base close to other tourist sites in Messinia and ferries to some nearby islands, including the Ionian island of Kythira and Kissamos in Crete. Within an hour's car ride, you can visit the beaches Navarino or the castles and historical sites of Mystras, Olympia, Koroni, Methoni and Mani. Though Kalamata has grown dramatically since an earthquake ravaged portions of the city in 1986, some areas have a small-town feel. It's not uncommon to catch the smell of jasmine on a summer evening while walking the paths between the family-owned plots of lime, fig and orange trees. The pride and joy of many residents is owning some land -- even a small parcel -- where they can grow a variety of things including cucumbers, squash, tomatoes and herbs. Kalamata has a historical center with beautiful neoclassical houses. A 13th-century castle dominates the town and has an interesting archaeological museum and a folklore museum with relics of the War of Independence of 1821. In addition to its theaters and theatrical groups, Kalamata hosts an International Dance festival during the summer in the amphitheater of the castle. But for most people, the lure of Kalamata is the beaches, with their blue waters and free sun beds. The tranquil beaches in Kalamata are more than 6 miles long, and elderly people taking a morning swim is a familiar sight. Take a leisurely walk or bike ride along the promenade, and it's hard not to stop into one the many tavernas for a cold Mythos beer and a Mikri Pikilia: a selection of sardines, meatballs, calamari, tomatoes and cucumbers. I always have to smile when I get up from a taverna's hard straw chairs. Although patrons won't ever be rushed out by a waiter trying to turn over a table, the uncomfortable seats are more than likely to leave you with a funny walk for the first several strides. And while unemployment in Kalamata, which city officials put at 10%, is far below the national average, there's still a feeling of uncertainty in the streets. ""The mood is gloomy. Things are tough, very tough. It seems there is no hope, and there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel,"" Mayor Nikas Panagiotis said. ""Strikes happen every day; there is unemployment. But compared to Athens, things are better. Not as bad as some places in Athens, but this doesn't mean that things are easy in Kalamata. There is no work, and they don't give us any hope, and that is the worst,"" he said. Panagiotis says Kalamata's annual budget of about 100 million euros is very dependent on tourism to cover the gap with what comes from Athens, which supplies only around 65 million euros. Although Kalamata does very well with tourism -- and the new national highway will help -- high unemployment and a small but increasing number of immigrants from North African countries, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have put strains on social services, the mayor said. Hotel owner Nikos Haikos, 35, whose establishment bears the family name and is situated across the street from the beach, says business has been mixed this year. ""This year we did not have a very good season in the beginning. June did not go as we preferred."" The hotel had a good May, July and August, but that success came with sacrifice. ""We lowered the price in the high season to keep the hotel full,"" Haikos said. The rooms, which normally go for 100 euros in the high season, were lowered to 70 euros this year. With the economy in shambles and the government reducing benefits and cuts to pensions, that's less money for Greeks to spend on holidays, Haikos said. So he's planning to adapt to the circumstances and begin making arrangements with the hotel site Booking.com. ""Good companies, if they manage, will survive. If you give good quality, with inexpensive rents, you will have tourists and still be able to pay off the expenses, and you will continue to live,"" Haikos said. Penny Manis contributed to this report.","Traveler was curious to see whether economic crisis had reached the town .

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela is now in critical condition, officials said. Mandela's condition worsened in the past 24 hours, the South African president's office said, citing Mandela's medical team. He has been hospitalized in Pretoria since June 8 for a recurring lung infection. Previously, authorities had described his condition as serious but stable. ""The doctors are doing everything possible to get his condition to improve and are ensuring that Madiba is well-looked after and is comfortable. He is in good hands,"" President Jacob Zuma said in a written statement, referring to Mandela's tribal name. Mandela, 94, has become increasingly frail over the years and has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010. 'I believe he is at peace,' Nelson Mandela's daughter says . The anti-apartheid hero has been in and out of the hospital in recent years. His history of lung problems dates to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during the apartheid era, and he has battled respiratory infections. Considered the founding father of South Africa's democracy, Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. South Africa's governing African National Congress noted ""with concern"" Sunday the change in Mandela's health. ""The African National Congress joins the presidency in calling upon all of us to keep President Mandela, his family and his medical team in our thoughts and prayers during this trying time,"" it said. In 1993, Mandela and then-South African President F.W. de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize. The iconic leader was elected the nation's first black president a year later, serving only one term, as he had promised. Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he remains popular and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Last year, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front. Mandela's impact extends far beyond South African borders. After he left office, he mediated conflicts in Africa and the Middle East. Word of his worsening health drew global expressions of concern. ""We have seen the latest reports from the South African government that former President Mandela is in critical condition,"" Caitlin Hayden, a U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Here comes the Moto X. If you haven't heard about it already, you will. It's the first smartphone produced by Motorola Mobility under the company's new Google overlords. It claims to be the first smartphone made in the United States. And it comes buoyed by a wave of hype, a fat marketing budget, and no shortage of new leaks threatening to out the device before its official debut as early as next month. Tech bloggers even took note last week when a leaked photo showed Google Chairman Eric Schmidt chatting on what appeared to be a white Moto X. Taken together, the leaks depict a phone that's less about the hardware specifications and more about clever uses of sensors, customized features and hands-free voice commands. A new marketing video from Canadian carrier Rogers was leaked to the Internet last week -- it's since been taken down by YouTube -- and showed some of the phone's unique features. You can activate the voice controls by saying ""OK Google"" out loud, then ask for directions or give it other commands. It's similar to Apple's Siri voice-assistant feature or Google's existing Google voice commands, except that you don't need to press a button to activate it. Active updates will push notifications to the phone based on your needs, location or time. Dennis Woodside, CEO of Motorola Mobility, said recently that sensors in the phone will anticipate users' needs -- for example, letting it know when it's being pulled out of someone's pocket. Finally, a twist of the wrist will trigger the Moto X's camera -- another feature for people who hate applying pressure to buttons in order to turn things on. ABC News has reported that customers will be able to customize their Moto X phone in advance by choosing colors for the back and trim, adding engraving and uploading a photo so that the wallpaper is already personalized when the device arrives. Great features, or just gimmicks? So will all these bells and whistles be enough to set the Moto X apart from other smartphones? So far, analysts aren't convinced. ""I don't really think that there's anything I've seen so far that will really get the consumer crazy,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. ""A lot of the things you see are more gimmicks."" The leaked features aren't entirely new, either. The active updates seem like an expansion of the Google Now predictive search tool. Currently available on Android and iOS, it combines location and time information with data pulled from your search history, Gmail account, and calendar to show information that's relevant right then and there. For example, your boarding pass will be displayed when you're at the airport. As for hands-free voice controls, Google previewed this feature at its Google I/O developer conference in May, comparing it to the voice-activated computer on Star Trek. To become must-have tools for consumers, these features must work extremely well lest they become more of an annoyance. If users like them, hands-free voice commands, active alerts and the camera shortcut could theoretically be rolled out in future updates to the Android mobile operating system. Then they would work on other phones that also have the right sensors, stealing the Moto X's thunder. Smartphones are constantly one-upping each other with incremental improvements -- higher-resolution screens, faster processors, pretty colors -- but experts say real innovation is stagnating. One of the few radically different features to hit the market of late is the 41-megapixel camera inside Nokia's Lumia 1020 smartphone. Smartphone consumers are still waiting for hardware improvements such as significantly longer battery life (not just ""it can last all day!""), wireless charging or durable, droppable bodies. Moto marketing . If these new features aren't enough to make consumers flock to the Moto X, the pricy marketing blitz Google has planned might do the trick. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google will launch a $500 million international marketing campaign for the device. The company will likely emphasize that the Moto X will be assembled at a new smartphone manufacturing plant in Texas. Motorola's news followed similar announcements by Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which is building a manufacturing plant in North Carolina, and Apple, which has said it will begin manufacturing a Mac computer in the U.S. this year. ""It seems to be a trend but at the end of the day, consumers don't care as much (about where a phone is made),"" said Milanesi. ""What's going to be more important is the price and what the product is going to do."" Google completed its purchase of the Chicago-based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2012. The deal was done primarily to flesh out Google's patent portfolio with Motorola's 17,000 patents. But there was always the exciting potential for a smartphone partnership between the two tech giants. Google makes the Android mobile operating system, Motorola Mobility makes handsets. In the flip-phone days of the early- to mid-2000s, Motorola was a leading phone maker with such models as its popular Razr. Google released its flagship Nexus 4 smartphone earlier this year, which is manufactured by South Korean company LG. It's possible that Motorola could take over the manufacturing of the Nexus devices in the future. The Motorola name had a lot of cachet a decade or two ago, but it's not clear whether that's enough to inspire brand loyalty from today's users. Many consumers may have forgotten about them. Either way, we'll find out soon.","A recently leaked video shows some of the Moto X's big features .

"(CNN) -- Coast Guard aircraft have found no sign of a spill from a Royal Dutch Shell oil drilling barge that ran aground off a southern Alaska island during a fierce winter storm, authorities reported Tuesday. The 266-foot Kulluk ""is sound. There is no sign of a breach of the hull. There is no sign of a release of any product,"" Coast Guard Capt. Paul Mehler III told reporters Tuesday afternoon. Mehler said the Kulluk had about 143,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 12,000 gallons of combined lube oil and hydraulic fluid on board. The rig -- a key part in Shell's controversial Arctic oil exploration project -- ran aground off uninhabited Sitkalidak Island, about 200 miles south of Anchorage, on Monday night. The Kulluk had been working in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska's North Slope, until October. It was being towed back to its winter home in Seattle when it ran into a severe storm off the Alaskan coast. The Coast Guard evacuated its 18-man crew Saturday night, and it drifted for 10 hours on Sunday after the tug that was towing it lost power. Monday night, tug crews had to cut the rig loose during a storm that whipped up 24-foot waves, leading to its grounding. Crews battle harsh weather trying to tow drilling unit to Alaska harbor . Sean Churchfield, Shell's Alaska operations manager, said Tuesday that the rig ""is upright, rocking with a slow motion, and is stable"" -- but he added, ""There is still a lot of work to be done to bring this to a safe conclusion."" Three people suffered minor injuries over the past few days, but have already returned to work, Churchfield said. The rig was aground in an area of Ocean Bay, where water depth is 32 feet to 48 feet. A joint command has been set up to handle salvage efforts, but ongoing bad weather has kept crews from getting aboard the vessel, Mehler said. Weather conditions were expected to improve through the rest of the week, with seas subsiding from 24 feet Tuesday to 11 feet by Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Most of the nearby shore is owned by a native Alaskan corporation on adjacent Kodiak Island, said Steven Russell, of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation. State officials are working with residents to watch out for any environmental damage from the grounding, he said. As of Tuesday, ""we have no indications of environmental or wildlife impact,"" Russell said. Shell's Arctic exploration plans caused widespread concern among environmentalists and were held up after BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Eskimo activist Caroline Cannon, one of Shell's toughest critics, said she fears a spill from the Kulluk could harm fish and wildlife in the area. Shell rig accident off Alaska shows dangers of drilling in Arctic . ""It's a scary thought you know, because our food chain is out there. Our people rely on our food,"" she said. Shell says it's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the BP well that erupted off Louisiana, killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap. The fuel on board the rig is used to power equipment and is not the result of the drilling operations Shell conducted off the North Slope, on the opposite side of the vast state from where the Kulluk now rests. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling. And the shrinking of the region's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region. Climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels. The science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","NEW: Alaska official says the state is looking for signs of environmental damage .

"(CNN) -- Croatia formally became the newest member of the European Union on Monday, marking an end to a 10-year campaign for a Balkan state that emerged from the ruins of a bloody civil war. The celebrations began as the clock struck midnight Sunday. Fireworks lit the sky in the capital Zagreb, a choir sang ""Ode to Joy"" and thousands clinked champagne glasses and erupted in cheers. ""Welcome to your union, welcome to our union,"" EU President Herman Van Rompuy told the crowd. The nation of 4.4 million people is the 28th member of the EU, and the second Balkan country that rose out of the ashes of Yugoslavia to join the union. Slovenia became a member in 2004. ""Whatever anyone is saying about us, you should know we are a country of rational people who are realistic about themselves and their country, and the role of their country in Europe and the world,"" Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic told the crowd. Croatia looks to oil and gas fields in Adriatic Sea . Many challenges . With a low credit rating of junk and a political class stained by accusations of endemic corruption, Croatia's challenges are unlikely to disappear overnight. It is three years into a debt crisis that is plaguing countries across southern Europe. One of the challenges facing Croatia is its growth prospects. The financial crash of 2008 brought about a harsh double-dip recession that left the country's economy lingering in the doldrums. Last year, unemployment peaked at 17.3% which is behind only Greece and Spain, according to Eurostat - the European Commission's data archive. ""The EU will not be a panacea for Croatia's economy,"" Will Bartlett, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics, told CNN in January. Fighting corruption . Croatia is also in the midst of cleaning up a political class that is rife with corruption. Since the country's inception in the early 1990s, it has struggled to choke off profiteering from those in positions of power. Transparency International - an organization tackling corruption -- ranked Croatia below Rwanda, Jordan and Cuba in its Corruption Perceptions Index for 2012. But the country still came in above Italy - Europe's third largest economy. ""The country's evolution has been very slow since 1990,"" said Zorislav Petrovic, head of Transparency Internernational in Croatia. But the current government - led by Milanovic - is taking steps to clean up the country's act under close supervision from the European Union. In November, the country's former Prime Minister, Ivo Sanader, was jailed for 10 years after being found guilty of taking pay-offs from foreign companies. Sanader - who was premier from 2004 to 2009 - had fled the country but was arrested in Austria. Kristof Bender, deputy chairman of the policy institute, European Stability Initiative, says Croatia's progress to the ""doorstep of the European Union"" is quite remarkable. ""We mustn't forget how bad it was in the 1990s,"" Bender said. ""The darkest moments of war, occupation, mass killings, ethnic cleansing, and autocratic leadership and crony capitalism were all there."" European Union, Turkey avoid rupture in relations .","""Welcome to our union,"" EU president says .

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. military aircraft jettisoned four bombs near the Great Barrier Reef off the Australian coast last week, the U.S. Navy says. Now, the Navy is looking at how it can get the bombs out, a U.S. Navy official who declined to be identified told CNN. The two Marine planes abandoned the bombs Tuesday in the national park containing the natural wonder because they were running out of fuel and could not land with the amount of ordnance on board, the Navy said. The two Marine aircraft were launched from a Navy ship, the USS Bonhomme Richard. Two of the projectiles were explosive bombs that were disarmed before they were dropped. They did not explode, the Navy said. The other two were inert, or non-explosive bombs, the Navy said. ""The jettison box was selected in a deep channel away from the reef to minimize the possibility of reef damage. However the inert and unexploded ordnance is inside the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area,"" the Navy official said. ""The Navy knows full well how environmentally sensitive the Great Barrier Reef is, and will do everything to make this right."" The pilots chose an area away from the reefs, which contain 400 types of coral. The area was also deep enough to prevent passing ships from running into the bombs, the Navy said. The reef is home to 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 kinds of mollusks, according to the United Nations' World Heritage Convention. It is also a habitat for animals threatened by extinction and is protected as a World Heritage Site. U.S. minesweeper lifted from reef . Reports of the incident drew swift condemnation from one Australian lawmaker, who told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the situation was ""outrageous."" ""I think it's outrageous that we're letting the U.S. military drop bombs on the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef,"" said Greens Sen.

"(CNN) -- A man has admitted he killed his uncle's 6-year-old stepdaughter, whose body was found in a Louisiana trash can this week, a spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. Matthew Flugence admitted to detectives Wednesday morning that he stabbed Ahlittia North, a girl he previously babysat, over the weekend, Col. John Fortunato said. Flugence, 20, was arrested in the case on Tuesday, the day authorities found Ahlittia's body in a trash can down the street from her mother and stepfather's apartment in the New Orleans suburb of Harvey. Flugence, who had an outstanding warrant charging him with sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl last year, has been charged with murder in Ahlittia's death, Fortunato said. ""I don't know what I else I can say about the character of an individual that just admitted to killing a 6-year-old,"" Sheriff Newell Normand told reporters Wednesday morning when asked about Flugence's background. ""I think that speaks for itself."" Flugence's brother Russell, 21, was arrested on suspicion of obstructing justice in Ahlittia's death, Normand said earlier this week. Russell Flugence had information about the crime that he didn't come forward with, and he also had information implicating his brother, the sheriff asserted. Matthew Flugence told investigators that he killed Ahlittia after finding her early Saturday outside the Harvey apartment where her mother and her stepfather -- Flugence's uncle -- lived, Normand said Wednesday. ""(Flugence's) story is (that) in the early morning hours ... he happened to see her out and about, and he was out and about, walking through the neighborhood,"" Normand said. The investigation began after Ahlittia's mother awoke Saturday to find her gone from the apartment, authorities said. The girl was living with her mother for the summer, but normally lived with someone else in Donaldsonville, about 60 miles to the west, Normand said. After she was reported missing, investigators spent Saturday combing the neighborhood, looking in alleys, Dumpsters and boarded-up fourplexes. They found a pool of blood in one of the buildings, Normand said, and when DNA results came back Monday evening showing the blood belonged to Ahlittia, investigators searched the area again. That's when they found the girl's body in a garbage can, wrapped in a blanket from her house and covered in a garbage bag, Normand said. Investigators looked at the garbage can during their first search of the neighborhood, so they know the body was put inside sometime after Saturday, he said. Flugence told detectives Wednesday that he killed Ahlittia on Saturday with a knife that investigators found on him when he was arrested, Normand said. Flugence was arrested Tuesday after people told authorities that he was walking along a road in nearby Westwego, asking for money and telling them he was on the run from police, officials said. Ahlittia suffered four stab wounds -- two to her neck, likely the fatal wounds, and two to the abdomen, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said. She also had bruises to the front and back of her head, shoulder, lower back, and lower extremities. Cvitanovich said were no obvious signs during an autopsy of sexual assault. When asked Wednesday whether it was hard to believe that Flugence's relatives didn't know about the sexual assault warrant, Normand said: ""No."" ""A lot of that information came about during the course of this investigation"" into Ahlittia's death, he said. CNN's Melissa Gray and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Matthew Flugence, 20, admitted stabbing 6-year-old Ahlittia North, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- As far as we know, there are no Saturnians on Saturn. There are no sirens on Titan nor large, monolithic stargates floating just outside Iapetus. And even if there were, they couldn't see us. Not in much detail, anyway. We're more than a billion kilometers away. But we're going to wave and smile at them anyway. At least, that's the plan hatched by NASA and ""The Day the Earth Smiled,"" organized by Cassini Imaging Team Leader Carolyn Porco. On Friday, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft -- serving humanity since 1997 and in orbit around the ringed giant since 2004 -- will take pictures of Saturn and its rings during a solar eclipse. Included in the images, though just the barest dot, will be our Big Blue Marble. Porco has high hopes for the extraterrestrial picture-taking, which will occur from 21:27 to 21:42 UTC. (That's 5:27 p.m. to 5:42 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time in the United States, subtracting an hour for each time zone to the west.) ""I hope, at the appropriate time, that you stop what you're doing, go outside, gather together with friends and family ... and marvel at your own existence and that of all life on planet Earth,"" she writes on her website. ""Then, by all means, rejoice!"" NASA has a catchier name for the image shoot. The agency is calling it ""The First Interplanetary Photobomb."" The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is asking viewers to ""wave at Saturn."" Hubble telescope spots blue planet where it rains glass . Is there an astronomical point to such celebrating? Well, NASA points out, it's not like Earth is often photographed from the far reaches of outer space. ""Opportunities to image Earth from the outer solar system are rare,"" the agency says in its ""Photobomb"" press release. ""Since the Space Age began, there have been only two images of Earth from the outer solar system."" The space agency is going to snap images from the other side of the solar system as well. NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft is in orbit around Mercury, and staffers ""realized Earth is coincidentally expected to appear in some images taken in a search for natural satellites around Mercury on July 19 and 20,"" NASA and JPL said in a press release. So MESSENGER will take photos at 7:49 a.m., 8:38 a.m. and 9:41 a.m. EDT (11:49, 12:38 and 13:41 UTC) on both days, NASA and JPL said. (Yeah, the Friday opportunity is gone, but you still have Saturday for the salute to Mercury.) The release said that NASA was inspired, in part, by the Cassini team. And maybe the ultimate point of all this should be more existential, anyway. On Saturday, we'll celebrate the 44th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's stroll on the moon's surface is still considered one of the most amazing achievements in human history. As The Onion famously once said in a headline, ""Holy S***, Man Walks on F****** Moon."" We haven't been back to the moon since 1972, but the steady stream of space images from NASA and others still has the ability to make us contemplate the sheer wonder of it all. So, what can it hurt? Take a few minutes and smile and wave for Earth. You never know who might be watching.

"(CNN) -- I had many conversations with Nelson Mandela, although I had not met him. In my family's tiny shack in Nairobi's Kibera slum, my one-way exchanges with the great man kept me going. Mandela survived 27 years of prison; maybe I would make it out, too. Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, when I was 10 years old. In Kibera, people celebrated and talk circulated the streets about this man, but I didn't see how his story connected to mine until much later. I was struggling too hard simply to survive. At 10, I was on and off the streets. I flitted from house to house, unable to live at home with my mother because my stepfather had threatened to kill us both if I tried to come home. I knew I was born poor, and believed I was fated to die poor. This was my prison. I needed a role model, but in Kibera, these were in short supply. At 16, I felt the pressure from gangs and drugs -- while fighting the temptation to drink my misery away and to find temporary comfort with women, like I saw my friends do. Opinion: A white South African's memories of Mandela . Even as the shadow of AIDS spread, I saw no reason not to die young, because I had nothing to live for. Our lives in the slums seemed to take a friend every day. Police shot my friend Boi; they thought he looked like a criminal. My childhood friend Calvin hanged himself. His suicide note said what I felt: ""I just can't take it anymore."" Both of my sisters were raped and impregnated as teenagers. People seemed to fade and disappear. To live was the exception. I am now 29, and all but two of my closest childhood friends are dead. It was Mandela who saved my life. A visiting American gave me two books. I had never gone to formal schools, but I had learned to read and write with the help of a kind priest. The American gave me a collection of speeches by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mandela's ""Long Walk to Freedom."" It was Mandela's book that spoke to me. I couldn't put it down. Here was someone whose life I could somehow picture. For the first time in my life I saw I had a choice. I could either submit to the degradations of poverty, to the prevailing hopelessness, or I could start my own long walk. I started small, using 20 cents from my pay at a factory job to buy a soccer ball. I organized young people to work together in an organization that has grown to include a school for girls, a health clinic and a community services project. This year we will serve 50,000 people. Yet as I look at the larger structural problems of urban poverty in my country, I feel my work has just begun. Despite my doubts and concerns, I would begin and end every day with a private conversation with Mandela. I'd ask him what he'd do when his problems seemed insurmountable. I shared with him my triumphs, and I read every speech of his I could find. But as I grew older I began to wonder about the power and perils of being a living hero. Mandela was, for me and for my continent, more than a person. He is the emblem of progress. He came through poverty and struggle yet did not allow it to embitter him. Instead he seemed emboldened by a sense of urgency. Why Mandela has six names . My fear is that we become too comfortable with his legacy -- content with honoring what Mandela has stood for that we forget to carry forward his sense of urgency. The journey to freedom in my country, Kenya, and in Mandela's own country, South Africa, is far from over. On a recent visit to Johannesburg, I spoke for an hour with three young men about the crushing challenges of their lives in one of South Africa's burgeoning slums. They are not alone. Mandela accomplished so much, but worldwide an ever-growing gap between rich and poor and mounting inequality threatens all for which he fought. I will still talk to Mandela, and will wonder what he might do. How he might have organized another movement to take Africa forward. These are conversations we must all begin to have. We have lost him, and must recognize the need for a next generation of selfless and driven leaders. For me, Mandela's example will always stand as a reminder of what is possible when conviction faces injustice, of the work that still remains unfinished, and of the long road ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kennedy Odede.","At 10, Kennedy Odede was on and off the streets in a sprawling Nairobi, Kenya, slum .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Gaming has become an important part of Comic-Con International, the annual gathering that brings 150,000 attendees to San Diego for a celebration of comics, movies, television and pop culture. Game publishers and developers are offering exclusive hands-on opportunities to fans, including the chance to demo upcoming games on next-generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft. Sony has a booth inside the mammoth San Diego Convention Center where gamers can play games like ""Driveclub,"" ""Knack"" and ""Octodad: Dadliest Catch"" on its forthcoming PlayStation 4. Microsoft has set up shop inside the Hard Rock Hotel across the street, where Xbox One games like ""Ryse: Son of Rome,"" ""FORZA Motorsport 5"" and ""Project Spark"" are on display. Perhaps the most interesting place to play a next-gen game here is on board the 1863 windjammer Star of India, which is docked behind the Convention Center at the Fifth Avenue Landing. Players can control the virtual Jackdaw pirate ship in Ubisoft's much-anticipated ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"" game, which ships October 30. Game publishers also are setting up free arcades throughout the neighboring Gaslamp District for the hordes of fans who don't have a convention badge. Sega's Pop-Up Arcade is offering the first public hands-on with the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS game ""Sonic Lost World,"" along with other titles. Inside PetCo Park, home to baseball's San Diego Padres, Nerd HQ has an arcade filled with old-school coin games like ""Donkey Kong"" and ""Centipede"" alongside the latest Xbox 360 games from Microsoft. It even has the new Kickstarter virtual reality setup, Virtuix Omni, with Oculus Rift 3D head-tracking goggles for a full immersive experience. Also inside the ballpark is the second variation of Ruckus Sports' ""The Walking Dead Escape,"" which allows fans of the AMC TV show to experience the undead live. The spectator option includes The Walking Dead Fan Festival, featuring ""The Walking Dead"" video games from Telltale Studios, including the new PS Vita version of the game. Outside the stadium, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment is promoting its 2014 open-world combat game, ""Mad Max,"" by offering fans photo ops with a replica of the Road Warrior's car. The game is being developed by Avalanche Studios and will serve as a standalone story in the movies' fictional universe. For attendees who do have those coveted badges, gaming also has been incorporated into convention panels. ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are in town to talk about their collaboration with developer Oblivion on the role-playing game ""South Park: The Stick of Truth."" And fans will learn what's next for the groundbreaking hit ""Defiance"" at a panel with creators and actors from the hit TV show plus game developers who have launched a massively multiplayer online (MMO) action game set in the same universe. Here are five promising games from San Diego Comic-Con. ""Batman: Arkham Origins"" (Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment; October 25; Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, Wii U) With WB Games Montreal taking over this popular franchise, gamers will take control of the Dark Knight very early on in the Batman mythology. This prequel, which is set on Christmas Eve in a snow-swept Gotham City, has the Black Mask putting a hit on Batman. Gamers must use all of Bruce Wayne's resources as they contend with eight criminal masterminds, including the Penguin, Deathstroke, Deadshot and the Joker, along with their assorted thugs. This Batman is aggressive and athletic, and he has a few new toys like the Batwing and the remote claw, which allows him to target multiple enemies in one swoop. Players will also explore new areas from the comic book mythology like Amusement Mile, Old Gotham and the city's docks. Much like Christopher Nolan's films, the ""Arkham"" franchise has excelled at bringing a fresh take to the Caped Crusader, and this third game is shaping up as another crossover hit. ""Dead Rising 3"" (Capcom; November; Xbox One) It wouldn't be Comic-Con without zombies. This latest game from Capcom Vancouver may be set 10 years after the events of ""Dead Rising 2,"" but everything about this next-generation horror game is different -- beginning with the horror. The humorous tone of previous iterations is taking a back seat to real scares in this open world game. These zombies are frightening and a lot tougher to deal with. The city of Los Perdidos offers plenty of challenges (it's so large, you can actually fit the first two game worlds inside it), since it's been overrun by the undead. It's a huge seamless playground that's completely destructible. Vehicles, including a hearse, are at your disposal as transportation and another weapon against zombies. Players take control of mechanic Nick Ramos, who has the ability to build some very cool customized weapons. The game also utilizes Kinect voice, allowing players to distract zombies with voice commands. And the Xbox SmartGlass opens up exclusive missions and second-screen functionality for what looks like a bloody good time. Share your mini-interviews from Comic-Con . ""Octodad: Dadliest Catch"" (Young Horses; 2014; PlayStation 4, PC) Sony has embraced independent developers with its PS4 console and invited them onstage during its E3 news conference last month. One of those featured games comes from the Chicago-based Young Horses, and it's unlike any next-generation game out there. Players take control of an orange octopus somehow passing as a human by wearing a blue suit. The challenge is in accomplishing mundane tasks like shopping at a grocery store or cooking on a grill while controlling your tentacles to walk and pick things up. Those suction cups quickly get in the way, however. The objective is to remain unnoticed by the humans (who don't seem to mind an octopus until he starts flinging plates across the room by accident). The challenges get progressively more difficult, as players must navigate a wedding ceremony without tripping on banana peels or knocking over the priceless vases that line the aisle. This game offers plenty to laugh at and requires a lot of skill to complete. ""Total War: Rome II"" (Sega/The Collective Assembly; September 3; PC) In this real-time strategy game, players must assume control of a powerful ruler from the earliest days of the Roman republic with the goal of conquering the world. This sequel to the popular PC game returns us to the rich history of ancient Rome and incorporates everything from epic battles featuring hundreds of soldiers, horses, catapults and African war elephants to the political intrigue of diplomacy and nation-building. Players can zoom in to the battles as soldiers slice and dice their way through enemy lines. The game also allows naval battles, meaning warships can destroy enemy vessels, and sailors can board and fight the survivors. Even novices can command huge battlefields, moving from skirmish to skirmish with the click of a mouse. If you have a higher-end PC, the developers have brought every detail, from the weapons to the landscapes, to life in high-definition glory. History has never been so much fun. ""Watch Dogs"" (Ubisoft; November 19; Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, Wii U, Xbox One, PlayStation 4) Ubisoft is introducing a massive open-world game that recreates the city of Chicago and allows players to control every camera, traffic light and El train within it. Playing as Aiden Pierce, a hacker with a smartphone that connects to Chicago's central operation system, players can access every element of the city's infrastructure and learn about every citizen who surrounds them. All of this power creates superhero-like capabilities through technology. Players must decide how to use this power and gauge their own morality level by choosing to help crime victims or aid the bad guys. Every action will have repercussions, as the police and even citizens will get involved. The game utilizes Xbox SmartGlass, allowing a second player to either help or hinder Pierce as he explores this world.","Developers are offering hands-on opportunities at San Diego Comic-Con .

"(CNN) -- Public transit in San Francisco came to a screeching halt Monday morning as Bay Area Rapid Transit unions went on strike. The strike began at midnight (3 a.m. ET) Monday after union leaders walked out of last-minute pay negotiations with BART, hours before their four-year contract was set to expire. About 400,000 commuters use BART every day in the San Francisco Bay area, BART spokesman Rick Rice said. ""The public doesn't deserve to be punished,"" Rice said. ""We are sorry they have decided to strike despite the fact we are willing to negotiate. The district is prepared to return to talks and get this finished."" Josie Mooney, spokeswoman for SEIU Local 1021, also lamented the impact on the community. ""A strike is always the last resort, and we have done everything in our power to avoid it. Unfortunately, BART seems intent on forcing a strike,"" Mooney said in a statement. ""We are disappointed that BART's failure to bargain honestly and fairly means that hundreds of thousands of Bay Area commuters have to suffer."" At odds . The dispute centers around pay and benefits. ""They've asked for (a) 21% pay increase,"" Rice said. ""We've gone from offering 4% over four years to 8% over four years."" Rice also said BART also offered to reduce the amount of employee contributions originally requested for pension and medical benefits. But local SEIU union President Roxanne Sanchez said workers are fed up. ""Years of layoffs have affected public safety and services. Crippling cuts have not just made our jobs more difficult, but put undue strain on our livelihoods, our families and our communities,"" she said in a statement. ""Believing in good jobs that pay fair wages, offer health care and a secure retirement â€” these are modest ideals. These are UNION ideals.""

"Moscow (CNN) -- Fugitive American intelligence leaker Edward Snowden is likely to leave the transit zone in Moscow's airport, where he's been holed up for weeks, ""in the next few days,"" his lawyer said Wednesday. Snowden applied for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday from Sheremetyevo International Airport. He ""will leave (the airport) in the next few days because some legal papers are still required to be formalized,"" Russian attorney Anatoly Kucherena said in Moscow. Read more: Snowden's transit zone mysteries . ""Therefore, I think this issue will be resolved within a week and after this, the question of granting him temporary asylum will be decided upon."" A former National Security Agency contractor, Snowden admittedly leaked documents to the media that exposed sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs. He faces espionage charges. Kucharena, who helped Snowden file his application for asylum, said his client might be able to leave the airport while the request is considered. Interactive: Snowden's options . Within a few days, Snowden should receive a certificate showing that the asylum request is under consideration, and that certificate will allow him to legally leave the airport's transit area, the attorney said. It's not clear whether Russia will decide to grant temporary asylum. Snowden has said he wants to stay while awaiting passage to Latin America. President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Snowden appeared to be ""shifting his position somewhat"" when it comes to meeting Russia's conditions for asylum, according to state news agency Ria Novosti. He had earlier said that Snowden would have to ""stop his work aimed at harming our American partners"" if he wanted to stay. The Guardian journalist who broke the Snowden story and a spokesman for WikiLeaks have both indicated that Snowden could reveal more secrets. On Wednesday, Putin told reporters in Moscow that ties between the United States and Russia ""are far more important"" than any intelligence scandal. The Russian leader said that he believes that Snowden ""never intended to stay here, in Russia, forever."" Snowden arrived in Moscow from Hong Kong on June 23. He has been unable to leave because the United States revoked his passport. The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give Snowden asylum, and Nicaragua's president said he would offer it ""if circumstances permit."" UK intelligence agency did not break law, post-Snowden inquiry finds . Snowden appears likely to try to avoid the chance of U.S. capture even if Russia grants him papers to leave. Washington has no extradition agreement with Russia and FBI agents who work at the American Embassy have no authority to make arrests. The U.S. government has requested Russia expel Snowden. Absent that, it will watch carefully the route he takes if he tries to reach one of the Latin American countries willing to take him in. The United States could grab Snowden if any plane carrying him were to refuel in a country that respects U.S. arrest warrants. But he likely will be careful to avoid that scenario. Nevertheless, the United States has sent provisional arrest warrants to a number of countries where Snowden could either transit or seek asylum, a U.S. official said last week. CNN's Carol Cratty in Washington contributed to this report.","Lawyer: Snowden will leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport in the next few days .

"(CNN) -- Q: Why are doctors recommending fewer cancer screenings? Shouldn't you find out if you have cancer and then decide whether to treat it? ""His teeth began to chatter. God All-Mighty! He thought, why haven't I realized it all these years. I've gone around with a -- skeleton -- inside me! I won't stand for it."" In one of Ray Bradbury's most famous short stories, ""The Skeleton,"" the lead character goes insane after becoming obsessed with the fact that he has something foreign and frightening inside himself. The story, preposterous as it is, rings psychologically true because it taps into the most primal of all human terrors: Having one's body invaded by something different than oneself, especially when that thing is not just different, but dangerous. This evolved fear, which is supported by very specific mechanisms in the brain and nervous system, likely helps explain why people are so much more terrified of cancer than they are of heart disease, even though the average American is more likely to die of the latter than the former. In the case of heart disease, there is only the failure of something we've always had ticking away inside us. On the other hand, cancers are our own cells that quickly become hideous mutant beings, not quite us, but not quite something else either. Whatever they are, they invade our bodies to disfigure and destroy us. Much has been written recently about why people are so upset over the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation to abandon the current practice of routinely screening healthy men for prostate cancer. Some experts have argued that the negative reaction comes from the fact that the panel is just flat-out wrong. The problem with this argument is that copious data suggest that the panel is right. A recent blog on Time.com more insightfully suggested that people are loathe to abandon even worthless blood tests because they anecdotally know someone who claims he/she was saved by getting this test at the right moment. Prostate cancer screening's false promise . As a psychiatrist I can't help but wonder if the extra fever pitch of outrage over abandoning prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, tests might also have its roots in our primal fear of harboring dangerous strangers beneath our skin and our consequent reluctance to give up any light in the darkness that might flush such foreign combatants from the shores of our bodies. To understand the mental health implications of this idea we have to take a step back and ask why abandoning the PSA test would improve our society's health. One reason is that, despite its name, the PSA is not particularly specific. This means that many people with a positive test will turn out not to have prostate cancer. That's good news for the affected individual, but bad news for overall health and well-being, because this conclusion only comes at the end of a medical work up that includes a biopsy and other procedures that come with their own health risks. Here is the more relevant reason for abandoning the PSA: It is probably even more dangerous when it is right than when it is wrong. That's because prostate cancer frequently follows one of three courses. Sometimes it remains small and contained and doesn't grow. In this situation it poses no health risk. Sometimes it grows, but grows so slowly that the person will almost certainly die of old age before succumbing to the cancer. Again this situation poses no health risk. Sometimes the cancer grows rapidly and is so aggressive that it will kill the person regardless of when it is discovered. In this case the PSA test does no material good. What these situations share is the fact that in each case, knowing that you have a cancer growing inside of you doesn't do you a whole lot of good. Here is what is being largely ignored in the current controversy: Would it cause harm to know you have a cancer growing inside you and do nothing about it? You don't have to be a mental health specialist to suspect the answer to this question is yes, for several reasons. At the most basic level, the knowledge that one harbors an ignored malignancy would place many people in an emotional state reminiscent of the unfortunate main character in Ray Bradbury's story. They would know that something strange, foreign and dangerous had taken up residence inside themselves, and this knowledge would almost certainly alter how they perceived themselves in multiple ways, subtle and not so subtle. But the real cost would come from the fact that not following up on a positive PSA test would almost certainly promote the development of mood and anxiety disorders. Why? Because we know from many studies that feeling powerless in response to a threat or danger in the environment greatly increases the risk that a person will develop depression and related conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. Knowing you harbor a tumor and aren't able to do anything with this knowledge would be a perfect example of this phenomenon. The cost of this knowledge would be especially high for those already predisposed to mood and anxiety disorders as a result of a tendency to worry, to ruminate, to focus too greatly on their health. But can you imagine any better way to make a previously normal person into a ruminating wreck? Imagine living in a world in which every mention of the word ""cancer"" immediately reminded one of his own situation and his inability to do anything meaningful about it? So from a mental health perspective, it seems to me the guidelines around PSA testing are clear: To continue PSA testing in low-risk individuals will significantly increase mental health morbidity if treatment guidelines change such that prostate cancers are not routinely removed. But it is also clear that PSA testing itself is not the deepest issue at play in the current debate. What it really comes down to is the question of whether we can sufficiently overcome our evolved terror of harboring dangerous foreign invaders inside ourselves to tolerate the clear implication of the Task Force's recommendation: . For medically healthy men, prostate screening is truly a situation in which ignorance is bliss.","Task Force recommends against routinely screening healthy men for prostate cancer .
Dr. Charles Raison says mental health can decline when people worry about their health .

"New York (CNN) -- Potential bidders at the auction website eBay can zoom in on a neatly-typed list of hundreds of factory workers spared almost certain death at Nazi concentration camps. One of Oskar Schindler's original lists was posted Thursday night with a starting bid request of $3 million. The German businessman became a Nazi and operated enamel factories in Poland, producing pots and pans using forced Jewish laborers during World War II. In order to save 1,200 prisoners, Schindler opened an armaments factory in Brunnlitz, present-day Czech Republic, to convince his superiors Jews were vital to the work production. The transfer of these workers was drawn up on multiple lists, collectively known as ""Schindler's List,"" according to Steven Luckert, curator of permanent exhibitions at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Schindler's List became a household name in 1993 when Steven Spielberg directed the Academy Award-winning classic movie of the same name. Eric Gazin, president of Auction Cause, which listed the historical document, says it is one of the original lists typed by Schindler's accountant, Itzhak Stern, and its authenticity is ""ironclad."" Playing to live: Pianist survived Holocaust by performing for Nazis . Of the seven original lists typed around 1944 and 1945, four are believed to survive, according to Gary Zimet, curator of Moments in Time auction house, who is working with Gazin on the sale. The list up for auction is the only one ever in private hands, according to Zimet. The list contains the names of 801 men from April 18, 1945. Two lists are at Yad Vashem, a Holocaust memorial in Israel, and one is at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Zimet says. The list has had zero bids as of Friday evening, but Gazin said there was immediate interest in the piece from multiple parties. ""For the right buyers, there might be a very spirited bidding war,"" he said. The anonymous owner, who lives in Israel, received the list from Stern's nephew, according to Gazin. It is not clear why the owner is selling the list. Bidding will end 10 days from its open, on July 28. The major significance of this list ""goes beyond the inaccuracies"" depicted to a certain degree in novels and movies about Schindler, such as the belief that there is only one list, according to Peter Black, senior historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. ""Schindler hired a number of workers, forced laborers, and over a period of time came to accept a moral responsibility for keeping those laborers alive and for protecting them against whatever the SS had planned for them, which ultimately, they were expected to die,"" Black said. Recovered Nazi diary gives rare view into Third Reich . Camp survivor says Schindler risked all . Halina Silber, a Holocaust survivor living in Baltimore, Maryland, says she is ""surprised that this is floating around and that it has such a value."" Silber was number 16 on one of Schindler's List containing women. While working in a Krakow concentration camp, Silber, then 13, lied and said she was 16 so she could be moved to work at a factory. Her brother fought for her to stay, but he was not listened to. She was sent to work for Schindler. ""This was a blessing in disguise and because of that, I survived the war, working with Schindler,"" Silber said. Silber says because of the1,200 people Schindler helped save, three generations and thousands of more people were able to survive and live on. Silber did not know that a list even existed until years later when historians began talking with Schindler survivors while researching for books and movies. ""He was exceptionally caring and passionate about what he was doing. He was very protective of his Jewish workers like no one ever in history. He was a Nazi and yet he was never ready to accept Hitler. He defied his plan to destroy every Jew,"" Silber said. ""He risked not only his professional standing but his own life to save and to support these Jewish workers until the end when they survived."" Schindler died in 1974 and is buried in Israel.

"(CNN) -- It was Rosy Esparza's first trip to Six Flags. She sat on the Texas Giant, a 14-story-high roller coaster that boasts what the amusement park calls ""the world's steepest drop."" Minutes later, one of the roller coaster's seats came back empty. Now Esparza is dead and Six Flags Over Texas representatives say the theme park is committed to finding out what led to the woman's death on Friday. Esparza's son-in-law and his wife were sitting in front of her at the time. Contrary to witness accounts reported by CNN affiliates, Ronald Segovia told CNN he did not hear his mother-in-law mention that her seat did not lock properly. Segovia also told CNN that Esparza was sitting by herself, contrary to initial reports that she was sitting beside her son. Her sons, according to Segovia, were not there. In Facebook posts on Saturday, her sons described the experience as a nightmare. A flood of condolences and prayers poured in. ""Only God knows Mama,"" Amado Esparza posted in Spanish along with a photo showing a group of people praying at the amusement park, ""something that I will always have as a memory of you is that you loved adventures."" Later, he described his mother as his best friend. ""It is sad to lose my mom,"" he wrote, ""but I am happy that when she was alive she enjoyed it to the fullest. I always took her to explore new places."" On Saturday, authorities said an initial investigation showed no sign of foul play in the woman's death. ""At this point of the investigation, it does not appear there was any foul play or criminality associated with this tragic incident,"" the Arlington Police Department said in a statement. Park visitors told CNN affiliate WFAA they saw the woman fall. ""She goes up like this,"" Carmen Brown told the affiliate, raising her hand up in the air. ""Then when it drops to come down, that's when it released, and she just tumbled."" Brown told The Dallas Morning News that the woman had expressed concern to a park employee that she was not properly secured in her seat. ""He was basically nonchalant,"" Brown said. ""He was, like, 'As long as you heard it click, you're fine.' Hers was the only one that went down once, and she didn't feel safe. But they let her still get on the ride."" Six Flags confirmed that a woman died Friday while riding the Texas Giant roller coaster, but did not provide further details. ""Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation,"" the theme park said in a statement. Six Flags Over Texas spokeswoman Sharon Parker said the park is committed to determining exactly what happened. ""It would be a disservice to the family to speculate regarding what transpired,"" she said. ""When we have new information to provide, we will do so."" The Texas Giant was originally designed in 1990 as an all-wooden roller coaster. It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April 2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary. At its highest point, the roller coaster is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park. Thousands of kids hurt yearly on amusement rides . Authorities look at a number of factors when they investigate theme park accidents, said Bill Avery, an amusement ride and device safety consultant. ""You're going to look at the operations of it, and the human factor, the human part of the equation,"" he told CNN. ""Was there an error or omission made by an operator or someone in operations?"" Maintenance and design would also be examined, he said, in addition to details such as the rider's posture and size. Avery, who founded a ride safety consulting firm and once headed up safety at several parks, said there a few things visitors should keep in mind when it comes to securing safety restraints. ""As a general rule,"" he said, ""It needs to fit snugly near your waistline, above the top of your thighs, so it can hold the passenger in regardless of what kind of forces are applied, and where they're applied, on the human body."" The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, a trade group representing amusement parks, describes them as ""one of the safest forms of recreation available to the public."" ""Approximately 297 million guests visit the 400 U.S. amusement parks annually and take 1.7 billion safe rides,"" the association says on its website. Visitors of fixed-site amusement parks -- places where rides are permanently attached to the ground -- have a 1 in 24 million chance of being seriously injured, the association said. CNN's Luisa Navarro, Fredricka Whitfield, Kevin Conlon, AnneClaire Stapleton and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Six Flags Over Texas says it's committed to finding out what caused a woman's death .

"(CNN) -- At home I drink from the tap. Not so much because I particularly love the taste, but because the automatic water dispenser on my fridge doesn't work. This, of course, is the primary job of any automatic water dispenser. Not to work. Seriously. Every fridge I've ever owned. Same thing. I'm actually starting to think it's all a giant conspiracy orchestrated by the evil hydration overlords at Brita. Don't let their cute little water pitchers fool you. Though, perhaps my fridge just needs a new filter. That could also be it. Regardless, swapping one out would require two full minutes of my life and minimal effort. Which sounds awful. So, really, it just makes more sense to ignore the problem and continue living my delightfully mediocre existence. ""Hooray! Everything is only decent!"" Fortunately, I really don't mind the flavor of what's coming out of the tap. It's more or less fresh and clean. And, most importantly, new. Because according to a trending science story floating around the interwebs, we now understand that the oldest known water on the planet tastes absolutely ""terrible."" There's far more to the story than just that. But the big headline everyone seems to be talking about online is the fact that this really old, prehistoric water shockingly doesn't taste like a mountain spring. In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, Barbara Sherwood Lollar, a science professor from the University of Toronto, described having a sip. ""What jumps out at you first is the saltiness,"" she explained. ""It has the consistency of a very light maple syrup."" How adorably Canadian. (Salty? Maple syrup?) Anyhow, the water, which for years has been bubbling up from a zinc and copper mine in Timmins, Ontario, was only recently dated by scientists who calculated its age to be anywhere from 1 billion to 2.6 billion years old. Which is quite a wide range. Good for prehistoric science. Bad for casual conversation. ""What a cutie! How old is your daughter?"" ""Welp, she's definitely somewhere between 3 and 67."" The point here is that this water is really old. And it doesn't particularly care for kids these days, what with their video games and rap music. Amazingly, the liquid has been trapped in granitelike rock fissures 1.5 miles underground where it's happily lived beneath the dirt. And as Lollar studied it seeping up within the mine, scientific research eventually led her to taste it. ""We are interested in the saltiest waters because they are the oldest,"" she told the Los Angeles Times. ""Tasting is the quick-and-dirty way to find which are the most salty."" Lollar did, however, insist that she doesn't let her students do it. Which shockingly goes against all human instinct to experience something disgusting and then immediately encourage others to do the same. ""Blech! This cheese tastes like a truck-stop men's room. Here, Dave, have a bite."" Prior to scientists discovering the approximate age of the ancient water found in Canada, the previous record holder came from a South African gold mine. But the water there was only tens of millions of years old. Lame. However, what's really exciting about all this is that, like the South African water, the Canadian liquid might be capable of containing life despite its incredible isolation deep within the earth. I seriously hope it's overrun with Fraggles. Of course, what we're actually talking about is tiny microbes. Which, generally speaking, I don't particularly care for. If you've ever dined on bad street meat in Ko Samui, Thailand, you know that some of these little bastards mean business. ""Yeeeeeah, we're here from that rat you just ate. If you could spend the next five days near a toilet, that would be great."" Lollar speculates that it will take about a year before they can confirm whether or not anything's actually living down there in the fissures, but positive results could have implications that reach beyond even our own planet. ""Scientists have found evidence that there was once water on the surface of Mars,"" she explains. ""It could be that there is water trapped in rock hidden deep beneath the planet's surface in the same way the water was trapped in the ancient rock in the Timmins mine."" Until then, for the next year or so, all we can really do is enjoy the fact that one brave, friendly scientist tasted horrible prehistoric water so the rest of us didn't have to.

"Boston (CNN) -- A juror wept Friday as James ""Whitey"" Bulger's former partner told a tragic tale of a slip of the lip and the ensuing result -- the strangling death of a 26-year-old woman, who was killed because she'd heard too much. What made this recitation of deadly details different from the ones that preceded it during reputed mob boss Bulger's trial in federal court was that the victim had been the girlfriend of the witness. ""It's affected me and it's going to affect me until the day I die,"" Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi said in the first humanizing testimony the jury had heard in two days of recollections about multiple murders and extortions. Flemmi was Bulger's number-two front man for nearly two decades, when prosecutors say Bulger reigned terror over Boston. Bulger is charged with 19 killings in a 32-count indictment that includes extortion, money laundering, and racketeering in addition to the deaths. ""He strangled her all the way down to the basement...when he got to the basement she was dead,"" Flemmi told the jury, referring to Bulger and Flemmi's girlfriend, Debra Davis. A female juror covered her mouth and began shaking, wiping away tears while she repeatedly checked the time, as if longing for the testimony to end. Shot-by-shot testimony in Bulger trial makes jurors squirm . Prosecutors brought up the horrific murder of Davis in 1981 just 10 minutes before court ended Friday. In his testimony, Flemmi said his much younger girlfriend became very upset when he left her birthday party abruptly to meet with Bulger. Flemmi said he ""inadvertently blurted out"" to Davis that he and Bulger were FBI informants. ""I bit my tongue and said we have a connection to John Connolly in the FBI and I got to leave,"" Flemmi said, referring to his and Bulger's rogue FBI informant-handler. Connolly is serving a 40 year sentence in Florida on murder charges connected to information he leaked to Bulger. Bulger then said several times that ""he wanted to kill her"" because of what Davis then knew about the duo's relationship with Connolly, Flemmi testified. ""I said no, of course not,"" Flemmi continued. ""And he (Bulger) explained a whole litany of reasons why John Connolly helped us... all of us and (said) 'You are jeopardizing that.'"" Flemmi, who testified earlier that Connolly had tipped them off to indictments, wire taps, and investigations, said it took him a while to come around but he eventually agreed to the slaying of Davis. ""I couldn't do it...(Bulger) knew it ... he said, 'I'll take care of it, I'll do it,'"" Flemmi told the jurors as they listened intently. Flemmi invited Davis to a house he had just bought for his parents, and when they walked in the front door, ""He (Bulger) grabbed her by the throat and strangled her,"" Flemmi said. Prosecting attornery Fred Wyshak asked: ""What did you do?"" Flemmi: ""Nothing."" Wyshak: ""Why not?"" Flemmi: ""That was the plan."" At that moment in court, Bulger -- whose attorneys made it very clear in opening statements that he does not want the death of women on his hands -- stared at his former partner for the first time all day. It was only for a few seconds before he turned his head back downward. The two, who sparred with expletives at the end of court Thursday, virtually ignored each other Friday except for that one interlude. ""I wrapped her up and he (Bulger) went back upstairs"" Flemmi went on. Flemmi testified that he ""cleaned up"" and they proceeded to take Davis' body to an area near the Neponset river where they buried her in a shallow grave. The remains of Debra Davis were excavated from a tidal marsh in late 2000. Most of her remains were discovered in plastic bags along with rope around the bags, a Massachusetts state forensic anthropologist testified last week. Almost all of Davis' bones were recovered, according to Dr. Ann Marie Mires. Because her body was in bags, even some of her hair was preserved. The hair, along with pieces of bones, were tested for DNA and were positively identified as the remains of Davis, according to Mires. Bulger trial opens window on mob world of cold violence, fierce loyalty . Davis' brother, Steve Davis, has been a regular at trial since it began in June. He told reporters after court, ""I've heard it before. It brings tears to my eyes but I learned how to deal and fight it, because I need to learn more about it, 'cause you don't know all it yet."" Flemmi pleaded guilty to 10 murders after charges were brought in 2004 and was spared the death penalty after agreeing to testify against Bulger. Of his relationship with Davis, he told the jury: ""I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her."" After court, the attorneys discussed the defense's amended witness list which had been reduced to 30 on Tuesday, from originally over 80 witnesses. Prosecuting attorney Brian Kelly argued that at least 15 of the witnesses -- former FBI agents -- would be a ""waste"" of the jury's time, as they are being called to refute the notion that Bulger was an informant, something Bulger has strongly denied. Kelly called these witnesses ""irrelevant."" Defense attorney Hank Brennan responded: ""Our witnesses are now down to 30. They are relevant to our case and we intend to call them."" The defense had mentioned on Tuesday that it would shrink its list if alleged extortion victim Stephen Rakes didn't testify because several defense witnesses were intended to challenge Rakes' expected testimony. Rakes learned Tuesday that prosecutors no longer planned to call him to the stand, according to a friend of Rakes. On Wednesday, Rakes' body was discovered near a walking trail about 30 miles from his home. CNN affiliate WBZ reported that his car was found Friday about six miles from where his remains were found. Federal law enforcement authorities were ""shocked"" to learn about the unexplained death of Rakes, according to a source familiar with the investigation into Rakes' death. Authorities consider Rakes' death suspicious, the source added, and authorities hope that there is no connection to the ongoing Bulger trial. The death is under investigation.

"(CNN) -- An initial investigation shows no sign of foul play in the death of a woman who fell from a roller coaster at Six Flags Over Texas, authorities said Saturday. ""At this point of the investigation, it does not appear there was any foul play or criminality associated with this tragic incident,"" according to a statement released by the Arlington Police Department. Six Flags confirmed that a woman died Friday while riding the Texas Giant roller coaster, but did not provide further details. ""Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation,"" the theme park said in a statement. Park medical staff and local paramedics responded immediately to the scene, the park said. Gabe Flores said he was next in line at the amusement park. ""Me and my girlfriend were at the gates and the next ones to get on the ride ... the cars came in and there was a man and a woman in the front,"" he said. ""The man was saying, 'let me out, let me out, my mom fell off.' "" The man and woman were distraught and speaking in raised tones, said Flores, who lives in Benton, Texas. ""There's a turn that's pretty steep, and the person behind her empty seat said she fell out there -- just flew out,"" he said. Flores did not see her fall, but park visitors told CNN affiliate WFAA they did. ""She goes up like this,"" Carmen Brown told the affiliate, raising her hand up in the air. ""Then when it drops to come down, that's when it released and she just tumbled."" Brown told the Dallas Morning News that the woman had expressed concern to a park employee that she was not properly secured in her seat. ""He was basically nonchalant,"" Brown said. ""He was, like, 'As long as you heard it click, you're fine.' Hers was the only one that went down once, and she didn't feel safe. But they let her still get on the ride."" Six Flags Over Texas spokeswoman Sharon Parker said the park is committed to determining exactly what happened. ""It would be a disservice to the family to speculate regarding what transpired,"" she said. ""When we have new information to provide, we will do so."" The Texas Giant was originally designed in 1990 as an all wooden roller coaster. It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April 2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary. At its highest point, the roller coaster is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park. Thousands of kids hurt yearly on amusement rides . Elsewhere, seven people suffered minor injuries in a boat-ride mishap at the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, park officials said. The incident occurred Friday evening when a boat rolled backward down a lift hill on the Shoot the Rapids ride, park spokesman Bryan Edwards said in an e-mailed statement. The seven people in the boat were evaluated and treated by Cedar Point emergency medical staff, Edwards said. One of the seven was taken to an area hospital for additional evaluation and was subsequently released, he said. The ride will remain closed until Ohio park officials and inspectors review it. CNN's Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Authorities say there is no sign of ""foul play or criminality""

The 19 -- members of the Prescott Fire Department's elite Granite Mountain Hotshots wildfire crew -- died while battling the Yarnell Hill fire, which consumed thousands of acres northwest of Phoenix. Officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters, blankets meant to protect against flames and heat, as a last resort after the fire suddenly changed directions. The thousands who filled Tim's Toyota Center west of Prescott gave a standing ovation to the unit's only survivor, Brendan McDonough, as he was introduced. Officials said McDonough was the unit's lookout away from the burn zone, and warned his crewmates by radio that the fire had changed direction. The fallen firefighters: who they were . After reciting a firefighters' prayer, McDonough made a simple tribute to his comrades. ""I miss my brothers,"" he said, ""and we're here to remember them.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- As Olympic icon Oscar Pistorius faces a murder trial for shooting his girlfriend, his older brother is also charged in the death of a woman. Carl Pistorius is accused in the 2010 death of a female motorcyclist, Pistorius family attorney Kenny Oldwage said. Culpable homicide refers to ""unlawful negligent killing,"" South African police say. Prosecutors say Carl Pistorius was driving recklessly in Vanderbijlpark, South Africa, when he crashed with the motorcyclist in the daytime. Oldwage disputes allegations that his client was driving recklessly and said the motorcyclist rode into Carl Pistorius' vehicle. ""Carl deeply regrets the accident. Blood tests conducted by the police at the time proved that he had not been under the influence of alcohol, confirming that it was a tragic road accident after the deceased collided with Carl's car,"" a statement from the Pistorius family said. The motorcyclist died in a hospital a couple of days after the accident, Oldwage said. Carl Pistorius was initially scheduled to go on trial Thursday -- during the middle of his brother's four-day bail hearing. The trial has been rescheduled for the end of March. His case could be over before his brother's murder trial is scheduled to start in June. Carl Pistorius was a fixture at his younger brother's bail hearing last week, handing Oscar tissues as the 26-year-old sobbed uncontrollably in court. Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee sprinter known as the ""Blade Runner,"" is charged with premeditated murder in the death of his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutors say the Olympian killed her after a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. Pistorius says he thought Steenkamp, 29, was an intruder. After a four-day, emotionally wrenching bail hearing, the track star was granted bail Friday. As part of his conditions for release, Oscar Pistorius cannot return to his home, where the shooting happened; must surrender his passport; and can't go near an airport. It's unknown whether Oscar Pistorius will be in court to support his brother during his trial.

"(CNN) -- New Zealand's capital was cleaning up Monday after a strong earthquake that shook the city and left authorities scrambling to make sure buildings were safe.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is crafting his own laws of political physics these days, insisting that inaction by a divided Congress requires White House action in order to get something done. A campaign labeled ""We Can't Wait"" pushes unilateral directives and programs from the White House as the only way to push ahead on the president's agenda when a do-nothing Congress fails to act. ""There is inaction. There is a lack of action,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney explained to reporters this week when asked about a series of executive orders and actions the president has taken or is planning. ""So there is a need to move, because we can move."" Republicans reject the premise of the White House position, arguing that Obama chooses to blame Congress for inaction instead of working with legislators from both parties on bills that can pass. House Speaker John Boehner, speaking on the Laura Ingraham show last week, described as laughable the prospect that Obama would use executive orders to bypass Congress on substantive issues. At the same time, though, the Ohio Republican said he would keep close watch to make sure nothing unconstitutional happens. To Adam Warber, a Clemson University political science professor who wrote a book on executive orders, Obama is carrying on a consistent tradition of his predecessors in trying to expand the power of the presidency as much as possible. ""It's incremental,"" Warber said. ""Each president kind of adds to the power that the presidency has."" In Obama's case, ""we pretty much are seeing that behind the scenes he's centralizing power,"" Warber continued. ""He's not really different than anyone else."" For Obama, the strategy of executive orders serves a dual purpose by moving forward on parts of his agenda despite Republican opposition while projecting an image of decisive action in the face of political inaction. ""Congress has been trying since February to do something about this,"" Obama said Monday in announcing an executive order that directs the Food and Drug Administration to increase efforts to reduce shortages of some prescription drugs. ""It has not yet been able to get it done. And it is the belief of this administration ... that we can't wait for action on the Hill; we've got to go ahead and move forward."" His GOP foes call such rhetoric grandstanding, noting it leads to piecemeal steps instead of working with Congress to pass more substantive legislation acceptable to both parties. ""I know he's desperately interested in trying to blame anybody else, but he's the president of the United States, he set the agenda, he got everything he wanted. And it didn't work,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said last week. Obama rejects the Republican view, saying in his weekly address Saturday that GOP foes now refuse to debate job-creation measures that congressional Republicans have supported in the past. In addition, Republican counter-proposals to cut regulations and roll back health care and Wall Street reforms failed to address the immediate need to reduce unemployment, Obama argues. ""Meanwhile, they're only scheduled to work three more weeks between now and the end of the year,"" Obama said in the Saturday address. ""The truth is, we can no longer wait for Congress to do its job. The middle-class families who've been struggling for years are tired of waiting. They need help now. So where Congress won't act, I will."" Warber, however, said the presidential messaging of the ""We Can't Wait"" campaign amounts to what he called ""political theater."" Obama is trying to ""pass the ball"" to congressional Republicans ""so that they have to hold economic problems in their hands during the election,"" said Warber, whose 2006 book was titled ""Executive Orders and the Modern Presidency: Legislating from the Oval Office."" Almost three years into his term, Obama is on a similar pace in issuing executive orders issued as his recent predecessors such as George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. While some executive orders are routine or ceremonial in nature, presidents since Jimmy Carter have used them more for major policy directives to sidestep the legislative or bureaucratic process, Warber said. ""What they're doing here is they're using these tools to bypass the legislative process to make laws,"" he said, adding that the White House ""through the president is taking the lead, saying this is what we want here."" The prescription drug executive order announced Monday is designed to help reduce a growing number of prescription drug shortages while protecting patients from possible pharmaceutical industry price gouging. Among other things, the order requires the Food and Drug Administration to increase its reporting of possible shortages of certain prescription drugs, while also speeding up regulatory reviews of new drug manufacturing sites, drug suppliers and manufacturing changes. The Justice Department will be tasked with examining whether specific drug shortages are tied to an intentional stockpiling of medications designed to raise prices. Other new policies pushed by the White House include steps to help families refinance homes that have lost value in the recession, programs to help war veterans get jobs, and reforms to student loan processing. When questioned by reporters Tuesday, Carney conceded that legislation passed by Congress would be a more substantive step toward the kind of job-creation measures needed to help the struggling economic recovery. For example, Obama's proposed jobs bill ""is filled with provisions that require legislative action,"" Carney said. ""He's not pulling things out and making them law by fiat. I'm sure he wishes he could."" Carney also has insisted that Obama ""is acting well within his authority, well within his constitutional authority"" by taking what he called administrative steps. According to Warber, other examples of unilateral executive steps include signing statements, proclamations, memorandums and directives. Signing statements are documents from the president that challenge or reject specific provisions in bills passed by Congress, acting as a kind of line-item veto that can serve as legal reasoning in a possible court challenge, Warber said. Proclamations are usually ceremonial in nature, he added, but presidents have been known to slip in policy statements or other substantive steps. If the language shifts from the generally flowery prose of a ceremonial proclamation, he said, look closely for a policy issue somewhere in the text. Historically, executive orders are rarely overturned. To do so in Congress would require overcoming a likely presidential veto, an unlikely event in the current Democratic-controlled Senate. Warber noted that the Supreme Court could exercise its judicial review authority to strike down an executive order as being unconstitutional. However, he said, research showed that Congress and the courts ""have been quite passive in challenging executive orders."" ""There is a lot of research that is needed on this subject,"" he said, ""but one of the theories about why this might be the case is that Congress and the courts are reluctant to engage in a separation-of-powers battle with the president.""","NEW: Few legal challenges are made against executive orders .

"Boston (CNN) -- Former drug smuggler William David Lindholm has a harrowing tale of how reputed Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger allegedly tried to extort $1 million by having a bullet fired past Lindholm's head. In the end, Lindholm lived to testify Wednesday at Bulger's federal trial about surviving a high-stakes, Russian roulette-style game. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he terrorized South Boston as the head of the Irish mob. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecutors allege Bulger shook down more than a dozen criminals and made them pay ""rent"" -- cash for permission to carry on with their business on the streets of Boston. Lindholm told jurors that he had never met Bulger until that 1983 encounter. Shot-by-shot testimony in Bulger trial makes jurors squirm . Bulger allegedly wanted a piece of the action but had no idea that Lindholm had successfully brought in a whopping $72 million in marijuana from Colombia into Louisiana, the East Coast smuggler testified. Lindholm said he was summoned to a meeting at the Marconi Club after his pals, closely affiliated with Bulger and his organized crime associates, fed Lindholm the ruse that they needed help with a ""problem"" they were having. Bulger allegedly had Lindholm's pockets emptied before brandishing two guns, telling him ""you are here because you are not with anybody."" ""A bullet was put in the chamber it was spun and pointed at my head,"" said Lindholm. According to Lindholm, Bulger ordered one of his associates to shoot past Lindholm's head with a silencer -- proving the gun worked -- before ordering his associate to dump the bullets on the table and reload with a single bullet. ""The trigger was pulled and it didn't go off,"" the witness testified. Lindholm said he had ""dealt with the Mexicans and Colombians before"" and talked Bulger down to a $250,000 payment. When they struck a deal, Bulger ""shook my hand and said I handled myself well,"" Lindholm told the court. Lindholm said he was reluctant to talk shop with Bulger because he thought the place was bugged. Lindholm said that Bulger ""was asking questions like a police officer might ask me."" At that, Bulger, 83, dressed sharply in a pressed blue button-down shirt, slowly turned his head toward the witness and stared. Bulger has fought the notion that he was an FBI informant during a 20-year period, though prosecutors have submitted a 700-page informant file that suggests otherwise. Just before court broke, prosecuting attorney Zachary Hafer asked Lindholm whether Bulger made any threats toward him about attempting to sell drugs in Boston without Bulger's permission. ""Yeah, he'd cut off my head,"" Lindholm said. Jurors view photos of alleged victims' remains . Lindholm, who is in the witness protection program, is testifying on a compulsion order under grounds of immunity. He was convicted of drug and tax evasion charges and joins the laundry list of government witnesses who served a lesser sentence after agreeing to cooperate. Weapons were destined for the IRA . Bulger's alleged international crimes also took center stage during the 23rd day of the trial. Prosecutors allege he sent guns to the Irish Republican Army on the fishing trawler Valhalla that departed from Boston Harbor in 1984. The guns were transferred to a vessel in Irish waters and were seized by Irish law enforcement before they reached the IRA, a former U.S. Customs agent testified. The interception of the weapons was seen as a moral victory for the IRA over the British because it showed that Americans were willing to ally with the IRA, according to agent Donald J. DeFago. DeFago testified that one of Bulger's alleged murder victims was cooperating with the FBI and Customs on this Valhalla exchange, as well as the attempted importation of 36 tons of marijuana into Boston Harbor. Because of John McIntyre's cooperation, the marijuana was seized by authorities. McIntyre was arrested on drunken driving charges when he began cooperating with the feds, said DeFago. The agent, now 64, formally interviewed McIntyre in October 1984, with an FBI agent who he said knew John Connolly, Bulger's rogue FBI handler who is now imprisoned. The prosecution charges that Bulger ordered a hit on McIntyre when he learned he was cooperating with authorities . Though DeFago testified that McIntyre named dozens of organized crime associates responsible for the seaborne marijuana exchanges, he never once named Bulger or his No. 2, Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi. McIntyre said it was Pat Nee, a reputed Charlestown gangster, who was the head of the jobs. DeFago said he ""understood that Whitey and Flemmi were apart of Nee's crowd."" Bulger's alleged No. 2 takes stand Thursday . Sparks are likely to fly Thursday when Flemmi, nicknamed ""The Rifleman,"" takes the stand. Defense attorneys say Bulger heard that Flemmi was arrested on extortion charges in 1995 on the radio and decided to go on the run for 16 years, landing himself on the FBI's most-wanted list before being arrested with his girlfriend in their Santa Monica, California, apartment in 2011. Flemmi argued he had immunity and should be exonerated of charges because he was an FBI informant. A judge ruled he did not have immunity, and he was sentenced in August 2001 to 10 years in prison for extortion and money laundering as part of a plea agreement. The government's star witness was once Bulger's front man for the ""Winter Hill Gang,"" collecting money from bookies and inspiring fear in those that didn't pay their debts. Flemmi pleaded guilty to 10 murders after charges were brought in 2004 and was spared the death penalty after agreeing to testify against Bulger. The two will be reunited Thursday for the first time in 18 years. Prosecutors say Flemmi's testimony will be the nail in the coffin in locking up the Bulger case.

"Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- He escaped the war, but life's no happier now for Omar. The 8-year-old Syrian refugee longs for friends back in Qusayr, hard hit by a civil war that grinds on. He also misses days in school -- when the most he had to worry about was finishing his homework. ""I work so I can bring money for my family,"" says Omar. His mother, like other refugees, asked that their last names not be used as they are worried for their safety. Eddie Izzard: In Syrian refugee camps, another day of childhood is lost . I met Omar on a hot, dusty day in Lebanon's wind-swept Bekaa Valley. We were interviewing his mother when Omar and his 14-year-old brother came zooming by on a motorbike. They had just finished gathering eggs at a nearby farm -- what little money the kids make is the only way their family is able to survive. The job is hard, but Omar went through an even more difficult experience recently. ""They hit us,"" he says timidly, describing how Lebanese boys his age beat him up. ""They said to me,"" he adds, embarrassed and close to tears, "" 'Damn every Syrian.' "" Omar now faces a different kind of brutality -- a harsh reality reflected in the weary faces of kids all around. Their eyes make them seem far older. There's no childhood spark, with smiles few and far between. I ask a 15-year-old girl what life's been like for her here. ""Life?"" She asks unbelievingly -- as if the question were a farce. ""We manage to live, but it's nothing like before."" She's forced to share a small tent with nine others. She says her circumstances are difficult, but at the same time, she feels blessed with what her family even has. In makeshift refugee camps such as this one, the overwhelming feeling is sadness. The Syrians interviewed say they can't believe their lives have come to this -- adding how they're not just destitute, but they're also facing discrimination. Bushra, a Syrian woman in her 40s, says she's still shocked at the kinds of hateful words she's heard since arriving. ""Some people say to me, 'God bless Bashar al-Assad's hands,' "" she says, "" 'the hands that slaughtered you all -- you deserve worse.' "" Bushra says it's told as a joke, but she and her family aren't laughing. The United Nations says more than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, a tiny country of about 4 million people. Aid workers warn resentment toward Syrian refugees is on the rise here. ""The crisis entered its third year now,"" says Patricia Mouammar with World Vision, a humanitarian aid and development organization. ""And the Lebanese community -- even though very generous at the beginning of this crisis, now they cannot take the burden."" Mouammar says there are many reasons for increasing tensions. ""Rent -- the prices of the rent have gone up, up to 400% in some areas,"" she says. ""Salary wages plummeted, and Syrian refugees are working for less, and they're sharing homes with multiple families. And everyone is feeling that -- everyone is feeling the burden on the Lebanese hosting communities."" Mouammar says her organization is ""calling for the humanitarian aid to direct more assistance toward both communities -- the Syrian refugees and the Lebanese communities."" It's gotten so bad that some Lebanese families have even been displaced. Taha, a Lebanese father, says his family's former landlord kicked them out when a recently arrived Syrian family was willing to pay double the rent. His younger son's anger is clear as day. ""The Syrians took our world away from us,"" says 9-year-old Iyad. ""There's nothing left for us."" His father's outrage, however, is reserved for others. ""We're not against Syrians -- we have to help the refugees,"" Taha says. ""But our government has to take care of us, too."" Pointing to his oldest, he says, ""My son here, now he has to work too -- it's awful."" There's no indication the teenager has heard us. He sits and stares -- his hopelessness and exhaustion apparent. He isn't just drained. Like so many Syrian children, he's also desperate.

"(CNN) -- Three bodies have been discovered in East Cleveland, Ohio, police say, and a man is in custody in connection with the case. ""We are dealing with a sick individual, and we have reason to believe that there might be more victims,"" East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton told CNN. All three victims appear to be young black women, their decomposing bodies wrapped in layers of plastic and taped up, according to authorities. Two bodies were found Saturday, one in the basement of an abandoned house, the other in a field nearby. The first victim was found Friday in a garage on the same block after police received a call about a foul odor. The first victim was found naked with indications of trauma, police say. The second victim was found wearing a green hoodie, and the third was wearing a leopard print leotard. The garage where the first victim was found was leased to Michael Madison, according to Detective Sgt. Scott Gardner with the East Cleveland police. Authorities obtained a search warrant for Madison's apartment and found ""additional evidence of decomposition"" there, he said. The 35-year-old suspect was later located and taken into custody without incident after a standoff at his mother's house. According to police, Madison was convicted of attempted rape in 2001 and is a registered sex offender. CNN could not immediately reach a representative for Madison. Norton believes the killings happened over a 10-day period. ""One of the things that makes us believe it's the same suspect is the way that they were all wrapped ... and the same concealment of each of the victims,"" he said. According to Norton, Madison ""idolized"" and was ""influenced"" by convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell. Sowell was sentenced to death in 2011 for killing 11 women in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. ""Unfortunately, this is a sick individual who appears to have been influenced by another sick individual,"" Norton told CNN. ""If he had been out for one more hour, there's no telling what would have happened."" One hundred volunteers were going house to house Sunday ""to see if there's anything else out there that police need to know about,"" he added. Cadaver dogs were assisting in the search. East Cleveland Police Chief Ralph Spotts told CNN affiliate WEWS that authorities have received tips from the public and hope to get more.

"(CNN) -- Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy, said Thursday it was difficult to listen to testimony about his son, particularly the negative comments, during George Zimmerman's trial. ""That wasn't the Trayvon that we raised. That wasn't the Trayvon that we knew, and that we love,"" he said during a Thursday night interview on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Still, Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said that she felt the need to sit through every day of Zimmerman's trial because her son was ""not here to say anything for himself."" She said that she wanted to ""show a face"" for her son. Martin's parents spoke out Thursday for the first time since Zimmerman was acquitted in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman could still be held responsible . ""It came as a complete shock for me,"" Fulton said about the verdict. ""And the reason I say that is because I just look at people as people, and I thought for sure that the jury looked at Trayvon as an average teenager that was minding his own business, that wasn't committing any crime."" Martin's parents opted not to be in the courtroom when the verdict was read. They thought they would not be able to control their emotions -- whichever way the jury decided. When they heard, they broke down. ""When I heard the verdict, I kind of understand the disconnect,"" Fulton said. ""Maybe they (jurors) didn't see Trayvon as their son. They didn't see Trayvon as a teenager. They didn't see Trayvon as just a human being that was minding his own business."" 'Does the system work? It didn't work for us' Tracy Martin said he wasn't concerned about the racial makeup of the jury before the start of the trial, which has become a forum for debate about gun laws and race in America. But, like Fulton, he believes jurors never saw the event from the perspective of his son. The jury had six women -- five white and one an unspecified minority. Tracy Martin said he believes Juror B37 had her mind made up before the trial began. The juror gave an exclusive interview to CNN's Anderson Cooper this week and said the jury felt like it knew Zimmerman but didn't know enough about Martin. Trayvon's dad: My heart is broken, my faith is not . Martin's mother said that despite that comment, jurors had sufficient information. ""They knew he was a teenager. They knew he was on his way home. They knew he ran,"" she said. ""... How much do you need to know?"" Referring to Juror B37's statement that she did not believe race was a factor in the shooting, Fulton said, ""I think that's a joke."" Tracy Martin said that his children had grown up in a diverse community, so he had never felt feel a need to have a conversation about how his sons should deal with race. Rather, he said he talked with his children about ""how we prepare them to become teenagers, to become upstanding citizens, to conduct themselves in public."" But once his unarmed son was shot, he said that changed. ""What is it I can tell my child now?"" he asked. In spite of his son's death, Tracy Martin said he has faith in the legal system. ""The state did all they could with what they had"" given the poor quality of the investigation, he said. ""Does the system work? It didn't work for us. We remain prayerful that through this injustice, we can close that gap and hopefully the system can start working for everyone equally."" 'Hopefully, we can find some positive' Martin's mother said that she hoped that a foundation started in her son's name would allow for something good to come out of his death. ""The change that we hope to affect is with the law,"" Fulton said. ""We want to make sure any teenager who is walking down the street wont' be killed, that they will make it home safe."" ""Hopefully, we can find some positive, some bright side out of all of this,"" she said. The parents did not say whether they may file a civil lawsuit. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family who also appeared on ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" said they are hoping for a federal civil rights investigation into the teenager's death. He said they were pleased by the charges brought against Zimmerman because they felt it got to the heart of the allegations. But he said he did not believe the police were aggressive with the shooting investigation, appearing to take Zimmerman's word for it. ""Not only did (Zimmerman) profile Trayvon Martin, the police profiled Trayvon Martin,"" Crump said. 'Forgiveness takes time' Earlier Thursday, in interviews on the three network TV morning news programs, Martin's parents assailed the verdict and the Zimmerman defense team's argument that the killing was in self-defense during an attack by the unarmed teenager. Fulton told ""CBS This Morning"" she was ""in a bit of shock"" after the verdict. ""I thought surely that he would be found guilty of second-degree murder,"" she said. On NBC's ""Today,"" Fulton said the case is ""sending a terrible message to other little black and brown boys -- that you can't walk fast, you can't walk slow. So what do they do? I mean, how do you get home without people knowing or either assuming that you're doing something wrong? Trayvon wasn't doing anything wrong."" Speaking to ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Martin added that he and Fulton did not find the verdict fair, ""and of course it's devastating."" ""Today"" asked them whether they may forgive Zimmerman, the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer. ""Forgiveness is like a healing process. Forgiveness takes time,"" Martin responded. ""The Bible says that you have to forgive and forget, but also the healing process is a long process and the forgiving process is a long process."" Martin's friend 'upset, angry' by verdict .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Mickey Rooney must revive his show business career soon or he will die ""in very short order,"" the lawyer appointed to oversee the 90-year-old actor's affairs told CNN Friday. ""He's available, he's marketable and we're going to get him working,"" said Michael Augustine. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz cleared the way for a Rooney resurgence Friday by appointing Augustine as permanent conservator, a move Rooney said he needed to protect him from his stepson and stepdaughter. Rooney's plight came to national attention when he delivered emotional testimony to Congress earlier this month in which he said family members took control of his life, making him ""scared, disappointed, yes, and angry."" Goetz issued a temporary restraining order last month prohibiting Christopher Aber, who is the son of Rooney's wife, from coming within 100 feet of the actor. Lawyers from both sides indicated they were near an agreement to remove that order. Aber's lawyer said the conservatorship, which removes the stepson from involvement in Rooney's business, would ""bring peace a little closer"" for the family. But attorney John O'Meara said ""relationship mending, that's going to take a little time."" Rooney's wife, Jan, in a written statement to the judge, said that while she initially objected to her husband being placed under a conservatorship, she now is supportive. The arrangement should help ""to restore peace in my family"" and pave the way for Rooney to ""perform individually and with me."" Mickey and Jan Rooney occasionally perform as a musical duo, including last June at an anniversary tribute on the first anniversary of Michael Jackson's death. Augustine, in a CNN interview after Friday's hearing, said he would immediately seek movie, television and commercial roles for Rooney, who he said is in good physical and mental health. ""Mr. Rooney's parents put him on the vaudeville stage when he was 17 months old,"" Augustine said. ""Mr. Rooney has had an 88-year career. If Mr. Rooney were to not work, I think we would be attending Mr. Rooney's funeral in very short order. It's part of his fiber. He loves it. He is a showman."" Another urgent reason to get work for Rooney is that he needs money, Augustine said. ""That's not a secret,"" he said. ""We brought this matter because bank accounts have been dissipated, money's disappeared."" The judge indicated Rooney needed cash to pay a delinquent mortgage. He also needs a new ride, Augustine said. His old car is ""just a beater that's been there for a while."" Rooney has been in demand as a spokesman for elder abuse causes since his emotional appearance before the Senate Special Committee on Aging in early March, Augustine said. He is negotiating a deal for Rooney to narrate a documentary about elder abuse and the actor is booked to speak at a symposium on the subject next week, he said. Rooney was the highest paid actor in Hollywood in 1941, out-earning movie stars Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable, Augustine said. Demand for Rooney's talent may be increased by this week's death of his ""National Velvet"" co-star Elizabeth Taylor, he said. Rooney made his audience laugh and cry this month when he implored senators to stop what experts call chronic emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse of elderly Americans by family members and other caregivers. ""You can't believe that it's happening to you,"" Rooney said. ""You feel overwhelmed."" The committee's hearing brought attention to what experts call chronic elder abuse in America. Rooney said Congress should pass a law to make it a specific crime. ""I'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse. I mean to stop it. Now. Not tomorrow, not next month, but now,"" he shouted from the witness table. Pass legislation and send it to be signed into law by President Barack Obama, he urged, so that the nation can say ""it's a crime and we will not allow it in the United States of America."" Following the hearing, committee chairman, Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin, introduced legislation that would create an Office of Elder Justice within the Department of Justice to help coordinate law enforcement response to elder abuse. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, more than 14% of noninstitutionalized older adults experienced some form of elder abuse in 2009. The report cautions that number may be lower than the reality because many instances of such abuse are under-reported. ""For years I suffered silently. I didn't want to tell anybody. I couldn't muster the courage and you have to have courage,"" Rooney said. ""I needed help and I knew I needed it. Even when I tried to speak up, I was told to shut up and be quiet."" The GAO report found that many Adult Protective Service programs at the state level have growing case loads and dwindling resources. The elder population of the United States is expected to grow by 60% over the next 25 years. Rooney summed up the challenge when he spoke of the personal difficulty that victims of elder abuse face. ""You're afraid, but you're also thinking about your other family members,"" he said, noting concern about potential criticism from ""your family, your friends, people who know them."" ""They might not want to accept the dysfunction,"" Rooney said, adding that ""one should love their families as I do. I love my family."" The diminutive Rooney has been a film star for decades, starting with his role in Andy Hardy films in the 1930s.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Arrests for women driving under the influence jumped by nearly 30 percent during the decade ending in 2007, according to a study released Wednesday by the U.S. Transportation Department. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood discusses the study at a news conference Wednesday. ""To be honest with you, I was certainly surprised about that statistic,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said at a news conference. However, when it comes to drunken driving arrests, women continue to be outnumbered by men by four to one. Laura Dean-Moody, president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said that ""women are unfortunately picking up some of the same terrible, reckless behaviors that men have exhibited."" The report, authored by the FBI for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, found a declining number of men arrested for similar alcohol-related violations. The numbers were compiled from national law enforcement records covering 1998-2007. Moody said the report does not explain why women are increasingly driving while impaired but speculated, ""Women are under more pressure. They're now perhaps the breadwinner with the unemployment rate."" She also added that ""TV shows have made it look hip or cool to be a mom that stays home and drinks."" The findings were part of the launch of a Labor Day law enforcement campaign called ""Over the Limit, Under Arrest."" Describing what's intended to be a nationwide effort, Fairfax County, Virginia, police Capt. Susan Culin said, ""we'll be making more traffic stops, writing more tickets, conducting more sobriety checkpoints and DUI saturation patrols, and we'll be arresting any driver we determine to be impaired."" Moody, whose husband was killed in 1991 by a drunken  driver, cited statistics suggesting that 2 million drivers with multiple alcohol convictions will be on the road during the Labor Day holiday. Criticizing a court system that has allowed such drivers to keep their licenses, Moody said, ""these are people who have proven not once, not twice but three times that they are not worthy of the public's trust when it comes to operating a vehicle.""","Arrests of women driving drunk rose 30 percent from 1998 to 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Three University of Texas at El Paso men's basketball players have been dismissed from the team for gambling on athletic events, the school announced Tuesday. The school said that seniors McKenzie Moore, Justin Crosgile and Jalen Ragland were dismissed from the team after an FBI investigation. UTEP said it was notified in December that two men's basketball players had bet on sporting events. The university then contacted the FBI. The investigation found that a third player was also involved. The investigation found no indication of point-shaving but showed that they all participated in gambling on one or more sporting events. There's no indication that they bet on their own games. ""To date we have no evidence of point-shaving involved,"" Ricardo Adauto, the school's executive vice president of legal affairs, said in a Tuesday afternoon news conference. Per NCAA rules, gambling carries a one-year suspension and the loss of eligibility. Because all three players are seniors, their collegiate careers effectively are over. They are no longer enrolled at UTEP. ""We evaluate every film after every ballgame, and I was not suspicious of any behavior that would have said that they were betting on any UTEP event,"" head coach Tim Floyd said. ""There's been no indication of that."" Moore -- the team's leading scorer -- and Ragland had not played the past two games. They were suspended indefinitely by the school in late December.","The University of Texas at El Paso found out about gambling in December .

"London (CNN) -- While President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping enjoy the Californian sunshine this week, a different kind of heat threatens Xi in his troublesome backyard, Tibet. Nearly 120 Tibetans have doused themselves in gasoline and set themselves alight in protest against Chinese occupation and repression. Most have died. Theirs is not the only form of protest. In November, students gathered in their hundreds in Chabcha (known in Chinese as Gonghe) county, Qinghai province, to protest the use of Mandarin, rather than Tibetan, as the language of education. In April, unemployed Tibetan graduates in Machu county, Gansu province, protested that Chinese immigrants were taking jobs, while last month, thousands of Tibetans converged on a pilgrimage site on Naghla Dzambha mountain to prevent a Chinese company mining it. The default Chinese response to protest is to use force. In its official human rights report this year, the U.S. State Department described repression in Tibet as ""severe,"" noting abuses such as ""extrajudicial killings, torture [and] arbitrary arrests."" In March, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee described Tibet as among the world's ""most repressed and closed societies."" The cycle of repression and protest goes on. Just last week Tenzin Shirab, a 31-year-old nomad, died after setting himself on fire. In 2011, the self-immolation of another young man, Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, was said to be the catalyst for the Arab Spring, an outpouring of long-repressed desire for freedom that was hailed by world leaders. But you will search in vain for any stirring words on Tibetan freedom from President Obama or other world leaders. Western politicians perform a careful dance in relation to Tibet. Those who elect them want them to speak out for freedom and human rights; China, reported to hold more than one-fifth of the United States' total foreign-held debt, wants them to shut up. Realpolitik dictates appeasement: electoral politics requires tough talk. The result is a mess. There have been countless official ""expressions of concern"" about the situation since the self-immolations started to spread two years ago, and we are constantly reassured that private channels are being used to apply pressure to China. Officials and junior ministers are permitted to issue calls for restraint. But there is a ceiling above which such statements do not go: leaders remain mute. President Obama has not publicly addressed the issue of human rights in Tibet since taking office. Secretary of State John Kerry has made one careful comment since his appointment, but there is no evidence he raised Tibet during his visit to China in April. China recently threatened commercial consequences for the UK unless Prime Minister David Cameron apologized for meeting the Dalai Lama in private last year. His response -- while falling short of an apology -- reassured them that the UK views Tibet as part of China, and failed to mention human rights at all. Sinologists -- and spin doctors -- in Washington or the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth office may argue that Tibet will benefit from a sensitive approach. Late last year, however, two British government ministers who had been leaned on not to meet with the Dalai Lama for fear of offending China again, finally lost patience with that view, writing that ""where Tibet is concerned, the Chinese government does not respond positively to any conciliatory gesture ... but instead interprets this as a sign of weakness and so makes further demands for concessions."" What goes for London goes for Washington -- and Berlin, Paris and Ottawa for that matter. Western policy on Tibet is pleasing no one -- not China, not the electorates, and certainly not Tibetans. It must be changed. China's economic engine is slowing, and Beijing is acutely conscious that without growth, its 1.3 billion people will be far less tolerant of continued dictatorship. Between 250 to 500 public protests are already estimated to take place every day in China -- foreign trade and investment will dry up if China starts to look like an unstable place to do business. Reform is in China's interests. China also seeks legitimacy as a full member of the world community and is undoubtedly sensitive to criticism on human rights. This year, it seeks election to the U.N.'s Human Rights Council (HRC). While economic muscle helps it win nations' votes for the HRC election, it still needs to offer its potential voters some tokens of sincerity. More tellingly, China actually accepted 42 out of 99 recommendations to improve its performance on human rights following its last full human rights review by the UN in 2009. In choosing not simply to reject that kind of external assessment, China has also accepted the need to demonstrate progress. It faces another such review this year. Beijing has not gone soft, however. It will not choose to show progress on Tibet, unless it is called to account for Tibet. No one expects President Obama to embarrass his guest this weekend with tasteless honesty or Arab Spring-style rhetoric on Tibet. But bringing Tibet to the table will show China and the American people he represents that he recognizes the old model has failed. China, the U.S. and Tibet all stand to benefit from that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eleanor Byrne-Rosengren.","Eleanor Byrne-Rosengren: Obama should raise issue of Tibet during meeting with Xi .

"East Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- A man who police say might have looked to the work of an infamous Cleveland serial killer for his inspiration was formally charged Monday in the deaths of three women whose bodies were found over the weekend, two of which are still unidentified. Michael Madison, 35, was ordered held on $6 million bond after authorities filed three counts of aggravated murder and three counts of kidnapping against him. The bodies were found within a few blocks from each other in East Cleveland over the weekend. The first victim was found Friday in the garage leased by Madison. She was naked with signs of trauma, police said. Two other bodies were found Saturday -- one in an abandoned house, the other in a nearby field. One of those women was wearing a green hoodie, and the other was wearing a leopard-print leotard. All three victims appear to be young black women. Their decomposed bodies were wrapped similarly in plastic garbage bags and taped up, authorities said. Mayor Gary Norton believes the killings happened over a 10-day period and that the same assailant is responsible. Norton identified one of the women, previously known as Victim No. 2, as Angela Deskins, 38, of Cleveland. Help sought to ID two other victims . Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner Thomas Gilson pleaded with help from the public to identify the other women, one of whom had several tattoos, including two featuring the name ""Gene."" Their identification could take days, he said. East Cleveland police Chief Ralph Spotts declined to answer questions about the case. ""This is an ongoing investigation. We are nowhere near done,"" he said. Madison might have been influenced by serial killer Anthony Sowell, who was sentenced to death in 2011 after being convicted of killing 11 women in Cuyahoga County, Norton said. ""Unfortunately, this is a sick individual who appears to have been influenced by another sick individual,"" Norton said over the weekend. ""If he had been out for one more hour, there's no telling what would have happened."" Spotts and Norton thanked residents who assisted in the weekend search for potential victims. Some 100 people helped, they said. Fast facts on serial killers . Who is the suspect? The trail that led to Madison's arrest began with a foul odor coming from the garage he leased, East Cleveland police Detective Sgt. Scott Gardner said. That's where police found the first body. Authorities got a search warrant for Madison's apartment Friday and found ""additional evidence of decomposition"" there, Gardner said. Police later found Madison at his mother's house in nearby Cleveland. After a standoff, he was taken into custody. When detectives returned to Madison's neighborhood to scour for evidence Saturday, they found the other two bodies in the field and the abandoned house. According to police, Madison was convicted of attempted rape in 2001 and is a registered sex offender. CNN could not immediately reach a representative for Madison. Shaeaun Child, a neighbor who tipped police off about the foul smell in the garage, told CNN he knows Madison. He said the two once argued over a blocked driveway. ""From what I know, he was an OK person when I first met him. And then from there, he actually, he had a lot of conflicts with different girls that he knew,"" Child said.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Egyptians, angered by their nation's slow progress toward reforms, converged in Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square on Friday to pressure the interim government to speed up the process. Protesters are determined not to leave until their demands are met, said Walid Rashid, one of the founding members of Egypt's pro-reform April 6 youth movement. Their intentions to stay were reflected in the number of tents that popped up in the square, the center of the revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak from power February 11. Five months after that historic event, Egyptians are disgruntled with the slow pace of change. Some protesters said they planned to remain in the square for 18 days, the length of the revolution. In recent days, anti-government demonstrations have raged, sometimes devolving into clashes. On July 2, armed men attacked protesters at the square. A group called the January 25 Coalition has issued a range of demands, calling for the removal of Cairo's head of security and an investigation into the violence at the rallies. The group, named for the day anti-government protests began this year, also called for the release of those detained after the demonstrations. The military-led government that took over when Mubarak resigned has been prosecuting several former officials accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters. A police officer accused of killing 20 protesters during a January 28 demonstration has been sentenced to death. Mubarak is scheduled to face the Cairo Criminal Court on August 3 on charges of corruption and deaths of protesters, officials said. At least 25 former Egyptian government officials have been referred to the Cairo Criminal Court with charges related to the February 2 attack in Tahrir Square, known as the Battle of the Camel, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor's office. They include former members of parliament, businessmen and members of the dissolved National Democratic Party. The suspects include Safwat El Sherif, the former head of the Shura Council, and Fathi Suror, the former speaker of the Egyptian parliament. Egypt's military rulers have set parliamentary elections for September. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Some protesters plan an 18-day stay in Tahrir Square .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has withdrawn two mobile ballistic missiles from a launch site in the eastern part of the country, according to a U.S. official, the latest hint of an easing in tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The disclosure came Monday, the day before President Barack Obama is due to meet with his South Korean counterpart, Park Geun-hye, in Washington. During a fraught period last month that included near daily North Korean threats of war, U.S. and South Korean officials said they believed Kim Jong Un's regime could carry out a test launch of at least one of the missiles at any time. The United States and Japan responded by stepping up missile defenses in the region. But the anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founder on April 15, seen as the likely date around which a launch could take place, came and went without either of the missiles being fired. And now they have been sent to a storage facility, the U.S. official said. The missiles the North has moved from the launch site are believed to be Musudans, an untested weapon that the South Korean government says has a maximum range of 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles). That would mean the missiles could reach as far as Japan and Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases. More tests will take North Korea closer to nuclear missile, Pentagon says . Recent tensions . The recent period of tensions flared up after the North's long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February, both of which were widely condemned. Pyongyang's fiery rhetoric intensified in March as the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the regime following the nuclear test. Annual U.S.-South Korean military drills in South Korea also fueled the North's anger, especially when the United States carried out displays of strength that included nuclear-capable B2 stealth bombers. But a key part of the large-scale training exercises, known as Foal Eagle, concluded last week, and the intensity of Pyongyang's threats appears to have subsided. Its rhetorical exchanges with Washington and Seoul have shifted to include conditions for possible negotiations, although both sides appear to remain far apart. North Korea is demanding recognition as a nuclear power, something the United States refuses to countenance. And the recent crisis resulted in the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. Analysts and U.S. officials have cautioned that Kim Jong Un's regime remains unpredictable and that tensions could escalate again in the event of new provocations. It would be ""premature"" to make a judgment about whether the North Korean ""provocation cycle is going up, down or zig-zagging,"" Daniel Russel, White House special assistant and senior director for Asian affairs, said Monday. ""No one should be prepared to declare a victory yet,"" he said, referring to the reports of the missiles being moved off the launch site. Last remaining South Koreans leave joint industrial complex . A fresh warning from the North . A reminder of the fragile situation came in a North Korean statement Tuesday that accused U.S. and South Korean forces of carrying out naval shelling drills near the two Koreas' disputed western maritime border. The statement, from the North Korean military's command in the sector near that part of the border, warned of ""immediate counteractions"" if ""even a single shell"" from the drills fell within its territorial waters. But the statement was notably free of the talk of ""nuclear war"" that peppered North Korean propaganda directed at the United States and South Korea during the height of the tensions in March and April. At a news briefing in Seoul, Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean defense ministry, denied the North's accusation that shelling drills had been taking place in the sea near the border since Sunday. He confirmed, though, that planned annual naval drills to practice the defense of islands near the border were under way. In November 2010, North Korea shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. Pyongyang accused Seoul of provoking the attack by holding a military drill in the area. The current situation regarding North Korea is chief among the subjects on the agenda for Obama and Park's meeting on Tuesday. Obama will use Park's visit to ""reaffirm the strong commitment"" of the U.S. to the defense of South Korea, Russel said Monday. CNN's Brian Walker and Lesa Jansen, and journalist Soo Bin Park contributed to this report.","Two Musudan missiles have been sent to a storage facility, a U.S. official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a series of floor speeches Thursday, a group of mostly Democratic women senators made a high-profile and at times emotional appeal to Republicans to support an expanded Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). In doing so, they suggested Republicans were blocking the bill because it would extend its protections to illegal immigrants as well as gays and lesbians. Many Republicans were furious at that suggestion and accused Democrats of election-year politics by trying to paint Republicans as anti-women. ""Let me put this on the table,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. ""This bill includes lesbians and gay men. The bill includes undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse. The bill gives Native American tribes authority to prosecute crimes. In my view these are improvements. Domestic violence is domestic violence."" Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the lone Republican to join in the floor speeches, said domestic violence victims in her state are often isolated in rural communities ""where there is no law enforcement and there is no shelter and there is nowhere to go,"" she said. ""The Violence Against Women Act is, I think, a ray of hope for those who service victims of domestic violence and sexual assault within our villages."" ""Nobody opposes the reauthorization of this legislation,"" Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Senate Republican, told CNN. ""If you follow the Judiciary Committee work on it, the questions had to do with the additions that have been made to this bill related to illegal immigrant visas, related to the additional sums of money and grants that would be available and the like. ""So what Republicans are focusing on is how to make a bill that should be reauthorized functional in this day and age of significant budget constraints so we can still accomplish the goals of the legislation,"" Kyl continued. ""I really resent the implication by some of my Democratic friends that if you're trying to improve the bill that somehow you are for violence against women. That's reprehensible."" Asked whether the provisions about undocumented immigrants and gays and lesbians needed to be pulled from the bill, Kyl said: ""I don't know. Reasonable people ought to be able to sit down and work these things out."" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, accused reporters of ""carrying Schumer's water,"" when they asked him whether he opposed the bill because it would include illegal immigrants and gays and lesbians. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is the Democrats' top message strategist in the Senate. Republicans think it was his idea to suddenly put VAWA on the floor, just after high-profile battles over other women's issues -- like abortion and contraception -- were in the news. ""I'm always for the Violence Against Women bill,"" said Sessions who voted for a GOP alternative bill that was defeated in the Democratic-majority Judiciary Committee. But he said every time VAWA is up for reauthorization, ""if you don't agree with everything that's in it, they just attack you as being anti-women."" Sessions added that he was not aware until Thursday the Democrats bill extended to lesbian, gays and illegal immigrants but he acknowledged voters could misread Republicans' views on the bill. ""I think we should be sensitive to the impressions we cast by our votes and so forth but fundamentally you can't vote a piece of legislation you don't think is sound,"" Sessions said. One bit of evidence that Democrats were, in fact, trying to use the issue for their political advantage was a fundraising appeal e-mailed to supporters by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""Today we're seeing another stunning GOP attack on women's rights,"" exclaimed the appeal which asked for donations of $5 or more for the committee's ""Protect our Women's Rights Fund."" In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash Wednesday about the recent fight over contraceptives, Murkowski warned her party is in danger of angering women voters. ""I think my party is in an unfortunate place right now, as viewed by many, many women in this country who are feeling anxious about what they believe to be attacks on women's health,"" she said.","Several Republicans accused Democrats of election-year politics .

"(CNN) -- Oil leaking from a container ship that ran aground on a reef off the pristine east coast of New Zealand's north island has begun washing ashore. Clumps of oil have been found on Mount Maunganui beach in the Bay of Plenty. New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), is advising people to avoid the beach for health reasons. Oil began leaking from the Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, after it struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the coast of Tauranga, on the North Island, on Wednesday, creating a five-km (three-mile) slick. Efforts to recover oil from the grounded ship, now heading south down the coast, are being hampered by high winds and strong swells. Approximately 10 tonnes of fuel oil was transferred to tanks on board a barge before the recovery operation was suspended on Monday. Most of the 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel carried by the ship has remained within the vessel's hull. However, the ship has sustained some damage from current movements and has leaked a significant amount of oil, which MNZ estimates to be 130-350 tonnes. MNZ said dispersants are being tested on the oil that has leaked. However, there are sea swells of up to four meters, which can make it difficult for the dispersant to work. Worsening weather prompted the ship's crew to be evacuated as a precautionary measure after a mayday call was made on Tuesday. Naval architects and salvage experts on board the Rena are monitoring the vessel and have placed sensors to provide advance warning should the ship's structure come under too much stress. MNZ has established a one-kilometer maritime exclusion zone around the ship due to the health risk posed by the oil spill. National On-Scene Commander Rob Service said the operation to remove the oil from the ship, led by Svitzer Salvage, would be complex. ""There is no way of doing this quickly,"" he said. A rescue center has been set up in the city of Tauranga to clean oil from animals affected by the spill and MNZ has 12 teams working to assist oiled wildlife. Nine birds have been recovered -- seven little blue penguins and two shags, the agency said. About 300 defense force personnel are on standby for a shore cleanup if needed, the agency said. Officials fear the stricken ship may spill additional oil as its condition deteriorates. ""I think we'd expect that at some point to have further problems and potentially even break up,"" Transport Minister Steven Joyce told broadcaster TVNZ. Greenpeace expressed ""extreme concern"" about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants. ""This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea,"" the organization's Steve Abel said. ""Even a slow, and relatively accessible, oil spill like this one has clearly stretched New Zealand's response capability to its limits. ""It is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area, as well as numerous other marine species."" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said two inquiries had been launched into the incident to discover how the ship hit the reef. ""This is a very large ship, that in calm waters has hit an extremely well documented reef,"" he told Television New Zealand. ""Some serious questions need to be answered about why that happened and who is responsible,"" he said. CNN's Karen Smith and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Clumps of oil found on beach; ship's crew evacuated due to worsening weather .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the Japanese prime minister's visit to Yasukuni shrine last week, Japan's struggles to move forward from its wartime past are back in the headlines. Commentators decry that Shinzo Abe's visit will increase tensions in East Asia. They are right: this gesture will curdle Japan's already sour relations with South Korea or China, and indeed has already provoked the predictable outcry. But Yasukuni visits are a symptom, not the main cause, of Japan's poor relations with its neighbors. A country's commemoration is a vital part of its national identity, but depending on their political agendas, leaders constantly manipulate and negotiate national remembrance. Countries often glorify their own past, while vilifying their rivals' behavior and ignoring their suffering. One country's heroes are another's villains â€” as seen, for example, in the Palestinian decision to name a square after Dalal Mughrabi, a young woman who carried out the deadliest terror attack in Israel's history, killing 13 children among the 38 dead. This decision outraged Israelis; an adviser to the prime minister said it represented the ""glorification of murderers"" and was another example of ""incitement of hatred and violence against Jews and Israel."" On the other hand, for countries seeking reconciliation, leaders understand that they must avoid commemoration that antagonizes their partner. So, they look for inclusive, rather than alienating, ways to remember their heroes and history. Thus when the Poles and Germans commemorated the past, they mourned together at Krzyzowa, a site associated with the German resistance, which emphasized German honor rather than brutality. The French and West German leaders in 1984 clasped hands together at Verdun (the site of the bloody World War I battle where both countries experienced monumental losses). Later, French and German leaders, alongside their American, British and Russian counterparts, bowed their heads together at Normandy. Furthermore, reconciliation between the British and Irish was also reflected in and reinforced by commemoration. Last month in Belgium, leaders from the two countries, once bitter enemies, together paid respects to British and Irish who perished in the First World War. All these countries adopted unifying rather than divisive themes in their commemoration, because they perceived reconciliation to be a vital interest. In East Asia, a mix of domestic politics and strategic conditions are pushing in the opposite direction. China and Japan are struggling to define the rules of a region in which they are now both great powers. Tokyo resents and worries about Chinese air and naval incursions into the East China Sea, where the two countries dispute ownership of an island chain (known as Senkaku in Japan, Diaoyu in China). The Chinese see similar menace in Japan's efforts to control the islands. The Chinese also fear Shinzo Abe's desire to increase patriotic nationalism and to revise Japan's ""peace constitution"" to permit greater military assertiveness. As for South Korea, one might think that the rise of Chinese power would push Seoul closer to Tokyo, particularly since the two countries share an ally in the United States. But so far this has not been the case; Seoul enjoys excellent relations with Beijing, and has shown a strong tendency toward hedging between East Asia's great powers. Indeed, national remembrance in East Asia reflects that reconciliation is not a priority. In Tokyo, Abe's decision to visit Yasukuni was a clear choice to cater to a powerful conservative domestic political base, and to reinforce his ""patriotic"" agenda. Yasukuni enshrines among its 2 million souls 14 war criminals, and features a museum that whitewashes Japan's past aggression. With his visit, Abe has demonstrated that he sees nationalism -- a vital part of domestic mobilization against security threatsâ€”as more important than conciliation toward Seoul or Beijing. For their part, China and South Korea also remember the past in ways antagonistic to Japan. China's memory of the Nanjing massacre â€”such as at the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall-- depicts the Japanese as rapacious and incurably prone to aggression. Of course, the Chinese suffered terribly at the hands of the Japanese, and the Nanjing Massacre is a horrific blight on human history. Yet the Poles were no less wounded by the Germans, and they have chosen to reconcile with their former tormentors. Similarly, in a controversy similar to the one over Dalal Mughrabi Square, Chinese and South Koreans have recently decided to build a statue in Harbin, China, to honor a man who assassinated a Japanese leader there. In 1909, Ahn Jung-geun shot Ito Hirobumi, a highly decorated, four-time Japanese prime minister and resident-general of Japanese-occupied Korea. South Korean soccer fans have also unfurled massive banners of Ahn at matches against the Japanese national team. Outraged, Tokyo calls Ahn a criminal. Some have likened the statue in Harbin to building a statue to Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas. Commemoration is not the root cause of poor relations in Northeast Asia; it is a window to just how distant relations are there. Instead of looking for ways to honor and show respect for one another's heroes and history, they remember in ways that humiliate and antagonize. Sadly, as long as prevailing strategic trends continue, we are likely to see more of the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Lind.","Jennifer Lind: Visit by Japan's prime minister to war shrine provoked objections from China .

"New York (CNN) -- Beyond the unhealthy influence that our demand for factory-farmed meat has in the area of food-borne illness and communicable diseases, we could cite many other influences on public health, most obviously the now-widely recognized relationship between the nation's major killers -- heart disease, No. 1; cancer, No. 2; and stroke, No. 3 -- and meat consumption. Or, much less obviously, the distorting influence of the meat industry on the information about nutrition we receive from the government and medical professionals. In 1917, while World War I devastated Europe and just before the Spanish flu devastated the world, a group of women, in part motivated to make maximal use of America's food resources during wartime, founded what is now the nation's premier group of food and nutrition professionals, the American Dietetic Association. Since the 1990s, the group has issued what has become the standard we-definitely-know-this-much summary of the healthfulness of a vegetarian diet. The association takes a conservative stand, leaving out many well-documented health benefits attributable to reducing the consumption of animal products. Here are the three key sentences from the summary of the relevant scientific literature. One: Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence, and for athletes. Two: Vegetarian diets tend to be lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, and have higher levels of dietary fiber, magnesium and potassium, vitamins C and E, folate, carotenoids, flavonoids and other phytochemicals. Three: Vegetarians and vegans, including those who are athletes, ""meet and exceed requirements"" for protein, the paper notes elsewhere. And, to render the whole we-should-worry-about-getting-enough-protein-and-therefore-eat-meat idea even more useless, other data suggest that excess animal protein intake is linked with osteoporosis, kidney disease, calcium stones in the urinary tract and some cancers. Despite some persistent confusion, it is clear that vegetarians and vegans tend to have more optimal protein consumption than omnivores. Finally, we have the really important news, based not on speculation, however well-grounded in basic science such speculation might be, but on the definitive gold standard of nutritional research: studies on actual human populations. ""Vegetarian diets are often associated with a number of health advantages, including lower blood cholesterol levels, lower risk of heart disease"" (which alone accounts for more than 25 percent of all annual deaths in the nation), ""lower blood pressure levels, and lower risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index"" (that is, they are not as fat) ""and lower overall cancer rates"" (cancers account for nearly another 25 percent of all annual deaths in the nation). If it's sometimes hard to believe that eschewing animal products will make it easier to eat healthfully, there is a reason: We are constantly lied to about nutrition. Let me be precise. When I say we are being lied to, I'm not impugning the scientific literature but relying upon it. What the public learns of the scientific data on nutrition and health, especially from the government's nutritional guidelines, comes to us by way of many hands. From the start, those who produce meat have made sure that they are among those who influence how nutritional data will be presented to the likes of you and me. Consider, for example, the National Dairy Council, a marketing arm of Dairy Management Inc., an industry body whose sole purpose, according to its Web site, is to ""drive increased sales of and demand for U.S. dairy products."" The council promotes dairy consumption without regard for negative public-health consequences and even markets dairy to communities incapable of digesting the stuff. As it is a trade group, the dairy council's behavior is at least understandable. What is hard to comprehend is why educators and government have, since the 1950s, allowed the dairy council to become arguably the largest and most important supplier of nutritional-education materials in the nation. Worse, our present federal ""nutritional"" guidelines come to us from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the very same government department that has worked so hard to make factory farming the norm in America. The USDA has a monopoly on the most important advertising space in the nation, those little nutritional boxes we find on virtually everything we eat. Founded the same year that the American Dietetic Association opened its offices, the USDA was charged with providing nutritional information to the nation and ultimately with creating guidelines that would serve public health. At the same time, though, the USDA was charged with promoting industry. The conflict of interest is not subtle: Our nation gets its federally endorsed nutritional information from an agency that must support the food industry, which today means supporting factory farms. The details of misinformation that dribble into our lives (like fears about ""enough protein"") follow naturally from this fact and have been reflected upon in detail by writers like Marion Nestle. As a public-health expert, Nestle has worked extensively with government -- on ""The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health,"" for one -- and has had decades of interaction with the food industry. In many ways, her conclusions confirm what we already expected, but the insider's perspective she brings has lent a new clarity to the picture of just how much influence the food industry, especially animal agriculture, has on national nutrition policy. She argues that food companies, like cigarette companies, will say and do whatever works to sell products. They will ""lobby Congress to eliminate regulations perceived as unfavorable; they press federal regulatory agencies not to enforce such regulations; and when they don't like regulatory decisions, they file lawsuits. Like cigarette companies, food companies co-opt food and nutrition experts by supporting professional organizations and research, and they expand sales by marketing directly to children."" Regarding U.S. government recommendations that tend to encourage dairy consumption in the name of preventing osteoporosis, Nestle notes that in parts of the world where milk is not a staple of the diet, people often have less osteoporosis and fewer bone fractures than Americans do. The highest rates of osteoporosis are seen in countries where people consume the most dairy foods. In a striking example of food industry influence, Nestle argues that the USDA has an informal policy to avoid saying that we should ""eat less"" of any food, no matter how damaging its health impact may be. Thus, instead of saying ""eat less meat,"" which might be helpful, it advises us to ""keep fat intake to less than 30 percent of total calories,"" which is obscure to say the least. The institution we have put in charge of telling us when foods are dangerous has a policy of not (directly) telling us when foods, especially if they are animal products, are dangerous. We have let the food industry craft our national nutrition policy, which influences everything from what foods are stocked in the health-food aisle at the local grocery store to what our children eat at school. In the National School Lunch Program, for example, more than half a billion of our tax dollars are given to the dairy, beef, egg and poultry industries to provide animal products to children, despite the fact that nutritional data would suggest we should reduce these foods in our diets. Meanwhile, a modest $161 million is offered to buy fruits and vegetables that even the USDA admits we should eat more of. Wouldn't it make more sense and be more ethical for the National Institutes of Health, an organization specializing in human health and having nothing to gain beyond it, to have this responsibility? The global implications of the growth of the factory farm, especially given the problems of food-borne illness, antimicrobial resistance and potential pandemics, are genuinely terrifying. India's and China's poultry industries have grown somewhere between 5 and 13 percent annually since the 1980s. If India and China started to eat poultry in the same quantities as Americans -- 27 to 28 birds annually -- they alone would consume as many chickens as the entire world does today. If the world followed America's lead, it would consume more than 165 billion chickens annually, even without an increase in population. And then what? Two hundred billion? Five hundred? Will the cages stack higher or grow smaller or both? On what date will we accept the loss of antibiotics as a tool to prevent human suffering? How many days of the week will our grandchildren be ill? Where does it end? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Safran Foer.","Safran Foer:  Food industry influences what stores stock, what schoolchildren eat .

"(CNN) -- Police have released dramatic security camera footage they say shows masked and hooded rioters firing shots at unarmed officers and a police helicopter in the English city of Birmingham. They hope the public will come forward with information as they investigate the violence that took place amid widespread rioting earlier this month. The footage shows a group of 30 to 40 young men, dressed in black, in the Newtown area of Birmingham as they attacked a pub late on Tuesday August 9, West Midlands Police said in a statement. As police tried to disperse the group, petrol bombs were thrown at a police car and shots were fired, police said. Officers believe the rioters intended to set fire to the pub. Chief Constable Chris Sims said the incident was being treated as attempted murder and arson. The force has taken the ""unusual step"" of releasing the footage because of the potential for serious harm to his officers and members of the public, he said. ""Eleven shots were fired at unarmed officers to enable disorder to continue, whilst petrol bombs were also thrown at officers who initially attended the scene,"" he said. ""This footage shows seemingly co-ordinated criminal behaviour with no regard for people's lives, whether it be through the setting of a fire, shooting at unarmed officers or shooting at the police helicopter."" West Midlands Police have so far arrested more than 500 people over the disturbances in Birmingham and nearby towns, of whom more than 140 have been charged. On Friday, Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, visited areas of Birmingham affected by the disorder. They met with residents including a small business owner whose store in central Birmingham was looted, local community leaders and emergency responders. Among the places they visited was Winson Green, an inner-city area where three young Asian men were killed by a hit-and-run driver amid the disturbances. Four men have been charged over their deaths and police continue to question other suspects. An eighth man was arrested Friday on suspicion of murder, police said.

"(CNN) -- Costa Rican officials plan to close the country's public zoos and open the cages where animals have been kept. Environment Minister Rene Castro says the country, long known for its biodiversity, is going in a new direction to protect wildlife: ""No cages."" Explaining the plan to close two public zoos next year, Castro described a memory from his childhood. When he was growing up, his grandmother had a pet parrot, Castro told Costa Rica's La Nacion newspaper last week. ""One day, we took the parrot out to the patio, and a flock of wild parrots passed, and the parrot went with them,"" he told La Nacion. ""It made a big impression on me because I thought that we were taking good care of her. We fed her with food and affection. ... all these things that we as humans thought she liked. And when she had the chance, she left."" As part of the government's plan, the Simon Bolivar Zoo in the capital of San Jose -- which currently houses hundreds of animals -- will be transformed into a botanical garden. And the Santa Ana Conservation Center west of the city will be turned into a park. The animals housed in the facilities will either be released into the wild or sent to animal sanctuaries, CNN affiliate Teletica reported. Environmentalists have criticized the country's zoos, arguing that cramped cages and unsanitary conditions are bad for animals there -- claims that zoo officials have denied. A veterinarian at the Bolivar zoo said environmentalists and the government don't know what they're talking about. In his view, animals shouldn't be released back into the wild or sent to a rescue center. ""If they close it down, none of the animals here could be released. Most have permanent injuries. Even though they have been treated, these injuries prevent them from flying or seeing well,"" veterinarian Randall Arguedas told Teletica. ""Some have simply lost their natural instincts. In other words, they will always have to live in captivity."" For the Bolivar zoo, there are also legal issues to consider. The facility was franchised to a foundation called Fundazoo 20 years ago. Fundazoo officials argue that they can run the zoo until 2024 because the government missed a deadline to cancel the franchise. ""The contract's clause that speaks about the renewal says that it renews automatically if neither party indicates that it doesn't want to extend it within the first quarter of the contract year,"" Fundazoo Director Yolanda Matamoros told Teletica. ""Their deadline expired on August 10 of last year."" The move to shutter zoos and ban cages is the latest step by Costa Rican officials who say they're aiming to protect animals. The Central American country banned circuses with animal acts more than a decade ago. Sport hunting is also banned. The most recent dispute over zoo animals has already made its way to the courts, and much like the animals at its center, it's already getting wild.","Costa Rica plans to close two public zoos next year .

"(CNN) -- Les Paul, whose innovations with the electric guitar and studio technology made him one of the most important figures in recorded music, has died, according to a statement from his publicists. Paul was 94. Les Paul, whose innovations helped give rise to modern pop music, played guitar into his 90s. Paul died in White Plains, New York, from complications of severe pneumonia, according to the statement. Paul was a guitar and electronics mastermind whose creations -- such as multitrack recording, tape delay and the solid-body guitar that bears his name, the Gibson Les Paul -- helped give rise to modern popular music, including rock 'n' roll. No slouch on the guitar himself, he continued playing at clubs into his 90s despite being hampered by arthritis. ""If you only have two fingers [to work with], you have to think, how will you play that chord?"" he told CNN.com in a 2002 phone interview. ""So you think of how to replace that chord with several notes, and it gives the illusion of sounding like a chord."" iReport.com: Do you play a Les Paul guitar? Guitarists mourned the loss Thursday. ""Les Paul was truly a 'one of a kind.' We owe many of his inventions that made the rock 'n roll sound of today to him, and he was the founding father of modern music,"" B.B. King said in a statement. ""This is a huge loss to the music community and the world. I am honored to have known him."" Joe Satriani said in a statement: ""Les Paul set a standard for musicianship and innovation that remains unsurpassed. He was the original guitar hero and the kindest of souls. Last October I joined him onstage at the Iridium club in [New York], and he was still shredding. He was and still is an inspiration to us all."" In a statement, Slash said, ""Les Paul was a shining example of how full one's life can be; he was so vibrant and full of positive energy.""

Even as a child he showed an aptitude for tinkering, taking apart electric appliances to see what made them tick.  Watch Paul dazzle on his guitar » . ""I had to build it, make it and perfect it,"" Paul said in 2002. He was nicknamed the ""Wizard of Waukesha."" In the 1930s and '40s, he played with the bandleader Fred Waring and several big band singers, including Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and the Andrews Sisters, as well as with his own Les Paul Trio. In the early 1950s, he had a handful of huge hits with his then-wife, Mary Ford, such as ""How High the Moon"" and ""Vaya Con Dios."" His guitar style, heavily influenced by jazzman Django Reinhardt, featured lightning-quick runs and double-time rhythms. In 1948, after being involved in a severe car accident, he asked the doctor to set his arm permanently in a guitar-playing position. Paul also credited Crosby for teaching him about timing, phrasing and preparation. Crosby ""didn't say it, he did it -- one time only. Unless he blew the lyrics, he did one take."" Paul never stopped tinkering with electronics, and after Crosby gave him an early audiotape recorder, Paul went to work changing it. It eventually led to multitrack recording; on Paul and Ford's hits, he plays many of the guitar parts, and Ford harmonizes with herself. Multitrack recording is now the industry standard. But Paul likely will be best remembered for the Gibson Les Paul, a variation on the solid-body guitar he built in the early 1940s -- ""The Log"" -- and offered to the guitar company. ""For 10 years, I was a laugh,"" he told CNN in an interview. ""[But I] kept pounding at them and pounding at them saying hey, here's where it's at. Here's where tomorrow, this is it. You can drown out anybody with it. And you can make all these different sounds that you can't do with a regular guitar."" Gibson, spurred by rival Fender, finally took Paul up on his offer and introduced the model in 1952. It has since become the go-to guitar for such performers as Jimmy Page. ""The world has lost a truly innovative and exceptional human being today. I cannot imagine life without Les Paul,"" said Henry Juszkiewicz, chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitar, in a statement. ""He would walk into a room and put a smile on anyone's face. His musical charm was extraordinary and his techniques unmatched anywhere in the world."" Paul is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Inventors Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is survived by three sons, a daughter, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Until recently he had a standing gig at New York's Iridium Jazz Club, where he would play with a who's who of famed musicians. He admired the places guitarists and engineers took his inventions, but he said there was nothing to replace good, old-fashioned elbow grease and soul. ""I learned a long time ago that one note can go a long way if it's the right one,"" he said in 2002, ""and it will probably whip the guy with 20 notes.""","Les Paul, guitar and studio innovator, has died at 94 .

"(CNN) -- The latest controversy over whether North Korea has the technology to fit a nuclear warhead on a missile is not the first time American intelligence agencies have been at odds in assessing Pyongyang's capabilities. And it is not the first time the Pentagon's intelligence arm, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has been out front in reaching the most alarmist conclusions about North Korea -- one with which other U.S. agencies have disagreed. The DIA assessment, disclosed by a Congressman at a hearing on April 11, was that the DIA has ""moderate confidence"" North Korea has developed a nuclear warhead that can be delivered by a ballistic missile. Within hours, however, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, released a statement saying the DIA report did not represent the consensus of the intelligence community, and that ""North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile,"" -- a view echoed by a Pentagon spokesman and the South Korean Defense Ministry. Secretary of State John Kerry also noted that ""it is inaccurate to suggest that the DPRK has fully tested, developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report."" READ MORE: Kerry visits South Korea amid North Korea's nuclear threats . The sharply different judgments about Pyongyang's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998, when a fierce debate erupted within the American intelligence community after U. S. spy satellites discovered an underground complex at Kumchangri, not far from North Korea's main nuclear facility at Yongbyon. The DIA insisted that Kumchangri was a construction site for a secret, underground nuclear weapons facility and that its existence proved Pyongyang was cheating on the Agreed Framework, the Clinton administration's 1994 deal under which the North froze operations at Yongbyon in return for economic and diplomatic concessions from Washington. ""The DIA was adamant,"" then-National Security Adviser Sandy Berger recalled in a 2007 interview for my book, ""Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis."" ""They said they could see the roads that were characteristic of this kind of facility, they could actually see that this hole was perfectly suited for a nuclear reactor,"" he said. Other intelligence agencies at the time, including the CIA, were more skeptical. ""I looked at the evidence,"" one senior Clinton administration official told me during research for my book, ""and I could easily see innocent explanations for virtually everything they pointed to. And others in the intel community looked at exactly the same stuff and heard the DIA's arguments about it, and said essentially, this is really flimsy stuff."" On August 17, 1998, the New York Times published a story that revealed the intelligence findings, turning what had been an internal intelligence debate into a public firestorm of controversy -- just as the congressman's revelations did on Thursday. The Times report, with headline ""North Korea Site An A-Bomb Plant, US Agencies Say"" created major problems. In Washington, the Clinton administration came under attack for Pyongyang's alleged violations of the Agreed Framework. And, unless the issue was handled with great skill, the tenuous link between the U.S. and North Korea that has existed since the 1994 deal would collapse. In the spring of 1999, Chuck Kartman, Washington's Special Envoy for Peace Talks with North Korea -- nicknamed ""Iron Butt"" for his ability to sit patiently and listen to North Korean envoys spew out venom, bombast and threats across the negotiating table -- engaged in protracted talks with his North Korean counterparts. In May, Kartman convinced the North to agree to permit U.S. inspectors to visit Kumchangri. In addition, after initially demanding a payment of $300 million dollars for a one-time visit, North Korea eventually accepted a shipment of 100,000 tons of potatoes as the ""price"" of permitting the inspection. Accompanied by a team of experts, Kartman flew to Pyongyang and the North Koreans took them to Kumchangri. To the Americans' surprise and embarrassment, they found a large, empty underground cave. There was no evidence of a secret nuclear site. The crisis passed. According to Gary Samore, then the National Security Council's Senior Director for Non-Proliferation and subsequently President Obama's Coordinator for Weapons of Mass Destruction, Counter-Terrorism and Arms Control: ""The conclusion was that Kumchangri was not configured in a way that could be used either for plutonium or for enrichment. So, whatever we thought Kunchangri was, it wasn't. It was not nuclear-related."" Nearly two decades later, the purpose of the construction site at Kumchangri remains unknown. But the episode underscores the complexities of assessing intelligence on North Korea. The rush to judgment in 1998, driven by the DIA's aggressive briefings and the deliberate leak of the story to the media, left many officials at the time cautious, if not downright skeptical, about subsequent intelligence findings. ""DIA hyped their findings unbelievably,"" one former senior Clinton administration official said to me. ""They mis-stated their level of certainty, and the further up the food chain they went, the more they dropped the caveats, and ended up putting us in a terrible position."" Gary Samore had accepted the DIA's analysis, and lobbied strongly for the Clinton administration to make Kumchangri a major issue. ""Sandy Berger [President Clinton's National Security Adviser] depended pretty heavily on my judgment,"" he told me, ""and I feel that my recommendation to him that it was a serious issue led the administration to deal with it more seriously than it ever turns out is justified. I would say that was the biggest mistake I made in my career as a civil servant."" The Kumchangri episode does not mean the DIA is necessarily wrong in its current assessment of North Korean nuclear capabilities. But the skepticism expressed by other agencies after Thursday's revelation carries a lesson. In a country which the former deputy head of the CIA, John McLaughlin, once described to me as an ""intelligence black hole,"" serious analysts can reach sharply differing conclusions about the same evidence, and the public should be careful in taking every alarmist headline about North Korea at face value.

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- A joint Cambodian-United Nations court, currently trying five former members of the ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge group on war crimes charges, is itself facing allegations of corruption and bribery. Cambodia's Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith says no proof of kickbacks or corruption has been found. Two employees of the court's Office of Administration told CNN of an ongoing kickback scheme involving Cambodian staff. The staffers asked their identities be protected out of fear of retribution to themselves and their families. ""We are talking about 30 to 40 or even a little bit more ... a month,"" said one employee, referring to the total amount allegedly taken from employees. ""Thousand dollars. Thirty or 40,000 dollars a month."" Cambodian staff at the office, they say, are forced to hand the money over -- a chunk of their salaries -- and the funds go to an official. ""They are supposed to pay a certain amount (of) money -- a certain percentage,"" the employee said. ""So every month, they have to put it in an envelope -- and give it to ... each section has one person go around to collect it ... the money is in cash, in U.S. dollars."" There is no suggestion that the court's judges or lawyers -- who are hearing and presenting the case against the former Khmer Rouge leaders -- are involved in the alleged corruption. The Cambodian government told CNN a senior Cambodian court official was investigated for corruption, but was exonerated. ""They told me they cannot find any proof of kick-back or corruption,"" said Khieu Kanharith, government information minister. ""If you want the court -- the trial -- to go ahead, separate the two cases."" However, a defense attorney for one of the defendants said the trial and the allegations of corruption are inextricably linked. ""What's really disturbing is that by the time the judges make their decision, every piece of evidence, every bit that they look at and evaluate and deliberate on, will have passed through the office of administration and will have literally passed through the hands of people who we say have dirty hands,"" said Andrew Ianuzzi, a consultant for defendant Nuon Chea's legal team. Defense attorneys say they plan to bring up the corruption allegations during the trial in an effort to discredit the court. The Cambodian government refused United Nations requests for an independent international war crimes trial for the Khmer Rouge defendants, agreeing only to a joint trial where the government participates along with the international judges.  Watch a report on the trial a Khmer Rouge torture camp commandant » . Prosecutors are attempting to prove that the five defendants played a significant role in the deaths of as many as two million Cambodians during Khmer Rouge rule of the country from 1975 to 1979. The trial has already cost $56 million, more than $10 million per defendant. But the court has asked for another $50 million to carry it through the end of 2009. The total could go higher if the trial continues into 2010. The United Nations says its internal affairs body -- the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) -- is investigating the corruption allegations within the court, but won't elaborate. ""This matter has been under investigation by OIOS, whose work is confidential,"" the United Nations said in a statement. ""The result of the probe will be submitted to the Cambodian government for further action."" In a letter sent to attorneys for the trial defendants, Sean Visoth, the head of the court's Office of Administration, writes that his office has ""never tolerated any kind of corruption or malpractice."" Visoth says the court now has an anonymous ""complaint mechanism"" in place. Meanwhile, however, independent trial monitors say they believe a culture of fear prevents other current and employees from coming forward. ""At the court, I have heard people express concerns about loss of their job, repercussions or retaliations against their families, and also some possibility of physical fears,"" said Heather Ryan, a Khmer Rouge trial monitor. The employees spoke out, saying they were fully aware of the risk. ""To me, it is really sick. How can you take money from people each month and look people in the eye and say, 'Oh, I don't know anything about it?'"" one employee asked.","Joint Cambodian-U.N. court is facing allegations of corruption and bribery .

"(CNN) -- A Montana judge, who drew a firestorm of criticism after sentencing a former high school teacher to a month behind bars for raping a 14-year-old girl, is going to retire at the end of the year. Judge G. Todd Baugh told CNN affiliate KTVQ his decision is unrelated to the controversy involving Stacey Dean Rambold. Yellowstone County District Court judge came under fire in last year when he ordered Rambold to serve 31 days in jail and more than 14 years on probation for the rape of the student who later committed suicide. In December, Baugh defended his decision, calling it ""the right kind of sentence."" ""If the Rambold thing was the only factor, I wouldn't retire for that,"" he said Monday. ""I'm 72-years-old, I guess I can retire."" Baugh was first elected in 1984 and is completing his fifth, six-year term as a district court judge, KTVQ reported. Retirement will ""allow me to spend a little more time with my grandchild and friends, and maybe even get in a few more rounds of golf,"" he said. ""God willing, I won't drive (my wife) Linda crazy."" Judge defends former teacher's one-month sentence . The controversy . There is a pending complaint against him before the state Judicial Standards Commission . In his response to the complaint, Baugh has acknowledged making controversial remarks about victim Cherise Morales at Rambold's sentencing in August. According to the Montana Attorney General's Office, the judge said she looked older than her years and was ""probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant."" Morales committed suicide in February 2010. ""I am sorry I made those remarks,"" the judge wrote in his November 15 response. ""They focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant."" Baugh said he weighed all relevant factors in passing sentence. ""The defendant's last legal or moral transgression was the crime he committed and admitted,"" he wrote. ""In the ensuing almost six years, he had legally and morally good conduct, he was reinstated in sex offender treatment and the undisputed evidence supported community placement and treatment."" The length of the sentence, Baugh's comments and the age disparity between defendant and victim drew criticism and a firestorm of media attention. The Montana Attorney General's Office in November appealed the 31-day sentence, saying it did not meet the state's mandatory minimum sentence. Rambold had sexual relations with Morales in fall 2007, when she was 14 and a student in one of his classes at Billings Senior High in Billings, Montana. She confided in a church group leader and Rambold was charged in October 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. Opinion: In Montana, a case study in rape culture .

"Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida (CNN) -- In a tightly controlled televised statement, golfer Tiger Woods gave an apology Friday for his ""irresponsible and selfish"" behavior, which he said included infidelity. ""I know I have bitterly disappointed all of you,"" said the golfer, dressed in a blue shirt and a blazer. ""For all that I have done, I am so sorry. ... ""I had affairs, I cheated. What I did was not acceptable, and I am the only person to blame."" Read the text and watch the full apology . The nearly 14-minute statement was his first public appearance since his November car crash outside his home near Orlando, Florida -- the beginning of what would become a torrent of bad news for the professional golfer, who is taking an indefinite break from his career. ""I owe it to my family to become a better person, I owe it to those close to me to become a better man. ... I have a lot of work to do, and I intend to dedicate myself to doing it,"" he said. Blog: Tiger has only delayed answering the hard questions . ""I ask you to find room in your heart to one day believe in me again."" Woods' appearance, at the TPC Sawgrass clubhouse in Ponte Vedra Beach about 11 a.m. ET, was carefully managed, with about 40 hand-picked people as an audience. iReport: Share your thoughts about Woods' apology . Although some members of the media were invited to listen to Woods' remarks, they were not allowed to ask questions. The large majority of reporters and media were housed at least half a mile away, where they watched the event on television. Woods' mother attended, although his wife, Elin Nordegren, did not. Woods spoke slowly and carefully as he stood at a lectern, which held a few pieces of paper. While his eyes appeared red, he showed control throughout the statement. He raised his voice at various points, including when he told the media to leave his family alone. After he finished speaking, he embraced his mother and a few others in the audience. The golfer said he was in in-patient therapy for 45 days from the end of December to early February for ""issues,"" which he did not explain. ""It's hard to admit that I need help, but I do. I have a long way to go,"" he said, adding that he is taking the first steps in the right direction. He said he will leave Saturday for additional treatment, but did not elaborate. Buddhism is part of his path to recovery, he said, explaining that he lost track of the faith that his mother taught him at a young age. Web lights up with Tiger Woods talk . Responding to rumors, Woods said that his wife never hit him, as some media reported in connection with the car crash, and that there has ""never been an episode of domestic violence"" in his relationship with his wife. ""Elin deserves praise, not blame,"" he said, and she has shown ""enormous grace and poise"" throughout the ordeal. Woods said the issue of whether he and his wife will remain together is for them to decide, emphasizing the privacy that he became known for before November. ""As Elin pointed out to me, my real apology to her will not come in the form of words, it will come from my behavior over time,"" he said. ""We have a lot to discuss. However, what we say to each other will remain between the two of us."" Afterward, Woods' mother, Kultida Woods, spoke to reporters, saying how proud she is of him. ""Golf is just like life, when you make a mistake, you learn from your mistake and move on stronger. That's the way he is,"" she said. ""I am upset the way media treated him like he's a criminal. ... He didn't kill anybody, he didn't do anything illegal,"" she said. ""They've being carrying on from Thanksgiving until now. That's not right."" The golfer's statement came amid the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. Accenture is among the companies that have ended relationships with the 34-year-old superstar. Accenture spokesman Fred Hawrysh said Thursday that the company did not think Woods' statement would be a distraction to the tournament, which began Wednesday in Dove Mountain, Arizona. Friday's session will begin well after Woods' remarks. Woods has won the event three times, according to GolfWeek Magazine. ""I have tremendous confidence in the golf media covering the tournament,"" Hawrysh said, explaining why he thought the statement wouldn't take away from the event. In his statement, Woods thanked Accenture and the players ""for understanding why I'm making these remarks today."" He also thanked the PGA Tour and its commissioner, Timothy Finchem. The commissioner called the golf star's public apology an ""effective step."" Famous sex scandals . The highly managed conditions of the statement also prompted the Golf Writers Association of America -- which was invited to have three members present and then later negotiated to have six -- to boycott the event. The association's president, Vartan Kupelian, said the group was still covering the event, but was simply not in the room. ""As long as we're not going to have the ability to ask questions, as long as we're just going to be standing there like props, there's no point of us being in the room,"" he told CNN. Former sportscaster Pat O'Brien criticized the way Woods seemed to be controlling the news conference. ""He might as well have done this on YouTube,"" O'Brien said Thursday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""But I do think that he's got to subject himself to some sort of question-and-answer at some point."" Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said the golfer feels that many of the issues he is dealing with are private, but that he still owes his fans an explanation. ""While Tiger feels that what happened is fundamentally a matter between him and his wife, he also recognizes that he has hurt and let down a lot of other people who were close to him,"" Steinberg said. He also let down his fans, Steinberg said -- another point Woods touched upon in his statement. ""Parents used to point to me as a role model for their kids,"" Woods said Friday. ""I owe all those families a special apology. I want to say to them that I am truly sorry."" Woods crashed his black Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and then a tree on November 27, just a few days after the National Enquirer reported he was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess, who denied involvement. A day after he paid his $164 traffic ticket, Woods' seemingly perfect world began to crumble under allegations of infidelity threatening his five-year marriage to Nordegren. The couple have two children: Charlie, 1, and Sam, 2. Woods had earlier issued an apology for ""transgressions"" that had let his family down, as several women reported they had affairs with the golfer -- including one who allegedly had Woods on a voicemail recording asking her to take his name off her cell phone because ""my wife went through my phone and may be calling you."" Celebrities recover from public scandals . In his Friday statement, Woods did not mention any mistress by name. A former porn actress, who said she had a three-year intimate relationship with the golfer, watched his apology Friday from Los Angeles, California. Veronica Siwik-Daniels -- whose film name was Joslyn James -- hugged attorney Gloria Allred and cried briefly as three dozen journalists and their cameras watched nearby. Allred, who also briefly represented another alleged Woods mistress, invited reporters to be in the room at a radio station as she and Siwik-Daniels watched Woods' televised statements live. Allred said Woods should publicly acknowledge his relationship with Siwik-Daniels and apologize to her by name. Although AT&T and Accenture ended their relationship with the golfer, other companies, including Nike and Pepsi's Gatorade, continue to sponsor him. Procter & Gamble's Gillette said it would stop airing commercials featuring the golfer for a while.

"Cleveland (CNN) -- The man accused of kidnapping three Cleveland women and holding them for close to a decade abused all of them but used captive Michelle Knight as his main ""punching bag,"" a family friend of one of the victims told CNN. The friend said suspect Ariel Castro hit Knight with a variety of objects, including hand weights. She has suffered vision loss, joint and muscle damage, and other problems from her time in captivity. Castro, 52, was jailed on charges of kidnapping and rape after one of the women, Amanda Berry, escaped from the home with the aid of neighbors on May 6. Knight, 32, stayed in the hospital for several days after the other two women left. She has released a statement saying she's doing well. ""I am healthy, happy and safe and will reach out to family, friends and supporters in good time,"" Knight said. According to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, the three women told police Castro had abducted them between 2002 and 2004, held them captive and sexually assaulted them. The family friend said Castro treated Berry slightly better than the other two women and Knight was treated the worst. All three women were underweight, the friend said. How the abductions happened . Berry gave birth to a daughter fathered by Castro, according to DNA testing by the Ohio state crime lab. Knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home, according to the incident report. When that happened, she told investigators, Castro ""starved her for at least two weeks, then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried."" Knight said he ordered her to deliver Berry's child, according to a police source familiar with the investigation. The baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid, the source said. Panic ensued soon after. The child stopped breathing, and everyone started screaming, the source said, citing accounts by the young women. Knight said Castro threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive, the initial police report states. ""What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old,"" the police source said. Castro intends to plead not guilty, his attorneys told CNN affiliate WKYC in an exclusive interview. ""I know the media wants to jump to conclusions and all the people in the community want to say terrible things about the person who's accused,"" attorney Jaye Schlachet told the station. ""We are not even at the beginning of the process. If this was a marathon race, we're not even at the starting line yet."" Castro's defense team may seek to move the trial out of the Cuyahoga County to improve their client's chances for a fair trial, lawyer Craig Weintraub said. He said Castro is ""completely isolated from society"" without access to television, radio or newspapers and is under suicide watch in a Cuyahoga County jail cell. I, too, am an abduction survivor . 'They're the true heroes here' On Wednesday, Cleveland police held a ceremony recognizing the work of officers who responded to the call at Castro's house. Patrol Officer Anthony Espada recalled the emotion at the scene. ""It just took everything to hold everything together. I tried to do my best to broadcast all the information over the radio without actually breaking down because I was on the verge,"" he said. ""They were just so brave, going through all that for all those years. They're the true heroes here."" He said officers didn't think twice about going into the house. According to the initial report, the women told investigators that they were chained in the basement but later were moved upstairs to rooms on the second floor. They were allowed out of the home only twice, and then just briefly. Since their release, Knight and Gina DeJesus, the third captive, have talked on the phone at least once, according to a source who has been talking to all the victims' families and attorneys. One of the them asked to speak with the other after they were freed, said the source. The women are learning how to use new, and not-so-new, technology they missed out on during their years in captivity, the source said. A glimpse of Castro's yard . Who is Michelle Knight? Knight's disappearance generated far less publicity and attention than did those of Berry and DeJesus, and a level of mystery still surrounds her case. Cleveland police removed Knight's name from an FBI database of missing people in November 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said. They did so after ""failing to locate a parent, guardian or other reporting person to confirm that Ms. Knight was still missing."" Police said, though, that her missing person's case remained open and was checked on as recently as November 2012. As of last week, her family still didn't know exactly where she was. Knight hadn't spoken yet with her mother, Barbara, a family spokesperson said. In fact, Knight's family had no idea where she was and had asked police for information on her whereabouts. What little is known about Knight's whereabouts comes from a source close to the investigation, who told CNN that Knight ""is in a safe place and very comfortable."" The source did not specify further. There were reports that Knight was at the DeJesus home, and there was a lot of activity there Saturday morning, but Knight was not there. Ohio women just want to be with families . The Knight family apparently has a fractured history. According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Knight became pregnant and dropped out of school. Her mother told the newspaper that she then became involved with an abusive man, who, she thinks, hurt her toddler grandson. The incident reportedly kicked off ""a chain of events that led Michelle to lose custody of the child."" Knight vanished soon after that, on a day she was set to make a court appearance in the custody case, Barbara Knight told the Plain Dealer. Times weren't always so tough for Knight though. Her mother recalled happier days, when her daughter had lots of friends and fed apples to a neighbor's pony. She liked fire engines and art class. After helping her mother deliver a litter of puppies, Knight decided she likely wanted to be a veterinarian, Barbara Knight told the Plain Dealer. ""I really miss her,"" she reportedly said. ""She was my daughter, but she was also my friend. She tried to make the best of her life and wanted to finish school. She never got the chance to go back."" Inside Cleveland's haunted house .

"State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky insisted in an interview Monday he is ""innocent"" of charges that he sexually abused young boys, denying to NBC's Bob Costas that he's a pedophile. In a telephone interview with NBC's ""Rock Center With Brian Williams,"" Sandusky admitted that some details in the graphic 23-page grand jury report released earlier this month are correct. ""I could say I have done some of those things,"" he said. ""I have horsed around with kids I have showered (with) after workouts. I have hugged them, and I have touched their legs without intent of sexual contact."" Still, Sandusky claimed he has been falsely accused of crimes. When pressed, the 67-year-old Sandusky said the only thing he did wrong was having ""showered with those kids."" Costas asked directly: ""Are you sexually attracted to underage boys?"" Sandusky repeated the question, paused, and responded, ""No. I enjoy young people."" Asked if then-head football coach Joe Paterno had ever spoken to him about his behavior or expressed disapproval, Sandustry said simply, ""No."" And asked if he felt guilty over the spreading fallout that has affected the university and prominent university figures including the fired Paterno, Sandusky responded, ""I don't think it was my fault. I obviously played a part in this ... I shouldn't have showered with those kids. That's what hits me the most."" Sandusky's lawyer, Joe Amendola, said Monday night that showering with children does not equate automatically to sexual assault. ""Jerry Sandusky is a big, overgrown kid. He's a jock,"" Amendola told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""The bottom line is jocks do that -- they kid around, they horse around."" Sandusky was arrested on November 5, after the release of the grand jury report detailing alleged crimes that he committed between 1994 and 2009. Some of those allegedly happened on Penn State's campus, including one witnessed by then-graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary in 2002. McQueary told Paterno what he had seen, and Paterno then alerted then-athletic director Tim Curley, but law enforcement didn't learn of the alleged incident until years later. In the interview with NBC's Costas, Sandusky flatly denied that McQueary witnessed what has been described in some accounts as Sandusky's rape of a young boy. He said instead that he and the boy were in the shower, ""snapping towels"" and engaging in horseplay. Regarding the 2002 incident, Amendola said ""the kid was messing around and having a good time"" in the shower with Sandusky, adding that McQueary felt ""uncomfortable"" upon seeing it. He denied the more graphic details offered in that and other allegations, claiming that the prosecution's case lacked sufficient evidence and witnesses. ""They have throwing everything they can throw up against the wall,"" Amendola said of prosecutors' case. "" And they're saying, (out of) all these accusations, some of them have to be true. But when you take it apart, they don't even have victims in several of their cases."" After Sandusky was charged this month with 40 counts of sexually abusing children, Judge Leslie Dutchcot freed him on $100,000 bail, against the wishes of prosecutors. A biography of Dutchcot posted on the website of the law firm Goodall & Yurchak lists her as a volunteer for Second Mile. It is not clear whether Dutchcot currently has any affiliation with the organization. CNN tried to contact the judge but has not received a response. School trustees fired university President Graham Spanier and Paterno last week on the heels of Sandusky's arrest, while McQueary was put on administrative leave. And on Monday, in an indication of the scandal's fallout spreading beyond Penn State, U.S. Navy spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Alana Garas said that the U.S. Navy secretary recommended that Spanier ""be removed from the board of advisers to the presidents of the Naval Postgraduate School and Naval War College."" Also on Monday, the board of directors for the charity that Sandusky founded -- Second Mile -- announced that its CEO had resigned. The CEO of 28 years, Jack Raykovitz, a licensed psychologist, ""and the board believe this is in the best interests of the organization."" David Woodle, the board's vice chairman, will take over day-to-day operations. Saying that the ""safety and well-being of the children"" is central to its mission, the board announced it will conduct an internal investigation and make ""recommendations regarding the organization's future operations. We hope to have those findings by the end of December."" The organization vowed to cooperate fully with the state attorney general's investigation. Sandusky molested young boys after developing close relationships with them through Second Mile, according to the grand jury report. The group said Sandusky has not been involved with its children since he told officials in November 2008 he was being investigated over ""allegations made against him by an adolescent male."" Sandusky and his wife were a host family through another charity, the New York-based Fresh Air Fund, which sends inner-city children to volunteer families and camps in non-urban locales, spokeswoman Andrea Kotuk said. She added that the charity isn't yet sure when the Sanduskys were hosts, saying workers there were reviewing records and cooperating with authorities in Pennsylvania. On November 7 -- two days after Sandusky's arrest -- the ex-wife of Sandusky's adopted son filed a petition for ""temporary emergency modification of custody,"" according to a filing by the woman's lawyer Justine F. Andronici. Jill Jones asked that her ex-husband, Matt Sandusky, ""not permit the children to be around Jerry Sandusky and that the children not be taken to Dorothy and Jerry Sandusky's residence."" The document claims that Matt Sandusky took the children to his parents' home on the day before the request was filed. The Sanduskys' neighborhood has been affected as well, with the road to his home blocked off and private property signs up on his lawn after police said a cinder block was thrown through a window there. Prosecutors: Coach went from mentor to predator . Since Sandusky was freed, an elementary school bordering his home has taken steps to ensure student safety. Sandusky's backyard is next to the playground at Lemont Elementary School. When he was released on bail, Sandusky, the former Nittany Lions defensive coordinator, was told not to go near children. State College Area School District Superintendent Robert J. O'Donnell told The Patriot-News newspaper by e-mail that the school principal ""has taken additional administrative action to ensure our children are safe."" O'Donnell didn't say what steps were taken. On Sunday, Melissa and Carl Anderson, the parents of two little boys who live near the school, questioned why he was out on bail. ""It baffles my mind,"" Melissa Anderson said. ""The presumption of innocence -- we all like to believe in that and we do in this country -- but I think there's a level of protection that a neighborhood and community is entitled to,"" Carl Anderson said. The Andersons were once such fans of the coach that they own an autographed, limited-edition copy of his book, ""Touched -- The Jerry Sandusky Story."" ""For me ... it alternates between anger and sadness,"" Carl Anderson said of his sentiments now. ""It really is a loss of wholesale community innocence."" How Paterno can promote healing . Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz have been charged with failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading investigators. Prosecutors determined they had a legal duty to report the alleged abuse, but not McQueary and Paterno. On Monday, the Big Ten Conference announced that Paterno's name is being pulled from the football championship trophy to be awarded next month at the conference's first championship game in Indianapolis, Indiana. ""The trophy and its namesake are intended to be celebratory and aspirational, not controversial,"" Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said in a statement. ""We believe that it's important to keep the focus on the players and the teams that will be competing in the inaugural championship game."" The trophy was going to be named after both Paterno, the winningest coach in top-level college football history, and Amos Alonzo Stagg, a founder of the Big Ten. It will now be called the Stagg Championship Trophy. New Penn State President Rodney Erickson, meanwhile, tried to help his school move on Monday -- after a week that he said ""tested the character and resilience of the Penn State community."" In a statement on the school's website, Erickson said he wanted to say ""how proud of I am"" of the school. He cited a candlelight vigil for abuse victims that thousands took part in Friday night and the Penn State-Nebraska football game on Saturday, which included a moment of silence. ""Today, we are back to class and the business of running this university,"" he wrote. ""Collectively, we need to show the nation and world that Penn State cares, and that Penn State is a community of individuals committed to moving forward with a shared sense of purpose."" CNN's Mary Snow and Sarah Hoye reported from State College; Josh Levs, Monte Plott and Dana Ford from Atlanta; and Barbara Starr from Washington.","NEW: Sandusky says Paterno never discussed his behavior with him .

"(CNN) -- People outraged by recent news of the National Security Agency's collection of phone records and Internet monitoring are taking action online. Mozilla, maker of the open-source Firefox browser, is leading a group of organizations in a campaign called StopWatchingUs, where people can sign a letter that will be presented to Congress. So far it has over 66,000 signatures. There are multiple petitions on the official White House petition site, including one to pardon Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor who leaked the documents, which has almost 63,000 signatures. (As of Wednesday afternoon, Snowden had not been criminally charged.) Another petition seeks to impeach a federal judge for ""authorizing warrantless NSA surveillance of millions of Americans' phone records."" It has just over 5,000 signatures. A petition needs 150 signatures to get on the site, and the White House says it will respond to any petition that gathers more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days. (The limit was first set to 5,000 signatures, but that number turned out to be too low and many silly petitions met the limit easily.) An online petition from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee PAC asking Congress to ""investigate spying on our phone calls"" has nearly 100,000 signatures. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a predrafted letter that people can automatically e-mail to their representatives. Change.org, a for-profit site that hosts petitions on a huge variety of issues, also has a number of NSA-related petitions. The Internet companies at the center of the NSA debate are also going into action. On Tuesday, Google's legal team sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director Robert Mueller asking for permission to publish the number of national security requests it receives. Facebook and Yahoo followed suit with similar letters. Online political activity has been called ""clicktivism,"" or the more dismissive ""slacktivism,"" in the past. Registering outrage or supporting a cause by filling out a form online or changing a Facebook profile photo takes less effort than showing up in person to a protest, volunteering at a charity, or even calling or sending an e-mail directly to a representative. But a 2011 study by the Center for Social Impact Communication at Georgetown University found that people who were taking to social media for political action were just as likely to donate money as people who didn't, and more likely to volunteer or take part in real-world actions like rallies. Nationwide physical protests are being organized on Reddit and Twitter for the Fourth of July. The ""Restore the Fourth"" rallies will focus on perceived Fourth Amendment violations. Last year, online activism proved itself with a big real-world win. To protest the Stop Online Piracy Act, people and companies across the Internet came together and signed online petitions, changed avatars, and e-mailed representatives. The big moment came when Wikipedia and other sites went dark and Google censored its logo, adding a link to an online petition that went on to gather more than 4.5 million signatures. ""We need to rekindle that energy more than ever so our elected officials take the necessary actions to illuminate how current surveillance policies are being implemented,"" Mozilla's Alex Fowler said in a statement announcing StopWatching.Us.","People protesting recent NSA news are taking action online .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel is getting used to life as Formula One's lone racer. The four-time world champion jokes that he has become something of a 'Sunday driver' -- it's just that he irritates those on the road behind him by being too quick instead of being proverbially slow behind the wheel. ""It is a Sunday afternoon drive,"" he mused to CNN after winning the penultimate race of the season in Austin, Texas. ""But not in that regard."" Along with his faithful Red Bull steed, Vettel has powered to four straight world championships and polished off a record-equaling nine consecutive race wins at the season ending Brazilian Grand Prix. Even more mind boggling, is the fact that he has won at least three of those races 30 seconds ahead of the next car -- an enormous margin by the sport's modern standards. When it was pointed out at the United States Grand Prix that the reigning world champion had won by a measly 6.2 seconds, he joked that perhaps the watching world was disappointed that he had not put his foot down. Class of one . For the sport's global audience of half a billion viewers and those watching from rival team garages, it is, of course, no joke. Vettel probably could have injected a turn of pace Speedy Gonzalez would have been proud of if he wanted to and won by a country mile. ""We just wanted to make sure there was plenty available,"" Red Bull team boss Christian Horner agreed after the Austin race. Despite being surrounded by a field of drivers that includes four world champions, Vettel has effectively been racing himself. So how does it feel to be driving in a class of one? ""It's not as if I've been getting bored,"" the 26-year-old German racer deadpanned. Even the best drivers in the world have to get the basics of motor racing right -- making a clean start, handling the seesawing balance of the car as it eats up fuel and managing the life of the tires to time the pit stops and maintain, or gain, an advantage over your rivals. ""Obviously I've quite a lot to do,"" Vettel explained. ""First of all, I have to match their pace. Obviously when they do come closer it's not the best feeling because you want the gap to increase always. ""Certainly it's a great feeling when you do pull away, and then it's about pacing yourself, pacing yourself to get the range, to look after the tires etc. ""There are a lot of things going on but also it's a nice feeling to have a little bit of a gap because you can take it a little bit easier in some crucial places, to look after the tires and benefit from that, especially later on in the stint. ""Overall, you do tend to have quite a bit of work in the car."" Team orders . Vettel has won 13 races in 2013 but not all of them have been at a canter. The 26-year-old caused a stink when he ignored team orders to snatch victory from his Red Bull team mate Mark Webber in Malaysia. Then in Germany he fended off the Lotus drivers while in Japan, Vettel clawed back victory, again from Webber, on tire strategy. The 10 other race victories? Well, they can be summed up by a single word -- dominance. There have been signs that perhaps Vettel, the lone racer, has been finding other ways to keep himself busy in the car. For one thing, the German claimed the DHL award for setting the highest number of fastest laps during the races in a single season. In 2013, Vettel set the fastest lap seven times -- and yes, there is actual silverware to add to his bursting trophy cabinet. There have also been hints that Vettel has been amusing himself by testing the limits of his Red Bull team, as he pushes the limits of the car. His level-headed race engineer Guillaume ""Rocky"" Rocquelin has often had to be the voice of reason on the pit-to-car radio warning Vettel to be patient, not to abuse the tires and to focus on ""distance not speed."" Even team boss Horner put on his best parental voice when he tried to persuade an impatient Vettel not to pass Webber for the victory in Malaysia, saying: ""This is silly, Seb."" Does Horner agree, I asked him at the Austin race, that Vettel has had to find new ways of testing himself by pushing the limits of his car and the team when he is able to win races so easily? ""What are you trying to say; that he'd like to go for it a bit more?"" Horner responded. ""Of course, Seb's very fixated on the fastest lap record, and he'd be enormously p****d off if he didn't get that trophy,"" he continued, with a dash of tongue in cheek humor. ""His enthusiasm runs away with him at times, I keep telling Rocky 'OK now you can slow him down.'"" Horner did, however, add that Vettel was equally comfortable notching up victories out in front or scrapping it out in a close fight with his peers. ""He enjoys competing, he enjoys winning and he'll do the best that he can in the circumstances, if that means going wheel to wheel with somebody he'll get satisfaction out of both. ""It's a question of managing the race. We've seen it with him so many times -- he's incredibly good at that."" Those racing behind the virtually untouchable German can also appreciate what Vettel has been able to achieve with car designer Adrian Newey's peerless Red Bull at his fingertips. Era of dominance . Mercedes' racer Lewis Hamilton, the 2008 world champion, told CNN he could barely remember winning a race by a clear 30 seconds -- although he did win a wet British Grand Prix in his championship-winning year with McLaren by more than a minute. ""In F1 it's always five seconds or maybe 10 maximum,"" Hamilton explained, when considering what it must have been like for Vettel to win races so dominantly in 2013. ""When you have that kind of gap you can just cruise; when you're that much faster than everyone you can just cruise, you've got no traffic, you've got time to pit, no-one in front of you -- it's really easy. ""When you have that time in the bag you don't make mistakes because you don't have to push to the limit. ""You can control it more and be more at ease and have more time to think about things. It's a much, much different position to be in than fighting in the midfield."" Hamilton, alongside fellow world champions Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen, publicly refused to declare the sport as boring under Vettel's era of dominance. But racing drivers have egos and inside they must privately acknowledge a gnawing sense of frustration that they have been fighting this season for the title of 'best of the rest'. Major rule changes loom large on the horizon in 2014 -- it's a chance for Formula One to press the reset button. Vettel may have raced off into the sunset as a lone racer in 2013 but next season he could find himself reunited with a posse of fierce racing rivals. For now, the achievements of his record season are still sinking in. ""It is very, very difficult for me to realize what we have achieved again,"" Vettel said as he faced the media for the final time at Brazil's season finale. ""I'm actually quite sad that this season comes to an end. Hopefully one day, when I've got less hair and I'm chubby then it's something nice to look back to.""","Sebastian Vettel won 13 of the 19 grands prix in the 2013 Formula One season .

"New York (CNN) -- I'm no stranger to poverty. I've lived it. I don't forget it. And when I saw Katherine M. pick up aluminum cans while walking her granddaughter home from school, I couldn't stop the rush of emotions. I wasn't reporting from a developing country. This was a New York street in the heart of Harlem. ""If I don't have my gloves, I don't dig into the garbage,"" Katherine said as she walked past dozens of black plastic trash bags that lined the street. I met her at a soup kitchen while covering a story about the end of the food stamp benefit boost from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ""You've gotta do your homework, and I've gotta do your hair,"" Katherine said with a smile to her 9-year-old granddaughter, Katherine. In 2004, her daughter died in childbirth, making the now-66-year-old a caretaker of three overnight. That's when she went back to changing diapers and taking care of two young boys with small attention spans and big appetites. Raising children on a fixed income was not easy for Katherine. Receiving $358 a month in food stamps helped but didn't cover all her grocery needs. On November 1, her food stamp benefits shrunk. That's when the boost in benefits from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ended. About 47 million Americans saw their benefits reduced, too. For Katherine, less food stamp benefits meant collecting more cans on the street and from friends. ""I tell everybody here, 'give me your cans,' "" she said. She redeems the cans for 5 cents each. Talking to strangers like me about her economic situation was not easy. ""I don't like that word, 'poor,' "" she said. ""I'm bent."" ""What does bent mean?"" I asked. ""Poor, but I don't like the word poor,"" she said. After Katherine's story aired, a generous viewer from Florida helped her shop for groceries so that this Thanksgiving, she doesn't have to sell cans to put food on the table. Life has been rough on Katherine, but you'd never know from the constant smile on her face. She laughs about the small joys in life and about its tough lessons, as well. ""Here, you pick that up for me,"" Katherine instructed her young granddaughter, pointing to a bottle resting against a fence. Young Katherine used her small hands to pick up the bottle and give it to Grandma, who put it in a small black plastic bag. We all continued walking. As I observed and listened, I could feel a knot growing in my throat. ""I don't want her to feel ashamed because she have to pick up cans to eat or get the things that she needs,"" Katherine said as she looked in every direction for plastic or aluminum. ""No matter how people look at you, you keep your head up."" ""Do you think it's an important lesson?"" I asked. ""Yeah, it shows young kids how to be independent,"" she responded. By this time, I was holding back my tears. It was a lesson I learned too, at a very early age. And I was seeing another young girl receive the same advice. According to Feeding America, 15.9 million American children lived in food-insecure homes in 2012. While many American children are thinking about the latest version of their favorite smartphone or tablet this season, millions of children across the country, like little Katherine, don't know where their next meal will come from.

"(CNN) -- The separatist group behind a series of bombings on a Spanish vacation island marks the 50 year anniversary of its struggle this year, a milestone that sees it no closer to achieving its goal. Police cordon off the route leading to the location of the latest blasts in Palma de Mallorca. ETA, which is fighting for the independence of Spain's northern Basque region, was said to be behind three bombs that detonated on the island of Mallorca on Sunday without hurting anyone. The latest incident appears to be part of a new wave of attacks, including another in Mallorca which killed two Civil Guard officers in July, which have left a 2006 cease-fire a distant memory. The violent resurgence also defies Spanish government claims that the group's operational capabilities have been broken by a series of high profile arrests in Spain and France. ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by Spain the European Union and the United States, began campaigning for Basque independence in 1959. The group, whose full name Euskadi Ta Askatasuna means ""Basque Homeland and Freedom"" in the Basque language, killed what some say was its first victim in 1968. Since then it waged a campaign of violence against the Spanish state, targeting politicians, policemen, judges and soldiers, often clocking up numerous civilian casualties with deadly car bombs. In 1980 alone ETA was blamed for 118 deaths, and in 1995 it nearly succeeded in assassinating Jose Maria Aznar, then leader of the opposition and later Spain's prime minister. On September 16, 1998, the organization declared a ""unilateral and indefinite"" cease-fire, raising hopes that its campaign was at an end. ETA called off the cease-fire in November 1999, however, and 2000 saw a sharp escalation in violence. Another unilateral cease-fire was declared in March 2005, with ETA raising hopes for a lasting peace by declaring it ""permanent."" It was called off by ETA in June 2006 following numerous more ETA attacks. At the center of the struggle is a region know as Euskal Herria in Basque. The area straddles the western end of the Pyrenees, covering 20,664 square kilometers in northern Spain and southern France. See map of territory claimed by Basque separatists . Spain officially recognizes three Basque provinces, Alava, Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya. A fourth neighboring province, Navarra, is of Basque heritage. Separatists consider these four provinces plus three in France -- Basse Navarre, Labourd and Soule -- as the Basque country, with a population approaching 3 million. The area has always possessed a fiercely independent instinct. The Basque people are the oldest indigenous ethnic group in Europe and have lived uninterrupted in the same region since the beginning of recorded history. Their language, Euskera, which is spoken regularly by about 40 percent of Basque inhabitants, bears no relation to any other Indo-European tongue and dates back to before the Romans arrived in Spain. For many centuries the Basques of Spain enjoyed a strong degree of autonomy. The Basque region's hilly landscape helped keep its people isolated from outside influences. In the Spanish Civil War, two Basque provinces -- Guipuzcoa and Viscaya -- fought against Gen. Francisco Franco, while the provinces of Alava and Navarra fought for Franco. Under Franco's dictatorship (1939-75), most of the Basque region had its remaining autonomy rescinded. Its culture, people and language were suppressed. ETA and its demands for an independent Basque state arose in 1959 in the midst of this suppression. ETA has focused its activities on the Spanish side of the border. For many years France provided a safe haven for ETA members, a situation that began to change in the mid-1980s. The organization has financed its campaign through kidnapping, bank robbery and a so-called ""revolutionary tax"" on Basque businesses -- a payment widely regarded as plain extortion. According to the counter-terrorism office of the U.S. State Department, ETA members received training in Libya, Lebanon and Nicaragua, while the group also enjoyed close links with the Irish Republican Army. The Good Friday peace accord influenced ETA to call its cease-fire in 1998.","Basque separatist group ETA formed in 1959 began violent campaign in 1968 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs has agreed to pay $20 million to current and former military personnel to settle a class action lawsuit on behalf of the men and women whose personal data was on a laptop computer stolen during a burglary. The names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of about 26.5 million active duty troops and veterans were on the laptop and external drive, which disappeared while in the custody of a Veterans Affairs data analyst in 2006. The theft led to an urgent search by federal authorities that ended with recovery of the laptop and a conclusion that the missing data had not been improperly used. ""The defendants [VA] have agreed to pay a lump sum of $20 million to the plaintiffs inclusive of fees and costs in exchange for the dismissal of this litigation,"" according to the settlement document. In a statement, the VA said it ""is committed to being the 'gold standard' in data security, just as we are a leader in the health care industry. We want to assure veterans there is no evidence that the information involved in this incident was used to harm a single veteran."" The settlement, announced in U.S. District Court in Washington, was reached ""in the interests of avoiding the expense, delay, and inconvenience of further litigation of the issues raised in the class complaints,"" the agreement says. The funds will go to military personnel and veterans who were harmed by the loss of personal data, either through emotional distress or through costs incurred in monitoring credit records. The settlement ends nearly three years of litigation. After the May 3, 2006, theft, five veterans groups filed the class action suit initially seeking $1,000 in damages for every veteran whose information was compromised in the computer theft. On June 29, 2006, the FBI announced the stolen laptop had been recovered and that it appeared no one had accessed the personal data. The FBI said it believes the laptop was taken in a routine burglary.","Laptop had data on 26.5 million active duty troops and veterans .

"(CNN) -- The most decorated skier in U.S. history is out for the season -- but not for the rest of her career, experts say, thanks to dramatic advances in treating even some of the worst kinds of knee injuries. Lindsey Vonn, 28, was taking a run on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria when she crashed Tuesday. Heart-stopping video of the crash shows Vann shoot over a hill and attempt to land the jump off-balance. Her right knee twists and slams into the mountain, causing her to flip over and smack into a gate. Vonn had to be airlifted off the mountain. On the video, she can be heard screaming in pain through the rescue operation. Doctors will have a better sense of Vonn's injuries once the swelling goes down and the fluid decreases, experts say. As of Wednesday, the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association said Vonn had been evaluated and released from the Schladming Hospital. Dr. Christian Kaulfersch, who treated Vonn at the Austrian hospital, said she doesn't need surgery right away, but that she suffered from a ""complex torn ligament"" in her right knee. Her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) are torn and Vonn has a lateral fracture of the tibial plateau, the upper end of the tibia or shin bone. Vonn faces race against time . ACL tears do require surgery, but MCL tears can heal on their own, according to doctors. It's the tibial plateau fracture that will need a much closer look and is the wild card in how long recovery may take, doctors say. First, Vonn will need time. The time will allow the MCL ligament and tibia break to heal on its own, depending on its severity, according to Dr. Jeffrey Webb, a professor of orthopaedics and sports medicine specialist at the Emory Sports Medicine Center. He's seen a lot of knee injuries over the years as the team doctor for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. ""With an MCL tear, you let it heal for two to four weeks and let the scar tissue build up, and only then do you want to go in and do the ACL reconstruction,"" Webb said. During this time, Vonn will likely wear a brace and try to get some motion back. It'll be painful to walk, so she'll be on crutches or even in a wheelchair. Doctors will continue to run tests to determine the extent of the injury. Doctors will use MRIs and CAT scans to determine what approach they'll have to take for the broken tibia. And only then will surgeons go in and repair the ACL and figure out if the MCL and bone break needs surgery. ""Back in the 1970s and 1980s we'd call this a career-ender of an injury, because doctors back then didn't know how to fix it, but we have better techniques and more practice at it, so we now call this injury -- even as horrific as it looked -- a 'career delayer,' "" said Webb. While the rate of injury for skiing overall has declined over the past 60 years because of better equipment and training, knee injuries remain common in the sport, particularly among women, according to a 2003 study. Alpine skiiers ""hold the notorious distinction of having among the highest rates of ACL injury of any activity or sport,"" study authors wrote. ""She's an amazing athlete. Just the amount of training and work that she puts in, I've seen firsthand in the past. If anyone's going to come back, she can,"" said Dr. Michael J. Rossi, one of the study's co-authors and an orthopaedic surgeon who works with the U.S. ski team under the direction of Dr. J. Richard Steadman. Champion skier Lindsey Vonn vows to fight on in bid to race the men . Recovery for a weekend-type athlete would be at least nine months, according to Webb. Recovery for a world-class athlete like Vonn is more in the six- to eight-month range, according to Dr. Tom Hackett, a Vail, Colorado-based doctor at the Steadman Clinic who often travels with the U.S. ski team and helps with team members' treatment. ""It is hard to know without all the information in front of me. There are many subtle decisions made on the day of operation,"" Hackett said. Vonn interviewed in 2010 . But with Vonn's physical condition and determination combined with her medical treatment, Hackett believes Vonn could recover before the Olympics, a year and a week away. Doctors will continue to work with her to help her stay in top shape even without a fully functioning knee. ""Typically when we manage an athlete of her caliber, we find ways to maintain fitness and strength and power as much as possible while she recovers,"" Hackett said. A six- to eight-month recovery time doesn't leave a lot of training time for the Olympics, but Vonn, a 2010 Olympic gold medalist, is determined to be there, according to her statement. ""First off, I want to say thank you to the amazing medical staff that cared for me. I plan on returning to Vail as soon as I can to have the necessary surgeries,"" Vonn said in the statement. ""I am also grateful to my fans for the outpouring of support, which has really helped me stay positive. I can assure you that I will work as hard as humanly possible to be ready to represent my country next year in Sochi (Russia).""

"Honolulu (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has now done what every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt has done -- visited the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Accompanied by his wife, Obama Thursday marked this year's 70th anniversary of the 1941 Pearl Harbor attacks by laying a wreath inside the memorial and scattering white, yellow and purple flower petals in the water above the wrecked ship. Sporting a dark suit -- attire Obama frequently wears in Washington but something that has not been seen on his current vacation -- the president observed a moment of silence while in the shrine room of the memorial. The president made no remarks while at the memorial, however, he marked the anniversary earlier in the month by releasing a statement that said, ""we salute the veterans and survivors of Pearl Harbor who inspire us still. Despite overwhelming odds, they fought back heroically, inspiring our nation and putting us on the path to victory."" Adm. Robert Willard, Navy commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, along with Donna Willard, the admiral's wife, also accompanied the first family at the memorial. Dedicated in 1962, the memorial sits above the sunken USS Arizona and commemorates the over 2,300 lives lost when Japan launched a surprise attack on the Navy base. That attack propelled U.S. military involvement in World War II and triggered the county's involvement in what came to be known as the Pacific theater. The stop was part of the Obama's larger Christmas vacation in Hawaii. Born in the Aloha state, the president has made Hawaii a regular vacation destination for his family while in office. This was not the president's first visit to the memorial; as president-elect Obama visited the memorial in late 2008.","This month marks the 70th anniversary of the attack .

"(CNN) -- The nine Supreme Court justices might be camera-shy, but a key federal appeals court is using its own technology to open up its most important proceedings to Internet viewers. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, has announced it will provide live streaming video for some of its oral arguments beginning Monday. Five appeals will be available online this week, beginning with a privacy case testing whether police can keep DNA profiles of criminal suspects, even after charges have been dismissed. Judicial officials say it is the first time a federal appeals court will use its equipment to offer live streams to the public, which can be accessed for free on the circuit's website, ca9.uscourts.gov. Media outlets, including CNN, have been allowed to record and air occasional high-profile appeals in the 9th Circuit and the New York-based 2nd Circuit in recent years. Most other federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have banned photographs and video. ""The 9th Circuit has a long history of using advances in technology to make the court more accessible and transparent,"" said Chief Judge Alex Kozinski. ""Video streaming is a way to open the court's doors even wider so that more people can see and hear what transpires in the courtroom, particularly in regard to some of our most important cases."" Under the new rules, all ""en banc"" oral arguments -- involving 11 judges sitting together in a courtroom at the 9th Circuit -- will be covered live through the court's website. Most such federal appeals are first heard by three-judge panels, and those hearings will not automatically be streamed live. The losing party at the three-judge stage can ask the court for wider en banc review, and typically involve matters of ""exceptional importance."" The court estimates about 20 en banc cases each year will be streamed live. Previous 9th Circuit cases that were televised by the media involved California's same-sex marriage ban, electronic surveillance by the government, affirmative action and international terrorism. The largest and busiest appeals court . All of circuit's 11 courtrooms are equipped with video cameras, and broadcast and cable news outlets have been allowed to access the feeds. About 378 media requests for photographic and video coverage have been granted in the past two decades, said officials. Among the 13 federal judicial circuits nationwide, the 9th is the largest and busiest, comprising of cases originating in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii, along with Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. Most appeals are heard at the James R. Browning Courthouse in San Francisco. Panels also convene occasionally in Pasadena, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle. Many at the 9th Circuit credit Browning for being a nationwide pioneer in bringing technology to improve public access in the courtroom and increase internal efficiency when managing a court's docket. ""The major innovations in court administration over the past 30 to 40 years, you'll find most of them started through the creative mind of Judge Browning,"" said Judge Sidney Thomas, a longtime colleague who was a 2010 finalist for a Supreme Court seat. ""We had e-mail in the 9th circuit 20 years before anybody heard of the term, and this from a judge who has never been able to operate a computer."" Browning served on the circuit from 1961 until his death last year. He was chief judge from 1976 to 1988. The Judicial Conference, the third branch's policymaking board, allowed federal courts of appeals in 1996 wide discretion to decide for themselves whether to allow cameras in its courtrooms. Three years ago, a pilot program was extended to federal district, or trial, courts. Fourteen such courts nationwide are participating, and nearly 150 civil proceedings are available to be viewed online. At almost 18,000, the case with the highest viewership involved a 2012 civil trial where several citizens alleged government surveillance of their phone and computer activity. Most federal courtrooms remain accessible for the public to watch in person, but seating can be limited. Baby steps at the U.S. Supreme Court . As for the highest court in the land, still no cameras, but incremental steps over the years to greater public access. Audio of that week's arguments are now posted Fridays on the Supreme Court's website. It may be the easiest to sample the flavor of public session: only about 330 courtroom seats are available to the public and only on a first-come, first-seated basis. A little-known fact about the high court is that it has been taping its arguments since 1955, initially in secret. Until three years ago, the audio from one term was not available until the beginning of the subsequent term, a wait of up to a year. And for decades, the only way to hear the reel-to-reel tapes was to go a National Archives and Records Administration annex in Maryland in person and listen on site. Typically only scholars and researchers were allowed access. Now all oral arguments from 2010 are easily available to listen or download on the website. Earlier Supreme Court cases are available on the website oyez.org, a digital archive run by Professor Jerry Goldman and the Chicago-Kent School of Law. But don't expect to soon see Justices Antonin Scalia or Sonia Sotomayor in their robes on CNN, mixing it up in the marble courtroom. Despite congressional efforts to introduce cameras there, the justices warn of unintended consequences. ""Please, senator, don't introduce into the dynamic that I have with my colleagues the insidious temptation to think one of my colleagues is trying to get a sound bite for television,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy told lawmakers in 2007. ""We don't want that. Please don't introduce this into our intercollegial deliberations.""","9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has been a technology leader .

"(CNN) -- This time of year, I am disturbed at the number of curveballs we see being thrown during the Little League World Series. I coached youth baseball for eight years, each spring and fall. Three years ago, I wrote that Little League Baseball should ban the use of the curveball by its young pitchers. The evidence seemed clear -- and sports injury doctors seemed to all agree -- that pitchers who were 13 and younger were not physically capable of handling the torque and strain on the elbow when throwing a curveball. The ulnar collateral ligaments connecting the lower and upper part of an arm simply couldn't survive the strain, they said. Now, there is evidence the curveball may not be entirely to blame. But there is still debate over whether it should be allowed at such a young age. Little League and others did separate studies -- and got somewhat similar results showing that injuries can result not just from throwing curveballs, but from kids throwing too much, with too little rest between pitching appearances. Little League instituted strict pitch-count and innings-pitched rules five years ago. But those rules don't apply to non-Little League-sanctioned games. ""The difference now is, kids are playing on a number of travel and showcase teams outside Little League, and they have no such rules,"" says Lance Auken, vice president of communications for Little League Baseball. ""Travel ball has no rules on pitch count or number of innings pitched. So you now have kids throwing 300 to 400 pitches over a four-day period,"" he says. Doctor: 'Don't throw curveballs until you can shave' Little League Baseball commissioned its study with USA Baseball and the University of North Carolina. More than 1,300 pitchers of all ages were examined. For the Little League age group, 409 pitchers were analyzed, looking for which factors influenced injury risk. ""What was causing arm problems was not the curve ball, but the overuse of the arm. It found no evidence to say breaking pitches caused no more injuries than any others,"" says Auken. Meanwhile, a group of doctors including Dr. James Andrews, the country's leading doctor in sports arm surgeries, conducted their own study. Andrews specializes in ""Tommy John"" surgery, which reconstructs the ulnar collateral ligament and is named after a former Major League pitcher. Andrews and his team at the American Sports Medicine Institute did their study in a laboratory, not on a field. And they found throwing a curveball enacts no more force on the arm than a fastball. But, they say, throwing curveballs early can lead you down a dangerous path later in a baseball career. ""Dr. Andrews still insists, 'Don't throw curveballs until you can shave,"" Lanier Johnson, Executive Director of ASMI told CNN. And, he acknowledges, ""That was a controlled lab setting. The field of play during a game isn't like that."" ""We've tracked Little League games right through the Little League World Series, and as the competition grows, the kids throw curveballs up to 70% of the time,"" Glenn Fleisig, ASMI's director of research and co-author of the Andrews study, told ESPN The Magazine. ""It's good that Little Leagues have enacted rules on pitch counts, but for say, a kid in the Dominican (Republic), if you see an unusually developed curveball at an early age, who knows the mileage on that arm?"" Johnson says, ""The kid who throws all those curve balls in the Little League World Series is a hero. But does he ever get a change to earn a college scholarship or sign a major league contract? Do you want to take a chance on your son or daughter to get a college scholarship? Do you want to be a hero at 13 or 14 but never much else after that?"" Surgery on the rise for young players? Even though Little League has instituted new pitch count rules, ASMI says Andrews has performed about seven times the number of arm operations on young pitchers that he did 15 years ago. So why not err on the side of caution and take Andrews' advice? ""(Andrews) himself will say that is an opinion of his, and is not based on any empirical data,"" Auken says. ""There wasn't any evidence in this study. It's a fine distinction between the two."" ""Little League has always been the leader in sports safety. We make changes in our sport based on data, not on feelings. We act out of scientific evidence,"" he says. However, Andrews' office does agree that kids who pitched while fatigued are 36 times more likely to have serious arm problems. Some 2.6 million kids play Little League baseball all over the world. Parents often are sizing up the competition for their 10- to 13-year-olds for future high school teams and college scholarships, and believe their kids should play as much as possible to improve their chances. Little League officials admit too much baseball is not healthy. ""Kids play year-round now,"" Auken says. ""Kids shouldn't be playing year-round in anything. If a parent is making a 10-year-old do that ... it will make them hate the game by the time they are 16 or 17 years old."" Andrews' group isn't alone on its curveball stance. Dr. Lyle Micheli, director of the Division of Sports Medicine at Children's Hospital Boston, told the Boston Globe in April that he still believes the curveball is best not thrown until a pitcher is at least 14. He also said kids shouldn't attempt to throw a slider, a pitch that puts even more stress on the elbow, until 16. Don Friend, an Atlanta-based pitching instructor and former scout for the Atlanta Braves and the Boston Red Sox, gave my son the same guidance in years of lessons. My son went on to pitch for NCAA Division III Piedmont College. Dr. Timothy Kremchek, an Ohio orthopedic surgeon who is the Cincinnati Reds' physician, told the New York Times this spring he performs 150 elbow ligament reconstructions a year. ""Seventy percent of those surgeries are pitchers who haven't hit college yet,"" Kremchek said. ""I ask each one the same question: When did you start throwing curveballs? And they say: 'I was 10. I was 11.' Sometimes, it's 9."" Five years ago, I attended a coaches' clinic at Georgia Tech that included the coaches and trainers of Georgia Tech and the Atlanta Braves. At the time, Georgia Tech had a team that counted and documented every pitch of the televised Little League World Series. Team members noted an increase in the use of the curveball every season. Andrews appeared in a video message, and all at the clinic agreed no one under 14 should be throwing the curveball. If you are watching the Little League World Series as a baseball purist, that sweeping hook of the curve can be a thing of beauty. But take a good look at the kids throwing them now. Chances are, you may not see them throw it or any other pitches without major surgery needed before they reach high school. So I will ask Little League again: Why not ban the curveball?","Evidence suggests that curveballs may not be entirely to blame for injuries .

"(CNN) -- Smartphones inch closer to becoming remote controls for your life at next week's 2013 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The annual event is the largest gadget conference in the world, where major technology companies and scrappy startups can show off their latest innovations. If the show sets the tone for the year's technology, 2013 will be about watching TV on your 5-inch smartphone while your self-driving car ferries you to work. Companies will continue to try to connect everything to the Internet -- lights, power outlets, cars, cameras, kitchen appliances -- and allow you to control them from a mobile device. There have been some big changes at this year's conference. Longtime headliner Microsoft has dropped out of CES, and mobile devices are increasingly saving their big announcements for the Mobile World Congress event in February. But hopefully the void is filled by exciting discoveries and gadgets we can't predict. Television: It's about the content . There will be wide, thin, innovative TVs at CES. They will have glorious high-resolution OLED screens and cost way too much money for the average consumer, when and if they become available. Samsung is teasing a TV that is a possibly a new shape or translucent, and Westinghouse has a 110-inch LED TV with 4K resolution. But the big television story this year will be the industry's continuing quest to break out of these beautiful boxes and move onto tablets and smartphones. How people consume content has changed drastically in the past few years. They are cutting cords with the cable companies and signing up for on-demand services such as Hulu and Netflix, or buying shows and movies through Amazon or Apple. Viewers want to watch TV on their smartphones and tablets. They are multitasking, watching the ""The Walking Dead"" while commenting on Twitter. In response, television companies will attempt to connect TVs to the Internet and share content between mobile devices, set-top boxes and televisions. Home automation and the art of connecting everything . There is very little in your home that won't be connected to the Internet if electronics manufacturers have their say. Cheap sensors are making it easy to turn devices you've used without much thought into ""smart"" devices that do a bit of the thinking for you. Connected devices for the home and your health will be plentiful at CES. Thanks to impeccable design, the Nest automated thermostat was one of the first commercial hits in this area, though others had tried integrating automation into existing home gadgets before. This year, smartphones will be on a bit of a power trip, getting apps to control home security, unlock doors, conserve energy and tinker with lighting. Cars get smarter and go online . Auto companies will have a larger presence at CES this year, with Ford, Toyota, Hyundai, Audi and others showing off technology to make cars smarter. There will be self-driving and assisted-driving cars, which use a combination of mounted cameras, sensors and GPS to can take the wheel completely or just help a driver into a tight parking spot. Vehicles are connecting to the Internet to improve navigation, better monitor a car's performance and alert the driver to maintenance needs. They are also taking a cue from (and synching with) smartphones. Cars will continue to integrate apps, voice control and entertainment into the dash, some even running on the Android operating system. The hot smartphone size is 5 inches . Mobile device unveilings probably will be at a minimum this year, since the major companies are saving their big announcements for the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona next month. There will be a few smartphones making their debut next week, though, and for the most part, they will have nearly identical specs: Android, 5-inch 1080p display, quad-core processor, 13-megapixel camera. A few entries could mix it up, including a rumored 6.1-inch Ascend Mate device from Huawei and the company's first Windows Phone 8 handset, the Ascend W2. Smartphone accessories will flood the floor, with the usual glut of headphones, cases and stands. Touchscreen computers and cheap tablets . Last year's hot computer was the super-thin ultrabook laptop, but that category has cooled down significantly. This year, the spotlight will be on tablet/laptop hybrids running Windows 8. The new Windows operating system is built for touchscreen computers, and manufacturers seem to be having some fun with the form factor. (Check out the Asus Taichi and Lenovo Yoga.) Cheap, sub-$100 7-inch Android tablets will still abound, but like smartphones, there won't be much in the way of innovation as companies hold back until February. Room for smaller, innovative companies . The big players lying low presents a great opportunity for the smaller exhibitors to get noticed and make connections. This year, innovative technology will come from unexpected places as smaller companies such as Pebble, a smart-watch company that got started as a Kickstarter campaign, debut products. Now that it's easier for a small operation to raise money and manufacture a physical product on a budget, the gadget market is ripe for a shakeup. Some big-name startups will also have a presence. Leap Motion will be on the floor, and its motion-sensing technology will appear in Asus notebooks this year. Razer will return this year after making a splash with its Project Fiona game tablet in 2012.","The annual Consumer Electronics Show kicks off Monday .
Televisions will be huge, and companies will experiment with new ways to deliver content .
Mobile devices will be generic, with a few 5-inch smartphones and cheap Android tablets .
With large companies lying low at CES, smaller players have a chance to stand out ."

"(CNN) -- A second former New Orleans police officer pleaded guilty Thursday in connection with police shootings of civilians on a Louisiana bridge in the days following Hurricane Katrina, authorities said. Jeffrey Lehrmann, a former police detective who now works as a special agent for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, pleaded guilty in federal court to a charge that he failed to report a cover-up in the investigation of the Danziger Bridge shootings in New Orleans, the Department of Justice said in a statement Thursday. Lehrmann also admitted he helped compile a false report on the incidents, and was with others when they planted a gun as part of the cover-up, according to court documents. Last month, former police Lt. Michael Lohman pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in connection with the cover-up. Two civilians were killed and four others wounded in the shootings on September 4, 2005, six days after Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast. In the first shooting, on the east side of the bridge, one person -- later identified as James Brissette, 19 -- was killed and four wounded, prosecutors said. In a second shooting, on the bridge's west side, Ronald Madison, 40, a severely disabled man, was killed. Madison's brother was arrested but later released without indictment, authorities said. ""The police maintained that they fired at the civilians in self-defense, after the civilian fired at police,"" the statement said. ""However ... Lohman pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring with other officers to cover up what he had determined was a 'bad shoot' on the bridge. Today, defendant Lehrmann admitted that he also knew of and participated in a conspiracy to obstruct justice in the investigation of the shooting."" Lehrmann faces a sentence of up to three years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced June 10, and Lohman faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine at his May 26 sentencing. Jim Letten, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, said that while Lehrmann's conviction is the second in the case, ""this officer was the first to enter into an agreement with the United States and provide cooperation."" Lehrmann learned from a New Orleans police supervisor, identified in court documents as ""the investigator,"" that an officer had ""shot an innocent man"" on the bridge, prosecutors said in the Department of Justice statement, citing the documents. Upon hearing that comment, Lehrmann determined it was a ""bad shoot,"" meaning it was not legally justified, authorities said. ""Lehrmann admitted that he participated with his supervisors in the creation of a report that included false statements by the officers involved in the shooting; false claims about a gun that had in fact been planted by the investigator; and fabricated statements from witnesses who did not really exist,"" prosecutors said. ""Lehrmann also admitted that the report of the Danziger Bridge investigation included false statements alleged to have been given by two of the victims of the police shooting."" According court documents, Lehrmann said the report of the incident indicated the investigator had returned to the bridge the day after the shooting and found a gun in the grass below the scene of one shooting. But Lehrmann said that story was ""a lie."" He told authorities that after the shooting, he and two sergeants drove with the investigator to the investigator's home, where the investigator retrieved a bag from his garage. Asked what was in the bag, the investigator said, ""A ham sandwich,"" according to the documents. ""Lehrmann then looked in the bag and saw a gun that would be used in the Danziger Bridge investigation,"" prosecutors said in the statement. ""Once the investigator assured Lehrmann and the sergeants that the gun was 'clean,' meaning it could not be traced to another crime, they all went along with the plan to plant the gun."" At the time of Lohman's guilty plea, authorities suggested that other indictments would follow. However, an information was filed in Lehrmann's case, showing he was not indicted. Informations can be filed when a defendant waives indictment by a grand jury, according to the federal courts' Web site. The shootings occurred after several officers, responding to a call for assistance, drove to the bridge and encountered six civilians who were walking across it to get food and supplies, according to the indictment filed in Lohman's case. The officers fired, killing Brissette, and then traveled to the other side of the bridge, where Madison was shot. Madison was shot seven times -- five times in the back, the coroner said. His brother, Lance, was arrested on suspicion of eight counts of attempted murder of a police officer and held for weeks before his release, according to the indictment. State prosecutors pursued criminal charges against several police officers without success. In August 2008, a judge quashed indictments against Sgts. Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius Jr., Officer Anthony Villavaso II and former Officer Robert Faulcon Jr., all of whom were facing first-degree murder and attempted murder charges. In addition, the judge threw out attempted first-degree murder charges against Officers Mike Hunter Jr. and Robert Barrios, and attempted second-degree murder charges against Officer Ignatius Hills. Federal prosecutors opened an investigation after the judge's actions. Legal scholars have said that while more might be indicted, it's unclear whether any other officers will be charged in the shootings. ""There's no evidence the officers shot out of malice,"" Dane Ciolino, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans' College of Law, said last month. ""It was probably negligence, ratcheted up to a federal offense by the cover-up.""","Former detective says he helped compile false report of police shooting .

"(Mental Floss) -- When it comes to the following tourist destinations, the trick will be getting there before the wrecking ball does. Limestone pinnacles do not make Nauru a pinnacle of success in the tourism business. 1. Nauru . This tiny island in the South Pacific may soon be completely uninhabitable, and it's all because the locals forgot to follow the Boy Scout motto: Be prepared. Since the turn of the 20th century, Nauru has been one of the world's prime sources for phosphate, a mineral compound formed over time from bird excrement, and an important ingredient in fertilizer. Phosphate mining quickly made Nauru rich, and at one point, the island even boasted the world's second-highest per capita GDP. But, as it turns out, basing your entire economy on dung can have its drawbacks. For one thing, phosphate is a limited resource. By 2000, many believed the island's supply had dried up. In fact, all mining ceased until the government managed to hunt down the last few traces of the mineral in 2006. But the phosphate will soon be gone, leaving Nauru without a profitable export and without decent, farmable land. That's because phosphate runs in veins throughout the limestone and coral foundation of the island. To collect it, miners have to rip up the ground, leaving pillars and pits of less-valuable land behind. About four-fifths of the island is now ravaged to the point that no crops can grow and no one can inhabit it. Worse, the ruined landscape collects heat, which ends up creating a pattern of warm air that prevents rain clouds from forming. Currently, Nauru imports almost all its food and water, and there don't seem to be any industries poised to replace mining once the phosphate is gone. 2. The Dead Sea . The Dead Sea is famous for being the lowest point on Earth (an ear-popping 1,400 feet below sea level) and for being so salty that humans naturally float on top of it. But in recent years, it's also become famous for the tremendous rate at which it's evaporating. Currently, the Sea recedes about 3 feet each year, leaving ever-growing plains of salty, puckered, sinkhole-prone dirt in its wake. To really understand the phenomenon, tourists need only visit the Ein Gedi Spa. When it opened 20 years ago, you could step out the back door and be within a few feet of the salty water. But today, the Sea has receded so much that the trek to its shore amounts to a 1-mile hike. The Dead Sea's imminent demise is also due to its neighbors' need for water. For the past several decades, Israelis, Palestinians, and Jordanians have been siphoning off more and more of the River Jordan -- the Dead Sea's primary water source. Growing populations and increased agriculture now require so much hydration that the Jordan is barely a trickle of its former self. Several solutions have been suggested, but the most promising is a canal that would funnel water from the Red Sea to the Middle East. The only problem is that the plan relies on Israel, Palestine, and Jordan engaging in long-term friendly relations -- something that may not happen in time to save the treasured landmark. 3. Mexico City . We've all felt that ""sinking"" feeling in the pit of our stomachs before, but imagine having it under the soles of your shoes -- all the time. That's part of life in Mexico City, which is built on the site of a former lake. In fact, the city was originally built on the lake, via a series of Aztec-designed aquatic platforms. Nifty as that was, the Spanish conquerors who tore through the land in the 16th century preferred a more traditional approach to urbanization, so they drained the lake and built a European-style city in the empty basin. Almost immediately, this proved to be a poor idea. Foundations sank into the soft clay and left many buildings tilting at odd angles. That alone might have made Mexico City just a little eccentric -- charming, even. But as its population ballooned during the 20th century, the government had to search for new sources of water. Officials ended up pumping much of the city's supply out of the underground aquifer that had once fed the lake, which amounted to yet another bad idea. As the aquifer emptied, the soft clay above sank faster and deeper. In the past century, Mexico City has sunk more than 30 feet. Even worse, there's no clear, practical plan today for how to stop the droop and still provide water for the area's 22 million people. We suggest you run for the border with a camera and click some pics while you still can. 4. Amish Country . Don't get us wrong; in 20 years, there will still be Amish people, and there will still be places known as ""Amish Country."" But, chances are, both will be very different from their traditional versions. The Amish, who originally emigrated from Europe in the 18th century, are most closely associated with farming and a technology-free lifestyle. And while the community has valued its isolation since the 1970s, those cultural norms have been shifting. The key culprit? The ever-skyrocketing price of land. Amish families typically have an average of seven children, which translates to a fast-growing population -- a population that's running out of room to expand. Because rural regions have become more popular with average Americans, many places that were farmland 20 years ago are now subdivisions, factories, and office complexes (not to mention a fair share of Amish Country tourist condos). Basically, the Amish need more land, but that land is now scarcer and more expensive. So what's a separatist religious community to do? In many cases, the answer has been ""become less separatist."" Today, a majority of Amish don't rely on farming as their sole source of income. Many have side businesses, often connected with the tourism industry, and some Amish have even taken jobs in non-Amish owned factories, making the old life increasingly difficult to maintain. 5. Freetown Christiania . The area now known as Freetown Christiania was originally a military base meant to defend one of the main waterways into the Danish capital of Copenhagen. But in 1971, it was captured by an invasion force nobody in the Danish military expected -- hippies. At the time, the base wasn't being used, so it was pretty easy for a gaggle of unarmed characters to take over. Beyond simply staging a short-term sit-in, the group hunkered down for the long haul and declared the abandoned base its own autonomous country. With little resistance from Denmark's tolerant government, the residents of Christiania spent the next several years building a society where all property is collectively owned, all decisions are made by painstaking group consensus, and all marijuana is openly grown and sold. Through the years, the hippies became entrepreneurs as well -- founding businesses, opening cafes and music venues, and even inventing and marketing a transport bicycle perfect for moving large loads through Christiania's car-free streets. Despite its status as one of Copenhagen's top tourist attractions, Christiania's days may be numbered. Since 2004, the newly elected conservative government has been cracking down on the hippie enclave -- first by staging a major drug bust and, more recently, by instituting a redevelopment plan for the land (which is still, technically, federal property). One major change tentatively approved by Christiania residents in April 2007 would turn the Citizen's Council into a regular public housing association and greatly increase rents. According to the Copenhagen Post, adult Christianians previously paid about $45 a month into a common fund to live there. Now, they'll have to pay the government closer to $800 a month. In addition, the plan gives the government the authority to tear down some hippie-built homes and replace them with (gasp!) condos. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Like a stereotypical beauty pageant, it looks like thin will be in at the world's largest annual gadget convention next week in Las Vegas. At the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show, computer makers will be pushing a new breed of ultra-thin, ultra-light laptops amid a sea of razor-thin smartphones and tablets. Last year, 140,000 people in the technology industry convened at the Las Vegas Convention Center to mingle and gawk at cutting-edge hardware. The organizers expect to welcome at least that many people next week. Electronics makers use CES as a platform to show the types of products they plan to release in the coming year. The compact disc player, high-definition television and Blu-ray each debuted at past conventions. Decades since its formation, the yearly six-day event is a spectacle. But with some of the largest players in today's consumer electronics industry shunning CES, the trade show's impact may be waning. Apple, the world's most valuable technology company, and Amazon, an upstart in tablets and the leader in e-readers, do not participate. Google's operating systems can be found in partners' booths, running on phones, tablets and TVs, but the software giant does not run a booth. And Microsoft, which will deliver its 14th CES presentation Monday, announced recently it will not have a booth or participate in the keynotes after this year's event. ""Are we doing something because it's the right thing to do, or because 'it's the way we've always done it?' "" a Microsoft spokesman asked rhetorically in a statement. The big product categories that will dominate the CES show floor next week, according to manufacturers and analysts, are not revolutionary. They are expected to be thinner, lighter and more refined versions of gadgets that have already gained a toehold with consumers. Tablets . Electronics makers have been chasing after Apple's iPad for two years, and the racetrack is expected to get more crowded next week. Google and Samsung last month released the first phone running Android 4.0, which is Google's first system that's designed to work consistently on either a phone or a tablet. At CES, tech companies will showcase plenty of phones with that software, but the touchscreen tablets with Android 4 will be prevalent. Not to get left out of the party it started about a decade ago, Microsoft is stepping up its tablet efforts. The next major version of Windows will have a revamped interface for tablet computers, which will present programs as tiles that can be touched to fill the screen. Analysts expect to see a bevy of Windows 8 tablets at CES. With so many options, bargain hunters may get to pick something besides Amazon's Kindle Fire, which lit up holiday sales last month. (The Fire actually has quite a bit of Android code under the hood. Sorry, Microsoft.) Ultrabooks . Windows won't be just for tablets, of course. A new breed of computers called Ultrabooks will launch at CES from several PC manufacturers. If the tablet wars are a response to the iPad, then Ultrabooks follow in the footsteps of Apple's MacBook Air. They are thinner and lighter than the average laptop because they typically do not have disc drives, and instead of hard drives, use flash memory, which is faster but more expensive. Microsoft will enable this anti-disc computer with the application store in Windows 8. But the Ultrabook initiative is being driven by Intel, which makes the processor that runs them. ""You have Intel pushing heavily on this very thin but relatively traditional clamshell form factor without a lot of emphasis on touch,"" NPD Group analyst Ross Rubin said in a phone interview. ""And then you've got Microsoft pushing the touchscreen tablet experience."" Netbooks appear to be on their way out. That's a bad sign for Google, whose Chromebooks have struggled to challenge Microsoft in PC operating systems. Internet TVs that also do 3-D . TVs have long been the centerpiece of CES and of the consumer electronics industry as a whole. For the last few years, the big push has been in three-dimensional viewing technology, but demand has been small. Meanwhile, Internet services are also working their way onto television sets. Netflix and Pandora have seen tremendous growth on TV platforms. For the 3-D optimists, app-friendly TVs, which also happen to work with 3-D glasses, could allow for more 3-D video from independent filmmakers who distribute over the Web, Rubin noted. CES is expected to provide a launchpad for TVs that are smarter about how they let watchers access Web content, analysts say. Google has reportedly invested more in its TV platform, which should be evident at CES. The electronics giants do not want to get beaten to another big opportunity by Apple, which is rumored to be working on a TV set of its own. Don't expect Apple to show up at CES with a big screen though. Or to show up at all. Connected cars . As the automotive industry strives for a rebound, car makers are looking for high tech to be their guide. Several car companies have lined up CES presentations. They are expected to announce partnerships with popular Internet software companies and unveil technical wonders available at the touch of a button on the steering wheel. Dieter Zetsche, the head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, will present a keynote speech Tuesday. MOG, the music-streaming service, plans to announce integration with a line of cars Tuesday. And since last CES, Pandora has more than doubled the number of cars that tap into its streaming radio service, Pandora founder Tim Westergren said in a phone interview. ""These companies see the car as a software platform,"" Westergren said. ""It's the computer on four wheels."" Apps . Sure, CES is about gadgets, but the programs that run on them have become a key selling point. Many electronics makers have apparently decided that each new phone, tablet, car or refrigerator should allow owners to update their Facebook statuses. ""Software has simply become so critical to the overall customer experience,"" said Rubin, the NPD Group analyst. ""It's no longer an optional part of the business."" Software makers are eager to exploit this reality. Many say they will tout their wares at partners' booths and in private meetings. For example, online video provider Vimeo plans to make a major announcement Monday to coincide with the start of CES. Vimeo CEO Dae Mellencamp said in an interview at the company's New York headquarters that CES has emerged as an important venue for her company and others like it. ""It's the only trade show I attend all year,"" she said.","The Consumer Electronics Show brings a slew of new gadgets .
Tablets running Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows 8 will debut .

"London (CNN) -- An inquest jury considering the death of Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police sparked widespread riots in England two years ago, said Wednesday he was lawfully killed. The 29-year-old father of four was shot by police officers who stopped the taxi in which he was traveling in the northern London neighborhood of Tottenham in August 2011. His death sparked protests that exploded into riots and looting in London and spread to other cities in the worst disturbances in the country in decades. The jury at the Royal Courts of Justice in London concluded that the killing was lawful in an 8-to-2 decision, even though Duggan did not have a gun in his hand at the moment he was shot. They also said it was more likely than not that just before he was killed, Duggan had thrown a gun from the taxi onto a grassy area near the scene. There were emotional outbursts at the court when the conclusion was reached, Britain's Press Association reported. It quoted Duggan's brother Shaun Hall as saying: ""We still fight for justice."" The inquest began in September, and the jurors had been told to decide whether Duggan was either shot lawfully or unlawfully, or return an open verdict. ""No officer sets out at the start of the day to run an operation that results in someone dying,"" Assistant Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said outside the court. ""So our sympathy today is with Mark Duggan's family. They have lost a loved one. But the task our officers face in making split-second decisions when confronting armed criminals means there is a risk -- a very small risk -- that this will happen.""","Police shot and killed Mark Duggan in August 2011 .

"(CNN) -- A train derailment in northern Illinois early Friday prompted the evacuation of 800 people and left several freight cars burning, authorities said. Smoke swirled over the derailment scene in the small town of Tiskilwa as the National Transportation Safety Board formed a six-person team to investigate. The 126-car train was hauling ethanol alcohol when some of the cars derailed around 2:20 a.m., the Bureau County Sheriff's Office said. The Red Cross opened a shelter at the high school in nearby Princeton and were providing services for more than 25, agency spokeswoman Kasey Kelly said. People will stay overnight if the evacuation order lasts into the evening, she said. Several fire departments responded, including the Ottawa Fire Department about an hour from the scene. Ottawa Fire Capt. Steve Haywood told CNN officials were worried about expanding liquid vapor explosions. ""It's something you are concerned with all the time,"" he said. He said authorities planned to pull parts of the train that weren't burning or derailed away from the scene. ""My guess is they'll probably just let it burn."" he said. Bureau County Sheriff John Thompson, quoted by the Bureau County Republican newspaper, said no injuries had been reported and no homes or other structures were on fire. He was quoted as saying the situation didn't appear to a ""major hazmat concern."" ""They can't rule out that it's an accident at this time or that it was criminal,"" he was quoted as saying. Citing Thompson, the paper said the evacuation wasn't mandatory but was recommended because ""the winds could increase and change directions, causing the fire from the still-burning train cars to blow westward into town.""

"(CNN) -- Jeanne Cooper, who played Katherine Chancellor, the ""Dame of Genoa City,"" on ""The Young and the Restless,"" has died. She was 84. Her death was confirmed by her son, actor Corbin Bernsen, on his Twitter account. ""Mom passed this morning,"" Bernsen posted. ""She was in peace and without fear."" Cooper had been suffering from an undisclosed illness. The cause of death was not given. Cooper was already a well-established TV actress when she took the role of Chancellor in 1973. ""The Young and the Restless"" was struggling in the ratings and its creator, William J. Bell, wanted to spice things up. ""Jeanne was the matriarch of the show in every sense of the word,"" said Lauralee Bell, Christine/Cricket on ""The Young and the Restless"" and William Bell's daughter. ""When you did work you were proud of, you'd hope for approval or a 'good job' from Jeanne as a child would from a parent. When things got too tense, she'd break the tension with her amazing wit. She would teach the younger actors without ever talking down to them. In fact, she would raise them up,"" said Bell. ""She always had my back and my parents (and our whole family) always had hers."" Kate Linder, another member of ""The Young and the Restless"" cast, said Cooper was her ""mentor and an amazing actress and friend."" Linder, Esther Valentine on the show, said, ""When Jeanne welcomed you into her life, you knew it and it was a fantastic feeling. This is truly the end of an era, not just for fans of 'The Young and the Restless' but for all of the people she touched throughout her long and distinguished career and life."" Cooper's character was colorful from the beginning: a drunk conducting a series of affairs with younger men, as well as one with the best friend of her husband, the wealthy Gary Reynolds. The character was an immediate hit and Cooper -- who had signed a three-year contract -- stayed on. Cooper was instrumental in another storyline 10 years later. In the early '80s the actress decided to undergo a face lift, so the show's producers had Chancellor get a face lift as well -- it was performed on-screen. Chancellor was also part of a famed soap opera feud, in her case with Jill Abbott Fenmore (played since 1987 by Jess Walton). At one point the two believed they were mother and daughter; at another, the relationship warmed when Chancellor had a breast cancer scare. The two later became rivals again. And Chancellor also found herself victim of many classic soap opera twists: conniving suitors, long-lost relatives, multiple marriages and memory lapses. Cooper enjoyed all the twists and turns. ""I never wanted to be a movie star,"" she said in an interview, according to Entertainment Weekly. ""I always wanted to be an actress, one of the best. And I am."" Cooper also appeared in episodes of ""Perry Mason,"" ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and ""The Twilight Zone."" Cooper married television producer Harry Bernsen Jr. in 1954. The pair divorced in 1977.

"(CNN) -- How narrow is the gender gap in the United States compared to some other countries? Check out how the U.S. stacks up on the 40th anniversary of ""Women's Equality Day"" -- established by the U.S. Congress as every August 26 (the day the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote was passed). Four Nordic countries rank at the top of the Global Gender Gap Index released last year by the World Economic Forum. Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden were considered to have the smallest gap between men and women when four key areas were taken into account: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. No. 1 Iceland scored a 0.8496 on a scale of 0-1, with 1 being perfect equality between men and women. The lowest country on the list, Yemen, scored a 0.4603. The United States came in near the top of the overall index, ranking 19th out of 134 countries. It tied for first with 21 other countries that received a perfect score in the educational attainment category. It also ranked sixth in economic participation and opportunity. Where it might have room for improvement, however, is in health and survival (38th) and political empowerment (40th). The health and survival category looks at the gaps between life expectancies and sex ratios within a country. The political empowerment category measures female representation in government and other decision-making structures. Many of the countries that rank near the bottom of the Global Gender Gap Index are Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and North Africa. More comparisons: Where is the Internet most popular?

"Washington (CNN) -- As competition expands among airlines to offer passengers the latest in-flight entertainment options, intercontinental routes have been slow to add Internet service. Because in-flight Internet relies on transmitting signals to the ground, intercontinental flights have yet to find a reliably cost-effective means of providing passengers with Wi-Fi service while over water. The main drawbacks are cost and the added weight of the equipment needed for satellite transmission. Several airlines have plans to roll out transcontinental Internet service this year. This month, Qantas is partnering with a company called OnAir to test satellite-based Internet service aboard flights from Australia to Los Angeles. Japan's JAL intends to roll out Internet service to passengers flying from Japan to Europe and North America this summer. United Airlines is reportedly exploring Internet service on international flights. Emirates Airlines says it plans to test satellite based internet service on its A380 double-deck, wide-body jets. Meanwhile, nearly all U.S. airlines have announced plans to install Internet service and added amenities on domestic aircraft in recent years. In-flight Internet service provider GoGo announced Wednesday that it has reached a deal to expand service aboard US Airways fleet of Airbus A319, A320 and Embraer 190 aircrafts. Delta Airlines recently announced it was partnering with Amazon to provide passengers with free access to shop the online retail giant's website onboard all of Delta and Delta Connection flights with in-flight Wi-Fi service.","In-flight Internet relies on transmitting signals to the ground .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Starting Monday, health inspectors will halt and check the shipment of ingredients common to Mexican cuisine from Mexico to the United States, sources familiar with the salmonella poisoning investigation said. Since April, more than 900 people have contracted the same strain of salmonella, but its source is unclear. The inquiry, which initially focused solely on tomatoes, has expanded to include cilantro, jalapeño peppers, Serrano peppers, scallions and bulb onions, said Tommy Thompson, former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who said he has been informed of the plan. Thompson said the plan involves intercepting food samples at the border and sending them to laboratories to examine them for possible salmonella or E. coli. A former director of the Food and Drug Administration's import operations said the expanded search raises a number of questions. ""Where's the contaminated product?"" asked Carl Nielsen. ""How would you know? And where along the supply chain did it happen? Was it at the retail level? Is somebody doing something to expose the product at the retailer? Is it at the wholesale? Is it at the grower? Is it at the processor? Is it in transport? Where is it? They don't know."" The source of the outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul remains unknown, but it has already had far-reaching implications.

The person in the Canadian case became ill in Ontario on the day he returned from the United States, the CDC said.

"New York (CNN) -- In the spirit of spring rebirth, the Occupy movement is ramping up activities as warm weather blankets the country. But while the season is typified by a reawakening of life outdoors, demonstrators are using sleep to get their points across. They call it ""sleepful protest."" The sleeping bags started appearing on the corner of Wall and Broad streets across from the New York Stock Exchange on April 9. A civil rights attorney sympathetic to the Occupy movement provided the legal justification for the move in the form of a court ruling from 2000. A federal district court judge said people can sleep on sidewalks as a form of political expression as long as they take up no more than half of the sidewalk and don't block any doors. Occupy organizers declared a month ago that the movement would be planning a comeback in the spring and summer. Some city and state governments, armed with new ordinances aimed at the Occupy movements, are ready to prevent demonstrators from re-establishing encampments. For the past few nights, dozens of Occupy Wall Street protesters have slept on a patch of concrete a stone's throw away from the traders and stock brokers who are the targets of their message. ""The goal here is to not violate the law and not give the police a reason to move the group,"" said Ted Schulman, who has taken part in Occupy demonstrations for several months. Every morning, they talk about income inequality and the role of big money in politics as commuters pass by on their way to jobs in the Financial District. Most people who work in the area seem indifferent. ""They just don't understand how things work,"" said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial. ""They have fantasy ideas. But, they're entitled to their opinions."" While police have occasionally forced the protesters to move so the sidewalk could be cleaned, and a few have been arrested, Occupy protester Lauren DiGioia is not deterred. ""We're not afraid anymore. I mean, we've been through so much. All of us have been to jail,"" said DiGioia, a 27-year-old with hair dyed neon blue. ""We know we're doing the right thing."" What are Occupiers really fighting for? So-called sleepful protests have popped up elsewhere in the country with varying degrees of success. In Washington, police have been less accommodating, while in Los Angeles, protesters have taken to sleeping outside Bank of America branches, a frequent target of the Occupy movement. Similar sidewalk sleep-ins are taking place in Boston and Atlanta. The protesters on Wall Street don't expect their sleep-in to grow into an encampment like the one that became home to hundreds of people at nearby Zuccotti Park. ""I view this as the pre-campaign. I certainly doubt that this will still be here May 1st when the big rallies start,"" Schulman said. ""My guess is by that point, they'll have taken control of this space again."" Occupy organizers are calling for large-scale demonstrations across the country on May 1 in conjunction with the labor movement's International Workers Day.","The Occupy Wall Street movement is ramping up its activities .

"(CNN) -- Amy Poehler drew a standing ovation when she initiated an impromptu pageant during the outstanding lead actress in a comedy category at the 2011 Emmy Awards. At the 2012 Golden Globes, Tina Fey made viewers do a double take, photo-bombing Poehler as the nominees were announced for best actress in a TV comedy or musical. The ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""30 Rock"" stars have been stealing the spotlight at awards shows as presenters and nominees for years. As Suzy Byrne of Yahoo! Entertainment says, ""It's almost like they've been practicing for this."" ""This"" being their gig co-hosting the 70th Golden Globes, to air on NBC on January 13. The news, which broke Monday evening, was met with such excitement from fans, celebrities and the media that many were left wondering, ""Seth Mac-who?"" It was announced this month that ""Family Guy"" creator MacFarlane would host the 85th Academy Awards. It's still considered a great get for the Oscars, which have been fixated on attracting a younger demographic, but all anybody seems to care about is the Fey/Poehler Globes. Tim Brooks, an author, TV historian and former network executive, told The Hollywood Reporter of MacFarlane's appeal, ""Younger viewers probably know the name, but he's not an A star."" It should be noted, however, that MacFarlane's ""Ted"" recently broke a box office record: The flick about a teddy bear that comes to life has surpassed ""The Hangover"" as the highest-grossing non-sequel R-rated comedy worldwide. Meanwhile, Brooks said of the Globes pick, ""Tina Fey is a good choice, particularly. She's appealing to younger and older viewers. She's accessible. She's not too trendy but trendy enough."" Poehler has similar range. Before starring on ""Parks and Recreation,"" she appeared alongside Fey on ""Saturday Night Live"" and in ""Mean Girls"" and ""Baby Mama,"" in addition to films like ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and ""Blades of Glory."" ""They're the first people we approached"" for the job, said Aida Takla-O'Reilly, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. ""I like their style of comedy because they're not trying to be funny, but they're funny. ... It's natural."" Takla-O'Reilly is just one of many dedicated fans. Two women recently bid big bucks at Comedy Central's ""Night of Too Many Stars,"" which benefits autism programs, to hang out with Fey and Poehler for one night. As some media outlets have pointed out, perhaps just to stir the pot, the foreign press association's decision to book Fey and Poehler could be seen as a slap in the face of the Academy for choosing to announce Oscar nominations on January 10, before the Golden Globes. However, Takla-O'Reilly says, that's not the case. ""I have the deep belief that we honor the members of the Academy,"" she said. ""In other words, what are the Golden Globes about? What are we honoring? Everyone we're honoring there is a member of the Academy, right? Where's the competition?"" The Fey/Poehler pick was made because ""they're obviously very pleasant to look at, and ... they play off of each other beautifully,"" Takla-O'Reilly added, noting that she enjoyed their skit at the 2011 Emmy Awards. Even Ricky Gervais, who hosted the Globes in 2010, 2011 and 2012, had kind words for the ladies: ""Good luck to Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the Golden Globes. After failing three years in a row to make E! Channel's Best Dressed list, I decided to hand over the reins."" This is the pair that viewers have been waiting to see, Yahoo! Entertainment's Byrne said. It's not that people are expecting these women to get on stage and reinvent awards shows; it's that they're looking forward to hearing smart jokes. ""They won't sit there and insult people like Ricky Gervais did,"" Byrne said. ""It's like in '30 Rock,' when you watch it, people at home feel like they're in on the joke. ... They'll pull the audience in that way."" Like ""Saturday Night Live's"" Seth Meyers tweeted, ""Poehler and Fey hosting the Golden Globes is excellent news for those who love good times.""","Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will co-host the 70th Golden Globes .

"(CNN) -- About 13% of the world's population is undernourished, according to the most recent statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That's at least 847.5 million people, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia and the Pacific. The FAO defines undernourishment as ""the condition of people whose dietary energy consumption is continuously below a minimum dietary energy requirement for maintaining a healthy life and carrying out a light physical activity with an acceptable minimum body weight for attained height."" The most undernourished nation on the list, at least by percentage, is the Democratic Republic of Congo. Nearly 42 million people there, or 69% of the population, are undernourished. Two other African nations, Eritrea and Burundi, are also over 60%. Haiti ranks fourth with 57%. Somalia, which is dealing with a devastating famine right now, is not on the list. Because of political turmoil within the country, the FAO has not been able to gather dependable statistics for the country. The United States isn't on the list, either. That's because, like many developed nations, its undernourished rate is under 5%. India has more undernourished people than any other country by far -- 237.7 million, or 21% of its population.

No one was killed and everyone was accounted for one day after the accident. ""I don't speak for anybody's religious beliefs, but the mayor and I both agreed that if you want to define a miracle, what happened here yesterday meets that definition for me,"" Adm.

At least seven people, including two pilots who ejected safely, were injured in the crash. All were released from the hospital as of Saturday, said Harvey, and are in ""good shape."" Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell thanked those who acted in an hour of need. ""This amazing news follows the countless acts of bravery and selflessness that we witnessed yesterday,"" he said in a statement. He said the crash response highlighted the character of the Navy, safety officials and the people of Virginia. ""We saw neighbors rushing to the assistance of neighbors, the Navy pilots waiting until the very last second to eject, citizens pulling the pilots to safety and treating them, and a successful and efficient coordinated response from first responders, the city and others,"" McDonnell said. ""It was the very best of Virginia on display."" Among those who sprung into action was an off-duty Coast Guard member. Petty Officer 2nd Class Nick Beane was at a friend's house having lunch when the jet went down, according to a statement from the Coast Guard. ""My training kicked in,"" Beane said. ""I saw the fire and explosion, and I knew I had to help."" He ran to nearby buildings and knocked on doors to make sure everyone was outside. He then saw one of the pilots, lying on the ground near flames. With the help of a civilian, they cut the pilot loose from his parachute and carried him to safety, the Coast Guard said. ""He kept asking if everybody else was okay,"" Beane said. ""He asked about the people on the ground and the other pilot. His own safety was the last thing on his mind."" The fighter jet experienced a ""catastrophic mechanical malfunction"" during takeoff Friday, raining jet fuel over Virginia Beach before plunging to the ground, damaging five apartment buildings, according to residents and Navy officials. The jet carried a student pilot in the front seat and an experienced instructor behind him, and the leakage of jet fuel was ""one of the indications that there was a mechanical malfunction,"" Navy Capt. Mark Weisgerber told reporters. The two-seat F/A-18 jet landed eerily upright in flames in a courtyard surrounded by the five apartment buildings that were suddenly set afire. iReport: Watch and hear jet fuel burning . Once the buildings were doused with water and the courtyard was coated with a foam, rescue crews began a detailed search through the charred hulks to look for any residents injured or killed, a fire official said. Are you there? Send images . The two pilots, a Virginia Beach police officer, an EMS volunteer and three other people were treated for injuries at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. The jet, which was not carrying live ordnance, was part of a training squadron at Naval Air Station Oceana, the Navy and Federal Aviation Administration said. It crashed 2.2 miles from the runway, a senior Defense Department official told CNN. Eyewitnesses and residents described their community -- so accustomed to military planes taking off near their homes -- suddenly taking a surreal turn for the worse when the jet fell out of the sky and spewed its fuel, a possible maneuver to minimize the inevitable fire upon crashing. One ejection seat shell ripped through an oak tree and crashed into a condo fence, and the other seat shell landed next door, suggesting that the two Navy pilots ejected at a low altitude, said resident Keith Gutkowski. Colby Smith told CNN affiliate WVEX that he was in his bathroom when he felt his ""whole house shaking."" Then he looked out his bedroom window and ""saw nothing but red, just red and orange flashing. And just a crackling noise. I was like, 'What is that?' "" he said. Smith said he ran outside, saw a friend and eventually spotted a pilot who was ""laying there"" and bleeding. He said he and several others then picked up the pilot and carried him to safety.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The baseball field looks like any other where people flock to play pickup games in Cuba on the weekends. A few blocks from the blindingly turquoise ocean, players hustle to close out innings in between slugs of Cristal beer. But this game was different from any other being played. It's not just that legends of the Cuban leagues arrived throughout the morning to play on this dusty field on the outskirts of Havana. No one in the small crowd that formed even looked at them. Instead, all eyes are on the player who should not be there: Jose Ariel Contreras. A star pitcher in Cuba, Contreras was part of a team that won Olympic Gold, was named the Cuban athlete of the year three times and, in the 1999 game between Cuba's national team and the Baltimore Orioles, pitched eight shutout innings. Fidel Castro, himself once an avid pelotero, nicknamed Contreras the ""Bronze Titan."" In 2002, he defected while playing in Mexico. After years of barely scraping out a living playing in Cuba, Contreras was signed by the New York Yankees for $32 million. Sports stars who left Cuba for mega-salaries abroad were considered traitors by Cuba's government. If they abandoned the island for the lure of playing in the majors, they could be barred from their homeland, never to see friends and family again. That was until January, when authorities instituted long-hoped-for reforms, lifting many of the restrictions on Cubans who wanted to travel abroad and return to the island. Sports stars and government officials will still need special permission to leave. But for the first time, high-level defectors like Contreras are allowed to come back. He is the first sports star to test the new law. ""Already, in the plane, I was crying. This is something big that I had waited 10 years for,"" Contreras told CNN as Cuban fans lined up to snap photos with him on cell phone cameras. ""It's years of pain that can't be erased, but I always had the hope that some day,"" he said. While other sports stars who left Cuba said they were uneasy about returning -- afraid they could still be banned or might even be imprisoned -- Contreras couldn't wait. His mother was ill in a hospital, and he said he had been homesick every day he was away. Other Cuban players who had defected, like Orlando ""El Duque"" Hernandez, complained that Cubans who live abroad still needed to ask the government for a visa to return. But Contreras said it was an important sign that the door had finally been opened to allow defectors to come back. ""They shouldn't be afraid, and (sports stars who defected) will keep continuing to return,"" he said. ""It's the dream of anyone who lives outside Cuba, to be able to return and be with your family and the fans here."" And there is no shortage of hometown pride for Contreras. While Cuba's government may disavow sports stars who leave to pursue careers in the United States, many Cubans quietly root for countrymen who achieve success abroad. Throughout the pickup baseball game, players wandered off the field to embrace Contreras, some with tears in their eyes. ""I am really happy to have him back and to see each other again and remember things we did together,"" Cuban pitcher Pedro Luis Lazo said. ""Thank God he can come back now when he wants. We will be seeing each other a lot more now."" Contreras said he would stay in Cuba a little while longer. His mother's health has improved, and she is out of the hospital. He also wanted to return to the small countryside town where he grew up and was discovered by a baseball scout while working in the fields. Then he would go back to the United States and continue training with the hopes of playing professional baseball again. Injuries sidelined Contreras after he played with the Yankees, White Sox and Phillies, but he said he was sure he still had a few more seasons in the majors. He said he would take the smells, sounds and memories of Cuba back with him. ""Every time I can, I will be here,"" he said. ""This is my country.""","In 2002, Cuban pitcher Jose Ariel Contreras defected, signed with Yankees for $32 million .

"(CNN) -- Libya's foreign ministry acknowledged Friday that at least one American had been detained -- then released -- in Benghazi, one day after the U.S. State Department said it had been in contact with a detained citizen. In a statement carried by the official Libyan News Agency, the foreign ministry said that an American and Cameroon national were both stopped on University of Benghazi grounds Thursday evening, at a time when only registered students were allowed on campus. University security turned over the pair to Libyan Army Special Forces in the eastern coastal city, according to the ministry. Both said they played for al-Hilal basketball team, which is in Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city, and were taking a tour around campus escorted by a student. They were later released in the presence of representatives from the foreign ministry and al-Hilal Sports Club, according to the official statement. The state news agency earlier reported -- citing unnamed security sources -- two Americans had been detained by Libyan authorities after being spotted scouting the university. It was not clear if the nationalities were not entirely correct (and the Cameroonian was mistaken for an American) in that report, or if there were in fact two Americans detained. On Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf did say that diplomats had communicated with ""a private U.S. citizen"" who'd been stopped in Benghazi, adding that she couldn't say anything more than that. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","Libyan ministry: An American, a Cameroonian were detained at a Benghazi university .

"(CNN) -- Fred Stobaugh of Peoria, Illinois, has written two songs in his 96 years. One was about Branson, Missouri. The other is about his unending love for his wife, Lorraine. Peoria's Green Shoe Studio introduced Stobaugh to the world in a blog post from June. It describes how the studio received a manila envelope containing a handwritten letter and a page of lyrics for a song titled ""Oh Sweet Lorraine"" from him as an entry in its online singer/songwriter contest. The letter described how Stobaugh's wife had passed away in April, ending their nearly 75-year romance, and his reasons for writing the song. Studio members were so moved by the story and song, they decided to meet Stobaugh. They also decided to professionally record the song and make a short documentary about it. The studio posted the documentary on YouTube in July and on its Facebook page, where it was noticed by fans and friends but went largely unnoticed until recently. In the past few days, it has been featured in Britain's Daily Mail and on Australian television. It also made the front page of the social sharing platform reddit. Green Shoe Studio did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. The video features old family photos of Fred and Lorraine, as well as the letter. But he is definitely the star of the show. ""She was the prettiest girl I ever saw. ... I just fell in love with her right there,"" he says in the video. ""After she passed away, I was just sitting in the front room one evening by myself, and it just came right to me almost. I just kept humming it and singing it. It just fit her,"" Stobaugh says. Near the end, the audience gets to sit with him as he hears the recorded version of the song for the first time. He wipes away tears, and his eyes seem fixed on a faraway place. Finally, he responds quietly, ""It's wonderful. Just wonderful."" ""Wonderful"" is also the response the story is getting from online audiences. ""If you're going to watch this,"" Frank M. posted on YouTube, ""have a hanky handy."" Reddit user sad_little_turtle shared, ""My grandfather passed away earlier this year after spending over 60 years with him I overheard my grandmother one evening talking to his picture, 'Oh John, why couldn't you take me with you? It's so lonely here without you and I bet wherever you are is a whole lot better than this lonely place.' As sad as those stories/moments are they make me wish that I get the chance to share an entire lifetime with someone special.""","96-year-old widower writes song for beloved wife .

"(CNN) -- As Occupy Wall Street demonstrations spread to cities across the U.S., protesters, bystanders and interested people almost everywhere are using mobile devices to share and follow events on the ground. How have mobile organizing tools evolved over the past few years, and where might they go from here? Media technologist Deanna Zandt (author of ""Share This! How You Will Change the World with Social Networking"") attended the protests In New York's Zucotti Park last week. This led her to reflect on her experience at the 2004 Republican National Convention protests in New York. ""2004 was well before Facebook and Twitter. The tools we had were great for mobile communication among protesters and organizers, or for uploading media to places like Flickr, where you hoped people might see it. But you could go to another part of the city where no protests were happening, and people there would have no idea that anything was going on,"" she said. That situation has completely flipped. Today, communicating from and about the Occupy Wall Street protests is primarily a social phenomenon. ""This week, all my apolitical friends who were not really involved or interested in the protests were still commenting about it on Facebook. It even generated a hilarious spoof meme, #OccupySesameStreet,"" Zandt said. ""It's on everyone's radar now."" In 2004, text messaging was the primary mobile tool for protest coordination. ""Most mobile social media tools didn't exist, so we were rolling our own,"" said open source software developer Nathan Freitas. In 2004, he helped the Ruckus Society build a text alert service, which transmitted tactical messages from organizers to more than 10,000 protesters on the scene. Frietas thinks this relatively closed communication channel may in some ways have had more impact on protests than the more open social media channels that are common today. He said the 2004 text-alert system ""was more powerful because there was less noise and competition. Our goal was to organize people using their phones; social media is more about spreading news and opinion. Notice that what we heard about how Twitter was used in Egypt this spring was mostly not about organizing people on the ground; it was about getting the word out to the rest of the world."" In a later project, the Ruckus Society helped the Service Employees International Union and MoveOn.org mobilize their ""get out the vote"" campaign. It expanded the text alert system it had created for the RNC '04 protests to use a distributed technique similar to how SETI@Home works. In that project, people across the nation volunteered their home computers' spare processing capacity to send out text messages to subscribers utilizing SMS gateway technology. This minimized the otherwise high cost of transmitting lots of text messages. Furthermore, distributed text message broadcasts helped ensure that the messages got delivered. Wireless carriers tend to block text messages when they're generated in volume from a single phone number. But when many volunteers were transmitting alerts in small batches, it bypassed carrier blocking. After 2004, looking at protest and dissent movements around the world, Freitas and others realized that in some countries, people may risk their lives by protesting. These activists need mobile communication tools that shield their identities, their current locations and other crucial information. So Frietas helped create the Guardian Project, which makes easy-to-use apps and other mobile software as well as customized mobile phones ""that can be used and deployed around the world, by any person looking to protect their communications and personal data from unjust intrusion and monitoring."" Freitas observed that the Occupy Wall Street protesters seem more interested in transparency than secrecy. ""With the Occupy protests -- at least so far -- law enforcement doesn't seem highly interested in surveilling or arresting protesters."" Today, Freitas teaches a course at New York University called ""social activism using mobile technology."" He's been sending his students out to the Occupy Wall Street protests. In addition to seeing mobile devices being used to create a great deal of citizen journalism there, they've noted innovative approaches, such as the curation tool Vibe, an iPhone and Android app that allows users to connect with people based on proximity. While it's not completely anonymous, it provides more privacy than popular social media services. ""With Vibe, you don't have to follow someone; you can just talk to people in your local area, within a radius of your location,"" Freitas explained. But since Vibe connects via the internet, ""that means it could be shut down if they turned off cell towers, like BART did in San Francisco recently."" Freitas noted that other mobile communication apps are emerging that are ""peer to peer"" or ""mesh networks,"" meaning mobile devices communicate directly with each other, not via the internet. These tools are in their infancy, but Frietas expects them to develop rapidly. Common mobile technologies like Bluetooth or emerging ones like near-field communication could play a roll in this evolution. Zandt also noted that mobile media have the ability to engage the attention -- if not always the participation -- of bystanders. ""Approximately every other person walking by on the streets was pulling out a phone to check online to see what the protest was about. They were tweeting about it and checking whether the subway was still running, things like that,"" she said. ""That's a huge ripple effect of awareness and education."" Zandt noted that in the past, bystanders would have to walk up to a cop or a protester to ask what was going on, something that can seem daunting or even risky to bystanders. But last week, ""Most bystanders were taking photos with their phones. Some were posting photos to social media or sending them around to their friends. You could see them texting and tweeting,"" Zandt said. ""I saw some women wearing janitorial uniforms, speaking an Eastern European language, doing that, too. Workers of the world, unite!"" Still, the proliferation of mobile media at the recent protests isn't always a good thing. ""I get frustrated with 'protest porn': people waiting to see the police do something wrong, and then they whip out their cameras,"" Zandt said. ""At a big demonstration, there are lots of interesting things to document. For instance, I loved seeing that lots of different kinds of people -- people of color, minorities, etc. -- who hadn't been well-represented in in earlier media coverage of the Occupy Wall Street protests are now getting coverage,"" she said. ""With mobile tools, we should do our best to represent the full picture of what's happening. We shouldn't just be waiting for something to go horribly wrong."" The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Communicating from and about the Occupy Wall Street protests is a social phenomenon .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Thirty-five years since Roe v. Wade, and little, it seems, has changed. The January 22, 1973, Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion remains the law of the land, and passions remain high on both sides of the issue, with annual protests on the anniversary. Access to abortion, then and now, is more than just about simple legalities. Social, religious and family values, as well as finances and politics, still play a role in shaping the abortion issue, but many legal and medical experts say the debate has become predictable. ""Much of the controversy about abortion is really stimulated by the interest groups on both sides of the political question, rather than by ordinary Americans,"" said David Garrow, a law professor at Cambridge University, and a longtime Supreme Court scholar. ""The American people and many political leaders have already made up their minds about legal abortion."" Public opinion on abortion has remained remarkably stable over the years. A CNN/Opinion Research survey in October found 36 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in most or all circumstances, 40 percent believe it should be available in a few circumstances, such as to save the mother's life, and 22 percent say abortion should never be legal. That is almost unchanged in the past 15 years. The Roe decision did not prompt ""abortion on demand,"" as many opponents of the procedure predicted it would. Nor have various legislatures or court rulings restricted access as much as some supporters claim. New research from the Alan Guttmacher Institute found the rate of abortions is at its lowest level since Roe, and the total number is also in decline, about 1.2 million in the year 2005, down 25 percent since the all-time high in 1990. For the Supreme Court justices, Roe reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy. That ""right,"" wrote Justice Harry Blackmun in the main opinion for the court, is ""broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."" ""Prior to Roe,"" said Garrow, ""whether one could obtain a legal abortion in the face of an unwanted pregnancy was a crapshoot. For 30 years now, it's been a constitutionally guaranteed right."" But the ruling was a qualified one, as many anti-abortion supporters have noted over the years, and that fact has been used by them in their efforts to narrow the scope of other abortion provisions. Blackmun noted the state's ""important interests in safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, and protecting potential life"" are compelling enough to justify regulation ""at some point in pregnancy."" That ""qualified right"" found its form in the controversial ""trimester analysis"" laid out by the justices in Roe: permitting no government regulation during the first three months; allowing limited regulation in the second trimester to protect women's health and safety; and granting government the power to ban abortions during the third trimester -- in which medical consensus has concluded the fetus is capable of living on its own. After Roe, the high court affirmed the right to abortion in subsequent cases: striking down a provision requiring a husband's consent for a first-trimester abortion and a provision requiring parental consent for an unmarried woman under 18; striking down efforts to expand on laws requiring women to give informed consent before having an abortion; striking down a 24-hour waiting period; and striking down a law requiring doctors to inform women of the risks and of assistance available if she completed pregnancy. But there was one notable victory for anti-abortionist activists: banning use of taxpayer funds to finance abortions for poor women. The abortion issue has been revisited several times since Roe, most famously in two cases: Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). Webster (a 5-4 decision) upheld major parts of a Missouri abortion law that prohibited use of public facilities or the participation of public employees in abortions, and required doctors to test the viability of a fetus before performing an abortion. Justices William Rehnquist, Byron White and Anthony Kennedy said they would allow restrictions on abortion, but only if the restrictions had a rational basis. More important, the three conservative justices said a compelling government interest need not be required to justify restrictions on abortion. That was a blow for anti-abortion forces. Then came the Planned Parenthood ruling, in which the justices clearly outlined their views on Roe. The decision (also 5-4) reaffirmed the heart of Roe while giving states the power to regulate procedures so long as they did not impose an ""undue burden"" on a woman's right to abortion. The standard: Undue burden exists if ""the purpose and effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability."" The ruling left supporters on both sides of the issue dissatisfied, feeling it was ambiguous. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not join either opinion, saying there was nothing in it to justify reconsidering Roe. Nevertheless, Blackmun wrote, ""the right to reproductive choice"" was in danger of being overturned. Another legacy of Roe that remains: The head-counting of justices on the court, a what-if scenario that could lead to the overturning of Roe. The current 5-4 conservative majority could shift significantly in either direction if two or more justices leave the bench in the next few years, as is widely expected. In the meantime, conservatives in Congress have promised to push for tougher restrictions on the access to abortion, though many political experts say the goal is not necessarily aimed at overturning Roe. They found success last year when the justices in a sharply divided 5-4 ruling upheld a federal ban on a controversial a late-term procedure, rejecting concerns the law didn't take into account the physical safety of the mother. The procedure is typically performed by doctors in the middle to late second trimester. The legal sticking point was that the law lacked a ""health exception"" for a woman who might suffer serious medical complications, something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions. The swing vote, as in previous cases, came from Kennedy. In angry dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the lone woman on the high court since O'Connor stepped down, called the majority's conclusions ""alarming"" and said they ""cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court, and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives."" If there is one last legacy of the Roe decision, it may be that it opened up and expanded the entire debate on the rights of women, sexuality, health care, and medical decisions. Issues like cloning, stem cells, and fetal research have become part of the national lexicon. As significant as it was, Roe v. Wade was only the beginning of the battle.

"(CNN) -- Jurors did not reach a verdict in their first day of deliberations Monday in the trial of Steven Hayes, the man accused of killing three members of a Connecticut family in a 2007 home invasion. They are expected to resume their work Tuesday morning. Hayes, 47, who has pleaded not guilty, is on trial in New Haven, Connecticut, for the murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters. The killings took place in the New Haven suburb of Cheshire early July 23, 2007. The home of William Petit, his wife, Hawke-Petit, and two daughters was invaded in the middle of the night by Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky, prosecutors say. Komisarjevsky will be tried separately. Judge Jon Blue gave instructions Monday morning and told the jury: ""You are the sole judges of the facts."" ""We're in the home stretch,"" the judge said after going over all 17 counts with the jury. ""No one will hurry you to produce a verdict."" Their first duty will be to pick a foreman, and their verdict must be unanimous, the judge reminded the jurors. Soon after starting their deliberations, the jurors asked for a transcript of an interview by a state police detective, who spoke to Hayes soon after his arrest. The judge offered to have the testimony read back -- which the jurors declined. Later in the day, they sent a note to the judge asking for a definition of what constitutes starting a fire.Their deliberations Monday ran just over 2 hours. Before the jury got the case, prosecutor Michael Dearington laid out an elaborate timeline of events, fully implicating Hayes and Komisarjevsky in the gruesome killings. ""We've reached the point where very shortly this case will be in your hands,"" he told jurors. ""I doubt you could have comprehended how horrendous this evidence would be."" During the trial, Jeremiah Krob, a Connecticut prison officer, testified he overheard Hayes confess to another inmate that he killed Hawke-Petit. Hayes also reportedly wondered out loud whether Petit might have been in cahoots with his co-defendant, Komisarjevsky, because Petit had escaped. Hayes said that he had tied the father in the basement of the home and that he doubted he could have gotten loose without help from Komisarjevsky, Krob testified. Outside the courthouse, Petit told reporters: ""I really can't dignify that insinuation with a response. I think the evidence put on by the prosecution speaks for itself."" Connecticut State Police Detective Anthony Buglione, who interviewed Hayes after the crime, has testified the duo beat Petit bloody and left him in the basement. According to the testimony, the two men then went upstairs and found Hawke-Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit asleep in the master bedroom. After tying Hawke-Petit to her bed, they led the girl to her room, tied her to her bed and put a pillowcase over her head, Hayes told Buglione. They then found 17-year-old Hayley Petit in her room and did the same, he said. After finding a bank account that contained $20,000 to $30,000, they decided to have the mother go to the bank in the morning and withdraw money from her account, Buglione testified. Hayes is accused of taking Hawke-Petit to the bank while Komisarjevsky allegedly stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, the two men allegedly set the home on fire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, had died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. Hayes is charged with capital murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, burglary and arson. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Public defender Thomas Ullmann conceded in the defense's opening statement that Hayes killed Hawke-Petit. But otherwise, he said, much of what happened is unclear. ""No one was supposed to be hurt,"" he said. ""What is known is that Steven Hayes kills and assaults Mrs. Petit. ... We concede much, but not all."" In Friday's closing arguments, Ullmann placed much of the blame on Hayes' alleged accomplice, Komisarjevsky, whom he called the mastermind of the home invasion. ""Just because the state has brought 17 charges doesn't mean he's guilty of all of them,"" Ullmann said of Hayes, though he conceded he couldn't explain why his client didn't leave the scene once things began to escalate. But, he said, ""Even in flight, Joshua Komisarjevsky was in control."" Dearington dismissed those statements in his rebuttal, saying Hayes ""was part of that whole plan to destroy this family, to take their money and to burn that house down."" In a police interview, Hayes said that his life ""sucked"" and that he had ""no money, no car, and not enough to eat."" ""Why didn't he leave?  He didn't leave because of his desire for money,"" Dearington said. He ended his closing statement Friday by asking for guilty verdicts on all 17 counts. ""Justice demands it,"" Dearington said. CNN's Michael Christian contributed to this report.","The jury ended its first day of deliberations without delivering a verdict .

"New York (CNN) -- Police encircled Lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park on Sunday as protesters geared up to observe the one-year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street. A loosely organized group of demonstrators first gathered in New York one year ago Monday as part of a movement that thrust ""the 99 percent"" into the political lexicon. The protests spread to dozens of cities across the United States. By 7 p.m. Sunday, New York police said there had been no arrests during the day -- but they put the number of arrests Saturday at about 40. Protesters faced various charges including disorderly conduct, resisting arrests and felony assault. Opinion: Occupy fizzled, but made 99% a force . Video of the scene showed people near the park being detained, while others banged on drums and shouted. Zuccotti Park is located in the city's financial district. The group's messages have ranged from protecting the environment to protests over education costs. There's been an overriding theme of condemning income inequality and social injustice. It put out a statement Sunday, saying ""the day's events are about flexing people power in the streets and utilizing public spaces."" ""The Occupy movement continues to utilize culturally creative tactics to build the movement for social and economic justice,"" the group said. The movement also has been criticized for its lack of focus, and over reliance on a physical space. ""The camp is one of the central points for the first couple of months and that's just not a sustainable form of protest,"" said Fordham University professor Heather Gautney, referring to Zuccotti Park. A look back: Meet the 99% . ""So I think there was a transition into more localized acts of protest but they never reallyÂ had the momentum that the camps had."" Occupy had ""a problem of transitioning into a new strategy,"" she said. The group's mantra has traditionally been directed against the so-called privileged 1 percent of society -- such as banks, the mortgage industry, insurance providers and others. The 99 percent is a reference to the broader public, which the group said had been undermined by those institutions. What was the point of the Occupy movement?

"(CNN) -- It was the very first race of this year's World Championships and Lindsey Vonn was confident of wresting back her Super-G title. Just five seconds in, the story went off script, and Vonn off course. On the Schladming slopes on an arctic Austrian February afternoon, the American downhill Olympic champion's first jump on the course initially appeared to go to plan but, as she landed, her weight seemed to shift too far forward and her right knee buckled virtually to a right angle beneath her. She skidded off the track and came to a rest 100 meters down the mountain, in a crumpled wreck in the snow, clutching her knee, her face twisted in agony before the rescue helicopter winched her up over the snow-dusted pine trees below, taking her to begin the slow and agonizing recovery process. She has been open in that recovery process, tweeting pictures of the horrific state of her blackened and swollen knee in the aftermath of her operation, keeping her followers posted on the slow and steady nature of her recovery. Less than seven months later in September, Vonn clipped back into her skis on the slopes of Portillo, Chile, to test the reconstructed knee, insisting ""I can't tell which knee is injured"" and that she was ""skiing without fear."" Her plan is now to return to competitive skiing at the World Cup meeting in Beaver Creek, Colorado, from 29 November to 1 December. The U.S. Ski Team, their physician Dr Bill Sterett, who performed surgery on Conn, and Athletes Special Projects at Red Bull, headed by Robert Trenwalder, have been at the heart of her recovery program. The comeback goal has been all about the Olympics in Sochi in February 2014, one year after the injury. ""Lindsey is a fighter and having her goal always in mind, she did everything needed for her comeback,"" Trenkwalder told CNN. ""She has mastered it outstandingly and she always knew that she couldn't do too much too early. ""But such a tremendous injury requires a very specific and well-co-ordinated rehab program. The U.S. Ski Team, Dr Bill Sterett and we at Red Bull did everything possible to create an ideal rehab environment for Lindsey."" Early in that recovery process, Red Bull published a picture of Vonn, her knee heavily strapped on a medical bed doing exercises with the caption ""not letting obstacles stand in her way."" Her program involved a strict calendar of rehab measurements and physical training but the physical side of things was only half of the battle. Returning to the slopes after crashing at high speed and with a potentially career-threatening injury can take some overcoming. ""The physical rebuild is absolutely essentially but it has to go in coordination with the rehab program,"" continued Trenkwalder. ""For sure there is a mental aspect too, returning to the slopes can be a challenge. ""But when I saw Lindsey giving her comeback on skis in Chile, it was totally obvious that everything is totally fine. Skiing is her element and she was all smiles to be finally back on skis."" For all the positive noises from Vonn's camp, however, there is still a sense -- to a certain degree -- that she is skiing into the unknown in the ensuing weeks. ""We are on target and everything looks good now,"" added Trenkwalder. ""However, I cannot read the future and returning to the peak depends on loads of different aspects."" For the superstar of world skiing, it is her first career-threatening injury. So just how does skier recover from those physical and mental wounds? Perhaps there is no better person to ask than British skier Chemmy Alcott, who is in the midst of rehab from breaking her leg for the third time. The first and most serious break dates back to December 2010 during a practice run at Lake Louise in Canada. It was a jump she had tackled 60 times, 59 of them correctly but this time things went awry... at 80mph. On this occasion, she ended up with a multitude of fractured bones in her leg, she was strapped to a stretcher and attached to a helicopter. The breaks were so severe that her ski boot liner became lodged inside her leg, the removed boot showing smashed bones and a torrent of blood as it was removed. It was an injury that kept her out of competitive action for two years but amazingly she remained conscious throughout. ""Well, for one, I don't remember the crash,"" said Alcott, who similarly has opted not to watch it back. ""I think that was my body's defense mechanism, to shut it out. ""I'm a very optimistic person and I don't need to see something that could be negative. There's nothing to be gained from reliving it."" Remarkably Alcott opted to make her return at Lake Louise of all places, which had nearly seen the end of her career, finishing an impressive 25th in the downhill against the world's best skiers. She describes that run as ""the gutsiest performance of her life."" Clearly the mental demons were in abundance, perhaps typified by the fact that rather than her customary 10 minutes preparing at the start gate, she opted to spend just half-a-minute there. Come the run itself, though, she explained: ""I really put my brain out the window. I came out of the gate with a sense of peace and satisfaction having made it back."" She did not on that occasion nor during her latest break see a sports psychologist. ""If I felt I had a weakness, I'd see someone about it,"" she said. Instead, she talked it through with other skiers who have endured similar experiences before adding, ""I think I'm mentally strong enough. With that Lake Louise run, I've proved how tough I can be. ""I didn't let anything in from the past, I wasn't scared, I was just excited to be back. I just don't think of 'what ifs' I just get on with things. ""For me, my only thought is Sochi. I've worked so hard for it. It's got to be."" ""Sochi doubt?"" she added, somewhat flabbergasted, in answer to the question of whether she would OK for the Winter Olympics. ""It's just not there, I can't let it creep in. It's my Hollywood ending."" There is something even more Hollywood about Vonn, with her higher profile and her on-going relationship with the world's most famous golfer Tiger Woods. Both skiers, though, have very similar goals, to make it to Sochi. But what is it about skiers that enable them to overcome such mental battles. Is it genetic? Dr Rhonda Cohen manages the London Sport Institute at Middlesex University and is a chartered sport and exercise psychologist whose research centers on personality, motivation, risk and reaction times especially in examining the psychology of extreme sport. ""We are all born with a genetic pattern and obviously a genetic predisposition towards certain behavior,"" says Cohen. ""When you are born with more of an anxiety trait your natural reaction would be to get anxious in a stressful situation such as a broken leg. ""However, both Lindsey and Chemmy have developed excellent coping mechanisms, pushing aside thoughts of perhaps not ever being able to be the best in your sport."" But even extreme sports starts come to a point after an injury where they think enough is enough. As Cohen pointed out: ""Some skiers do give up. I have often found the length of their career as part of an odds game -- the longer they compete or engage in the sport, the greater the chance of something serious happening."" That happened in the case of Austrian skier Hans Grugger, a World Cup winner who suffered a serious head injury in a fall in 2011. At the age of 30, Grugger made a full recovery from those head injuries but any hopes of a return to the slopes -- at least competitively -- were curtailed by nerve damage to his right leg. He had suffered two serious falls before, much like Alcott and Vonn, and on both occasions opted to return. ""To me, that was not a problem, crashing is a part of skiing, and crashing never gave me fear for the next time,"" he explained. ""But this accident was different. I couldn't come back."" His comments suggest he would still be competing if given the chance but Grugger is not so sure. ""I don't know as I just feel happy to have my life,"" he adds. ""I was told if my head injury was one centimeter to the right or left, things could have been very different."" Perhaps fortunately the mental demons of the crash do not haunt him -- he has no memory from six weeks beforehand to about six weeks afterwards. However, before returning to the slopes in a more amateur fashion, he opted to watch back his horror fall. ""It was just me and my laptop,"" he recalls. ""It took me a time to press play -- my finger was hovering over play for a long time. But when I watched it, it was OK. It was just like watching someone else. So when I did first ski, I was not scared."" Unlike Grugger, in retirement from the age of 30, Vonn, who turns 29 on Friday, and 31-year-old Alcott have opted to return. Despite their crashes, they show no signs of slowing down or hanging up their skis.","How Lindsey Vonn is bidding to return from a potentially career threatening injury .

"(CNN) -- Swiss banking giant UBS is changing the way it pays out bonuses to its 6,000 highest earners to limit the firm's exposure to risk and loss. The rule change comes as the Zurich-based bank reported a huge fourth quarter loss to shareholders of $2.1 billion. A large portion of that stemmed from a December 2012 agreement to pay $1.5 billion in fines over a scandal to manipulate Libor, the rate banks use when borrowing money from one another. Under the new compensation model, UBS will dole out a larger portion of annual bonuses in the form of bonds instead of cash. Such instruments would be fully paid out over a number of years and only if there are no major financial issues for the bank, such as the need for a bailout or if its common equity ratio falls below 7%, UBS says. If such events happen, the value of those bonds would be wiped out, essentially erasing a portion of employee bonuses. In a press release, UBS said ""the changes focus UBS's employees on medium- and longer-term performance, provide them with the opportunity to benefit from the firms longer term success, and simplify UBS's compensation framework, making it more transparent."" The move signals a shift in the politically-charged issue of bank bonuses. Many financial institutions that received government bailouts during the financial crisis were contractually obligated to continue to pay out bonuses, which raised taxpayer ire. For bank executives, the change may spur them to make less risky trades or to search for a new job at a firm with less stringent bonus pay rules, analysts say.","UBS unveils compensation model allowing bank to claw back bonuses more easily .

"(CNN) -- I have for some time been collecting the phrases that patients use to complain about us doctors, and it is amazing how often you hear, ""(S)he never touched me!"" or, "". . . never laid a hand on me!"" or ""never looked at me"" or ""never listened"" or ""was too busy looking at the computer screen."" I take these statements as validating my belief that it is important for the physician to listen to the patient and to perform a skilled physical exam and it is more important than ever in this era of technology. Of course, when you take that position, you run the risk of being called a Luddite. The truth is, I love and embrace technology, and have no desire to return to the pre-CAT scan and pre-MRI days of old. But I see no reason to let new technology make us lose the abilities we have had for over a hundred years to make sophisticated diagnosis at the bedside. Indeed, it should make us so much better. There are clearly two very different ways of being a 21st-century physician in nations with advanced health care: In the first way, call it the old way, the patient's story (the history) is critically listened to and examined, because the diagnosis often lurks in that simple step. After that, the physical exam begins: here the actual body becomes the text, a text that is changing and must be frequently re-examined and read by the time-honored methods of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation (listening with a stethoscope). The scent in the room that might signal liver failure, or the expression of a family member that contradicts what the patient says, or the feel of a giant spleen -- these are valid soundings, pieces of phenotypic information that are even more valuable than knowing the patient's genotype. (In other words, it is great to have a genetic test that says you have a certain risk of skin cancer, but it would be just as important to have a physician who can detect that cancer—the phenotype-before it has spread.) Indeed almost all of dermatologic diagnosis is made by this step, but so also many other diagnoses can be made by this method. The physician then judiciously asks for blood tests and selectively gets imaging (by ultrasound or CT or MRI) and putting it all together, comes away with a holistic understanding of the unique individual who is wrestling with a problem. TED.com: Your health depends on where you live . The other way of being a physician tends to pay less attention to the living patient — indeed, the patient can almost seem like a distraction, because it is the ""iPatient"", (the term I coined for the virtual construct of the patient in the computer) that is being treated and examined. Increasingly, more and more physician time gets taken up with the iPatient, leaving the real patient in the bed feeling neglected. And the bizarre way health care is funded and the way incentives are lined up in this country ( we are paid to do to people, rather than for people — sticking a needle in or performing a test pays more than listening), we are pushed to spend more time with the ""iPatient"" (much of it spent documenting the time we supposedly have spent with the live patient). TED.com: Aubrey de Grey on how we can avoid aging . Though we can debate the merits of the two methods (and I think it is not much of a debate), it is clear that patients prefer the former method. That is because a visit to a doctor is not a cognitive exercise by two individuals and a computer — a crossword puzzle to be jointly solved. Instead, it is a complex human-with-human interaction. Indeed it is a ritual. Rituals, I have learned from my anthropology colleagues, are all about transformation: the elaborate rituals of baptism and wedding are associated with crossing a threshold, a transformation. When one individual (a patient) seeks help from another individual, and confides in that other person, and then incredibly, disrobes and allows touch, that has all the trappings of a ritual — it is not a mere cognitive exercise. Instead it is a ritual that is fundamental to the doctor-patient relationship and one, particularly in chronic disease or in terminal illness, that conveys to the patient a sense of the physician's commitment to being there, to never abandoning the patient. Indeed, it does not in any way negate the importance of technology but instead complements it. In short, it is just good medicine. Moreover, it is what most patients want. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Abraham Verghese.","Abraham Verghese: In age of technology, old-fashioned physical exam still vital .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Fall is foliage season in Ann Arbor, but the colors that really get locals excited this time of year are blue and yellow -- for the University of Michigan's football team. Every Saturday, millions of fans across the U.S. stream into college football stadiums like Michigan's Big House to chant, cheer, and stomp for the home teams. While winning helps, the best places to watch college football are based on more than any record. The stadiums must be outstanding, whether for their history or sheer size. Toss in rousing fight songs, stunts, and postgame hangouts, and you've got an experience worth traveling for. The stadium attendance numbers speak for themselves. College football drew a combined 49.6 million fans in 2010 -- nearly three times as many as the NFL (17.4 million). There's also a sense -- despite a few recent scandals -- that college football is much ""purer"" than the pro game. And college football is peppered with larger-than-life historic figures like coach Knute Rockne and running back Archie Griffin. But it's always ready for new legends. Join the game-day crowds at one of these top stadiums for that kind of exhilarating rush -- and maybe even history in the making. Travel + Leisure: America's worst drivers . BRONCO STADIUM: Boise, Idaho . Whether crashing the Bowl Championship Series (small schools just aren't supposed to be there) or asking your cheerleader girlfriend to marry you (on national TV) after upsetting Oklahoma in a bowl game, the Boise State Broncos like to make their own rules. Even Bronco Stadium's bright blue playing field -- sometimes called the ""Smurf Turf"" -- was the first non-green field in college football and remains the only alternative color in Division One. With a high-powered offense and a never-say-die attitude, little old Boise State is one of the NCAA's most entertaining teams to watch. Team Tradition: The freaky blue turf. Typical Chant: The call-and-answer, ""And that's another Bronco"" ""First-down"" Biggest Rival: University of Idaho and, nowadays, anyone who says the Broncos don't belong with the big boys of college football. Postgame Hangout: End Zone. Stadium Capacity: Approximately 33,500; broncosports.com. MEMORIAL STADIUM: Lincoln, Nebraska . The Nebraska Cornhuskers have sold out every home game since 1962, an ever-growing NCAA record of more than 300 consecutive full houses. It's now roughly 3.2 million people -- twice as many as currently live in the Prairie State. Erected in 1922 to honor Nebraska vets who fought in World War I, the Spanish American War, and the Civil War, the stadium is awash in red on game days as fans flood the stadium to cheer on their beloved Huskers and watch replays on one of the largest jumbotrons in college football. Team Tradition: The dramatic ""Tunnel Walk"" and charging onto the field across the Big Red Carpet. Typical Chant: Hus-ker Pow-er! Biggest Rival: Oklahoma. Postgame Hangout: The Single Barrel. Stadium Capacity: Approximately 85,000; huskers.com. ROSE BOWL: Pasadena, California . The Bruins haven't been a top team in years, but the laid-back southern California ambience still makes the Rose Bowl an appealing place for college football. It also helps that this nearly 90-year-old behemoth (opened 1922) is a National Historic Monument. Follow the lead of fans who tend to tailgate in leafy Arroyo Seco Park, watch the sunset over the hills behind the stadium as the game winds down, and then party hard in downtown Pasadena afterward. Team Tradition: Cheering the bear mascots Joe and Josephine Bruin and, on occasion, vandalizing the Tommy Trojan statue on rival USC's campus. Typical Chant: ""U-C-L-A Fight! Fight! Fight!""

Game day here is a sea of scarlet and gray sweeping across the campus toward Ohio Stadium to see the Buckeyes vanquish yet another opponent. Despite recent NCAA violations and a head coach departure, Ohio State remains a national power with historic trappings: the Buckeye Grove of trees to honor OSU All-Americans, the victory bell that tolls after each game, and the sousaphone player dotting the ""i"" when the Ohio State marching band spells out the word ""Ohio"" during the pregame show.

""Touchdown Jesus"" and the famed golden dome loom above this storied stadium, where Joe Montana learned to throw miracles long before he was a 49er. It was constructed in 1930 after coach Knute Rockne threatened to resign if his Fighting Irish didn't get a stadium more befitting their national stature. The flag-waving leprechaun mascot and the Irish Guard precision marchers rile up the crowd, and the team still salutes the fans after every game (win or lose). And are those fans rabid: Fox Sports recently named the Notre Dame faithful the ""most obnoxious fan base"" in college football.

While much of the rest of the football world slogs through rain and snow, ""The Swamp"" in Gainesville is filled with sunshine and rowdy fans. Consider that over the past 20 years Florida has won nearly 90 percent of its home games (the best in Division One college football). When visiting teams are about to hike the ball, it gets so loud they often can't hear their quarterback's signal. But the highlight of any visit to The Swamp comes when the band breaks into the theme song from Jaws and Florida fans raise their arms for a collective Gator Chomp. Team Tradition: The Gator Chomp.

The Texas Longhorns may be the state's most renowned football program, but nobody does Saturday afternoon in the fall like the folks in College Station. With Texas A&M's long and strong Cadet Corps tradition, its games are akin to military academy sporting events. Aggie students, collectively known as the ""12th Man,"" stand for the entire game. The 400-strong Fightin' Texas Aggie Band -- all of them cadets -- is the world's largest military marching band and known for its intricate precision drills. Midnight Yell pep rallies are a student staple before every home game. Team Tradition: The Aggie Bonfire (before the Texas Longhorns game). Typical Chant: ""Beat the Hell Outta!"" Biggest Rival: University of Texas. Postgame Hangout: The Dixie Chicken. Stadium Capacity: Approximately 82,000; aggieathletics.com. FRANKLIN FIELD: Philadelphia . More impressive for its heritage than knockdown, drag-out football, Franklin is the oldest college stadium still in use, dating back to 1895. It was the site of the first scoreboard and the first radio and television broadcasts of a football game, and -- back when the Eagles shared the stadium with the UPenn Quakers -- this was the first NFL stadium with Astroturf. The Quakers won the national college football championship four times before World War One. Now their Ivy League games are a throwback to that time when the players really were student-athletes. Team Tradition: Throwing toast onto the field at the end of the third quarter. Typical Chant: ""Hurrah! Hurrah! Pennsylvania!"" Biggest Rivals: Harvard and Villanova. Postgame Hangout: Cavanaugh's. Stadium Capacity: Approximately 52,000; pennathletics.com. MICHIGAN STADIUM: Ann Arbor, Michigan . The ""Big House"" is the largest stadium in college football and the third largest sports stadium on the entire planet. (It even hosted the largest ice hockey crowd of all time: 100,000). At its 1927 opening, the stadium featured 22 miles of bleacher seats hewn from California redwoods. The seats have changed, as have the Wolverines, who are fighting their way back into the top 10 rankings. Whatever their record from one season to the next, their rivalry games are consistently among the most hotly contested in collegiate sports. Team Tradition: Maize and blue ""winged"" helmets. Typical Chant: ""Hail! Hail to Michigan."" Biggest Rivals: Ohio State, Michigan State, and Notre Dame. Postgame Hangout: The Arena Bar. Stadium Capacity: Approximately 109,000; mgoblue.com. AUTZEN STADIUM: Eugene, Oregon . In little more than a decade, the Ducks have gone from laughingstock to national contender -- and the NCAA's number one fashion show. Nobody does uniforms like the chic Nike-clad Ducks, who normally sport a dozen different looks in any given season. Many a visiting coach, player, and broadcaster have claimed that Autzen is the loudest stadium in college football. The highest noise level recorded inside the stadium was an eardrum-shattering 127 decibels during a 2007 victory over USC -- a level that falls right between a jackhammer and a jet plane. Team Tradition: The Oregon Duck mascot doing push-ups for every point the team scores. Typical Chant: ""Go! Ducks!"" Biggest Rival: Oregon State (their annual game is called the ""Civil War""). Postgame Hangout: Rennie's Landing. Stadium Capacity: Approximately 54,000; goducks.com. TIGER STADIUM: Baton Rouge, Louisiana . ESPN named Tiger Stadium the ""scariest place"" to play in America in 2007 based on a survey of opposing South East Conference (SEC) coaches. And with more than 90,000 trash-talking Tiger faithful -- nearly all of them decked out in purple and gold -- screaming from kickoff to the final whistle, it's not hard to understand why. By the time night games kick off, fans have been partying practically since sunrise. Legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant quipped that playing away at LSU, a.k.a. ""Death Valley,"" was ""like being inside a drum."" Team Tradition: Playing home games on sultry Saturday nights rather than the daytime. Typical Chant: Shouting ""L-S-U . . .

"(CNN) -- When the eye of the storm closes in most people head home -- but for surfers intent on riding out the waves of the winter storms it's a different story. Europe may have escaped the icy touch of the ""Polar Vortex"" which has ravished the U.S. but storms on the continent have rung in the new year with widespread flooding and disruption. For hardcore surfers this is a time of feast not famine; they are having a swell time. The low pressure systems sweeping in off the Atlantic have had surfers chasing the so-called ""Black Swell,"" with world class athletes travelling to the west coast of France to ride the waves blooming off the famous Belharra reef in Basque Country. American Shane Dorian packed his bags and hopped on a jet from Hawaii to join some of Europe's top surfers, including Justine Dupont and Benjamin Sanchis, for a once in a lifetime chance to master the big Belharra swell. ""Belhara take me to your arms,"" wrote Sanchis on his Facebook page, while Dorian quipped: ""paddled into a few at #Belharra today in the south of France."" Although the waters peaked during the night, Dorian and his cohorts were still able to enjoy a surf session at a spot where surfers normally need to be towed out to the colossal waves by jet skis. French 1998 World Cup winner Bixente Lizarazu, a keen surfer since hanging up his football boots, also took to the water at Belharra. On the west coast of Ireland, stormy weather and whopper waves attracted a huddle of surfers to sweet surf spot Mullaghmore Head. Across the water, the U.K. has battened down the hatches against high winds and heavy rain but even in the comparatively smaller waves lapping the British coast intrepid surfers ignored the safety advice of the Met Office to brave the waters.

"(CNN) -- The movement to eradicate food deserts would benefit from, of all things, banishment of the term food desert. In a job where I'm seeking innovations that allow more families to have better access to fresh fruits and vegetables, I'm struck that advocates seem mostly interested in mapping and remapping the same neighborhoods to establish conclusive proof that food deserts exist. By the USDA definition, that means documenting ""a census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy, affordable food retail outlet."" The problem is that this approach focuses on diagnosis but not cure. It's as if doctors kept perfecting the test for polio without looking for a vaccine. The food desert diagnosis too easily turns into a club used to beat families most in need. Being labeled a food desert makes a neighborhood undesirable, rather than a target of opportunity. The discussion gets mean-spirited when critics assert that it's the people -- not the neighborhoods -- who are broken. In poor neighborhoods where there's more violence and limited opportunities, some assume that residents brought the difficult circumstances on themselves, that families like living on the dole. Sometimes it's whispered. Sometimes it's shouted. Either way, it's the same conclusion: Those people got what they deserved. To buy the critics' argument means you have to believe a mother would put her family in life-threatening situations, endure the suffering associated with hunger, opt out of the American Dream, all to get about $4.50 a day in federal food assistance. On top of everything else, as economist Jacob Geller and others have pointed out, the government's food desert definition might not matter much. What we need is the recognition that food represents heritage, love, faith, healing and family pride. Food builds community and helps reduce social isolation. What we need is experimentation with new ownership, supply chain and distribution models to disrupt the existing food systems. What we need is a Food Oasis Movement. There is an untapped demand for fresh fruits and vegetables. Unlocking the demand requires understanding that food access is about relationships, not transactions. Also, price matters. Families won't respond to the food police nagging them to eat their veggies. Outsiders dropping off a pallet of free food won't cut it. Families will respond positively to cooking classes with their friends, celebrations of family kitchen traditions and high-quality produce distributed through trusted sources. Philadelphia grocer Jeff Brown has opened supermarkets in neighborhoods written off as food deserts. He hires from the neighborhood, adds specialty items the neighbors like and puts health clinics and community meeting rooms inside his stores. His stores make money. Food Oasis innovators focus on what they can do, not what they can't. In Chicago, community activists came up with Fresh Moves, a grocery on wheels. In California, Oakland's People's Grocery created a mobile market and a farm-to-table distribution business serving low-income families. It's now launching a grocery store. In Maryland, Baltimore's virtual supermarket allows residents to order healthy food and pick up their deliveries at neighborhood libraries, schools and senior housing sites. In Atlanta, across the street from the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, Rashid Nuri turned a neglected property into a six-acre farm, Wheat Street Garden, with an on-site market. He is transforming a neighborhood into a Food Oasis. The demand is unquestionable. Customers keep coming back for chemical-free kale, squash and other whole foods. The distribution model is creative. Many shoppers pay full price. Thanks to foundation grants, families using SNAP benefits get $2 worth of food for every $1 spent. For people who are broke and hungry, Nuri makes sure they get food. There's an easy way to test the usefulness of the food desert label. Show up at a neighborhood meeting with research on how residents are living in a food desert. Guess what? They already know. So take another tactic. Ask residents how they want to transform their neighborhood into a Food Oasis. I've done it, and residents have lots of ideas. They want to turn vacant lots into gardens, learn canning techniques so summer vegetables will be available year round and teach young people the joy of making casseroles. Sorting through all of the answers, it boils down to three things: Eat. Cook. Grow. Daniel Ballard, whose Edible Yard and Garden firm creates landscapes that feed people, figured this out when he was working with high school kids through Desire Street Ministries in New Orleans. He saw that young people were interested in culinary traditions. He taught them that the way to eat what you want is by learning to cook. To get the ingredients for the recipes -- these young people discovered -- they had to grow the food. We all get the food desert diagnosis. Like Ballard's kids, we're ready to create a Food Oasis. We're ready to eat, cook and grow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Bare.","John Bare: The movement to get rid of food deserts can start with banishing the term .

"(CNN) -- Authorities imposed a curfew in the Iraqi city of Ramadi following the arrest of a prominent Sunni lawmaker in a raid that left at least two people dead, police officials said Sunday. The arrest of Ahmed al-Alwani, one of the main organizers of the anti-government demonstrations in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, has raised fears of a possible retaliatory strike against Iraqi forces. The curfew is in place until further notice, the police officials said. The arrest comes as violence has reached its worst levels since the height of the Iraq War, when sectarian fighting pushed the country to the brink of civil war. Al-Alwani, a staunch critic of the Shiite-dominated government of Nuri al-Maliki, was wanted on a warrant issued by the government alleging the incitement of sectarian strife, said the police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. Al-Alwani has accused the prime minister of marginalizing Iraq's Sunni minority. Al-Alwani's brother and a woman were killed Saturday when Iraqi security forces clashed with the lawmaker's bodyguards at his Ramadi home, the police officials said. Eleven of al-Alwani's bodyguards were wounded, they said. Meanwhile, 12 members of Iraq's security forces were killed in four separate attacks in the Sunni-dominated city of Mosul, north of Baghdad, police officials said. Among those killed were six soldiers who died in a suicide car bombing that targeted a military post, the police officials said. CNN's Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","NEW: A curfew has been imposed in Ramadi until further notice, police say .

"(CNN)  -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report. The Texas Transportation Institute reports commute times saw a small dip in 2007. Rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility. ""It's temporary, but real,"" said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. ""As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work."" The institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007. The organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by ""every measure, congestion has increased substantially"" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007. Researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline. Congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a ""rare break in near-constant growth,"" the report said. Because the changes were nominal, some people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said. ""Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice,"" Fette said. Among the report's other findings: . • American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler. • The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person. •  The amount of wasted fuel from sitting idle with the motor running topped 2.8 billion gallons or three weeks' worth of gas for every traveler. Congestion has slowed but, said the report's authors, that means only that things are getting worse slower, ""hardly a positive goal statement."" The Urban Mobility Report data base includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- Northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s. In every case, when the economy rebounded, so did the congestion problem, the report said. That means congestion trends are likely to swing upward once the economy starts picking up. Americans might then have fatter pocketbooks, but they'll go back to staring through their windshields a bit longer. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Texas Transportation Institute: Less time in traffic, less wasted gas in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Not even the British spy agencies that inspired James Bond can solve the mystery of a secret World War II message recently found on the skeleton of a carrier pigeon in a house chimney. The meaning of the encoded message apparently died about 70 years ago with the wayward pigeon that David Martin found in his smokestack in Bletchingley, Surrey County, England. Martin recently discovered the bird's remains with the surprisingly intact message inside a small red canister attached to a leg bone. The only hope appears to be curators at the Pigeon Museum at Bletchley Park, who are now trying to trace the origins of two alphanumeric identifiers for the pigeon that were also written on the message, the UK intelligence agency GCHQ said this week. ""If they are identified and their wartime service established, it could help to decode the message,"" the agency said about the pigeon's identity numbers. To the casual reader, the message is indecipherable. Hand-written on a small piece of paper labeled ""Pigeon Service,"" the note consists of five-letter words. Those words don't make sense: The jumble begins with ""AOAKN"" and ""HVPKD."" In all, the message consists of 27 five-letter code groups. Read the full encoded message (PDF) Deciphering the message requires codebooks and possibly a ""one-time pad"" encryption system, and those materials ""will normally have been destroyed once no longer in use,"" the agency said. There is a small chance that a codebook survived. ""Without access to the relevant codebooks and details of any additional encryption used, it will remain impossible to decrypt,"" the agency said. The one-time pad encryption gave the note added security. A random key is used to encrypt only one message. ""The advantage of this system is that, if used correctly, it is unbreakable as long as the key is kept secret,"" the agency said. ""The disadvantage is that both the sending and receiving parties need to have access to the same key, which usually means producing and sharing a large keypad in advance."" Heightening the mystery are three other issues: The message is undated, the meaning of its destination of ""X02"" is unknown, and analysts can't identify the sender's signature or his unit. ""Unfortunately, much of the vital information that would indicate the context of the message is missing,"" the intelligence service said. Coded notes: A whodunit without an answer . The sender's sign-off appears to say ""Sjt W Stot,"" using an abbreviation for ""serjeant,"" an old-fashioned spelling for ""sergeant,"" the agency said. The use of ""Sjt"" links the message to the army, the spy agency said. ""If 'Sjt Stot' and addressee X02 could be identified, it could give us a better idea of where to look for the information,"" the agency said. About 250,000 pigeons were used during World War II by all branches of the military and the Special Operations Executive, the UK intelligence agency said. Flying from mainland Europe to Britain, the birds heroically delivered all sorts of messages through a gauntlet of enemy hawk patrols and potshots from soldiers. ""Although it is disappointing that we cannot yet read the message brought back by a brave carrier pigeon, it is a tribute to the skills of the wartime code-makers that, despite working under severe pressure, they devised a code that was undecipherable both then and now,"" said GCHQ, one of three UK intelligence agencies.

"Washington (CNN) -- The path to the White House is paved with former frontrunners -- or maybe call them buzzleaders, since we're three years away from 2016 and nobody is officially running for president yet. Time magazine has put three different GOP lawmakers on its cover. First it was Marco Rubio. Then it was Rand Paul. Now it is Chris Christie. Don't forget to sprinkle that seasoning over all the sugary buzz surrounding Christie, who was emphatically reelected as New Jersey governor this week. The foreshadowing was evident as he sailed to victory and a second term. There's no doubt Christie is mulling a run for president. ""I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, then maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now and see how it's done,"" he said during his victory speech, suggesting he had found the right mix to work together with Democrats and rise above partisan rancor. He was even more pointed with CNN's Jake Tapper when he suggested that Republicans have veered away from a winning path and onto an ideological one. Where does Christie go next? ""I think that the party's got to focus on winning again,"" Christie said from his campaign bus Tuesday, sending a clear message to conservative idealists and the tea party. ""You know, sometimes, I feel like our party cares more about winning the argument than they care about winning elections. And if you don't win elections, you can't govern. And if you can't govern, you can't change the direction of a state, like we have done in New Jersey."" The big question, assuming he does run for president, will be whether he can get conservatives he doesn't see eye-to-eye with to support him in order to get to a general election. The Christie narrative goes like this: The dynamic New Jersey Republican has flourished as a red governor in a blue state. He's defied unions and enacted conservative policies without doing something too drastic, the way Mitt Romney did with health insurance reform. He's shown a willingness to work with Democrats. He showed leadership after Superstorm Sandy. There's no doubt about it: Chris Christie won a huge victory Tuesday. And the way the media works these days, a big win for a governor like Christie makes him the odds-on favorite to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016, three years from now. Until he isn't. Wait for it. Or just ask Rubio about working across party lines in Washington. Rand Paul isn't much known for working with Democrats, but his buzz has faded lately as he's dealt with a plagiarism scandal. And he has competed with Sen. Ted Cruz for attention with the most conservative bulwarks of the party. When moderates fight back: GOP civil war could be brutal in 2014 elections . Christie's relationship with social conservatives, a key GOP constituency, could be frustrated. He laid down his sword, for instance, when it became clear that courts would allow same-sex marriage in California. But conservatives in Iowa aren't ready to reject him simply because he lost the battle over same-sex marriage. ""He accepted, I'll say it, the position of gay marriage existing in New Jersey,"" said Rep. Steve King, a Republican from the key state of Iowa. He said economic issues will be more important. ""We've had to make accommodations for that in Iowa. We have some experience with that. But he didn't endorse gay marriage. And the tea party themselves, I've been in many discussions with them and tried to argue to the contrary, they say we want to stay with the economic and the constitutional issues. Not the social agenda."" And don't forget: Romney, the Republicans' 2012 presidential nominee, was governor of the first state to allow same-sex marriage when courts there OK'd the practice back in 2004. Christie has got the cover of Time this week. Back in February, it was Rubio pictured confidently on the cover of that publication with the bold headline, ""The Republican Savior: How Marco Rubio became the new voice of the GOP."" Back then -- just this past February -- Rubio was the young senator with tea party credentials and a willingness to work across the aisle. The Rubio narrative is just as compelling as Christie's. The son of Cuban immigrants came to Washington on a tea party wave and staked his career on a bold and politically courageous effort to rewrite the nation's immigration laws. He sought to heal a perceived rift between Republicans and Latinos and bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. It was a tortured process, but the Senate did, four months after Rubio was featured on the Time cover, pass 68-32 the immigration bill he helped write. It took mostly Democratic votes to do it, however. And Rubio's tea party cred was hurt. Election Night 2013: Christie wins big, Virginia provides drama . Now that bill on which Rubio spent so much political capital is, as he told CNN's Dana Bash on Wednesday, ""stuck."" And Rubio is the first to admit he has paid a political price with Republicans for working with Democrats and supporting a pathway to citizenship. ""I was in favor of immigration reform. It had nothing to do with politics of it, although it may have some political implications. It was because it was the right thing to do for our country."" The more conservative House of Representatives won't touch Rubio's bipartisan bill, which has put him in the tough position of potentially having to support something less expansive in order to get anything done. ""What comprehensive bill on anything is going to get passed around here right now?"" he asked. ""We can't even get a farm bill passed."" Farm bills, FYI, are normally bipartisan and easily ratified. But not this year, with a stubborn Congress and a divisive president. ""People think Washington is gross,"" he said of the current atmosphere. Later, Rubio told Bash he doesn't yet know of any senators running for president (meaning him), but he hopes his experience in Washington won't be a permanent liability. ""You can work in Washington without being of Washington,"" he said. ""Luckily, I haven't been here long enough to believe that what goes on here is normal.""","There's no doubt Christie is mulling a run for president .
The big question will be whether he can get conservatives to support him .
Sen. Marco Rubio's prominent profile has led to complications for the potential 2016 contender ."
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama met with leaders of several Russian social activist groups Friday, an event that likely touched on the sensitive subject of gay rights in the nation amid tensions over Syria. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law passed by parliament that bans the public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it. Violators can be fined and, if they are foreigners, deported. Obama, who has advocated gay rights and same-sex marriage, has said that ""nobody's more offended than me"" by the Russian law. In connecting with the nine activists, Obama spoke about his own foray into politics. ""I got my start as a community organizer, somebody who was working in what would be called an NGO in the international community,"" he said. ""I got elected president by engaging people at a grass-roots level."" He further called the activists' work ""critically important"" to open society. ""I'm very proud of their work,"" Obama said. ""Part of good government is making sure we're creating a space for civil society."" Critics say the Russian law is so vague that anyone can be prosecuted for wearing a rainbow T-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex. At the event Friday in Russia, Obama met with representatives of groups that support a range of causes, including media freedom, protection of the environment and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. The controversy over the law is one of several disputes between the United States and Russia, including the question of possible military action against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Moscow's decision to shelter National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Obama and Putin met briefly Thursday at the Group of 20 summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, shaking hands and exchanging a few words. Officials said the two leaders could have a longer meeting on the margins of the event. Obama had previously canceled a summit meeting with Putin scheduled around the G20 event after Russia gave temporary asylum to Snowden, whom the United States wants to prosecute for leaking documents about NSA surveillance programs. It said at the time that considerations on a variety of issues went into the decision to cancel the meeting.","President Barack Obama is in St. Petersburg, Russia, for the G20 summit meeting .

"(CNN) -- On a winter evening in early 1940, Hattie McDaniel became the first black performer to win an Oscar, a best supporting actress honor for her performance as Mammy, the servant in ""Gone With the Wind."" Will Smith has overcome racial boundaries but can do more, says an expert in race-based casting. She accepted her award at the Academy Awards ceremony at the Coconut Grove, a nightclub in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel, where she was seated in the segregated section at the rear of the room. Though her win was played as a sign of progress for black actors in America -- ""Not only was she the first of her race to receive an Award, but she was also the first Negro ever to sit at an Academy banquet,"" said Daily Variety, according to Mason Wiley and Damien Bona's indispensable ""Inside Oscar"" -- her role was poorly received by much of the black community. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People claimed that the part was stereotypical and degrading. ""I think [the NAACP] were correct,"" said Jill Watts, author of ""Hattie McDaniel: Black Ambition, White Hollywood."" But, Watts added, ""McDaniel knew that 'If I reject these maid roles, [black people] won't be on the screen.' And her point was, 'we need a presence within the industry.' "" Nearly 70 years after McDaniel's win, black performers have certainly come far. Actors like Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington and Halle Berry have broken boundaries in making their mark on the film industry. But black actors have been few and far between at the Oscars. In its 80-year history, the Academy has awarded 11 black actors with trophies, six of whom won in this decade. This year, two black actors are nominated for Academy Awards: Viola Davis for her role in ""Doubt"" and Taraji P. Henson for her part in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.""  Watch Viola Davis talk about the Oscars » . Tom O'Neil, entertainment reporter for the Los Angeles Times' TheEnvelope.com and founder of GoldDerby.com, a Web site dedicated to predicting and analyzing award show wins, said the Academy finally began making an effort to recognize black actors after Halle Berry and Denzel Washington won Oscars in 2002. ""The Oscars were notoriously stingy to black actors,"" O'Neil said. ""It was that year that it became such a huge issue in the media and Hollywood really woke up to this issue."" O'Neil claims that Hollywood has improved in its recognition of black actors, but the Academy's failure to nominate 2006's ""Dreamgirls"" for best picture, for example, is a sign that Oscar voters simply don't understand such films culturally. ""I don't believe that there's an element of racism. It's an inability to relate to the drama being portrayed,"" O'Neil said. ""The largely white Academy just didn't get ['Dreamgirls']. They weren't emotionally engaged in the story."" Although awarding Oscars to 11 black actors is ""stingy,"" O'Neil said, ""you have to compare that to the number of quality films that gave good roles to actors."" That's the problem, said Russell Robinson, a professor of law at the University of California - Los Angeles, who wrote a 2006 report about unfair race-based casting in Hollywood. ""It's an industry norm that the assumption is that roles go to white actors,"" Robinson said. ""They use people of color to flesh out the film and exemplify racial stereotypes."" Robinson's report, ""Hollywood's Race/Ethnicity And Gender-Based Casting: Prospects For A Title VII Lawsuit,"" found that the majority of roles that do not specify a race or ethnicity are played by white actors, which tends to limit black actors to stereotypical roles. ""I think what bothers a lot of African-Americans is that we see the same images time and time again. ... We'd like to see the full range of complexities that we see in our communities,"" Robinson said. In the past, black actors didn't have much of choice when it came to playing stereotypical parts, said John Forbes, executive director of the Black Hollywood Education and Resource Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting films featuring black actors. ""People had to do what they had to do in those days on and off the screen to survive,"" he said. In the early 1900s, that often meant playing caricature roles like that of Stepin Fetchit, a foolish and weak character created and played by Lincoln Perry, who eventually became the first black millionaire actor. With the arrival of Poitier to the film industry in the 1950s, Hollywood seemed to change its perspective of black actors. iReport.com: Who will win at the Oscars? ""Poitier was able to create a character that was always strong. The black male image that he portrayed on the screen was something that everyone was proud of,"" Forbes said. More recently, actors like Will Smith have been successful in overcoming racial boundaries because they're profitable, Robinson said. But with their success also comes responsibility. As the biggest box office star in the world, Smith, Robinson believes, is obligated to push Hollywood to make changes. With Smith's 2005 film ""Hitch,"" ""the studio would not cast a black woman as Will Smith's love interest in the film because they didn't want the film to be a 'black film,' "" Robinson said. ""I would hope that Will challenged that decision. ... I would hope that Will would try to get black actors hired."" Robinson added, ""the question is, 'How can you use that power to help other people?' ""","Hattie McDaniel was the first black performer to win an Academy Award .

"(CNN) -- They're on display at cash registers all across America: Candy bars, packs of gum -- and little cigars. In some cases, those cigars aren't tucked away behind the counter where only the attendant can get to them but right in front for anyone to pick up. Traditional fat cigars are a small part of today's cigar industry. Newer types of cancer sticks include cigarette-sized cigars, or little cigars, designed to look like a typical cigarette but which evade cigarette taxes and regulations. Flavored little cigars can be sold virtually anywhere, and kids are a prime target of these new products. Unlike cigarettes, many are sold singly or in small, low-priced packs, at a fraction of the cost of a cigarette in most states. These little cigars have names like ""Da Bomb Blueberry"" and ""Swagberry."" The flavors themselves -- chocolate mint, watermelon, wild cherry and more -- can mask the harsh taste of tobacco and are clearly attractive to children. The Food and Drug Administration banned candy and fruit flavors in cigarettes so young people would not be enticed. But cigars weren't covered. The tobacco industry claims that its marketing efforts are solely aimed at adults. It has long argued that its marketing doesn't increase demand or cause young people to smoke but instead is intended to increase brand appeal and market share among existing adult smokers. How many grown-ups do you know who smoke grape-flavored cigars? CDC: More teens smoking flavored tobacco . Little cigars have become more popular in recent years. Flavored brands have almost 80% of the market share. In 2011, among middle school and high school students who currently smoke cigars, more than one in three reported using flavored little cigars. Six states -- Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Wisconsin -- have youth cigar smoking rates the same as or higher than those of youth cigarette smoking. Despite industry statements to the contrary, the link between marketing and youth tobacco use is clear. Some legislative and regulatory actions that tackle elements of tax discrepancies, youth appeal and marketing are in place or under consideration. New York and Providence, Rhode Island, have enacted city-wide ordinances prohibiting the sale of flavored tobacco products, including flavored little cigars. Both ordinances have been challenged and upheld in U.S. District Court. In April, the Tobacco Tax and Enforcement Reform Act was introduced in the Senate. This bill aims to eliminate tax disparities between different tobacco products, reduce illegal tobacco trade and increase the federal excise tax on tobacco products. Based on decades of evidence, the 2012 surgeon general's report on tobacco use among youth and young adults concluded that tobacco industry marketing causes youths to smoke, and nicotine addiction keeps them smoking. This sobering fact holds true in spite of bans on advertising and promotions that target children and youths, and restrictions on certain other marketing activities. Nearly 90% of smokers started before they were 18 years old, and almost no one starts smoking after age 25. To prevent the needless death, disability and illness caused by smoking, we must stop young people from even starting to smoke. A key part of prevention efforts must be action that will eliminate loopholes in restrictions on tobacco marketing, pricing and products that encourage children and youth to smoke. I don't think it's too much to expect of our society that we protect our kids so they can reach adulthood without an addiction that can harm or kill them.

"(CNN) -- The first refuge of tyrants and buffoons is to blame someone else for the messes they make. On the world stage, that usually means blaming America when things do not go their way. It's an old trick. It's easy to spot. But it doesn't work as well as it used to. Russia's Vladimir Putin is using it to bolster his standing ahead of Sunday's presidential election. The Iranian regime just dusted off the old trick in advance of Friday's election, the first national vote since the disputed, probably stolen, 2009 election. So have Egypt and Syria, blaming ""foreign conspirators"" for their people's demands for democratic change. Even Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, with elections approaching, has blamed his cancer on the CIA. That is, indeed, a flattering collection of critics. The blame-America ploy is nothing new. The first chapter of the Dictators' Handbook instructs practitioners to find an external enemy to help them preserve their rule. OK, there is no such book, but the strategy is as familiar as paying ""supporters"" to attend a pro-government demonstration, or simply stealing an election. By blaming mysterious and powerful outsiders, rulers can shift their problems and distract the population from their legitimate grievances. And when it really works, the tactic can rally the people behind the leader as they passionately take up the cause against evil foreigners who would harm their country. What could be better? The scam worked like a charm for decades in the Middle East, where dictators blamed the U.S. and Israel for their countries' multiplying ills. But the search for excuses, like a knife that has been used too many times, is not cutting as sharply as it used to. In 2009, when hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets accusing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of stealing the election, the regime blamed ""Western powers"" for the outcry. Ahead of Friday's parliamentary elections in Iran, authorities first decimated the opposition and then accused America of a secret plot. Authorities imprisoned those who dared to speak out, including reporters, and carried out scores of public executions as a way to intimidate dissenters. The regime still faces profound internal divisions -- between hard-liners and harder-liners. But it would still like a strong turnout to make its stifling grip on power look like a warm embrace. To pre-empt anyone from interpreting low voting numbers as rejection of the regime, the government warned that a malevolent U.S. is afraid of a turnout and is working to keep Iranians from voting. It further claimed that turnout was high when voting was just starting, despite observations to the contrary. In Egypt, the U.S. and Israel have been blamed for practically everything, from starting uprisings to fomenting sectarian clashes. The ruling military council is resisting pressure for change. When protesters demand democracy, the military council hints it's America's doing, suggesting ""hidden powers"" are creating unrest, and then detaining American democracy workers. Egyptian authorities walk a fine line, seeking to benefit from anti-American sentiment without cutting off Washington's generous aid. Syria's Bashar al-Assad has blamed a variety of villains for his woes, as he continues to kill regime opponents by the thousands. He even tried to provoke fighting with Israel by rushing people across the border last summer, but the people saw through his scheme. Protesters want Assad out. Still, the president claims, ""The external conspiracy is clear to everybody."" In Russia, no one doubts that Vladimir Putin will win Sunday's presidential election. He has run Russia for more than a dozen years, including an early stint as prime minister. He won the presidency twice, and when he hit the term-limit block, he anointed a successor as president while he became prime minister yet again. When he announced a few months ago that he would seek the presidency, Russians felt insulted. Despite the merciless Moscow cold, thousands have protested against Putin, because they believe his actions are an affront to democracy. But in utterly predictable fashion, Putin blames the the U.S. He took a jab at Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and dismissed his critics by accusing them of following Clinton's ""signal."" In a rant reminiscent of moldy Cold War politics, he said the United States wanted to weaken Russia, a rival nuclear power. Putin will win because he still enjoys a great deal of support, and because he has denied Russians a chance to fairly weigh the alternatives by undermining the opposition at every turn and monopolizing media coverage. His charges that the U.S. orchestrated opposition to his rule only serve to show his nervousness and weakness. In Venezuela, Chavez is facing stronger opposition than at any time in his dozen years in power. He too has made warnings about U.S. misdeeds a hallmark of his rule. When he was diagnosed with cancer, as had been several Latin American presidents, he suggested a mysterious Washington link to the illnesses. The search for a distraction, for someone to blame for all that ails a president or a country does not mean that outsiders are completely free of blame. But it does point to regimes that want to change the subject, that want the people to think about something else, anything, other than whether or not they should stay in power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Tyrants like to blame someone else for the messes they make .

"(EW.com) -- History Channel's ""The Bible"" premiere delivered divine Nielsen ratings Sunday night, thumping all of the major broadcast shows. The miniseries' two-hour cable network premiere was seen by 13.1 million viewers and scored a 3.3 rating among adults 18-49. That's more viewers and a higher demo rating than any show on the major broadcast networks last night and ranks as cable's most-watched entertainment telecast this year. If you include the show's repeat, the viewership rises to 14.8 million for the night. ""The success of 'The Bible' has catapulted History into one of the most powerful brands across media landscape and we could not be more thrilled and more proud,"" Nancy Dubuc, president of A&E Networks. ""Clearly there is a nationwide groundswell that was waiting for this moment ... An enormous debt of gratitude goes out to everyone and the amazing effort put forth to drive us to this amazing win. Clearly the passion for this project has resonated with our viewers and across the nation. We are thrilled, and the story is only just beginning."" ""The Bible"" couldn't quite top History's previous record-setting mini Hatfields & McCoys, however, which had a stunning 13.9 million viewers for its premiere last year. And last night's 18-49 demo rating is almost certainly lower than AMC's mega-hit ""The Walking Dead"" (those ratings will not be released until tomorrow), though ""The Bible"" very likely had more viewers. ""The Bible"" is a 10-hour live-action miniseries executive produced by ""Survivor"" and ""Celebrity Apprentice"" executive producer Mark Burnett along with his wife Roma Downey (""Touched by an Angel""). Burnett has said he made the special effects-filled project to help tackle ""Bible illiteracy"" among young people. ""In school, you have to know a certain amount of Shakespeare, but no Bible,"" Burnett told the Christian Science Monitor. ""So there's got to be a way to look at it from a pure literature point of view. If it wasn't for the Bible, arguably Shakespeare wouldn't have written those stories."" 'Downton Abbey': Tom Cullen cast as... Burnett predicted that ""The Bible,"" once you include home video and international sales, will eventually be seen by more viewers ""than any of our other series combined over the next three decades."" It's off to a good start â€” among the broadcast shows that The Bible out-performed among total audience last night was Burnett's own ""All-Star Celebrity Apprentice"" premiere on NBC which returned to a disappointing 5.1 million viewers. ""We could not be more thrilled with this out of the gate success,"" said Downey and Burnett in a statement. ""The world is watching right now and we are incredibly humbled by the reaction to the series. This No. 1 series is a tribute to all those who have helped us to spread the Word. Ultimately 'The Bible' will be seen and felt by billions around the globe ...Today, more people are discussing God's chosen people â€” Moses and Abraham â€” in one day than ever before."" Alexis Bledel joins Fox sitcom pilot . Also last night, History's first scripted series ""Vikings"" delivered 6.2 million viewers for the premiere and 8.2 million for the night.

"(CNN) -- In finding mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger guilty on racketeering charges Monday, a federal jury linked him to 11 murders. He had been accused of involvement in 19 murders, with those killings taking place from 1973 through 1985. The jury found that the government failed to prove Bulger was involved in seven of the murders, and jurors had ""no finding"" in one murder. Here are profiles of the victims, listed in the order that the deaths occurred. Bulger was found to be involved in the deaths of: . --Paul McGonagle (1974): McGonagle was a leader of a rival gang in Boston. Jurors were shown several photos of remains recovered in 2000, including parts of a pelvic bone, a fractured skull with decomposed brain matter and a ring with part of a decomposed finger bone. The remains were recovered from a shallow grave near a river, and a witness testified that whenever Bulger drove past the grave area, he would say, ""Drink up, Paulie."" --Edward Connors (1975): Connors was gunned down in a phone booth in 1975 after, according to witnesses, he had bragged about his involvement in another killing. Connors' daughter, Karen Smith, testified in the trial about how her father always came home for dinner and put her and her sister to bed. Smith sobbed as the courtroom listened to Bulger talk about the Connors killing in a recorded phone call. --Thomas King (1975): King was involved in Bulger's criminal activities, according to testimony, and Bulger was convinced King was going to do something reckless. Former hitman John Martorano, who served 12 years in prison but was released in 2007 in exchange for testifying against Bulger, testified that he shot King in the back of the head, on orders from Bulger. Martorano said King was told to come along on a ""hit"" on another target, and while Bulger drove and King sat in the front seat, Martorano shot him. --Richard Castucci (1976): Castucci, a night club owner and a bookie, had learned too much about members of Bulger's gang who were hiding from authorities, witnesses said. Martorano, the former hitman, testified that that he shot Castucci while he, Martorano and Bulger were in an apartment counting money. ""Richie was sitting at the kitchen table counting the money with Whitey at the table,"" Martorano tesitified. ""I walked to the side of Castucci and shot him in the temple."" --Roger Wheeler (1981): Wheeler, a wealthy Oklahoma businessman, refused to sell a portion of his business to John Callahan, who was fronting the deal on behalf of Bulger and his gang, according to testimony. When Wheeler wouldn't sell, Bulger and his partner Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi sent weapons in a ""tool kit"" on a bus to Oklahoma for Martorano to pick up. Martorano testified he shot Wheeler in the eye at a Tulsa country club. --Brian Halloran (1982): Halloran was gunned down in 1982. According to testimony, Halloran had become an FBI informant and had agreed to wear a ""wire"" to get John Callahan, the man who had tried to buy a business from victim Roger Wheeler to admit gang participation in Wheeler's murder. Bulger learned from his crooked FBI handler that Halloran was cooperating with authorities against Bulger. --Michael Donahue (1982): Donahue was gunned down while driving home a man Bulger and his crime associates were targeting. John Morris, a corrupt FBI supervisor who was on the Bulger payroll at the time of Donahue's death, made a public apology to the Donahue family in court during Bulger's trial. ""I don't ask for your forgiveness, but I do want to express my sincere apology for things I may have done and things I didn't do,"" Morris said to the Donahue family. Michael Donahue's three sons and widow, Patricia, sat front row in the reserved section in the Boston courtroom. --John Callahan (1982): He was the ""front man"" who had tried to buy a business from victim Roger Wheeler. Callahan's body was discovered in the trunk of a car in a Miami airport parking lot. According to testimony, Bulger got word Callahan was being called for questioning in Wheeler's death. Callahan was called down to Florida to talk to hit man Martorano. When he got there, Martorano shot him in the head, according to testimony. --Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett (1983): Barrett went missing after a dispute with Bulger over money from the burglary of a financial institution, according to testimony. Barrett's remains were exhumed from a shallow, makeshift grave in Boston in 2000. A former drug dealer for Bulger testified that Bulger threatened him once by saying, ""You remember what happened to Bucky Barrett."" --John McIntyre (1984): According to testimony, McIntyre had begun cooperating with the government on the shipment of weapons to the Irish Republican Army and the shipment of 36 tons of marijuana imported into Boston Harbor. Bulger partner Flemmi said he was holding McIntyre's body while Bulger was trying to strangle him with a rope, but the rope was too thick. After that didn't work, McIntyre practically begged for a bullet after Bulger asked him if he would ""like one in the head,"" according to Flemmi. --Deborah Hussey (1985): Hussey was the common-law stepdaughter of Bulger partner Flemmi. Flemmi testified that Bulger strangled the 26-year-old woman, and another witness testified that he saw Bulger strangling her as her eyes rolled back into her head. Bulger's defense countered that Flemmi had molested Hussey when she was 17 (at act that Flemmi maintained happened twice and was consensual), and that Flemmi was responsible for Hussey's death. ""You murdered your stepdaughter,"" defense attorney Hank Brennan charged in his questioning of Flemmi. ""In the eyes of the law, yes,"" Flemmi responded, ""but physically no."" The seven deaths in which Bulger's alleged involvement was not proved, according to the jury: . --Michael Milano (1973): Milano was a member of a rival gang and, according to testimony, was killed when he was mistaken for the leader of that gang. --Al Plummer (1973): Plummer was a member of a rival gang. A man who was in the car with Plummer when he was shot to death testified ""A firing squad hit us,"" and that a hundred slugs plowed into the car, which ""imploded."" --William O'Brien (1973): O'Brien was killed in a drive-by shooting that left another man, Ralph DeMasi, with eight bullet wounds. DeMasi testified fresh out of jail after serving 21 years for conspiracy to rob an armored car. --James O'Toole (1973): O'Toole had been a member of a rival gang. Former hitman Martorano testified that he, Bulger and their associates shot O'Toole because he was ""mouthing off"" at a local bar about seeking revenge on Bulger's gang. --Al Notorangeli (1974): Notorangeli was the alleged leader of a rival gang. According to testimony, he was killed because his gang had been terrorizing bookies from other organized crime groups. --James Sousa (1974): He was killed because he had been involved in a botched gold exchange, and there was concern he would become a liability to the gang, according to testimony. --Francis ""Buddy"" Leonard (1975): Leonard's body was found riddled with 13 bullets, including two to the head. He was killed to cover up the murder of another gangster with whom Leonard had been friends, according to testimony. And there was ""no finding"" in the death of Debra Davis, who was the girlfriend of Bulger partner Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi. Flemmi had testified he lured Davis to a house where Bulger stranged her. The defense presented testimony from Martorano, who admitted he had ""accidentally strangled"" the 26-year-old woman.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro will host the next World Youth Day, Pope Benedict XVI announced Sunday to hundreds of thousands of young Roman Catholic pilgrims at the close of this year's event in Madrid. ""I am pleased now to announce that the next World Youth Day will be held in 2013, in Rio de Janeiro,"" the Pope told the faithful assembled to celebrate Mass at a military airbase on Madrid's western outskirts. The crowds of young people from around the globe erupted in cheers at the announcement. Rio will also host the Summer Olympics in 2016 and Brazil will host the World Cup in 2014. City officials who were in Madrid for Sunday's announcement said in a statement that they were eager to see the festivities come to their city. ""From an economic standpoint, it's amazing. ... The streets will be full, and the museums and sites,"" said Sergio Cabral, governor of Rio de Janeiro state. Eduardo Paes, Rio de Janeiro's mayor, said the city -- with the massive Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking it -- will be the ideal host for the event. ""Upon arriving in Madrid, I was very impressed with the size of this fantastic meeting. ... On every corner, demonstrations of fellowship, harmony, ideas for building a better world. And there's no better environment than Rio, the city known to be blessed by God, to receive this event,"" he said. ""Brazil is a country of continental dimensions, with a Catholic majority, and our city has unique scenery and welcoming people."" Benedict ended his four-day visit to Madrid on Sunday, with Spain's King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia escorting the Roman Catholic leader to the steps of his outbound jetliner. During the visit, thousands protested what they said was the high cost of organizing the event this year in Madrid during Spain's deep economic crisis, with nearly 21% unemployment and nearly 5 million people jobless. The World Youth Day organization said it was spending about $70 million on the event, which is celebrated on a global scale every few years and which this year included activities that cut traffic in central Madrid on Thursday and Friday, before moving to the airbase over the weekend. Most of the money came from Catholic pilgrims and sponsors, the organization said, insisting that it would not cost taxpayers anything. But critics said public funds would likely pay for the 10,000 police officers on duty, or the discounts on the Madrid metro for the visiting pilgrims at the same time that normal fares have gone up. Madrid will see economic benefits as a result of the large number of visitors and the attention from international news media, Spain's chief government spokesman, Jose Blanco, told a news conference Friday. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: Pope heads home after World Youth Day .

"(CNN) -- For better or for worse, at almost every major event in the history of modern Israel, Ariel Sharon, the man his countrymen turned to when they thought they had no other choice, was there. ""I can talk and look in the eyes of the citizens of Israel and convince them to make painful compromises,"" he declared in August 2001. ""I saw my friend being killed, I was myself badly injured in battles. I had to take decisions of life or death for others as well as myself and believe me I understand the importance of peace better than many of the politicians who talk about peace."" READ MORE: Ariel Sharon, giant of modern Israel, dies at 85 . Israelis called him the ""Bulldozer,"" a fearless leader to his supporters who got things done. ""He always worried about the destiny of the Jewish people and it was clear for the Jewish people to survive in this world you have to stand up and fight,"" said his senior adviser Raanan Gissin. To his opponents though, like Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi, he was merely a bulldozer in a china shop. ""Sharon was the most bloodiest of Israel's leaders. No scruples, no compunction -- killing people, men women children, destroying homes, destroying trees and crops, stealing land."" Born on a farm outside Tel Aviv on February 26, 1928, the son of Russian immigrants, Sharon took the lessons from working the land to the highest office in Israel. ""When my father saw that I was tired,"" Sharon recalled in 2001, ""he would stop for a minute and say 'Look how much we have done already.' So from time to time I try and think how much we have done already."" He served bravely during Israel's war of Independence and the dashing paratrooper quickly rose through the ranks, well liked by Israel's founding fathers. ""He was tall, he was handsome, he was blonde, and he was thin at the time,"" said historian Michael Oren ""and they looked at him: 'This is what we have produced in this land, this new Jew.'"" READ MORE: 5 things to know about Ariel Sharon . But controversy was never far away. In 1953, after a wave of terrorist attacks from Jordan, he established and commanded the infamous Unit 101, assigned to carry out reprisals. One of those missions was a raid on the border town of Kibya, in which 45 houses were blown up and 69 Arab villagers killed. Sharon said he thought the houses were empty. By June 1967, he was back at war, now a general, leading his tank battalion to a crushing victory over the Egyptians in the Sinai during the Six Day War. But what he considered his greatest military achievement came during the 1973 Yom Kippur War when a surprise attack by a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria prompted Sharon to defy his command by surrounding Egypt's Third Army and leading his troops over the Suez Canal. It was a turning point in the war. ""He was the kind of commander when the going was tough -- uncertainty and casualties -- soldiers always looked up to him to give guidance, to be like their guiding light in the dark,"" observed Gissin. ""He was against all those notions of command from the rear. He said the commander must be on top of it with his troops on the front line."" Retiring from the army, he turned to politics. As a member of the conservative Likud party, he served in several Israeli administrations. He was the father of the settlements -- Jewish communities built on occupied Palestinian land -- condemned internationally, and seen as an obstacle to peace by many within Israel. ""That is the land of Israel and we are going to stay there forever,"" Sharon declared defiantly. As defense minister he was the architect of Israel's disastrous 1982 war in Lebanon, ordering the invasion to stop the Palestine Liberation Organization from using Lebanon as a base for attacks on Israel. ""This was a misadventure, an ill-fated invasion,"" commented political analyst David Horovitz. ""Sharon was trying to play superpower here and re-arrange the region in a way that would help Israel."" And in 1983, an Israeli tribunal found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon. It was carried out by the Christian Phalangist militia group, Israel's allies, and Sharon was found to have done nothing to stop it. He was forced to resign and was banned from ever being defense minister, a punishment that rankled even with the thick-skinned Sharon. ""He felt betrayed, he felt betrayed by government,"" said Gissin. In the Arab world they called him the Butcher of Beirut. ""He was resented, hated, he had not only blood on his hands he had a trail of blood everywhere he went,"" said Ashrawi. ""Sharon was the most bloodiest of Israeli leaders."" The 1990s would see his political rehabilitation, eventually becoming leader of his party in 1999. In September of that year came his notorious visit to the Temple Mount -- the holiest site for Jews, also claimed by Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, the ""Noble Sanctuary."" Violence soon erupted; Palestinians claim it was the spark that brought about the Second Intifada or uprising. ""You don't bring thousands of border guards and police onto the Haram al-Sharif ground at a time when it is clear that the situation was simmering ... was a powder keg ready to erupt,"" said Ashrawi. But historian Michael Oren said there was more to the move than met the eye. ""Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount had been co-ordinated with the Palestinian Authority at the time. They knew about it, there was no surprise about it; they were simply waiting for him to go up to intiate their terrorist war."" In the violence that followed, Sharon was elected prime minister; and Israelis again turned to the Bulldozer, who promised to bring peace and security. Later he was asked how he managed such a remarkable comeback from the political grave. ""Maybe they try to bury me too early,"" he told CNN, laughing, ""and ah, maybe not deep enough -- what can I tell you?"" As a wave of suicide bombings rocked Israel, Sharon unleashed the Israeli military, sending tanks and troops into Palestinian towns, ordering assassinations of Palestinian militant leaders. ""And believe me, we show restraint. I am under heavy pressure to act differently."" Palestinians of course, had a different view. ""I think Sharon will be seen in history as the one who has perpetrated the must cruelty on the Palestinians,"" said Ashrawi. Sharon ordered the construction of the barrier through the West Bank and confined Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to his compound in Ramallah -- accusing him of encouraging attacks on Israel. In 2001, he told CNN, ""no doubt Arafat is a terrorist."" Previously he had said he always regretted not killing his old foe when he had the chance. But Horovitz said Sharon's decision was made out of fear of what might have happened. ""I think Sharon only refrained from killing Arafat reluctantly only because of a promise he made to the American government that he wouldn't kill him and because of an assessment by some in the Israeli intelligence community that more Jews would die if Arafat was killed."" As the violence continued, Israelis overwhelmingly re-elected him for a second term in January 2003. Not long after Sharon made an historic announcement: Israel would give up Jewish settlements in Gaza and part of the West Bank. Sharon sent in the police and army to drag settlers from their homes, a move that earned him plaudits overseas, but derision and death threats from the settlers who once saw him as their champion. A small group of political rebels stirred up trouble within Likud, and by the end of 2005, Sharon had had enough. He bolted from his party, and established a new centrist group, called Kadima, Hebrew for ""forward."" Early opinion polls showed Sharon on track for a third term in office, but the man who many had thought was unstoppable, unexpectedly suffered a mild stroke in December 18, 2005. Characteristically, he tried to brush over his illness. ""He felt he had to come as quickly as he could smiling on his own two feet,"" commented analyst Horovitz, ""otherwise he would be a political lame duck."" Two weeks later, he was back in the same intensive care unit at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, after suffering a second stroke -- but this time it was more serious. He underwent three emergency operations in 24 hours when doctors later tried to wake him from the medically induced coma. There were some signs of life -- slight movement of his hands and legs -- but little else. He has remained in a coma ever since. Questions were asked: did the prime minister receive the best medical treatment, why did he rush back to work after the first stroke? Eventually though, well-wishers and news crews left the hospital, the business of government resumed, and Israelis accepted that Sharon was not coming back.","Sharon was a force in Israel for decades .
Many Israelis saw him as a fearless leader .
Palestinians viewed him as ruthless ."
"(CNN) -- Is the Central African Republic the world's next Rwanda? That's the question some are beginning to ask about a crisis that has been going on for most of this year but has only just burst through into the mainstream international mass media. Warlords ruling the countryside by terror, a government that is almost toothless and the collapse of institutions have forced 0.4 million people to flee their homes and left a million dependent on aid. And now reports of Muslim and Christian communities engaged in inter-communal violence have sparked concern about a slide into religious conflict. The ""G-word"" -- genocide -- has even been floated as a real risk by some observers. In fact the country has not yet sunk that far. There is no sign of ideological motivation or the systematic political organization of mass killings. Read more: What's happening in the Central African Republic . Humanitarian agencies active on the ground believe the Central African Republic (CAR) can still be pulled back from the brink of utter disaster. But time is pressing and it is only now that the international community has fully appreciated the danger of the situation. The U.N. Security Council is next week expected to vote, authorizing the deployment of a reinforced peacekeeping force under the banner of the African Union or, potentially, the U.N. itself. Meanwhile, France, which already has 400 troops in the CAR, has announced the dispatch of a further 800-1000, to work alongside African peacekeepers. Read more: France to send 1,000 more troops to Central African Republic . Until recently the CAR had not been a priority focus of concern, even within Africa. By contrast, Mali shot right to the top of the agenda when its northern regions were taken over by jihadist armed groups in March-April last year. Yet even then, it took many months of diplomacy to secure U.N. Security Council endorsement of African and, ultimately, French military intervention to tackle the crisis. Read more: Fighting surges in northern Mali . The CAR is rather less well placed to grab global attention. As its name suggests, the country lies at the very heart of the African continent, away from major trade routes and population centers, and very far indeed from public attention. With only 4.5 million people but a territory the size of France it matters in strategic terms but has rarely hit the headlines, at least not since the dictator Jean-Bedel Bokassa proclaimed himself emperor back in the 1970s -- a story of almost picturesque caricature that distracted attention from the harsh underlying reality of poverty, isolation and incompetent government. Chronic instability . The country has slid into its present condition of almost complete state collapse, leaving free rein to looting and murderous rebel groups, partly because the outside world did not perceive its earlier condition of chronic instability and political weakness as a risk to Africa or even the region as a whole. For many years the CAR's persistent problems have been a sad humanitarian story, with a daunting incidence of diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and sleeping sickness, and depressingly high rates of child mortality and malnutrition. Even before the present crisis, life expectancy, at just 48 years, was the second lowest in the world. But in spite of these dismal health and development conditions, the CAR's problems impinged little on neighboring states -- other than occasional localized movements of refugees into remote fringe regions of Cameroon, Chad or Democratic Republic of Congo. Over recent years the then president, François Bozizé -- who himself originally came to power through rebellion in 2003, before repackaging himself through a democratic election -- found himself confronting a string of rebel uprisings. These were fueled by local grievances, the ambitions of disgruntled warlords and faction leaders and the heavy-handed tactics of Bozizé's presidential guard. Peace-keeping . Through a peace process hosted by Gabon and the presence of a small peacekeeping force, African neighbors attempted to contain these problems and nudge the CAR towards a consensual domestic settlement. In January this year a respected human rights lawyer, Nicolas Tiangaye, was appointed as a neutral prime minister. But some faction leaders stayed out of this peace process, combining their forces to launch a military campaign to depose Bozizé. As this rebel movement, Seleka, advanced south towards the capital, Bangui, government forces crumbled, while South African troops sent to help Bozizé suffered defeat with heavy casualties. The president fled and Seleka leader Michel Djotodia proclaimed himself head of state. But almost immediately he found his authority disintegrating. Read more: CAR president fled to Cameroon . The kernel of Seleka are native Central Africans, mostly from the country's northern Muslim minority. But many of the rebellion's fighters were foreigners, particularly from Darfur, in Sudan, and from Chad. They expected to be rewarded for their efforts -- but Djotodia had found no cash to pay them. Faction commanders turned on the civilian population instead, engaging in months of looting and brutal violence, and seizing local resources such as diamonds -- which are mined in several areas of the CAR. Their brutality towards the largely Christian population sparked the latter into forming self-defense groups -- who have taken revenge on local Muslim communities with whom they peacefully co-existed before. Meanwhile, the state has stood by powerless, lacking the military and political means to bring a halt to this deepening crisis -- or the practical resources to help civilians. It is this spiral of state collapse and spreading violence that the new reinforced African and French deployment hopes to halt. Read more: U.S. must act now . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Melly.","A coalition of rebel groups ousted the Central African Republic's president in March .

"Washington (CNN) -- They are the aviation equivalent of fender benders. But citing 12 incidents since 1993 in which large airplanes' wingtips collided with other planes or objects while taxiing -- including three recent accidents -- the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday it wants the federal government to require external cameras or other anti-collision aids on large aircraft if the pilot is incapable of seeing the wingtips. Collision warning systems are now common in cars, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said, and they should be common in large aircraft as well. 747 cargo plane clips commuter jet in Chicago . In the three recent incidents, all under investigation by the NTSB, the pilots of the large airplanes ""could not easily view the airplanes' wingtips from the cockpit,"" Hersman told the Federal Aviation Administration. Cameras or other anti-collision aids would assist pilots without requiring them to open the cockpit window and extending their head out of the window, ""which is often impractical,"" Hersman wrote. In a letter to FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta, the transportation board said an anti-collision aid, such as cameras that show a plane's wingtips, ""would give pilots of large airplanes a clear indication of the airplane's wingtips... thus providing information to the pilots to avoid a collision."" The NTSB said large airplanes such as the Boeing 747, 757, 767, and 777; the Airbus A380; and the McDonnell Douglas MD-10 and MD-11 would benefit from such a system. It recommended the systems be installed on new aircraft and on older planes that need them. The board also recommended the addition of cameras or other anti-collision aids on jetliners to the European Aviation Safety Agency, which sets standards for aircraft manufacturers in Europe. Feds investigate 3 planes flying too close at DC-area airport . Currently, the massive Airbus A380 aircraft has two exterior cameras which display the nose and main landing gear positions before and during taxiing, and an exterior ""landscape"" camera, which is primarily for providing exterior views for passengers. None of the cameras show the plane's wingtips. The three recent incidents cited by the NTSB are: . -- May 30, 2012: The right wingtip of an EVA Air Boeing 747-400 struck the rudder and vertical stabilizer of an American Eagle Embraer 135 while taxing at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. -- July 14, 2011: A Delta Air Lines Boeing 767 was taxing for departure when its left winglet struck the horizontal stabilizer of an Atlantic Southeast Airlines Bombardier CRJ900. -- April 11, 2011: During a taxi for departure, the left wingtip of an Air France A380 struck the horizontal stabilizer and rudder of a Comair Bombardier CRJ701.

"(CNN) -- An extensive internal review of the debacle at Penn State that left a child sex abuser in place on campus for years forever casts a shadow over a heroic figure at the school: Joe Paterno. The report, the result of months of investigation, finds Paterno and a few other top officials not only showed a ""callous and shocking disregard for child victims,"" but also helped ""empower"" assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky to attract victims, according to former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who spearheaded the review. Review at Penn State: 'Total disgard' for the victims . Allegations have swirled around Paterno, the legendary head football coach who led Penn State to national prominence, since the scandal broke last year. Still, the official independent review deals a heavy blow to those who love college football and idolize Paterno. Penn State trustee Kenneth Frazier, head of the committee addressing the Sandusky scandal, said it was clear that Paterno and other key university leaders exhibited ""inexcusable failures"" when it came to protecting children. But, Frazier said, figuring the coach's legacy will be a bit more complicated. Paterno defended Penn State in letter before his death . ""There is a lot about his life that's worth emulating,"" he said. ""You have to measure every human by the good they've done, the bad they've done. I don't think any of us wants to be measured by the worst things we've ever been done in our life."" Following the report's release Thursday, many people took to social media to condemn the aura of support that has long surrounded Paterno -- and the students who rioted in November after he was fired. "" 'JoePa' participated in a cover-up to protect a child rapist and allowed it to continue,"" Facebook user Ted Gannon wrote Thursday on Penn State's Facebook page. He added that ""there's a statue of him on campus. What on earth are people being taught at that university?"" But some people in State College -- a small town that revolves largely around the big university -- insisted Paterno, who died in January, has not been judged fairly. ""I think from the very beginning, Paterno was made a scapegoat,"" said local resident Kathy Gburuk. The football program itself, she added, ""really had nothing to do with this."" Reactions to review flood social media . Student John Zang said he believes ""there is some merit"" to the idea that Paterno has been scapegoated. But Zang praised the report, including what he described as its calls for changing the culture at Penn State. ""It's hard for a lot of people"" at Penn State to hear Paterno's name ""not used in the best of light,"" he added. Lee Rubin, who played for Penn State between 1991 and 1993, told CNN shortly after the report came out that what he heard of it had not changed his opinion of the legendary coach, though he had not yet read it. ""I think in fairness it needs to be read. It needs to be digested to be responded to,"" Rubin said. ""I think the accusations are very direct, they are very clear, and it would be unwise to try to defend any wrongdoing. I just think there needs to be an opportunity to respond to those accusations."" Weeks before his death, Paterno himself wrote an op-ed that was never published. In it, he generally defended his actions and the university. At a glance: Key players in Penn State report . ""Regardless of anyone's opinion of my actions or the actions of the handful of administration officials in this matter, the fact is nothing alleged is an indictment of football,"" he wrote. Freeh, in his report, notes that Paterno once told a reporter, ""I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was. So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."" But ""it is more reasonable to conclude"" that he and former President Graham Spanier, former Vice President Gary Schultz and former Athletic Director Tim Curley, in order to avoid bad publicity, ""repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's child abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large,"" Freeh wrote in a statement accompanying the 267-page review. Evidence shows that Paterno was made aware of a 1998 criminal investigation of Sandusky relating to suspected sexual misconduct with a young boy in a Penn State football locker room shower, the report says. But Paterno ""failed to take any action, even though Sandusky had been a key member of his coaching staff for almost 30 years, and had an office just steps away from Mr. Paterno's. January: Paterno remembered at public memorial . ""At the very least, Mr. Paterno could have alerted the entire football staff, in order to prevent Sandusky from bringing another child into the Lasch Building,"" where the incident took place. Paterno and the others also failed to alert the Board of Trustees, Freeh's statement says. ""None of them even spoke to Sandusky about his conduct. In short, nothing was done and Sandusky was allowed to continue with impunity."" Once, in February, 2001, the four men decided they would report the incident to the Department of Public Welfare; but Paterno then had a conversation with Curley, and the men agreed not to do so, Freeh wrote. After then-Penn State graduate assistant Mike McQueary reported to Paterno that he had seen what appeared to be a sexual attack involving Sandusky and a boy in a shower room in February 2001, Paterno responded to McQueary, ""You did what you had to do. It is my job now to figure out what we want to do,"" according to Freeh's report. ""To his credit, Mr. Paterno stated on November 9, 2011, 'With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.' "" Freeh wrote. Freeh also said the team that carried out the investigation believes Paterno would have spoken to them before he died, were it not for his declining health. The Paterno family released a statement saying it was reviewing the report. ""From the moment this crisis broke, Joe Paterno supported a comprehensive, fair investigation. He always believed, as we do, that the full truth should be uncovered."" Despite scandal, Penn State raises more than $200 million . The probe found that Paterno ""reported what he was told about the 2001 incident to Penn State authorities"" -- meaning Curley, Schultz, and Spanier -- ""and he believed it would be fully investigated,"" the family wrote. ""One great risk in this situation is a replaying of events from the last 15 years or so in a way that makes it look obvious what everyone must have known and should have done. The idea that any sane, responsible adult would knowingly cover up for a child predator is impossible to accept. The far more realistic conclusion is that many people didn't fully understand what was happening and underestimated or misinterpreted events. Sandusky was a great deceiver. He fooled everyone -- law enforcement, his family, coaches, players, neighbors, University officials, and everyone at Second Mile,"" the charity program for children that Sandusky ran. Sandusky was convicted in June of sexually abusing young boys over a 15-year period. He maintains his innocence. ""Joe Paterno wasn't perfect,"" the family statement said. ""He made mistakes and he regretted them."" But if he ""had understood what Sandusky was, a fear of bad publicity would not have factored into his actions."" The family statement acknowledged, ""It can be argued that Joe Paterno should have gone further,"" but it deflected blame from him, saying Paterno assumed others were ""doing their jobs."" LZ Granderson: Mourning Joe Paterno, a flawed hero . The College Football Hall of Fame, which inducted Paterno in 2007, says in his biography, ""No coach has been as synonymous with one school as has Penn State's Joe Paterno."" He was a five-time National Coach of the Year. ""More important than all of the wins and titles he has accumulated may be his legacy with the influence he has had on his players, Penn State Students and alumni. Paterno has generously contributed millions to the school and its academic programs. The National Football Foundation has honored him with the Distinguished American Award in 1992 and the Gold Medal Award in 2006."" The organization did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday from CNN. John Tecce, a Penn State student who has sat in the first row for every Penn State football game throughout his entire college career, cautioned against letting the scandal, and specifically the damage to Paterno's reputation, cast a pall over the entire university. ""I received my diploma in May, and it says 'The Pennsylvania State University,' not 'Joe Paterno University,' "" he said. ""The university is not defined by one name or the actions of a few."" Karen Peetz, chairwoman of the board of trustees, said the question of whether the university should honor Paterno ""is a very sensitive topic.""

"(CNN) -- There are several reasons why Yann Martel's Man Booker prize-winning novel ""Life of Pi"" was considered unfilmable when it was published in 2001. That most of the story takes place on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean surely didn't help. That the shipwrecked hero, a young Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Patel -- ""Pi"" for short -- didn't have another human soul to talk to for 200 days presented another significant challenge. But the most glaring problem facing any aspiring filmmaker would have to be Richard Parker, the full-grown 450-pound Bengal tiger who shares the lifeboat with Pi. Well, it's amazing what they can do with special effects these days: Richard Parker is such a fabulous and fully realized creation, perhaps nothing is unfilmable now? We don't usually think of ""Brokeback Mountain"" director Ang Lee as an effects filmmaker, but he gave us the romantic swordplay above swaying bamboo forests in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and, less happily, ""Hulk"" bouncing across the desert like a rubber ball. Here he's embraced 3-D, and it's a masterstroke. The slightly artificial quality that comes with this technology -- even wearing the spectacles puts a barrier between the movie and reality -- complements Pi's magical realist yarn, and Claudio Miranda's luminous, glossy, color-saturated cinematography gives the movie a picture book look. No surprise, really, that 3-D is ideally suited to lunging tigers and pitching sea. But it's more than that. In this story Pi must remain acutely aware of distance: the distance between him and the big cat, the restricted space of the lifeboat, and the overwhelming open horizons of the ocean all around him. Underneath, too. Some of the loveliest, most magical images plunge beneath the surface to reveal the myriad marine creatures separated from Pi by nothing more than an inch or two of wood. And, at night, the water reflecting the deep glimmering stars. This is stereoscopic CGI image-making as pure visual poetry, a demonstration of what the medium can do in the right hands that is worthy of comparison with ""Avatar"" and ""Hugo."" So how does Pi find himself in this unusual predicament? That's prosaic in comparison, and the first act is not quite as nimble as it might have been (there's a necessary framing device, but also a redundant romantic interlude concocted by screenwriter David Magee for reasons that have more to do with conventional Hollywood wisdom than the demands of this particular tale). It's only when Pi's world is turned upside down that the film really finds its sea legs. Interesting to note that the movie revises and pretty much demolishes the tiger-taming tips Martel came up with -- worth bearing in mind should you ever find yourself in close proximity to a man-eater for a prolonged period of time. The movie's Pi (Suraj Sharma) is considerably more circumspect than the novel's, and understandably so -- Richard Parker is more ferocious in the flesh than he was on the page. The tension is welcome and also a discreet approach to violence which should make the movie accessible to children. Even then, to his credit, Ang Lee is never tempted to domesticate this cat, except briefly, when both boy and beast are starving and at death's door. It's at this point that the movie conjures its most surreal and outlandish episode, an alluring strange interlude on a floating island that doesn't quite catch the horror in the novel's description. If this climax feels a shade hurried, the poignant coda is written and acted with immense delicacy by Irrfan Khan and Rafe Spall. This transcendent fable carries a real sting in its tail.

"(CNN) -- The reminders are everywhere: Wash your hands.  Use hand sanitizers.  Stay away from class if you're sick. Cornell student Vishnu Patel wears a ""Got Soap"" shirt as he spreads awareness about the flu. College students said they're reminded nearly daily about flu prevention by e-mail updates, posters and ubiquitous hand sanitizer dispensers around campus. Yet, despite the pervasive prevention messages, many students said they're not too worried. Those who have been sick said it was no different than the seasonal flu. ""Students are going about their business as normal,"" said Dr. James Turner, the executive director of the department of student health at the University of Virginia. ""They're asking, 'What's the big deal?' Some of them are aggravated. Those that are sick report feeling miserable. They recover uneventfully and go on. There's more anxiety among parents and staff trying to respond on campus to various needs."" Since August, 13,434 cases of the flu have been reported by the 253 schools contributing data to the American College Health Association. Of the cases, there have been 21 hospitalizations. This data do not include all U.S. universities. ""There's plenty of opportunity to spread infections,"" said Turner, who is also president of the association. He noted that students ""tend to socialize in large groups, frats, bars, sharing the drinking glasses, smoking material. They're in real close contact, densely packed into parties which are all breeding grounds for infections."" Two student deaths related to the flu have been reported this school year. Andrew Salter, a freshman at Troy University in Troy, Alabama, died on September 5. The student had the flu, possibly H1N1, before he was hospitalized for pneumonia, according to a university spokesman. Six days later, Cornell University student Warren J. Schor, 20, died of complications related to H1N1 flu, according to a statement released by the Ithaca, New York, university. Since school started in mid to late August, the Southeast had a high rate of H1N1 infection, but those rates are dwindling, while in other areas the rates are increasing, Turner said. ""We're seeing increasing rates in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic areas,"" he said. ""This has to do with when schools start classes... We're going to see regional outbreaks, timed around when classes are reconvening."" When David Accame returned for his sophomore year at the University of Maryland, College Park, he wasn't worried about H1N1. ""There's always the risk of sickness when you're around so many people in close quarters,"" said Accame, who lives in the dorms. ""I didn't think anything of it more than a regular cold."" Then in early September, Accame came down with a headache, stuffy nose, cough, sore throat and a 103-degree fever. After taking Tamiflu, Accame recovered in a few days. His illness sparked some anxiety among his roommates. ""Both my roommates sprayed down everything. They sprayed my bed with Lysol, all the silverware, desk, everywhere,"" he said. Other than the brief illness, Accame said ""this school year has been the same as the last."" Some have opted for a humorous approach, forming Facebook groups such as ""not living on campus and as a result, not having swine flu"" and ""We hate swine flu affected students."" Several students said they are aware of the risks and are taking precautionary measures. Blog: Back to school flus . Michelle Zeng, a Cornell senior, said, ""I definitely wash my hands more often and try to get more rest than usual to help my immunity more. I still go to class. My regular daily routine, I don't think it changed that much."" Angelica Geter, a graduate student at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, noted that people get tense when a classmate coughs nearby. ""Everyone says, 'Are you feeling OK? Have you been to the doctor?'"" Emory formed a voluntary isolation unit for students who become ill. Since the unit opened, 131 students have checked into the dorm, and as of last Friday, all had checked out, according to a university spokeswoman. Earlier this month, Dan Tapiero, an Emory sophomore, was kicked out by his three roommates when he got sick. ""They were polite about it,"" he said. He stayed at the isolation unit for four days doing homework, surfing the Web and catching up with classes. Having the H1N1 flu wasn't terrible despite the forced exile, he said. ""It's like the regular flu. You feel sick for one or two days,"" Tapiero said. ""I felt like the media was using scare tactics about the swine flu."" The difficulty for schools is letting students know about H1N1 risks without spreading panic, said James Tinney, director of media relations at Washington State University. ""I think students have gotten the message. A lot of the students interviewed by the media outlets, their message back has been 'This is over-hyped. It's not that big of a deal.'"" Earlier this month, the university had more than 2,600 possible flu cases surface. By Monday, WSU's flu blog reported that health services were in contact with 32 students with flu-like illness. Officials at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, canceled its first home football game because several players had flu-like symptoms. After that forfeit, the team played the next two games. But for most universities, events and classes have continued uneventfully. ""National, state and local health officials have told us there is no reason to cancel events at Cornell,"" Claudia Wheatley, director of the Cornell press relations office, wrote in an email. ""The vast majority of our students are very healthy and anxious to enjoy our traditional fall activities, like football games and so on."" For two weeks, the school's InterFraternity Council canceled large social events out of health concerns. ""Too often, as college students, we think we're invincible,"" said Cornell senior Eddie Rooker, president of the InterFraternity Council.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- More than half of children taking antiviral drug Tamiflu suffer side-effects such as nausea, insomnia and nightmares, UK researchers have said. Anti-viral drug Tamiflu caused nausea, insomnia and nightmares among some children studies show. Two studies from experts at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) showed a ""high proportion"" of British schoolchildren reporting problems after taking the anti-viral drug. Data was collected from children at three schools in London and one in south west England who were given Tamiflu earlier this year after classmates became infected. The studies by HPA experts were carried out in the early stages of the epidemic between April and May, when everyone sharing a classroom with a child who developed swine flu was given the drug, even if they showed no symptoms. Their research, published in the Eurosurveillance scientific journal, looked at side-effects reported by 11 and 12-year-old pupils in one school year in a secondary school in south west England. A total of 248 pupils took part in the study; their school was closed for 10 days after a pupil there contracted swine flu during a holiday in Mexico, researchers said. Seventy-seven percent of these children took the full course of Tamiflu, according to researchers. The report said: ""Fifty-one percent experienced symptoms such as feeling sick (31.2 percent), headaches (24.3 percent) and stomach ache (21.1 percent)."" One of the studies found that evidence of side-effects prompted UK ministers to change the policy so only confirmed or suspected cases were prescribed Tamiflu. The second study, also published by Eurosurveillance, looked at 103 children. The research found that 53 percent of children at three London schools had one or more side effects. The most common side effect was nausea, with 29 percent of the pupils complaining of this. Another 20 percent of those questioned by researchers complained of stomach pain or cramps, while 12 percent had problems sleeping, the study found. Almost one in five (18 percent) of the children reported a ""neuropsychiatric side effect,"" such as poor concentration, inability to think clearly, problems sleeping, feeling dazed or confused, bad dreams or nightmares and ""behaving strangely,"" researchers said. The UK's Department of Health said in a statement: ""The European Union regulatory position remains that no causal association between Tamiflu (or Relenza) and an increase in neuropsychiatric events has been established."" Reports from Japan, where Tamiflu has in the past been widely-used against seasonal flu, has linked the drug in rare instances with unusual neurological and psychiatric disturbances in children, according to media reports. Japan is now advising against prescribing Tamiflu to youngsters aged 10 to 19 after its own studies revealed people reporting psychiatric symptoms, according to media reports. A spokeswoman for pharmaceutical company Roche, which manufactures Tamiflu, told CNN: ""Abnormal behavior is recognized to occur in patients with influenza virus infection including those taking and not taking antiviral drugs. ""Following extensive investigations, no mechanism has been identified by which Tamiflu could contribute to such events. Following a review by an FDA advisory committee in the US, the labels for both Relenza (zanamivir) and Tamiflu have been updated to inform physicians that influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioural symptoms.""","Researchers say more than half of children who took Tamiflu suffered side-effects .

"(CNN) -- This may turn into much more than just a political scandal. It may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time, but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the middle of a serious legal stew. And the fire underneath it is just beginning to heat up for the Republican presidential hopeful, as the state assembly plans to post online 907 pages of documents related to the case Friday. State lawmakers questioned one of Christie's allies Thursday, a former state official implicated in the scandal. So far, David Wildstein has repeatedly refused to answer, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The legislators charged him with contempt for his lack of cooperation. But the dam could eventually break as lawmakers dig in their heels, analysts say. As long as Christie was telling the truth at a marathon news conference he held Thursday -- that is, if he really didn't know anything about any wrongdoing -- he should be able to step out of the caldron, analysts who spoke with CNN say. For nearly two hours, the high-profile governor, who gained national recognition for his response to Superstorm Sandy, answered questions from journalists, divulging many details. ""He was pretty specific about what he knew and when he knew it,"" said CNN analyst Gloria Borger on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" But if any of it doesn't jibe with other people's stories, information provided in documents or clues that pop up, experts say Christie could get dragged into civil and criminal lawsuits. One thing is certain. The legislative inquiry into the alleged misdeeds that led to the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge is just getting into gear. What happened to begin with? It was September, and Christie was full steam into his re-election bid -- which he won two months later. Wildstein, whom Christie appointed to a high position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. It held up motorists trying to make it into Manhattan and caused days of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, where Democratic Mayor Mark Sokolich had not endorsed Christie for re-election. Democrats speculated that the mayhem was political retaliation against Sokolich. Hearings ensued, and Wildstein resigned under pressure. Then came Wednesday's revelation that a top Christie aide, Bridget Anne Kelly had e-mailed Wildstein before the closures, telling him, ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied. He e-mailed a comment that the parents of children stuck in school buses in the traffic jams were Democratic voters. Christie fired Kelly after the scandal broke. Possible prank, sure, but something to sue over? This was no fun and games for people who sat tormented for hours in traffic and missed important appointments, legal analyst Alan Dershowitz told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. It did real damage. ""It was utter chaos those days. People were pouring into the store, complaining,"" Debbie Minuto recalled Thursday in her shop, Binghamton Bagel Cafe, in the town of Fort Lee. ""The bridge is a lifeline here. You take away the bridge, you take away our livelihood."" That makes it a legal matter, Dershowitz said. ""The law looks backwards and says: What causes these harms?"" he said. One group of residents from Bergen County, where Fort Lee is located, has already filed a class-action civil lawsuit against Christie. They want to be compensated for alleged wages lost when they arrived late at work. Was a crime committed? A woman died at the time of the mayhem, and emergency workers trying to get to her to save her complained that the traffic jams slowed them down. Sokolich thinks there should be a criminal investigation into the incident, saying it put ""folks in absolute danger."" His Democratic colleague, New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, agrees but takes it a step further. He called for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman's death. ""Endangering people's lives -- that's not politics. That's why the U.S. attorneys have to get involved,"" he said. U.S. Attorney's Office spokeswoman Rebekah Carmichael said it's ""reviewing"" whether federal laws were violated. But Florence Genova's family doesn't seem to want to press charges. She was 91 when she went into cardiac arrest, and her daughter Vilma Oleri told CNN affiliate WABC that she didn't think the traffic was to blame. ""I really don't think so, no, I really don't. I think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got (to her house),"" she said. But Genova was not alone. No other deaths were reported. But paramedics red-flagged ""unnecessary delays for emergency services"" to the mayor on the second day of the lane closures. The traffic increased their reaction time in at least four cases. Legal analyst Dershowitz thinks a crime may have indeed been committed and prosecutors could land convictions against Wildstein, Kelly and anyone else implicated, ""particularly if they can demonstrate if the woman died as a result of the traffic jam."" Christie says he didn't know anything about this. How could this get him? If Christie's close associates are prosecuted or convicted, it could lead them to turn on Christie, Dershowitz said. Thursday's news conference was the longest and most candid in Christie's career, Matt Katz, a New Jersey public radio reporter, told Jake Tapper. ""This is absolutely extraordinary,"" he said. Christie offered a lot of information to back up his claim that he knew nothing. At the same time, he may have given Wildstein and Kelly a lot to contradict, should they open up to lawmakers questioning them. ""They may very well want to save themselves and say, 'Wait a minute; don't believe what the governor said,' "" Dershowitz told Baldwin. Wildstein may have pleaded the Fifth initially, but that's normal in the beginning, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Defense lawyers often start by telling their clients to take the Fifth. ""You don't want your client testifying until he has seen all the documents available."" But things could change. If lawmakers decide to go after Christie, they could offer Wildstein -- or Kelly, if they question her -- immunity. They could decide to save themselves at his expense, Toobin said. Anyone Christie fired may also try to get revenge. And if Christie really didn't know about alleged misdeeds, he could still be in hot water, Dershowitz said. ""There's a concept in law called willful blindness,"" he said. It's enough to just suggest to people working for him to commit illegal actions on his behalf or to create an atmosphere that promotes such actions. Dershowitz said that it would be enough for the governor to say: ""Don't tell me; I don't want to know; just do what you have to do to take revenge. I don't want to know the details."" CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","New Jersey state assembly releasing 907 pages of lane closure scandal documents .

"(CNN) -- She's the antithesis of the typical fashion designer, preferring to step away from the adulation of shows and flashy parties, yet from behind the scenes, Miuccia Prada has a huge impact on the world of fashion. Preferring to stay behind the scenes, Miuccia Prada has built up a fashion empire. Miuccia Prada has taken a unique path to become the name and impetus behind a worldwide brand that has developed what fashion brands can achieve beyond the catwalk. Coming from a wealthy family that supplied luxury goods, she gained a degree in political science from the University of Milan before studying to be a mime artist for six years in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ""[It was] part of the culture of those times"" she told CNN. ""At that point I like the idea and also in those years you wanted to do anything that was strange or different or eccentric."" She fostered many left-wing political and feminist ideas before entering the fashion industry in the 1970s, which was then operating to a different set of values. Yet she disagrees that there are unmanageable contradictions between her personal values and her work. ""If you compare with philosophy, [fashion] is frivolous, but frivolity may be something good, something that is part of our lives, so I don't dislike it and what I like is the mix, that in your life you can have serious things, more frivolous ones,"" she told CNN. ""Beauty is not something that is contrary; it is the right of everybody. Still I retain the idea of justice and so many other ideas, but that is my work, and it is a contradiction that still is creating me problems, but it's like this."" While Prada has expanded its operations across the world and is focusing, like so many other premium companies, on China, it remains synonymous with wealth and luxury. Bringing the iconic black Prada nylon bag to the market in the early 1990s was just one way in which Miuccia and her husband Patrizio Bertelli transformed the slightly frumpy family business and helped shift perceptions of what a fashion house could or could not do. ""I always wanted to do something that was nearly impossible, but obviously it had to be something that made sense to people because if you think about now, the black nylon is everywhere,"" she told CNN. From 1980s chic and glamour, Miuccia has never been afraid to take risks with her collections or spark the imagination of the public -- her very first collection was likened to something from The Flintstones; her Fall 2009 collection featured fishing waders. ""I would say that my dreams are doing things that I like and I have fun with. My dreams are about how can I do interesting things and make having fun with things, or doing things that are clever or relevant or intelligent. So it's more about what I can do than about how big the company could become,"" she said.","Fashion designer Miuccia Prada prefers to stay out of fashion limelight .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- A senior official with Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard is calling for the prosecution of two key opposition leaders and a former president, accusing them of fanning the protests that have gripped the nation since its disputed presidential election two months ago. A top official in Iran wants to put former President Mohammad Khatami, left, and Mir Hossein Moussavi on trial. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi, along with former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, should be tried for attempting to lead a Western-backed ""velvet revolution"" that aimed to topple the regime, the official said. ""If Moussavi, Khatami ... and Karrubi are the main suspects believed to have been behind the velvet coup in Iran, which they are, we expect the judiciary to go after them, arrest them, put them on trial and punish them according to the law,"" said Brigadier General Yadollah Javani. Javani heads the Guard's political bureau. The Guard, which was initially created to protect the leaders of the revolution, is under the direct control of Iran's supreme leader and enforces the governments' Islamic codes and morality. His comments were reported Monday by the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. A day earlier, state-run Press TV reported that lawmakers were working on a complaint to present to the parliament's National Security Commission to bring Moussavi to trial for fomenting the post-election unrest. Until now, the government has gone after the protesters themselves in mass trials that have been denounced internationally. Among those appearing in court are two French and British embassy employees and a French citizen. Iran says many of the defendants have confessed to helping foreign countries -- specifically Britain and the United States -- ""instigate the unrest."" Moussavi and Khatami have contended the detainees were forced into confessions through torture. Human rights organizations have also decried the mass trial, calling it a farce and a way to intimidate Iranians who speak out against the government. Moussavi and Karrubi ran in the presidential election on June 12, in which hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest, calling the election results fraudulent, and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Iran said at least 30 people were killed in post-election violence. The two opposition leaders unsuccessfully challenged the results for weeks, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term last week.","Brigadier General Yadollah Javani is a senior official in the Revolutionary Guard .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- East African leaders on Friday gave South Sudan's warring factions four days to lay down their arms after nearly two weeks of widening violence. If they don't, the leaders of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) warned they'll ""take action"" to stop the conflict that the United Nations says has killed more than 1,000 and forced some 121,000 from their homes. The warning came the same day the United Nations said the first of 5,500 additional peacekeepers had arrived in the country. The leaders of the IGAD didn't specify what sort of action would be taken. But a communique issued Friday in Nairobi, Kenya, appears to throw the group's weight behind South Sudanese President Salva Kiir. In a joint statement by the leaders of the IGAD said they would not accept a violent overthrow of the country's democratically elected government, and said any change must come through the democratic process. Kiir has accused rival politician Riek Machar, his former vice president, of trying to stage a coup. Machar has denied involvement in a coup. Fighting broke out between Kiir's government and supporters of Machar on December 15 in the capital city of Juba. It quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings as evidenced by mass graves. Kiir and Machar are longtime rivals from two different tribal clans -- Kiir is from the Dinka tribe, Machar from the Neur. South Sudan's government said it has agreed ""in principle"" to a cease-fire demanded by the IGAD, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told CNN. Leith said Kiir's government is open to ""unconditional dialogue"" to end the violence. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development appointed envoys from Kenya and Ethiopia to help broker a deal. Machar hasn't responded to the proposal, leaving it unclear Friday what immediate impact the agreement would have on the fighting. The news of a possible deal comes as United Nations officials work feverishly to finalize details of sending peacekeeping reinforcements to South Sudan. The U.N. hopes to send them in no later than Saturday to help protect the 50,000 people now crowding U.N. bases, seeking shelter from the fighting. On Friday, 72 peacekeepers arrived in Juba, according to the United Nations. It was the first group of an additional 5,500 peacekeepers approved by U.N. Security Council. The additional personnel will increase the total peacekeeping force in South Sudan to 12,500 soldiers and 1,323 police officers. Meanwhile, U.N. officials and aid workers struggled to protect and provide food, shelter and medical care to those who have fled the fighting, which has spread to seven of South Sudan's 10 states, according to the United Nations. More than 63,000 people have crowded on to U.N. bases in South Sudan seeking shelter from the violence, requiring a massive influx of aid. U.N. workers on Friday were able to resupply a U.N.-operated hospital in Malakal, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Toby Lanzer said on Twitter. The U.N. Humanitarian Air Service also began flying in aid workers and supplies, he said. CNN's Azadeh Ansari, Nana Karikari-apau, Moni Basu, Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- For the second time in as many years -- after going 46 years with the same coach, Joe Paterno -- Penn State has named a new man to helm its storied football program. James Franklin, 41, was announced Saturday as the Nittany Lions' next football coach, replacing Bill O'Brien, who was hired in January 2012 and recently left to become head coach of the NFL's Houston Texans. ""I'm excited to come home,"" said Franklin, who had led Vanderbilt University's football team the last three years but originally hails from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. ""I'm a Pennsylvania boy with a Penn State heart."" A former assistant coach at the University of Maryland and Kansas State University, Franklin took over a Vanderbilt team that went 2-10 in 2010 and led them to a 24-15 record and three straight bowl appearances. Franklin joins a program that is still rocked, in many ways, by fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. In addition to leading to Sandusky's conviction on 45 counts involving 10 young victims, the ordeal led to cover-up allegations and criminal charges involving three former Penn State administrators, including one-time President Graham Spanier. And as the scandal was first unfolding, Paterno was ousted as the football team's coach. He died a short time later. The NCAA imposed harsh sanctions on Penn State in the wake of what happened, including scholarship reductions, a post-season ban, a $60-million fine and 13 years of vacated wins. The Nittany Lions' team nonetheless surprised many with its performance under O'Brien, finishing 8-4 in 2012 and 7-5 this season. But there remained a perception that Paterno supporters weren't fully supportive of the new coach, with reports that sentiment played some part in O'Brien's exit. Paterno's widow, Sue, released a statement Saturday welcoming Franklin -- who described the late coach as the ""great Joe Paterno"" during Saturday's press conference. ""His deep ties to Pennsylvania and his exceptional coaching record have prepared him well for his new position,"" Sue Paterno said. ""We wish Coach Franklin great success and we know he will find broad support and encouragement from Penn Staters everywhere."" The university's outgoing president, Rodney Erickson, said Franklin's hire followed what he called ""a careful and deliberate search process."" ""Our program requires a very special kind of leader,"" Erickson said of the dual commitment for excellence on the field, the classroom and in the community. ""...I believe we have found the right person."" CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","James Franklin is hired as Penn State's new football coach .

"(CNN) -- When kiteboarding was given the Olympic seal of approval earlier this year, the brightest stars in the sport were faced with some life-changing decisions. Would they continue as semi-professionals who sail for fun, or quit their day jobs and focus all their time and energy to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio -- with a good shot at winning gold? For the current world number one male and female kiteboard racers -- Johnny Heineken and Katja Roose -- the news that the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) had made their sport of choice an Olympic event was met with both celebration and contemplation. Roose, from the Netherlands, has been kiteboarding -- or kitesurfing as it's also known -- for over ten years. For her, the decision to try and go pro after the Olympic announcement was easy. She was part of the team that went to Spain to convince ISAF that kiteboarding was a worthy Olympic contender, and she has her heart set on making the Dutch national team in four years time. ""My first goal is to qualify, and then I want to go to the Olympics and win a medal. It would be the most beautiful thing,"" said the 31-year-old, who became the highest-ranking female kiteboard racer last year, according to the International Kiteboarding Association (IKA). Since completing university, Roose has been working a full time job for an internet provider in Amsterdam -- training in the evenings and during the weekends. She even started putting in overtime every week to save enough time off to travel to the best and biggest ranking kireboarding tournaments around the world. But juggling a career and a competitive sport at the toughest international level is not an easy task, which is why Roose has decided to quit her job this month. ""If you want to be able to continue to be number one and win the Olympics, you have to dedicate more time to the sport. I might keep working one day a week to keep developing my career -- but I know this is what I have to do to have a chance to go to Rio, and I don't want to miss that chance,"" she said. Watch: Fastest man on the water . Since ISAF announced that the sport would be featured in the 2016 Olympics, Roose has noticed a swell of interest from sponsors -- and quitting her job is all part of the plan to get a good sponsorship deal, enabling her to commit to the sport she loves. Men's world number one Johnny Heineken has also had sponsors knocking on his door. The 23-year-old American grew up sailing and windsurfing in San Francisco Bay, and although he is ""super excited"" about the prospect of competing in the Olympics and will ""definitely keep going"" to try and qualify for 2016, he is in no rush to resign from his day job just yet. Heineken works as a mechanical engineer for a company that specializes -- rather fittingly -- in kite-powered wind energy. It just so happens that his boss is also an avid kiteboarder, and allows him time off to go to races when needed. ""The boss is pretty stoked with what I am doing, so I am lucky in that respect,"" said Heineken. ""I think for now it's nice to be able to go home and not have to think of every race over and over again, to go to the office and keep a little bit of reality,"" he added. Both Roose and Heineken believe ISAF's decision will have a big impact on the future of kiteboarding. On the whole, Heineken thinks the changes to the sport will be positive -- but he is adamant that any significant alterations must ""be done right."" ""There is that saying: 'The quickest way of killing a class is to make it an Olympic class' -- and that's definitely not what we want,"" he said. The quest to make the Olympics Games more exhilarating to a younger audience -- while ensuring that new sports are not altered too much -- is a challenge. However, both Heineken and Roose believe kiteboarding has enough of a ""cool-factor"" to pull in the younger crowds without too much tinkering. ""Kiteboarding has always been cool and it's a fast growing sport,"" said Roose. ""Incorporating expression sports like snowboarding and kiteboarding definitely helps change the image of the Olympics,"" she said. Watch: Investing in a winning team . Indeed, the sport was developed in the 1990s and has rocketed in popularity over the last few years. IKA Executive Secretary Markus Schwendtner estimates there are more than 1.5 million participants globally -- with 100,000 new learners joining every year. According to the IKA, there are currently five categories of kiteboarding: Wave, freestyle, slalom, speed and course racing. Both Roose and Hainekken compete in ""course racing"", which was the category selected by ISAF as an Olympic sport. ""Course racing"" is very similar to sailing's ""fleet racing"" and during a regatta it is common to have 60 or more kiteboarders cluster around a course at dramatic speeds. The most important elements of course racing are the ability to generate and control the speed -- often exceeding 50 knots or more -- and tactical understanding, something which both the world number ones learned at a young age while sailing traditional boats. Watch: A modern race with a classic design . Roose spent ""every weekend sailing"" with her parents around the Netherlands, while Hainekken raced skiffs for most of his life until he decided to focus solely on kiteboarding during his time at university. ""What I love about kiteboarding is that it is super fun and I still play around a lot when I practice,"" said Hainekken, who admits he didn't find sailing much fun in the end. ""I think a lot of it has to do with eliminating tons of logistical aspects of sailing. I used to have to have my boat somewhere, have my crew there, have three other boats to train with and wherever your gear was based you had to travel to,"" he said. ""But now I can just get up in the morning, pick what beach I want to train on, put my gear in the back of the car, and after a few text messages you know you will have an amazing fleet of kiteboarders to go out there and sail with. Making it easy makes it fun,"" he added. For Roose, the thrill of kiteboarding is primal: ""Because you are using the wind and the water, every second and every day is different -- you have to adjust yourself to nature's elements. You can use these things to do anything you want -- jump high into the air, speed up or just cruise. For me kiteboarding is ultimate freedom.""","Kiteboarding was selected as an Olympic sport in May and will be part of the 2016 line up in Rio .

"(CNN) -- Esteemed psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross spent much of her career working with terminally ill patients and the anxiety many of them expressed in the face of their impending death. Her experience and interactions with hundreds of them formed the basis for ""On Death and Dying,"" a groundbreaking 1969 book. In it, she outlined the five stages she believed those nearing death endured—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and, lastly, acceptance—and suggested strategies for helping them and their families cope. Her work was monumental within the field in part because the emotional needs of those dealing with death had for so long been avoided. It would not be for much longer. Which is perhaps what makes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's hijacking of Kübler-Ross' grief cycle for his own gains so egregious. As he faced the press in an unending press conference held Thursday after a scandal that jammed traffic on the George Washington Bridge for four days blew up on his administration, Christie issued a series of halfhearted mea culpas. He asked not for the public's forgiveness but for pity. ""You can only imagine as I was standing there in my bedroom looking at my iPad how sad and betrayed I felt,"" he said. ""I'm heartbroken about it and I'm incredibly disappointed. I don't think I've gotten to the anger stage yet, but I'm sure I'll get there."" In his telling, he, too, after all, was a victim, just like the thousands of commuters—including schoolchildren--who endured hours trapped in their cars somewhere between New York and New Jersey. Just like 91-year-old Florence Genova, who died after paramedics who were stuck in traffic reached her. (Christie, while expressing regret, could not help but note, ""I've also heard conflicting reports about the cause of death."") In fact, at his new conference, he characterized himself as ""heartbroken,"" ""sad,"" ""humiliated,"" ""betrayed;"" referring again and again to the stages of grief he was struggling through. Oh, and did he mention he was ""very sad?"" ""On Death and Dying"" had a profound impact on psychology and society. It led to a greater emphasis on counseling and hospice care for dying patients and their families, and inspired Kübler-Ross to devote the remainder of her years in clinical practice to the dying, including AIDS patients and children in particular. In subsequent years, of course, Kubler-Ross' grief cycle has been applied to countless other traumatic situations, including losing a job, going bankrupt and ending a relationship, all of which can carry fair amounts of grief and require coping. But this may be the first time her work has been used as a political strategy. The situation that forced Christie to an accounting before the cameras was traumatic, but not for him. Despite his claims, he wasn't actually a victim. Nor was he convincingly contrite about either the cause or the effect of the actions that occurred at the behest of the staffers in his administration and on his watch, as he piled most of the blame on his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly (he described her as ""stupid""). Nowhere among Kübler-Ross' stages, it should be noted, is ""seek sympathy,"" ""blame others,"" or ""do whatever it takes to clear your name."" In fact, if the governor is looking for some more situation-appropriate stages to pass through, he might consider turning to his Catholic upbringing for a guide. Among the church's steps to a good confession: Be truly sorry. Examine your conscience. Express sorrow for the sin. Resolve not to commit it again. Lastly, ask for forgiveness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Elisabeth Kubler-Ross first named 5 grief stages to help with death, says Peggy Drexler .
She says Christie's casting himself as victim, invoking grief stages over scandal, is a first .

"(CNN) -- New photographs released by NASA have captured images of a vast stellar formation resembling a human hand reaching across space. NASA's Chandra Observatory captured this hand-shaped image of an X-ray nebula. The image, taken by NASA's space-based Chandra Observatory telescope, shows an X-ray nebula 150 light years across. It shows what appear to be ghostly blue fingers -- thumb and pinky clearly discernible from index, ring and middle digits -- reaching into a sparkling cloud of fiery red. NASA says the display is caused by a young and powerful pulsar, known by the rather prosaic name of PSR B1509-58. ""The pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is spewing energy out into the space around it to create complex and intriguing structures, including one that resembles a large cosmic hand,"" NASA says. The space agency says B1509 -- created by a collapsed star -- is one of the most powerful electromagnetic generators in the Galaxy. The nebula is formed by a torrent of electrons and ions emitted by the 1,700-year-old phenomenon. The finger-like structures are apparently caused by ""energizing knots of material in a neighboring gas cloud,"" NASA says. NASA scientist Patrick Slane told CNN that he and his fellow astronomers were more interested in the make up of nebula rather than its hand-like appearance.  Watch Slane explain the discovery » . ""To tell you the truth, when I first saw the image, it wasn't a hand structure that jumped out at me at all, it was other more complex structures,"" he told CNN.

"Rome (CNN) -- The new pope gave an insight into his choice of the name Francis in an audience with journalists Saturday -- and said how he wished for a church that was both poor and ""for the poor."" His words came in his first meeting with the media since he became the only Jesuit and first Latin American to be chosen as leader of the Roman Catholic Church three days ago. Francis, who before he became pope was known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, said a fellow cardinal from Brazil had told him ""don't forget the poor"" as the votes stacked up in his favor. This thought stuck in his mind, Francis said, as it became clear that he had won the two-thirds majority that meant he was the new pontiff. ""Right away, with regard to the poor, I thought of St. Francis of Assisi, then I thought of war,"" he told the assembled journalists. ""Francis loved peace and that is how the name came to me."" He had also thought of St. Francis of Assisi's concern for the natural environment, he said, and how he was a ""poor man, a simple man, as we would like a poor church, for the poor."" St. Francis of Assisi, who gave up his own wealth and prestige, is revered among Catholics for his work with the poor. The journalists included Vatican communications staff and several Latin American reporters, mostly from Argentina. Francis began by thanking them all for their efforts to share with the world the momentous events for the church in the days since Benedict announced his unexpected resignation. Pope Francis a pontiff of firsts . Blessing for all . He drew a parallel between the work of the media and that of the church, saying both worked to communicate ""truth, beauty and goodness."" The media also had an important role to play in explaining the way the church works, he said, which is made more complicated by the role played by faith rather than more worldly or political concerns. The new pope concluded the audience -- which did not include questions -- with a blessing for all the journalists present and their families. He acknowledged that not all those present were Catholic, saying he gave them his blessing ""knowing that you are of different religions, because all of you are children of God."" 5 things to know about the new pope . As a cardinal in Buenos Aires, Francis developed close relations with Argentina's Jewish community. He wrote to the chief rabbi in Rome this week, saying he strongly hoped to ""contribute to the progress of the relations that have existed between Jews and Catholics"" since the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, which redrew the church's relations with the modern world, ""in a spirit of renewed collaboration."" On Sunday, Francis will celebrate Mass in Vatican City and for the first time deliver the Angelus, or noon blessing, from his papal apartment window to the crowds gathered below in St. Peter's Square. The official Mass to inaugurate Francis as the bishop of Rome -- and leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics -- takes place Tuesday. Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward . Reforms to come? Francis has already struck observers with his simple and humble style since being elected to the papacy -- and prompted speculation that he may bring in wider changes. The Vatican said Saturday that he's decided that the heads of the various Vatican offices will keep their jobs for now, but he's not making any definitive appointments. This, writes CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, who's also a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, is the first clear signal that he may be serious about reform. ""It's customary for new popes to swiftly reconfirm the department heads who lose their positions when the previous pontificate ends, and then take his time about bringing in his team,"" said Allen. ""The fact that Francis has not followed that path may suggest that significant personnel moves will come sooner rather than later."" Francis wants ""a certain period for reflection, prayer and dialogue before [making] any definitive nomination or confirmation,"" the Vatican statement said. Military dictatorship . The pope's media audience came only a day after the Vatican sought to damp down reports over his conduct during Argentina's so-called Dirty War, amid accusations that he could have done more to protect two Jesuit priests who were kidnapped. The Vatican rejected the allegations as defamatory and untrue in a news conference Friday. ""This was never a concrete or credible accusation in his regard. He was questioned by an Argentinian court as someone aware of the situation but never as a defendant. He has, in documented form, denied any accusations,"" said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. ""Instead, there have been many declarations demonstrating how much Bergoglio did to protect many persons at the time of the military dictatorship,"" he said. Francis will meet with his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, in a week, the Vatican said Saturday. The March 23 meeting will take place at the papal summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, where Benedict has been staying since his historic resignation. It comes amid concern in some quarters that the presence of a living former pope might lead to a conflict of interests or influence. The Vatican has said that Benedict will not seek to interfere in the running of the church, but will focus on study and prayer. First Latin American pope 'very exciting,' faithful say . CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.","NEW: Pope Francis will deliver his first Angelus blessing on Sunday .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The U.S. military has handed over five condemned members of Saddam Hussein's regime, including two of the former dictator's half-brothers, to Iraqi authorities, a Justice Ministry spokesman said Friday. All five members were tried and sentenced to death and are expected to be executed within a month, said the spokesman, Haider al-Saadi. The United States handed over Watban Ibrahim Hassan and Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Hussein's half-brothers, as well as former Defense Minister Sultan Hashem Ahmad and former Gens.

Saddam Hussein spent three years jailed at Camp Cropper before his execution in December 2006. The transfer of the detainees represents the final steps of the U.S. military relinquishing control of Camp Cropper, part of the drawdown in Iraq.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Preliminary charges against Spain's Princess Cristina in a financial corruption case will be dropped, an appeals court ruled Tuesday. In a 2-1 decision, an appeals court in the Balearic Islands agreed with prosecutors and the princess' defense team, which argued there was insufficient evidence to bring the unprecedented preliminary charges against the princess, according to a copy of the court order viewed by CNN. Princess Cristina is the youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos. The preliminary charges were brought last month by a magistrate investigating the case in which the princess' husband, Inaki Urgandarin, already faces preliminary charges. There was no immediate reaction from the palace on the development. Judge Jose Castro issued the order that brought the preliminary charges against Princess Cristina April 3. The same judge had decided in 2012 there was insufficient evidence to name the princess as a suspect, but said in his decision last month that further investigation changed his mind and that Princess Cristina should be questioned regarding ""the handling and destination of funds obtained"" through her husband's foundation and a separate company. Urgandarin has faced preliminary charges for more than a year. He is accused of diverting, for private use, public funds earmarked for his non-profit foundation. He denies any wrongdoing. The scandal already had created unprecedented problems for the popular royal family due to Urdangarin's alleged involvement, but when the princess was also named as a suspect, it became top news at home and abroad. It was the first time since democracy was restored in Spain in 1975 that a member of King Juan Carlos' immediate family faced preliminary charges of any kind, in any case, a spokesman for the Royal Household said. The government's monthly CIS poll for April showed the Royal Household has an approval rating of just 3.68 on a scale of 10, below the military, police forces and news media, but higher than the government, unions and a business owners association. In October 2011, it had a rating of 4.89, and in previous years it was among the most highly rated of Spanish institutions. In April, the Royal Household made public for the first time that it had quietly asked the government in February to include the monarchy in a new law on transparency -- regarding financing and other activities -- that is currently being debated and pending approval, a Royal Household senior spokesman said.","The charges stemmed from a corruption case involving the princess' husband .

"(CNN) -- Sandra Manzke paused a moment as an ATV whizzed by her small farm in Wardsboro, Vermont. With no hot water or electricity, Manzke took stock of her situation Wednesday, three days after the remnants of Hurricane Irene left the town largely marooned. She had a generator. Her two horses were alive. Eight inches of water in the basement was mostly gone. ""I am lucky,"" she told CNN by phone. ""There are people with houses in the water. They've lost everything."" Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. Roughly 1 million customers remain without electricity from North Carolina to Maine, the U.S. Department of Energy said. Vermont transportation officials made emergency road repairs to more than a dozen previously isolated towns, officials said. Officials opened a makeshift road to Wardsboro, the last of them, late Wednesday.  Many people in the community of about 900 could not leave their property because of road damage, Manzke said. Vermont National Guard helicopters were flying water, food, diapers, baby formula, blankets and cots to other towns where residents can't safely get in or out. About 12,000 customers remained without power Wednesday after the catastrophic flooding. Grocery stores and residents gave away food when their freezers no longer had electricity. Helicopters made drops Tuesday and Wednesday, said the Rev. Howard Gunter, pastor of Pittsfield Federated Church in central Vermont. ""People are remaining calm,"" Gunter said. ""We're encouraged to take of yourself and take care of your neighbor."" The town near the ski area of Killington may be without power for several weeks. That means no Internet service. ""I am fine,"" the pastor said of the inconveniences. ""My wife and I were missionaries in a number of Third World countries."" At one point, more than 250 roads were closed in Vermont. ""Everyone wants the roads rebuilt,"" said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. ""It gets you to a grocery store in another town."" But it will take weeks -- months in some places -- for roads to be fully repaired. Officials are telling residents to stay off the temporary roads as much as possible. ""All of these roads are extremely rough and intended for emergency vehicles and National Guard delivery vehicles only,"" the state said. ""Please stay off the roads unless you have an emergency. This will help speed up permanent repairs."" Replacing washed-out bridges will take more time. Nora Wilson, town clerk in Marlboro, said some motorists are inhibiting repairs by getting on roads targeted by repair crews. ""Essentially, we're still cut off,"" Wilson said. ""Some people are not back in their homes yet."" Officials and residents in the town of 1,700 have checked in on each other. Most had electricity as of Wednesday, according to Wilson. Accustomed to snow storms and bad weather, many Marlboro residents previously stocked up on food and other supplies. Pittsfield, population 427, reacted in its own special way to severe flooding. Residents had a town barbecue Tuesday. ""No one in this town was expecting the flooding to be what it was, and we've all gotta eat,"" said Jason Evans, the owner of the skiing enclave's popular Clear River Tavern. Todd Trzaskos of Gaysville, east of Pittsfield, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night that people meet at the end of a bridge to get updates on conditions. Farmers with front-loaders are clearing roads and neighbors are checking in on each other and helping others leave unsafe houses, he said. In Wilmington, near the Green Mountain National Forest in southwest Vermont, consignment shop co-owners Suzette Kingman and Kathy Costello were able to salvage some items -- and a mannequin. ""Gucci pants that were like butter,"" Costello said. ""Now they are like mud."" Not insured, the operators of the Fashion Plate say their landlord will repair the building. Manzke said the flooding has done severe damage to aging road infrastructure and culverts in and around Wardsboro. Proper long-term repairs are needed, she said. The part-time Florida resident also is concerned about Vermonters being able to get to work, or having enough options available, when the leaf-peepers and skiers arrive later this year. Still, Vermonters have come together this week. ""These are really small towns,"" Bosma said. ""Everybody knows everybody."" The Rev. Pete Carlson, who oversees three congregations in Wardsboro, said he saw a house perched over a river, ""just hanging on."" He saw several tree company and utility trucks in the area Wednesday night. ""I am amazed at the amount of work that's been done in three days,"" Carlson said. ""These guys are working night and day."" The town, which has a lumber mill, is made up of hard-working people, he said. The churches have no committees, ""but everything gets done."" ""There is a remarkable group of folks over there,"" said the Connecticut native. CNN's Ashley Fantz and Amber Lyon contributed to this report.","NEW: Crews reach final stranded town .

"(CNN) -- China, the United States and three Middle Eastern nations carried out the most executions last year, rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday, but a global trend toward ending the death penalty persisted. There were at least 682 confirmed executions worldwide last year, two more than in 2011, according to the group. China is believed to have executed several thousand people last year, Amnesty said, but government secrecy makes it impossible to confirm exact numbers. ""The lack of reliable data does not allow Amnesty International to publish credible figures for the use of the death penalty in the country,"" the rights group said. ""However, available information strongly indicates that China carries out more executions than the rest of the world put together."" Iran carried out at least 314 executions last year, Iraq at least 129 and Saudi Arabia at least 79. In the United States, 43 people were executed across nine states. Sixth on the list was Yemen, with at least 28 executions. ""Methods of executions included beheading, hanging, firing squad and lethal injection,"" Amnesty International said. ""In Saudi Arabia, the body of one man executed through beheading was displayed in a public 'crucifixion' display."" According to the 60-page report, ""Death Sentences and Executions in 2012,"" there were at least 1,722 newly-imposed death sentences in 58 countries last year, compared with 1,923 in 63 countries in 2011. This meant that at least 23,386 people were under sentence of death worldwide at the end of 2012, it said. 'Cruel and inhumane punishment' In Africa, two countries -- Benin and Ghana -- are on their way to abolishing the death penalty. In nearby Sierra Leone, there are no prisoners on death row. However, a surge in executions in Gambia, which had not carried out the death penalty in almost three decades but executed nine people in August, and 19 executions in Sudan pushed figures for the continent up, the rights group said. Three countries in the Asia-Pacific region -- Japan, Pakistan and India -- also resumed executions after a hiatus, Amnesty International said. The number of executions in the Middle East last year, almost all of them in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, was ""a cause of great concern,"" it said. The tally almost doubled in Iraq from the previous year, when 68 people were put to death. The conflict in Syria made it impossible for researchers to establish whether capital punishment was carried out, it added. Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty said the ""regression"" seen in some countries last year was disappointing -- but that it did not change the overall trend. ""In many parts of the world, executions are becoming a thing of the past. Only one in 10 countries in the world carries out executions,"" he said. ""Their leaders should ask themselves why they are still applying a cruel and inhumane punishment that the rest of the world is leaving behind."" There is no evidence that the death penalty works as a special deterrent against crime, Shetty said. ""The real reason for the death penalty's use can often be found elsewhere. In 2012, we were once again very concerned to see countries executing for what appeared to be political purposes -- either as a populist measure, or as an outright tool of repression."" Texas leads executions . In the United States, the number of executions and death sentences remained steady compared with 2011, but the number of states carrying out capital punishment continues to drop, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Forty-three men were put to death in 2012, matching 2011's total, it said. Eighty people were sentenced to death, the second lowest total since executions resumed in 1976. Only nine of the 50 states carried out lethal injections of convicted capital murderers, led by Texas with 15 executions, more than a third of the nationwide total for 2012. Connecticut became the 17th state to abolish the death penalty in April last year. California narrowly approved keeping capital punishment in a November referendum. The state has by far the nation's largest death row population at 727 inmates, but has not carried out an execution since 2005, over continuing legal challenges to the lethal injection procedures.

"(CNN)  -- Dr. George Tiller knew that violence could come at any moment. For a reminder, he needed to think only of the old gunshot wounds in his arms from 1993 or the bombing of his clinic years earlier. Dr. George Tiller was one of the few U.S. physicians who performed late-term abortions. Still, Tiller, who was fatally shot at his Kansas church Sunday, continued to provide the late-term abortions that often brought protesters to his Women's Health Care Services clinic in Wichita. Tiller, one of the few physicians who was still offering such abortions in the United States, ""made an effort to live his life as normally as possible, knowing he could be a target at any time,"" said Peter Brownlie, president of the regional Planned Parenthood office in Kansas City, Missouri. Normal came with an asterisk. The 67-year-old had armed security at his clinic and a ""pretty rigorous"" security procedure at home, Brownlie said. Scott Roeder from the Kansas City, Kansas, area is being held without bail in the shooting, according to the sheriff's office Web site. A motive wasn't immediately known. But if someone targeted Tiller for his work, it wouldn't be the first time. ""What a gentle soul,"" said Suzanne Poppema, chairwoman of the board for the Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, national network of abortion-rights physicians who are committed to providing the best possible care for patients. Tiller also served on the board for the group.""He was a rational intelligent human being."" Poppema called his death""the ultimate backwardness."" She said the threat of attack was often a concern for Tiller and is a worry for many doctors and medical students who choose to perform abortions. ""It wears on your psychology, because you always have to be looking over your shoulder, thinking, 'Is today OK or not OK?' "" Poppema said. ""Because you are doing work that is medically correct and yet having to operate as if you live in a war zone."" Poppema said the attacks, even after Tiller was shot through both arms in 1993, didn't deter him from practicing. An ardent foe of abortion, Shelley Shannon, was convicted of attempted murder and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for the shooting.  See all abortion-related attacks since 1993 » . Tiller's clinic was damaged by a bombing in the mid-1980s, and it has been picketed for years, with some activists distributing leaflets around his neighborhood, Brownlie said.  Watch background on George Tiller » . ""He endured that kind of stuff on a very frequent basis,"" Brownlie said. ""As recently as early this month, the clinic sustained serious vandalism that put them out of commission for a week or so."" Tiller, a former Navy flight surgeon, took over his father's Wichita medical practice where abortions were performed during a time when the procedure was illegal. Tiller's practices had an effect on proposed abortion legislation. This year, before she was sworn in as U.S. secretary of health and human services, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius vetoed a bill that would have required doctors to give more details when justifying late-term abortions to the state health department, the Wichita Eagle reported. Tiller also made a mark on Sebelius' confirmation process for the health and human services post. Sebelius came under fire in part because Tiller and his staff attended a 2007 reception that Sebelius held at the governor's mansion and because she originally failed to account for donations she received from him. Tiller, a University of Kansas medical school graduate, had been practicing medicine for about 40 years, starting as an intern at a U.S. naval hospital and later becoming a Navy flight surgeon in California, according to his clinic's Web site. He started providing abortion services in 1973 and became the clinic's director two years later, according to the Web site. The clinic also provided grief counseling and funerals. His patients were ""almost always in circumstances where something had gone horribly wrong with a pregnancy"" and where a woman's health would be endangered if the pregnancy continued, Brownlie said. His willingness to perform late-term abortions as more and more doctors abandoned them made Tiller a lightning rod for anti-abortion rights activists and legislators. Kansas law generally allows abortions even into the third trimester so long as the physician determines that the fetus isn't viable. A doctor who makes such a determination after 21 weeks gestation must report the reasons why the determination was made. ""Third-trimester abortion is simply a part of abortion,"" Tiller told Wichita TV station KAKE in 1999. ""We have constructed our clinic and our philosophy along the lines that until you have natural survivalhood [of the fetus], the woman is the patient, not the fetus. ""When does natural survivalhood come on? ... Sometime after the end of the second trimester.""  Watch panel discuss implications of his slaying » . But even if a fetus is determined to be viable after 21 weeks, Kansas law still permits a doctor to perform an abortion if that physician and another determine that the procedure is necessary to preserve the life of the woman. Tiller was the only Kansas doctor still performing late-term abortions in Kansas, the Wichita Eagle reported. His Web site said his clinic had ""more experience in late abortion services over 24 weeks than anyone else currently practicing in the Western Hemisphere, Europe and Australia."" He faced repeated legal challenges. In March, he was acquitted on 19 misdemeanor counts relating to how he obtained second opinions for late-term abortions, according to the Wichita newspaper. In 2008, an inquiry initiated by abortion opponents who petitioned state authorities to convene a grand jury ended without charges. Tiller is survived by a wife, four children and 10 grandchildren. In a statement issued Sunday through Tiller's lawyers, his family said their loss ""is also a loss for the City of Wichita and women across America."" ""George dedicated his life to providing women with high-quality health care despite frequent threats and violence. We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere."" CNN's Matt Smith and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","George Tiller was one of few remaining doctors in U.S. offering late-term abortions .

"Madrid (CNN) -- An unprecedented court hearing for Spain's Princess Cristina in a financial corruption scandal, scheduled for April 27, was postponed Friday after a prosecutor filed an appeal, judicial officials said. No new date for the hearing was immediately set, because a three-judge panel must first resolve the conflict between the view of the judge who issued the subpoena that there is sufficient evidence to cite the princess as a suspect, and the prosecutor's view that there is not, the officials said. Princess Cristina is King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter. This is the first time since democracy was restored in Spain in 1975 that a member of King Juan Carlos' immediate family has faced preliminary charges of any kind, in any case, a spokesman for the Royal Household said. On Wednesday, the investigating magistrate, Judge Jose Castro, issued the 18-page order that brought preliminary charges against Princess Cristina in a fraud case centered on her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, the king's son-in-law. Urdangarin has faced preliminary charges for more than a year. He is accused of diverting, for private use, public funds earmarked for his non-profit foundation. He denies any wrongdoing. The scandal already had created unprecedented problems for the popular royal family due to Urdangarin's alleged involvement, but after the princess was also named as a suspect, it became top news at home and abroad. On Friday, prosecutor Pedro Horrach filed his appeal to Castro's local court in Palma de Mallorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands. A higher provincial court in Palma must decide if the princess will remain a suspect in the case. If she does, the princess has chosen two top lawyers, the Royal Household announced on Friday. One is Miquel Roca, a Barcelona-based former politician who helped write Spain's Constitution of 1978. The other is well-known criminal lawyer Jesus Maria Silva. The Royal Household initially said on Wednesday it wouldn't comment on judicial matters, but later in the day announced that it was surprised that the judge -- who last year said in an order that there was insufficient evidence to name the princess as a suspect -- had changed his mind. In his order, the judge said that further investigation since last year had led to the decision to bring preliminary charges against the princess. Castro's order said Princess Cristina should be questioned regarding ""the handling and destination of funds obtained"" through her husband's foundation and a separate company . The Royal Household also said on Wednesday that it was in ""absolute conformity"" with the prosecutor's announcement that he would appeal. The main opposition Socialist Party has called on the Royal Household to remain neutral in the legal battle between the judge and prosecutor over the evidence regarding the princess. On Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters that the case is hurting the image of Spain. On Friday, the Royal Household made public for the first time that it had quietly asked the government, two months ago, to include the monarchy in a new law on transparency -- regarding financing and other activities -- that is currently being debated and pending approval, a Royal Household senior spokesman said . Urdangarin was given the title of Duke of Palma when he married Princess Cristina in 1997. An adviser to the Royal Household also has been implicated in the scandal. Earlier this year, a judge ordered Urdangarin and a former business associate, Diego Torrres, to deposit a joint bond of â‚¬8 million (about $10.8 million) for potential civil damages. If not, the judge would move to embargo the assets of the two men, a court spokeswoman said. No trial has been set in the case. The preliminary charges that have been announced could eventually be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion.","Princess Cristina had been subpoenaed to appear in court April 27 .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Heavy fighting continued Monday in Benghazi between Libyan army forces and an Islamist militant group the United States blames for the attack last year on its diplomatic mission that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. LANA, Libya's state news agency, reported that at least six soldiers and one civilian were killed and 39 people were injured, most of them soldiers, in the clashes Sunday between the military and the group Ansar al-Sharia. On Monday, the Libyan government said that at least nine people were killed and 49 injured. A senior Libyan military official in the city, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said heavy fighting continued Monday morning as troops engaged members of the group in different parts of Benghazi. At midday, residents and state media reported a tense calm in the city. Schools in Benghazi were closed, and security forces, through alerts on state media, asked residents to remain indoors Monday morning as troops worked to secure the city. The fighting was not a planned operation but a ""reaction"" to an attack on the army by members of the group Sunday night, the official said. He said members of a military special forces group called Thunderbolt, with support from local residents, responded with raids on Ansar al-Sharia locations in Benghazi. The official said the fighting Monday morning was intense, with Ansar al-Sharia fighters using mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy weapons. He described the situation as very tense after reports that Ansar al-Sharia might be receiving reinforcements from the eastern city of Derna, where jihadist groups are active. Libyan state media reported that military forces were securing all main roads and entrances to the city. A Benghazi resident told CNN that heavy clashes broke out Sunday night, and gunfire and explosions intensified Monday morning across the city. ""This is really the heaviest fighting I have heard in Benghazi since the revolution"" he said ""Ansar al-Sharia versus the army, this has been a long time coming."" Militant group returns . After the assault on the U.S. Consulate last year, Benghazi residents attacked the headquarters of Islamist militias in the city, including Ansar al-Sharia's base. The group left the base but later returned. During a visit to Benghazi this year, a CNN team confirmed that Ansar al-Sharia was back at its base and the group had a checkpoint at a western entrance to the city. The government has been struggling to control the hundreds of militia groups that operate freely across the country, including some radical militant groups with ties to al Qaeda in eastern Libya. Libyan militias hand over Tripoli bases to government . Over the past year, there has been a significant deterioration in the security situation in Benghazi, which is Libya's second-largest city and the cradle of the 2011 revolution. After an uptick in violence in the city, most notably in an assassination campaign that has primarily targeted security force members, most of whom held positions under the former regime, the government announced a security plan to secure the city. This month, Benghazi residents reported an increased Libyan army presence, most notably the Thunderbolt forces working to secure the city. Bombings and shootings have targeted army checkpoints and patrols, and a senior military official escaped an assassination attempt when a bomb targeted his car in Benghazi this month. The violence is blamed on Islamist extremist groups in the city. Commander: U.S. to help train Libyan forces .

"(CNN) -- After an unbeaten career and a Vogue cover, Australia's most celebrated horse now has a bronze statue in her honor. The statue of Black Caviar, which retired with a perfect 25-0 career record, was unveiled in the animal's birthplace of Nagambie in the state of Victoria as it emerged the horse is set to deliver a living legacy of its own -- the super mare is in foal. A crowd bedecked in Black Caviar's signature salmon pink and black polka dot silks turned out to catch a glimpse of the life-size tribute, which is the work of sculptor Mitch Mitchell. And excitement among her throngs of fans grew as word spread that Australia's foremost equine superstar -- after two visits to stallion Exceed and Excel -- is expecting. ""We are all proud Australians we are all proud Victorian this is a great day for Australia,"" breeder Rick Jamieson told The Telegraph. ""As Nagambians we can say we bred the best horse in racing history."" The six-year-old sprinter, worth almost $8 million in prize money, bowed out after claiming her quarter century victory at Sydney's TJ Smith Stakes in April. Duing a record-breaking career, the ""Wonder from Down Under"" transcended the sports pages to become one of the country's most beloved sporting celebrities. The super mare wasn't just a powerhouse on the track -- she was a treasured personality who appeared on the cover of Vogue, launched a best-selling biography and was named Sportswoman of the Year by Sydney's Daily Telegraph. The retirement of the world's top-rated racehorse led news bulletins in Australia, with former Australian p . Prime Minister Gillard tweeting: ""We've never seen anything like Black Caviar before and may never again. She has an incredible legacy."" Since demolishing the field in her first major win at the Danehill Stakes in 2009, interest in Black Caviar has grown expotentially. The wonder mare, who even has her own Twitter handle, has not just won all 25 of her races -- with the exception of Britain's Royal Ascot she has won them by staggering margins -- destroying world-class fields to become one of the world's top-rated race horses. Her unblemished record is the second highest of all time, trailing behind only Hungarian horse Kincsem, which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s.","A bronze sculpture of Black Caviar has been unveiled in its hometown .

"(CNN)  -- Serena and Venus Williams may still be the players to beat on the women's circuit while Andy Roddick has enjoyed a recent renaissance on the men's tour but strip away this illustrious trio and there are real fears for the future of American tennis. Roddick remains the only U.S. male in the top 10 of the ATP Tour rankings, with John Isner and Sam Querrey solid performers in the 20s. On the WTA Tour, Serena and Venus are at No. 1 and No.4 but then there is a gap to promising teenager Melanie Oudin at 36, with three other women occupying spots in the lower reaches of the top 100. For a nation with the tennis pedigree of the United States, and with its three standard bearers in their late 20s, it is a worrying trend which Roddick says is a product of the talent pool in the United States being diluted. Are Federer's rivals pretenders to the throne? ""I think our best athletes probably get spread out across 10 or 12 different sports,"" he told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""Where in Serbia -- with the success of Novak (Djokovic) and the other girls on tour and guy players too. It's kind of become the sport there. ""Their best athletes -- have been funneled into tennis. In the States -- I feel like it's funneled into football, baseball, and basketball. There are so many different options that it might water down the talent pool for a given sport,"" he added. Nick Bollettieri, whose famous tennis academy has produced the likes of Andre Agassi and Maria Sharapova, agrees with Roddick. ""Look you have cheerleading, you have basketball, you have lacrosse, you have basketball, football, you have everything,"" he told CNN. ""You have marathons, running, we have a variety of things. I believe you have to go for one sport and dedicate your life to it and also have some talent."" Bollettieri also believes the worldwide growth of tennis with many more countries now producing top-ranked players is responsible for the relative decline in U.S. standards. ""Let's go back to the 80's and 90's. Basically there were six countries playing and we certainly we were right up on top and if you look at the world today you have China -- unbelievable ladies and India, you have Japan, the Czech Republic, you have Serbia, you have everybody playing,"" he said. Bollettieri also questions the failure of U.S. tennis to discover talent at grassroots level from working class backgrounds. ""How many of the kids playing today come from poor families? How many have come from the inner city where there is a possibility they can be somebody? It is very difficult today in America to get players to commit,"" he added. In response to the problem, the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) has charged Patrick McEnroe with developing its elite young players, combining this role with captaining their Davis Cup team. McEnroe, whose brother John topped the world rankings in the 1980s, agrees with Roddick about the attractions of other sports, but is not going to make it an excuse for failure. ""We've got to do a better job,"" he told CNN. ""We need to find those players and train them more systematically."" He says he has been given sufficient funding and resources by the USTA, but says no amount of money can develop a grand slam winner if the talent is not there. ""I'm not sure you could create a champion. I'm not sure that's possible, but I think you can create an environment where you will get a lot of really good players, hopefully if you do that, you will get the Serena Williams, the Andy Roddicks."" he added. Pete Sampras, the last American man to top the world rankings, has no doubt the USTA made the right choice in selecting McEnroe to his role two years ago. ""Patrick is a good friend, a great Davis Cup captain and a solid ambassador for the sport of tennis. I wish him nothing but the best and will help in any way I can,"" he told the USTA official Web site. Despite the support for McEnroe, the flow of young U.S. talent onto the professional circuit remains a trickle rather than the hoped for flood. Current hopes are the Harrisons, 17-year-old Ryan and his younger brother Christian, who are both at the Bollettieri Academy. Ryan became the third-youngest player to win an ATP Tour match at 15 and Bollettieri believes he has the talent to make it to the top from his current ranking in the mid 200s. ""He certainly has the ingredients and that is what this academy does. It provides the basis and then it is up to you and how you want to compete and if you can deal with competition,"" he added. Despite the talent of the likes of the Harrisons and more established young players such as Oudin and Isner, Bollettieri does not believe that future success is guaranteed. ""Pat has got a tough job, not impossible but he is the one who is going to have to go out, get all the good coaches, support them and get the good players with the good players and work with the colleges. ""But you are still going to have to seek out the hungry athletes,"" he added. In the meantime, Roddick, who scored a superb victory in the Miami Masters 100 tournament recently, is hoping that Isner and Querrey can step up to the plate to give him some support in the upper echelons of the world game. ""I've been real excited that Sam and John have been playing well. I'm certainly always welcome to have some home company in the top ten or so,"" he said.","U.S. suffering from a lack of depth below stars such Williams sisters and Andy Roddick .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge who presided over the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial last year has tentatively rejected the Jacksons' request for a new trial.. The six-month-long trial ended in October with a victory for AEG Live, the concert promoter Jackson's mother and children had claimed was liable for his death because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death. Lawyers for mother Katherine Jackson argued that the verdict form used by the jury was faulty and that the judge erred by refusing to let them pursue a negligence claim independent of the hiring case. Their motion for a new trial filed in December included sworn statements from four of the 12 jurors saying they feel cheated by the outcome, which they blame on a misleading verdict form. Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009, which Dr. Conrad Murray told police he used to treat the pop icon's insomnia as he prepared for a tour produced by AEG Live. Conrad Murray completes jail time for killing Michael Jackson . Los Angeles County Judge Yvette Palazuelos issued a tentative ruling saying that she did not err in her decisions on the verdict form or with the dismissal of the negligence claim. She head oral arguments on Friday and is expected to make a final decision soon. Jackson lawyers have indicated that they will appeal the jury's verdict. AEG Live lawyers filed statements from seven other jurors saying they were not confused by the verdict form. The jurors cited by the Jackson motion used the words ""stunned,"" ""upset"" and ""shocked"" when they were told they had to stop deliberations after a majority agreed that the answer was ""no"" to the second question on the verdict form: ""Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?"" One juror called the question ""a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues of the case."" ""After sitting through almost six months of the trial in this case, I believed that Mrs. Jackson had proven her case against AEG LIve,"" another juror said. ""Despite this fact, I had no way of voting in favor of the plaintiffs because of the way that the verdict form was worded.""

"(CNN) -- New photographs released by NASA have captured images of a vast stellar formation resembling a human hand reaching across space. NASA's Chandra Observatory captured this hand-shaped image of an X-ray nebula. The image, taken by NASA's space-based Chandra Observatory telescope, shows an X-ray nebula 150 light years across. It shows what appear to be ghostly blue fingers -- thumb and pinky clearly discernible from index, ring and middle digits -- reaching into a sparkling cloud of fiery red. NASA says the display is caused by a young and powerful pulsar, known by the rather prosaic name of PSR B1509-58. ""The pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is spewing energy out into the space around it to create complex and intriguing structures, including one that resembles a large cosmic hand,"" NASA says. The space agency says B1509 -- created by a collapsed star -- is one of the most powerful electromagnetic generators in the Galaxy. The nebula is formed by a torrent of electrons and ions emitted by the 1,700-year-old phenomenon. The finger-like structures are apparently caused by ""energizing knots of material in a neighboring gas cloud,"" NASA says. NASA scientist Patrick Slane told CNN that he and his fellow astronomers were more interested in the make up of nebula rather than its hand-like appearance.  Watch Slane explain the discovery » .

"(CNN)  -- The body of the managing director of one of the richest investment funds in the world was found Tuesday, four days after he disappeared after a plane crash in Morocco, the official Moroccan news agency reported. Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had been missing since his glider plane crashed into a lake in the north African country on Friday. The late sheikh was a brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Ahmed, 41, was director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. He was also chairman of the board of trustees of the Zayed Foundation for Charity and Humanitarian Works, according to WAM, the official news agency of the United Arab Emirates. The body was found by rescue teams at a dam in Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah lake, in Skhirat Temara, a suburb of the Moroccan capital Rabat. Some 225 people -- including over 100 divers from Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, France, Spain and the United States in addition to four emergency physicians -- were called in, the Moroccan Press Agency reported. The body was found by rescue teams in Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah lake, in Skhirat Temara, a suburb of the Moroccan capital Rabat. The remains are being transported back to the Emirates from Morocco and are expected to be buried Wednesday, Abu Dhabi TV reported. The ruling family will attend prayers in the Sheikh Zayed Mosque Wednesday afternoon as three days of state mourning begin, the station reported. Forbes' 2009 rankings of ""The World's Most Powerful People"" listed the late sheikh at No. 27. The pilot of the plane was rescued in good condition after the crash, WAM said. The sovereign-wealth fund, which was established in 1976, is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. In an interview in January with Germany's business daily newspaper Handelsblatt, Sheikh Ahmed said he preferred not to use the sovereign-wealth fund label to describe the investment fund. ""We prefer to be seen simply as a globally diversified investment institution, with the difference being that our owner is the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi,"" he said. ""ADIA's sole mission, which has not changed in over 30 years, is to secure and maintain the current and future welfare of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi."" Asked about news reports that ADIA's global assets range between $300 billion and $800 billion, Sheikh Ahmed hewed to the secretive style that has marked the fund. ""As a matter of policy ADIA does not disclose its assets under management,"" he said. But he noted that his brother, the president, who is also ADIA's chairman, ""has stated publicly that some of the highest estimates seen in the media have been exaggerated."" But the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute estimates that ADIA is among the richest investment vehicles of its kind in the world -- if not the richest.

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie built his keynote address to the Republican National Convention on the theme of telling tough truths to the nation. ""We have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved,"" announced Christie, showing off the gruff, no-nonsense style that catapulted him into the governor's mansion. It's only fair to mention some tough truths about his speech, his tenure as governor and the state of the Republican campaign for president. The most striking truth (as Democrats pointed out even before the address) is that New Jersey under Christie has suffered from a severely troubled economy and soaring costs of government: the very things that Republicans like Christie blame on Democrats. As of July, New Jersey's unemployment rate stands at 9.8%: higher than the national average, fourth worst among the 50 states and the highest level in 35 years. The rate is higher than on the day Christie took office in 2010 and nearly a full percentage point higher than earlier this year, when Christie's State of the State address exultantly and repeatedly claimed that a ""New Jersey Comeback"" was under way. And despite Christie's boasts about trimming the cost of government in the Garden State -- the keynote speech repeated his frequent claim of balancing three state budgets -- some fiscal watchdogs attribute the budgets to creative accounting, not true cost containment. ""A hard truth Christie absolutely will not tell is that every one of his budgets has been unbalanced by more than $2.5 billion,"" notes Bloomberg news blogger Josh Barro, citing Christie's bad habit -- started by previous governors -- of skimping on payments into the state's pension fund. This year, for example, Christie paid just over $1 billion into the fund, a record amount but far less than the $3.74 billion that actuaries said was needed, according to Barro. Those unpaid billions are, in effect, a loan that will have to be repaid by taxpayers someday. No wonder Christie omitted ""New Jersey Comeback"" from his keynote address. Put aside the ugly economics, and Christie's speech was unusually good. He read well from the teleprompter, even though he normally speaks without a prepared text. And he was persuasive, showing off the skills of his old job as a federal prosecutor. Most important, from a political perspective, Christie had a smooth launch onto the national stage, talking more about Chris Christie -- much more -- than about the man of the hour, candidate Mitt Romney. In the seven-page text of the address sent to reporters, Romney's name doesn't appear until near the bottom of page five. That's no surprise: Keynote addresses at the national conventions often serve as the launching pad for politicians preparing their own bids for president, and Christie has not shied away from talk that he might be a candidate in 2016 or later. But even the most successful convention-speech-as-launch-pad of recent times -- the keynote delivered at the 2004 Democratic convention by a then-little-known Illinois state senator named Barack Obama -- lavishly praised Sen. John Kerry, the party's nominee that year. Though Obama called Kerry's name 13 times in that speech, Christie mentioned Romney only seven times. Clearly, Christie's political star is rising. But he may also need to refine his ""tough truths"" mantra. The underlying message -- a promise to shrink government and reduce programs like Medicare -- is risky business in an election year. Voters, like supermarket shoppers, want as much as they can get for as little as they can get away with paying. Our nation's airwaves and billboards are chock full of companies advertising two-for-one sales and buy-one-get-one-free specials for a reason: it works. By contrast, you rarely see stores advertise the hard truth that the product isn't as good as they thought, the supplies are limited and the cost is going up. If the tough-talk message helps Romney win the White House in November, Christie is assured a bright future on the national stage. But if he hopes to repeat any version of Obama's astounding leap from keynote to candidate, he'll have to get New Jersey's fiscal house in order pronto. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Chris Christie built his keynote address to RNC on theme of telling tough truths to America .

"New York (CNN) -- Investigators know roughly where the flames erupted in the engine room of the Carnival Triumph, but it could be a year before they learn what caused the fire, which left the massive ship adrift for days in the Gulf of Mexico. ""We know that the fire originated in front of a generator,"" Patrick Cuty, a senior marine investigator for the U.S. Coast Guard, told CNN on Sunday. ""You can see the ignition marks on the wall."" There are three generators in the engine room where the fire broke out. Three other generators are in a second engine room that wasn't involved in the fire, Cuty said. The same ship encountered a problem in January with its propulsion system, according to a notice posted on the website of Carnival senior cruise director John Heald. ""We'll know by end of the next week whether the generator is the same one that was having an issue, an anomaly, in January, according to passengers we interviewed from previous cruises,"" Cuty said. It could take up to a year to determine the cause of the fire, however, because of the amount of work involved. It includes a painstaking analysis of the ship's records, automated data and wiring. The Triumph was on the third day of a planned four-day cruise from Galveston, Texas, to Mexico when the fire broke out and brought the trip to a halt. It was carrying more than 4,200 people, including 3,100 passengers. The loss of power not only crippled the ship but also created smelly conditions. Toilets stopped working, and waste spilled onto floors and into hallways. Passengers had to use plastic bags to collect their waste. Passenger Cassie Terry described the ship as ""a floating toilet, a floating Petri dish, a floating hell"" in a lawsuit filed Friday against Carnival for unspecified damages related to the cruise. Passengers reported long lines for food, shortages of fresh water and widespread boredom. Many passengers slept in hallways or outside to escape the odors and heat below decks. The Triumph was eventually towed into port in Mobile, Alabama, Thursday night, and the last passengers disembarked Friday. The ship is at a Mobile shipyard for repair and won't resume cruises until at least mid-April. Cuty's team remains on board the ship cataloging the location of everything in the engine room where the fire started. He said investigators are still working on lighting the room because the ship is operating on temporary power from a generator on the dock. It's likely that Carnival will make repairs on the ship in Mobile, where the investigation is taking place, Cuty said. However, a Carnival spokesman says no decision has been made on a schedule or location for repairs. On Saturday, Carnival crew members were bused to and from the ship to help with the clean up. One housekeeper told CNN it wasn't pleasant work but said it had to be done, and the crew was willing to do it. Passengers have praised the crew for its response during the ordeal. Sewage, gray water and all waste generated during a cruise are stored in tanks and removed at the end of each trip, according to Cuty. Because the Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency and will work with the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators pulled the voyage data recorder, a device that records alarms, voice communications on the bridge, engine speed, navigation information and rudder angle, Cuty said. It appears that the fire suppression worked as designed, Cuty said Friday. The engineer who was on watch around dawn February 10 saw the fire ignite over a video feed and immediately notified the bridge, Cuty said. Based on an inspection of the engine room Thursday, Cuty said the fire did not appear to have been large. As compensation, Carnival offered each passenger $500, a free flight home, a full refund for the trip and for most expenses incurred onboard, and credit for another cruise.","Investigators now know roughly where the fire started .
It could still be a year before they know the cause .

"(CNN) -- The Coast Guard is searching for a man knocked into the Mobile River after high winds hit the area Wednesday, blowing the man's security guard hut into the water and causing the Carnival Triumph cruise ship to break loose from its repair dock. The call to the Coast Guard came in at 1:45 p.m. CT as near hurricane-force winds smacked the Gulf Coast city of Mobile, Alabama. An official with the city's fire department said earlier that the missing man and another person were in a guard shack at the BAE Shipyard that was blown into the Mobile River. One man has been recovered from the water. On the agency's Twitter feed, the fire department said the Coast Guard, Mobile police and the sheriff department's flotilla are now in charge of a ""recovery operation."" Some of the flotilla's boats are equipped with sonar to find underwater objects. The Triumph, which was adrift for several hours, was secured at a dock at the Alabama Cruise Terminal on Wednesday night, officials said. Tugboats will remain next to ship as as precaution, Carnival said. Carnival spokeswoman Joyce Oliva said all of the company's crew members and contractors on the ship have been accounted for. Photo: Watching Triumph drift from shore . Wind gusts reached 66 mph Wednesday at nearby Brookley Field, according to the National Weather Service in Mobile, though a Carnival statement said the winds exceeded 70 mph. The Triumph has been at BAE Shipyard in the Port of Mobile since an engine fire in February left the cruise ship crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard. For four days, tugboats guided the disabled ship into the port as passengers complained about miserable conditions on board. On Wednesday, it drifted across the shipyard after breaking free. Tugboats kept it from drifting farther down river, the Coast Guard said. CNN affiliate WKRG reported the cruise ship had a hole on the right side of the stern; Carnival said an initial inspection found limited damage. Carnival said in late March the ship would be out of service until June 3. In addition to repairs, workers will increase the number of systems and services that the Triumph and other Carnival ships can run on backup power. Will Carnival keep its customers? Wednesday's incident was the latest in several headline-making issues for one of the world's leading cruise lines. Four of the company's 23 ships have had problems in recent months. The cruise line has offered affected passengers refunds and discounts on future cruises. It faces a class-action lawsuit related to the Triumph's last cruise, when passengers reported that food was scarce, cruise goers sweltered in the heat with no air conditioning, toilets overflowed and human waste ran down the walls in some parts of the ship. The problems have also prompted one U.S. lawmaker to propose a ""Cruise Ship Passenger Bill of Rights."" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said he was asking the cruise industry to voluntarily sign on to a list of guidelines, including the right to backup power if generators fail and the right to disembark a docked ship ""if basic provisions cannot adequately be provided on board."" He also called on the International Maritime Organization to investigate whether cruise lines are following existing guidelines, and whether existing standards are being enforced by countries where cruise ships that serve U.S. passengers are based. ""Cruise ships, in large part operating outside the bounds of United States enforcement, have become the Wild West of the travel industry, and it's time to rein them in before anyone else gets hurt,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""This bill of rights, based on work we've done with the airline industry, will ensure that passengers aren't forced to live in third world conditions or put their lives at risk when they go on vacation.""

"(EW.com) -- Panem may become the hottest new vacation spot. Lionsgate, the studio behind the ""Hunger Games"" movies, announced in a conference call with analysts Friday morning that the company had been approached about ""Hunger Games"" theme parks in two territories, and was considering the possibility, according to Variety. No further details were given. It obviously makes financial sense for the Katniss empire to expand; the first film made over $690 million, and people seem a little bit excited for ""Catching Fire,"" opening November 22. 'The Hunger Games': See full coverage . Ignoring the pesky fact that starving districts full of poor people looking toward revolution as a way to end their suffering isn't the most upbeat concept (and blatantly misses the point of the books), let's brainstorm some ideas about what Adventureland: Dystopia Edition would look like, should it happen. 1.) Layout. It seems that the ""Harry Potter way"" — with a couple different ""settings"" from the world all part of the park — might be a good model to follow. There could be a fictional forest to represent the outer districts, a fancier Capitol area, and then some kind of arena to signify the Games. 2.) Archery. The most obvious activity is also the most necessary. In whatever forest-type layout the park designs, there should be archery lessons and targets for every wannabee Katniss. This is an actual skill that many never have the opportunity to try, and as opposed to some of the more fantastical ideas in the novels (such as Jabberjays), archery is totally feasible; side-braids for all participants totally mandatory. 'Hunger Games: Catching Fire' clip shows Katniss tearful and scared . 3.) Capitol Glam. The disturbing world of excess at the Capitol is clearly more theme-park ready than District 12. In the Capitol section of the park, there should be makeovers aplenty, so everyone can get in touch with their inner Effie Trinket. If the designers can figure out a way to replicate the ""Girl on Fire"" dress for photos, all the better. For a more chilling take on the Capitol, have some kind of dark maze people must maneuver through while the voice of Philip Seymour Hoffman yells at you to come out. Haunted houses would have nothing on those kind of fears! 4.) Quarter Quell. While the first book's arena is fairly basic, the one for the Quarter Quell in ""Catching Fire"" provides more opportunities for some missing-the-point fun. Set up like a giant clock, perhaps this could be the ""game"" aspect of the park. In groups, you enter the arena and must be the last person standing. Every, say, 10 minutes some kind of bad thing happens — like rain or smoke machines — and you would lose a member of your team (to an exit sign. We're not monsters here!). Instruct people to dive to a bottom of a pool or strap on a harness and climb a tree for various points, and you've got a thrilling adventure that doesn't end with everyone's deaths. 5.) Food. Refreshments are another area where staying true to the source material might make tourists unhappy. Perhaps instead of starving residents, people could have a Tribute-worthy feast aboard a Victory Tour train that gives fans a scenic tour of the park. Capitol screens broadcasting mandatory viewing of kids killing kids clearly not included. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- A class action lawsuit has been filed against Carnival Corporation surrounding the events that crippled the cruise ship Triumph in the Gulf of Mexico. Filing on behalf of other passengers, Matt and Melissa Crusan of Oklahoma alleged in their lawsuit that ""Carnival knew or should have known that the vessel Triumph was likely to experience mechanical and/or engine issues because of prior similar issues,"" the court filing said. The lawsuit alleged that conditions on the ship ""created a severe risk of injury, illness and/or disease."" The case was filed this week in U.S. District Court in the southern district of Florida. Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said: ""We are unable to comment on pending litigation."" Coast Guard: Cruise ship fire started with leaking fuel-oil line . The Triumph experienced propulsion issues on prior voyages in mid-January, and on January 28, ""there was an incident which resulted in damage to the Triumph's ... propulsion system and generators,"" the suit said. ""Notwithstanding said issues, Carnival knowingly decided to embark on the subject voyage."" On February 7, the Triumph departed from Galveston, Texas, for planned four-day cruise to Mexico, but on the third day, a fire broke out, bringing the trip to a halt. The vessel was carrying more than 4,200 people, including 3,100 passengers, and conditions became unsanitary as human waste overflowed into public spaces on the ship. On Tuesday, the U.S. Coast Guard said the fire started with a leak in a fuel-oil return line running from one of the ship's engines. When the leaking oil hit a hot surface, the fire ignited. The Coast Guard is continuing its investigation into why the ship was disabled for so long. The fire started about dawn February 10. Tug boats pulled the disabled ship to safe harbor in Mobile, Alabama, late on February 14. The debarkation process lasted until February 15. Lawsuit filed over 'floating hell' cruise . ""From February 10, 2013, until February 15, 2013, Plaintiffs and all other similarly situated passengers were harmed and/or injured as a result of the engine room fire by way of being stranded at sea without necessary services and supplies,"" the lawsuit said. Passengers slept on deck or in other public areas and used buckets, bags, showers and sinks to relieve themselves of waste, the suit said. They were given ""spoiled and rotting food"" to eat, the lawsuit said. ""Due to the lack of working plumbing and sanitation systems on the vessel, sewage and/or putrid water filled with urine and feces leaked onto floors, walls, and ceilings. This sewage and/or human waste sloshed around the vessel as the vessel listed while drifting and/or while under tow,"" the suit said.

"(CNN) -- Tonight, as my husband stands in our bedroom, fingers whirling across his smartphone and eyes glued to its tiny screen, I have no idea ""where"" he is. Is he checking the score of his beloved home team, or dealing with a rant from an indefatigable boss overseas? Is he working or home-ing, or both? This melding of work and home, of course, is an old story. In 1999, I wrote an article about three generations of a Baltimore family and their work-life balance. Shattering my romantic views on what it was like to live a few easy steps from work -- literally over the store -- the family's elderly patriarch told me that his parents couldn't wait to move to the suburbs and put some distance between family and work. Their hardware business had shadowed their evenings and weekends, stealing peace. Decades later, the patriarch's restless, cell phone-toting, entrepreneurial son blamed the portability of work for his recent divorce. How smartphones make us superhuman . In the digital age, we blend home and work, not because we are tied to a store or farm or job, but because the fetters of time and space seem shattered. We can physically circuit the globe in hours, and our thoughts can move across the planet in seconds. Time seems putty in our hands. Our lives are increasingly shorn of context. My early days in the mobile revolution . Does it matter much whether it's night or day, spring or fall, home or the office? We are empowered, yet disturbed by this free-for-all. Two recent reports underscore the tensions within these shifts. While more companies are allowing employees to work when and where they want to, they increasingly are limiting people's ability to take a leave or work part-time, the Families and Work Institute found in its 2012 National Study of Employers. Flex-time is up, but career breaks have fallen steeply. More than half of executives get business information at all hours, according to a survey released earlier this year by Forbes Insights and an advertising firm. As many executives reported feeling enabled as irritated by an ""@Work State of Mind."" Nearly a third of those executives who feel ""in control"" of their always-on lives also describe themselves as resigned to the situation. Is overwork the trouble? Yes and no. In a blended world, work does tend to win out over other parts of life. Studies over the past decade show that people who work at home or outside the office tend to work longer hours, contrary to employers' initial fears. According to a recent survey, 54% of American smartphone owners check their phones in bed -- sometimes in the middle of the night. And at a Chicago marketers' networking luncheon where I recently spoke on a panel, a majority of the crowd of 150 reported, in a show of hands, that they sleep with a smartphone within reach. Even if work is our passion, as it is mine, we're pitching ourselves headlong and unthinkingly into a world without boundaries -- a world without rest. But overwork is perhaps the least of the challenges when we blend work and home. The blending itself changes how we work, as well as how long we work. In frantically integrating work and home, we stray perilously close to diluting both. This is a matter of attention, intention, and depth. In courting the always-on livelihood, we're turning our backs on rich moments of full focus and absorption, in favor of darting restlessly back and forth between two or more complex streams of life. The integrity of a moment is lost when we unthinkingly blend different parts of our life. I'm writing this on a Sunday. My teen is sleeping in and my husband is away. The silence of the morning provides a perfect context for writing. But when my groggy teen wakes up, I'll put aside my work, and we'll share toast and tea and a plan of the day. Because if I tried to skate through breakfast with one eye on my daughter and one eye on the clock or smartphone, a fleeting moment of togetherness would be diluted. The silken threads of mutual presence would be thinned to the point of fraying. As much as we try to believe otherwise, it matters where we are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maggie Jackson.","Maggie Jackson: We blend home and work because we all use smartphones .

"Washington (CNN) -- An outside company now heads the effort to correct problems with HealthCare.gov, rather than the federal agency getting most of the blame for the botched rollout of the website to enroll in President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms. Jeffrey Zients, the former White House budget officer assigned by Obama to fix the mess, said Friday that QSSI, a Maryland tech company, would serve as the ""general contractor"" in working to make the website function smoothly by the end of November. The announcement was a shift in tone and strategy for the administration. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was the lead agency in overseeing creation of the online site that buckled under the volume of initial visitors following its October 1 launch. QSSI was one of the dozens of contractors working with the government on the project coordinated by CMS, and now has the role of managing the correction efforts, according to Zients. ""There is now a general contractor who is overseeing the other contractors and directing the effort. In the tech world, this would be called a new systems integrator,"" the White House said in a statement. ""This general contractor will work around the clock with all the key decision makers and players, including CMS leadership and staff, vendors and contractors."" The problems became a political liability for the Obama administration by emboldening Republican efforts to undermine the health care reforms detested by conservatives as an extreme example of government overreach. After weeks of pledges by Obama and other officials to correct problems, including the inability to register, lengthy delays and incorrect information being relayed to insurers, Zients offered the first solid target for significant improvement. He said HealthCare.gov would work fully for the ""vast majority"" of users in just over a month. ""Healthcare.gov is fixable,"" he said on a conference call. Zients confirmed that as many as 70% of its users were unable to complete the first step of the enrollment process -- creating accounts -- at various times in recent weeks. The situation has improved, he said, while acknowledging other difficulties comprised a ""punch list"" of items being addressed. ""The punch list is dozens of items on both sides, in terms of priorities both on performance and functionality,"" Zients said, adding that new problems would be added as discovered ""but most importantly, we will be taking issues off the list."" Contractors point fingers . In more than four hours of testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday, officials of contractors hired to create Healthcare.gov cited a lack of testing on the full system and last-minute changes by the federal agency overseeing the online enrollment effort. Republican Rep. Renee Elmers of North Carolina said that ""the bottom line here is that CMS is responsible for this failure,"" while other Republicans also targeted Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, whose department includes CMS. Angry exchanges between Republicans who oppose the 2010 Affordable Care Act and Democrats defending it erupted repeatedly at the hearing, while the contractors insisted their work went fine even though the software functioned poorly when the system went live. ""I think the problems with Obamacare are much deeper than a website,"" GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told CNN on Thursday, echoing the Republican attack line that the health care reforms intended to help millions of uninsured Americans get affordable coverage are unmanageable. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that plenty of time remained to get the website fixed and people enrolled before the sign-up deadline of March 31. He said Zients had figured out the problems that needed to be addressed and now put in place the management changes to do so. While visiting a health insurance call center Friday in Texas, Sebelius stuck to the Obama administration's line that the website for enrolling in new health insurance exchanges was improving. Sebelius admitted she was surprised by the site's failure upon rollout. ""I didn't realize it wouldn't be operating optimally before the launch,"" she said. ""I think we knew that if we had had another six months, we would probably test further, but I don't think that anyone fully realized that both volume caused some problems, but volume also exposed some problems,"" she said. Request to extend the deadline . Separately, 10 Democratic Senators have asked Sebelius to extend the open enrollment period for insurance exchanges beyond March 31. If the period is not extended, people who are uninsured after that date would face an IRS fine under the health care reforms. But Sebelius described the open enrollment period as ""unusually long"" already and said any extension would have some consequences. Responding to Congress . Sebelius and her agency came under new pressure from the chairman of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee, who said he might consider a subpoena to get information he wants on contracts, communications and other details involving the Obamacare website. Committee aides said Thursday that the Health and Human Services Department had so far failed to respond to a previous request, and Rep. Darrell Issa of California gave Sebelius until Monday to comply or possibly face ""compulsory"" action. The agency said it is working to comply. ""The committee sent us an extremely broad request for documents on October 10 - while the government was still shut down - and asked that we produce these materials within two weeks,"" HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement. Peters said the agency has ""been engaged in discussions"" with Issa's panel to ""better understand and prioritize"" requests. CNN's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.","NEW: Outside contractor now overseeing website fixes .

"(CNN) -- Nine of us booked a trip on the Carnival cruise ship Triumph to celebrate our recent college graduation. I started out in a room of four friends but we were re-located because our room had a leak. So we were separated and my friend and I headed to our newer, more comfortable room...or so we thought. Around 5:30 Sunday morning, after a fun day in Mexico, we woke up to a PA announcement calling for crew help. As soon as I heard the captain come on, I looked at my friend and said, ""Adriana, if the captain is coming on sounding shaken, we better start to worry."" We put on our robes and rushed out, only to smell a bitter, burning odor at the end of the hall. Keep in mind this was on deck 6, so you can imagine how much worse it was on the lower decks that were closest to the engine room. People were throwing on life jackets and frantically rushing to find crew, friends and loved ones. By now, we had no cell service, only each other. People on the first and second decks had opened their doors to find their hallways filled with smoke. They told us of crew members running through the halls to address the situation. Tears, big hugs as passengers reunite with families . Within an hour, my friends found each other in the halls and ran to the top deck, where we could see black smoke billowing from the smokestack. It was only 45 minutes to an hour after the first PA announcement that we were informed of a fire. Six to eight hours later, we learned how bad the fire actually was when we heard that the crew could still not open up the engine room to inspect the damage. Not much information was provided and we were left to put the pieces together. At this point, the majority of the passengers had been forced out of their rooms due to smoke, sewage or lack of light. Many began camping out in any open-air section of the ship. They used whatever resources were available for bedding, shade and warmth. Sheets, blankets and pillows were seen all throughout the outside areas of the ship. Many families set up their new homes on any available spaces inside the ship, in hallways or on the floors of the dining rooms and lobbies. The passengers referred to these places as ""Tent City."" Luckily for me and the friends I traveled with, we were able to camp out with other friends who had a suite with a balcony. Never have I felt so blessed. By evening on the day the fire began, we were assured that Progreso, Mexico, would be our port of arrival and that we would be there no later than Tuesday. Of course, our hopes were extremely high. I could sense people were beginning to calm down as they anticipated Tuesday. Little did we know that soon that hope would be gone. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? A couple of days after the fire, as we were getting fresh air, near evening, we were startled again. We were greeted by the sight of a second cruise ship that dropped off supplies and amazingly we were able to pick up a cell phone signal from the other ship. Finally most of us were able to make our first call, only to find out that people off the ship knew more details of the events than any of us on it. Still we were informed that our arrival in Progreso was on track. Then the electricity went out. People were beginning to panic, but after half an hour, the power came back on. We were told via the PA system that due to better access to flights home, we were now heading to Mobile, Alabama, and would get there by the earliest on Thursday morning. Yet again our spirits were shattered. Finally my frustrations emerged, and I lost it. The next day began the worst part of the trip. Anywhere you went on the ship, the rancid stench from sewage was evident. At this point, in order to breathe, our only option was to keep moving to an open space where we could take a deep breath of fresh air. Passengers were becoming anxious, aggravated, irritable and angry. Lines for food and beverages were getting longer and longer. This made people even more panicked and many began to hoard food on their plates, with nearly half of it not being consumed. Why did rescue take five days? Food and water were going quicker than ever and nerves were running high. By this time, seven out of the nine friends in our group had reached their breaking points emotionally, along with many other passengers. The two tug boats sent to tow the ship began having problems. Their tow lines were breaking, which caused more delay and lower morale. The mood changed on Thursday when three cruise ships stopped to provide food and provisions. The Coast Guard stayed close as well and dropped off provisions. Two tug boats assisted us. If it wasn't for the crew on board, all of us would be severely injured, starved or crazy. Crew members always had a smile on their face and a concern in their voice. Honestly, these people deserve more than compensation. They deserve a huge thank you for their enduring support, service and compassion. This was supposed to be a celebration trip, and I can confidently say there has not been much of a celebration on this ship. Opinion: How Carnival can clean up the PR mess . But people have been so supportive of each other. The camaraderie and compassion between the passengers and crew members has been outstanding. Strangers lent cell phones, moms held other moms' babies so they could have a break, passengers gave a hand to the elderly to ensure they got up and down the stairs safely and guys were ready and willing to lift wheelchairs of sick children up and down the stairs, as my friend Nick Burge did. It was the last day on the Carnival Triumph and finally we were offered treats such as hot chocolate and imitation bacon. Of course, the lines were hours long so my friends and I opted not to wait. Instead we packed, charged our phones and cried as I sat down to write this. I could write on and on about what I have seen, heard and felt, but by Day Five, I honestly have nothing left.

"(CNN) -- Passengers on a Carnival cruise ship drifting in the Gulf of Mexico aren't getting the vacation they expected -- sleeping on its decks, making do with a few working toilets, and doing what they can to get food -- all due to a weekend engine fire left the vessel dead in the water. The Carnival Triumph was about 150 miles off the coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, heading back Sunday morning to Galveston, Texas -- where it had departed Thursday on a four-day trip -- when a fire broke out in an engine room, according to Carnival Cruise Lines. The ship's automatic fire extinguishing system kicked in and soon contained the flames, and no injuries were reported, Carnival reported. Yet this fire left the ship -- and its 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members -- adrift without propulsion, the cruise line said, halting its trip back to port. The first of two tugboats that will tow the ship to Mobile, Alabama, arrived on Monday evening, the cruise line said in a statement. The ship should arrive in the Gulf city some time Thursday. Not being able to sail, though, is just one of the problems. Issues with running water, scarce electricity and more contributed to headaches big and small, according to passengers and their loved ones. Toby Barlow's wife Ann told him there was ""sewage running down the walls and floors"" with passengers being asked to defecate in bags and urinate in showers due to a lack of functioning toilets. Food lines ran 3Â½ hours long and some, like herself, slept outside to keep cool. ""Elderly and handicap(ped people) are struggling,"" she texted her husband. ""The smells are gross."" Read related: Cruise safety drill results in 5 deaths . Brent Nutt said his wife, Bethany -- who is on board, and whom he talked to Sunday -- reported similar problems. ""She said they had no power, no running water, and she said she hadn't been able to eat anything yet. Then you call the Carnival phone number for families, and they tell you that everything is all right,"" Nutt told CNN. Posts to CruiseCritic.com, which bills itself as an ""interactive community of avid and first-time cruisers,"" documented similar issues with power and more. Some posts, though, were more light-hearted. ""They are all fine,"" wrote one woman, whose sister is on board. ""Said they are still having fun and gave me the task to call her boss who seems to think I was lying."" Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen acknowledged issues, while noting the cruise line's efforts to address the situation. Some people are camping out on the decks because some cabins don't have air conditioning, he said Monday evening. And Gulliksen pointed to recent progress. For instance, ""we have restored toilets in some public areas and cabins;"" there is running water for showers, even if it's cold; and some elevators are working. As for the food situation, he said the Triumph's poolside restaurant has ""limited food service"" and meals have been brought aboard from two other Carnival ships. Earlier Monday, the cruise line said in a statement that there was hot coffee available, among other options. ""All our guests are safe, and we're doing everything we can to make them as comfortable as possible,"" Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill said in a statement issued at 8:30 p.m. ET Monday. ""We're terribly sorry for the inconvenience, discomfort and frustration our guests are feeling."" Read related: What caused the Costa Cruises ship disaster? Besides the two Carnival vessels that have come to transfer supplies -- and, in one case, take on a passenger with a pre-existing medical condition, said Gulliksen -- the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Vigorous is on-site to aid the stranded ship. ""It's in deep water and not near any hazards to navigation,"" said Greg Magee, the commander of the Vigorous. The ship was initially expected to be towed into the northern Yucatan port of Progreso, Mexico. But the ship had already drifted about 90 miles north due to strong currents by Monday night, prompting the decision to instead move the Triumph to Mobile. Carnival said Mobile and Progreso were then roughly equidistant, adding that strong currents toward the Alabama shore and a ""simpler re-entry"" -- especially for the 900 passengers without passports -- also drove the decision to head to the U.S. coast. After being towed to port, those aboard the Carnival Triumph will be flown home at no cost to them, the cruise line said. They will also get a full refund, credit that can be used toward a future trip and reimbursement for all expenses, except casino and gift shop purchases, for their current trip. The vessel's next two departures, scheduled for Monday and Saturday, have been canceled. Those slated to be on those trips will get full refunds and discounts toward future cruises, the cruise line said. Family and friends of those on board may call 888-290-5095 or 305-406-5534 for information. Throughout the ordeal, Barlow said his wife Ann has kept her sense of humor despite being stranded. ""I joked with her that I got the raw end of the deal. I was stuck in Texas with all (the) kids going to watch midget wrestling while she was on a cruise this weekend with her girlfriends,"" he said. ""When I talked to her (Sunday) night, I reminded her maybe I got the better end of the deal,"" he said. Read also: Eight icy getaways .

"(CNN) -- Some friends and colleagues have been up in arms about an article in Wednesday's New York Times that discussed how exercise may be as effective as medication in treating heart disease and other medical conditions. Those who fall on the side of more traditional medicine think this is crazy and believe that the studies supporting lifestyle changes ignore the hard and fast outcomes promised by drugs. Those who fall on the side of more alternative medicine, or have a more holistic, bent have no trouble with these findings and believe lifestyle has always been far superior to pharmaceutical treatment. The truth is that both sides are correct -- to a point. That, of course, makes both sides a bit wrong, too. The research was published in October in the British Medical Journal. It was a meta-analysis, or study of studies, of previous meta-analyses of research that investigated whether exercise or drugs reduced the chance of death from coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure and diabetes. Four of the previous meta-analyses covered exercise interventions and 12 covered drugs. No difference in efficacy between the exercise and drug interventions was found in respect to coronary heart disease and diabetes. In other words, they performed the same in terms of reducing your chance of death. With respect to stroke, exercise performed better than some drugs. With respect to heart failure, some drugs performed better than exercise. What can we take home from this type of study? Well, the first thing to note is that lifestyle changes can make a big difference in a person's health. Exercise interventions, which are often far less intensive than you might think, can significantly reduce your chance of dying from these conditions. Exercise can also help you to shed pounds if you're overweight or obese. It can even make you look a little better. Many people report secondary gains of improved mood and quality of life when they're more active. The secondary gains from a more active lifestyle are not to be minimized. Exercise is usually cheap, if not free, and has relatively few side effects. Getting someone to exercise, however, is not easy. A lifestyle change is, by definition, a change in how you live your life. That can be difficult, and many patients will choose to take drugs instead. Taking a medication can be far simpler, and a doctor can prescribe it immediately. Many of my physician friends believe it's more likely that a patient will comply with taking prescription pills than with advice to exercise. But that's part of the problem with our medical system. Every time a doctor writes a prescription, he or she probably earns some money. The pharmacy that dispenses the meds makes some money. And, of course, the pharmaceutical company that makes the medications makes money, too. The health care system understands and even encourages this practice. Insurance pays for it without issue. But the same health care system is not at all equipped to deal with lifestyle change. No one makes any money if you're more active. No one would ever think to write a prescription for a gym membership, which could easily cost less than some medications, with the same potential outcomes. It's thought that the recently released guidelines for assessing and preventing cardiovascular disease could lead to more than a billion people taking statins worldwide. That is, as you can imagine, a huge amount of money going to those types of drugs. It's highly unlikely that a similar number of people will be encouraged to exercise. One is considered ""doing something"" by the health care system; the other is not. One is paid for by the health care system; the other is not. But as evidence amasses that lifestyle interventions are as beneficial as medical ones, it may be time to rethink how that system works. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Study found exercise may be as effective as pills in fighting some medical conditions .

"Paris (CNN) -- Dressed in a wet suit, air tanks strapped to his back, poised to head overboard is an image of Jacques Cousteau most people would recognize. It was a routine the French explorer and conservationist repeated over and over again, hundreds, perhaps thousands of times over his long and adventure-filled life. But less known was that Cousteau was an inventive genius. ""I remember most that he was enchanted with ideas ... He was almost like a little child, but he was the most creative and imaginative person I've ever met,"" says Susan Schiefelbein, a close collaborator with Cousteau for more than two decades who also helped him write his autobiography. ""He made connections that other people were slow to make. A scientist who would be involved and have a passion in his work could go to Cousteau and say 'A,B' and Cousteau could skip to 'Q' and understand immediately the intermediary steps,"" she said. The Frenchman practically invented scuba diving when he developed the regulator valve that made possible breathing air from tanks underwater. Apart from his scuba equipment, which he called an ""aqua lung,"" Cousteau was perhaps best known for his underwater photography. His stunning documentaries produced for television and cinema had their origins in the adventurer's childhood curiosity. ""He was fascinated by film from the time he was a little child -- he actually pinched chemicals from his grandfather's pharmacy and taught himself how to develop films and he made movies of himself and his friends,"" Schiefelbein said. Cousteau's original ambitions were to forge a naval and aviation career, attending the naval academy in Brest. But a serious car accident in which he broke both his arms ended any dreams of becoming a pilot. ""He was strengthening himself by swimming and he became a naval explorer kind of by default,"" Schiefelbein says. If he came to diving by accident, it was a fortunate accident indeed. It led Cousteau to a lifelong search to find out what lies beneath the surface of the world's oceans. Cousteau's endless curiosity led him to explore ever more remote, ever deeper waters. But he needed something to help withstand high water pressures and capable of maneuvering silently like a diver without disturbing the aquatic life around it. Submarines couldn't work because of the turbulence and danger of their propellers. Nothing like he had in mind existed, so Cousteau invented it. ""He had the idea for it at lunch. He pulled out a saucer from under a coffee cup and then put another one on top and he said 'something like this,' and in two weeks he had scientists working on the idea,"" Schiefelbein said. With the help of Jean Mollard from the French Center for Undersea Research, Cousteau created the ""diving saucer,"" or the SP-350 as it was formally known -- a two-man submarine which could dive to depths of 350 meters for several hours at a time. He very often insisted on testing his new devices and techniques himself, frequently risking his own life in the process. ""Here was a man who took these devices down enormous depths, not having any idea of what would happen and he had to find out for himself. So it was really trial and error in a very dangerous sense. And he always survived,"" Schiefelbein said. But the French explorer's vision was not limited to the world of diving. He saw the need to take on broader issues especially those concerning the environment and the seas. In the 1960s, he campaigned to stop underwater dumping of nuclear waste in the Mediterranean Sea and helped restrict commercial whaling in the 1980s, doing his bit to protect the world he so enjoyed exploring. ""If somebody said: 'what do you expect to see at the bottom of the Romanche Trench?' -- which they were the first to photograph -- he would say: 'If I knew what I expected to see why would I go? Why would I even look?' So it was 'allez voir,'"" Schiefelbein says. ""Allez voir"" (""go see"") was advice that Cousteau himself followed right until the end.","Jacques Cousteau allied an inventive genius to his exploring and photography skills .

"Washington (CNN) -- The fire that crippled the Carnival cruise ship Triumph started with a leak in a fuel-oil return line running from one of the ship's engines, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday. Leaking oil hit a hot surface, starting the fire, said Teresa Hatfield, the lead investigator for the Coast Guard. Hatfield said there was no indication the leak in a flexible hose section was intentional. ""Fire suppression was immediately activated by the crew, first by waterfog and then by (carbon dioxide). They did a very good job,"" Hatfield said. ""We are looking at the cause of the fire and why the ship was disabled for so long, and we are also looking at the crew response to the fire as well."" Hatfield said the investigation will last for several months. The Coast Guard said it has conducted 21 interviews with passengers and crew members since Thursday, when investigators boarded the ship while it was still at sea. Hatfield said the oil return line is one of the items that is routinely inspected, but she did not say when it was last inspected or describe its condition at that time. Vance Gulliksen, a spokesman with Carnival Cruise Lines, told CNN Monday that the ship's last scheduled Coast Guard inspection was on November 15. Gulliksen also said the cruise line agreed with the Coast Guard's determination of the origin of the fire. Coast Guard spokesman Carlos Diaz said the line ran from the ship's ""number-6 engine"" to a fuel tank. The Triumph was on the third day of a planned four-day cruise from Galveston, Texas, to Mexico when the fire broke out and brought the trip to a halt. It was carrying more than 4,200 people, including 3,100 passengers. The Triumph was eventually towed into port in Mobile, Alabama, Thursday night, and the last passengers disembarked Friday. Stranded on the crippled ship, passengers and crew lived with worsening conditions, as toilets stopped working, and waste spilled onto floors and into hallways. Passengers had to use plastic bags to collect their waste. Passenger Cassie Terry described the ship as ""a floating toilet, a floating Petri dish, a floating hell"" in a lawsuit filed Friday against Carnival for unspecified damages related to the cruise. Passengers reported long lines for food, shortages of fresh water and widespread boredom. Many passengers slept in hallways or outside to escape the odors and heat below decks. Patrick Cuty, a senior marine investigator for the Coast Guard, told CNN Sunday that investigators had located the area where flames erupted in the engine room. ""We know that the fire originated in front of a generator,"" Cuty said. ""You can see the ignition marks on the wall."" There are three generators in the engine room where the fire broke out. Three other generators are in a second engine room that wasn't involved in the fire, Cuty said. The same ship encountered a problem in January with its propulsion system, according to a notice posted on the website of Carnival senior cruise director John Heald. On Saturday, Carnival crew members were bused to and from the ship to help with the clean-up. One housekeeper told CNN it wasn't pleasant work but said it had to be done, and the crew was willing to do it. Passengers have praised the crew for its response during the ordeal. Because the Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency and will work with the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators pulled the voyage data recorder, a device that records alarms, voice communications on the bridge, engine speed, navigation information and rudder angle, Cuty said. It appears that the fire suppression worked as designed, Cuty said Friday. The engineer who was on watch around dawn February 10 saw the fire ignite over a video feed and immediately notified the bridge, Cuty said. On crippled cruise ship, icky jobs fell to 'amazing' crew .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United ended a run of three consecutive defeats with a 2-0 win against Swansea City in the English Premier League on Saturday. Second-half goals from Antonio Valencia and Danny Welbeck eased the pressure on David Moyes following a league defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on New Year's Day and losses to Swansea and Sunderland in England's two domestic cup competitions. A goalless first half ended with the visitors in the ascendency having dominated possession while United, barring a shot from Welbeck which went close, failed to threaten Swansea's goal. United, who were again without their two star strikers, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, looked like they could slip to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time since 1961. But the game turned in the home side's favor 90 seconds after the break when Valencia swept home from close range after goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel had parried Shinji Kagawa's header into the path of the Ecuador international. United doubled their lead 12 minutes later as Welbeck neatly deflected Patrice Evra's shot past a helpless Tremmel. The England international's sixth goal in as many games settled home nerves and in the end the winning margin could have been greater especially if Kagawa and Chris Smalling hadn't squandered good chances. ""We started the game well but we didn't do enough in the first half to get goals,"" Moyes told Sky Sports after the match. ""We limited them to very few opportunities today. I can't hardly remember any at all and in the end we got the result we deserved,"" Moyes added. ""We are hoping to give the supporters some more goals here, not just the two, but maybe we'll keep those for later on in the season."" The win keeps United in seventh with 37 points, two points behind Liverpool who travel to Stoke City on Sunday and nine points behind of current leaders Chelsea who assumed top spot after beating Hull City 2-0 at the KC Stadium. Eden Hazard put the visitors ahead in the 56th minute firing low into the bottom right corner before Fernando Torres sealed victory three minutes from the end with a goal on his 200th Premier League appearance. Jose Mourinho's side now have 46 points, one more than Arsenal who take on Aston Villa on Monday and two more than Manchester City who travel to Newcastle on Sunday. London rivals Tottenham Hotspur continued their resurgence under new coach Tim Sherwood with a comfortable 2-0 win over Crystal Palace. Second-half goals from Christian Eriksen and Jermain Defoe means Spurs have now won four out of five league games since Andre Villas Boas' dismissal last month. The result lifts Sherwood's team to fifth with 40 points while Palace are now bottom on goal difference following Sunderland 4-1 win against Craven Cottage. Everton are one point ahead and one place above the North Londoners after also securing a 2-0 win against Norwich City at Goodison Park. Southampton, meanwhile, notched up only their second win in 10 games with a 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion at St Mary's. Adam Lallana's 66th-minute goal means Southampton have 30 points and stay in ninth while West Brom, whose new boss Pepe Mel watched on from the stands, remain in 14th with 21 points. After conceding 11 goals in their last two cup matches West Ham United recorded a vital league win against Cardiff City. Two drubbings -- 5-0 against Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup and 6-0 to Manchester City in the English League Cup -- had put manager Sam Allardyce's future at the club in doubt, but the 2-0 win against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side relieves the pressure for now and sees the Hammers move up to 17th while Cardiff slip to 18th.

"(CNN) -- Managers Manuel Pellegrini and Alan Pardew were involved in an unseemly touchline spat as Manchester City went back to the top of the English Premier League with a controversial 2-0 win at Newcastle Sunday. Pellegrini's City had taken an early lead through Edin Dzeko when the verbal confrontation occurred after Newcastle had an apparent equalizer from Cheick Tiote chalked off by referee Mike Jones. He ruled that Yoan Gouffran, who was in an offside position, was interfering with play, but the decision infuriated Pardew. He confronted fourth official Martin Atkinson and with the benches from both teams drawn into the argument, Pardew also directed some of his venom in the direction of Chilean Pellegrini. ""Pellegrini said something to me on the touchline which I wasn't happy with, it was normal banter where I probably used words I shouldn't have in the heat of the moment and I apologize for that,"" admitted Pardew after the match. Pardew was given a two-match ban for pushing a referee last season and it remains to be seen what action the English Football Association takes after receiving reports from the officials. Pellegrini, who was angered by a foul on Samir Nasri by Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, which saw the French star stretchered off, tried to play down the incident. ""Nothing important was said on the touchline between me and Alan Pardew, but I think it's impossible for the referee to handle a game when every time he gave a decision against Newcastle there were complaints,"" he said. He has overseen a 16-match unbeaten run for his expensively-assembled side, which has gone a point clear of Chelsea at the top of the EPL. Arsenal, who play Aston Villa Monday, can reclaim first place with a victory in a tight title race. Dzeko's eighth-minute goal and a late strike from Alvaro Negredo in stoppage time sealed the victory. In between, Joe Hart made some fine saves to deny Yohan Cabaye and Loic Remy as Newcastle pressed for the leveler. Liverpool later revived their faltering challenge with a pulsating 5-3 victory at Stoke City as Luis Suarez scored twice. His 32nd-minute strike allied to an earlier own goal from Ryan Shawcross put Liverpool 2-0 ahead until the home side hit back through former Reds duo Peter Crouch and Charlie Adam. A Steven Gerrard penalty after Raheem Sterling was fouled and Suarez's second opened up the two-goal cushion again before Jonathan Walters gave Stoke late hope. Substitute striker Daniel Sturridge, making his return from an ankle injury that had sidelined the England international since late November, snuffed that out with the clinching fifth with Liverpool moving back to fourth, five points adrift of Manchester City.","Manchester City win 2-0 at Newcastle United Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Before the thousands of passengers and crew of the snakebit Carnival Triumph debarked Friday, an investigation into what went wrong had already begun. ""We started the investigation right after we were notified Sunday"" that the ship's engine room had caught fire, cutting all but generator power to the floating city, said Patrick Cuty, a senior marine investigator for the U.S. Coast Guard. Initially, investigators got engineering schematics for the vessel from Carnival, Cuty told CNN. Because the Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency, and will work with the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. Coast Guard investigators boarded the vessel Thursday as it headed to port to get passengers' accounts of what happened and how it was handled, he said. Investigators have already pulled the voyage data recorder -- a device that records alarms, voice communications on the bridge, engine speed, navigation information and rudder angle, said Cuty. The probe will likely take eight to 12 months to complete, he said. 'Amazing' crew handled icky jobs on crippled cruise ship . Though the investigation into the cause of the fire in one of the ship's two engine rooms is just beginning, Cuty said it appears that the fire suppression worked as it was designed to do. The engineer who was on watch at around dawn on Sunday saw the fire ignite over a video feed and immediately notified the bridge, Cuty said. ""He saw the flash; that's what alerted him."" He continued, ""Fire doors closed, the extinguishing systems worked, the fire was extinguished, it was kept closed as it is supposed to be so that the fire can cool down."" Lawsuit filed over 'floating hell' cruise . Based on an inspection Thursday of the engine room, the fire did not appear to have been large, Cuty said. ""It was just a fire that was, apparently, in the right place."" Though the crew might have been able to restore power to the vessel by firing up the generators in the ship's other engine room, Cuty said the ship's engineers made the right call in not doing so. ""Really, the safe thing to do was to tow the vessel back into port rather than re-energize the power system that was damaged by fire,"" he said. He said the listing ship was never in danger of exploding or of capsizing, as some passengers had feared. Fuel tanks are kept far from the engine rooms and the vessel, which began tilting when the power loss led its plane stabilizers to stop working, listed only about 5 degrees from the wind. Cuty commended the ship's 1,086 crew members, saying they went to great lengths to meet passengers' needs -- including redirecting emergency power to certain parts of ship to provide occasional water and toilet service. ""The crew did an excellent job, from what we saw above and below decks and, over all I think, they accomplished their mission as far as safety goes: they brought everybody back safe."" Tears and big hugs as passengers reunite with families . Passengers, too, praised the crew. Many said they bent over backward to meet the needs of passengers, performing well even during unpleasant jobs such as cleaning the raw waste that had sloshed out of toilets. ""They served us with smiles, and served us in ways that are truly unthinkable, the things they had to do for us, yet they did it with smiles,"" said passenger Joy Dyer, wearing a Triumph bathrobe with ""Float Trip 2013"" scrawled on the back. Investigators will look into passenger reports from previous cruises of the Triumph that noted ""some mechanical issues,"" Cuty said. ""They may be completely unrelated to this,"" he said. Meanwhile, busloads of passengers departed Mobile on Friday for their homes. Among the passengers arriving in Galveston, Texas, were Tony and Jenny Larocca of Lake Charles, Louisiana, on their first trip away from the kids -- a cruise that the husband got his wife for Christmas. Their souvenir? A bag of stinky clothes and a new appreciation for each other. ""There's no way I could have made it without him,"" Jenny Larocca said. As the former passengers spoke, tugboats pulled the crippled Triumph to a Mobile, Alabama, shipyard for repair. The ship won't resume cruises until at least mid-April. Opinion: My celebration trip on the Carnival Triumph: From joy to misery . Nightmare vacation . The Triumph's more than 3,100 passengers were in their third day of a planned four-day cruise from Galveston to Mexico when a fire in an engine room left it with no propulsion, adrift in the Gulf of Mexico. The power outages put toilets out of order and the listing caused many of them to overflow, sending urine and feces sloshing across floors and down hallways. Passengers reported long lines for food, shortages of fresh water and widespread boredom. Many passengers slept in hallways or outside to escape the odors and heat below decks. Five things we've learned about cruising . Late Thursday, Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill apologized on behalf of the company. ""We pride ourselves in providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,"" he told reporters before boarding the ship to apologize in person. But for passenger Norma Reyes, it was too little too late. ""The hallways were toxic,"" said Reyes, who vowed never to go on another Carnival cruise. ""Full of urine. It was horrible.

Fallout . Carnival has offered to give each passenger $500, a free flight home, a full refund for the trip and for most expenses incurred on board, as well as credit for another cruise. Travelers have few options for compensation in these cases, other than what the cruise line is already offering, according to travel expert Jason Clampet of Skift.com, a travel website. ""The passengers on the ship aren't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home,"" he said. Travel ""insurance really doesn't cover this sort of thing. Their trip wasn't interrupted and they aren't incurring extra expenses ... so they can't be compensated that way."" But the resulting PR could hurt Carnival, he said. ""I think people will think twice about taking a cruise,"" Clampet said. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? Previous problems . The fire is at least the second problem for the ship since late January, when it had an issue with its propulsion system, according to a notice posted on the website of Carnival senior cruise director John Heald. It's also not the first fire to disable one of the cruise line's ships. In 2010, the Carnival cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it adrift off Mexico's Pacific coast. The ship was towed to San Diego. Opinion: How Carnival can clean up the PR mess . Leonara Chavez and David Zambrano were on the Splendor when it lost power in 2010.

She said they took the free cruise offered by Carnival after the 2010 debacle. Despite walking the halls of the ship recounting things that had happened, she said they were determined to enjoy the trip. But what happened aboard the Triumph, she said, has sealed their decision when it comes to cruising: They won't be going again. Why did the rescue take so long?

"Chicago (CNN) -- Protesters and police clashed outside the NATO summit in Chicago, where world leaders met to discuss the way forward in Afghanistan. Police hit protesters with batons as they pushed against a line of officers, video from CNN affiliate WLS showed. The clashes came toward the end of a day of peaceful protests. At least 45 people were arrested Sunday and four officers were taken to the hospital with injuries, said Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. One officer had been stabbed in the leg, he said. ""They rallied. They charged the cops and they assaulted the officers,"" McCarthy said. ""The finger should be pointed at the people who assaulted the cops."" Occupy Chicago, one of the groups that helped organize the demonstrations, similarly reported that some people were injured. ""The police have several demonstrators detained behind their lines, calling for medics. Bloodied protesters being dragged out of sight now,"" the group wrote on its Twitter page earlier in the day. A city official, who was not authorized to talk to the media on police matters, told CNN that between 75-100 protesters had refused to leave the area after being told to disperse. They threw bottles and other objects at police, the official said. ""Quite frankly, I think it's been an incredibly successful event in spite of some of these issues,"" said McCarthy, who offered high praise for his officers. ""We're not here to get battered."" He accused some protesters of splashing red paint on themselves to make it look like they had been wounded. The clashes took place just blocks from the NATO summit. Inside that meeting, U.S. President Barack Obama met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and hosted other world leaders. He stressed that more work must be done before NATO troops pull out of Afghanistan. ""There will be great challenges ahead. The loss of life continues in Afghanistan. There will be hard days,"" Obama said at the summit. ""But we are confident we are on the right track and (what) this NATO summit reflects is that the world is behind the strategy we've laid out. Now it's our task to implement it effectively and I believe we can do so in part because of the tremendous strength and resilience of the Afghan people."" Obama and other world leaders were expected to draw up a road map out of the war in Afghanistan. The summit comes at a key time for NATO countries, who are trying to figure out how to meet a 2014 deadline to withdraw from an unpopular war in Afghanistan while shoring up that nation's security forces. ""There will be no rush for the exits. We will stay committed to our operations in Afghanistan and see it through to a successful end. Our goal, our strategy, our timetable remains unchanged,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Sunday. ""Once the Afghans have full responsibility by the end of 2014, our combat mission will come to an end. But we will not walk away,"" he added later in the day. Also Sunday, NATO leaders inked a deal to acquire five unarmed drones as part of ""smart defense,"" a term used to describe efforts to do more with less at a time when many nations' defense budgets are being slashed, Rasmussen said. More than a dozen countries will help to buy the drones. ""NATO in itself is smart defense because it is about helping each other instead of re-nationalizing defense,"" said the secretary general. Security was tight at the summit following Saturday's arrest of three men, described by authorities as anarchists who plotted to attack Obama's Chicago campaign headquarters and lob Molotov cocktails at police during the summit. Two other men, not believed to be part of the alleged plot, appeared in court Sunday to face charges from ""related investigations,"" authorities said. Police insist there were no imminent threats to the leaders of more than 50 nations gathering at the summit. The leaders are expected to formally adopt a timetable to transition security from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force to Afghan forces, senior administration officials told CNN. Why ordinary Afghans worry about NATO summit . The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity as a matter of practice, said the plan will also lay out NATO's training and advisory role after 2014. A small contingent of British forces could remain after NATO forces leave in 2014, a senior British official said. A senior U.S. official said the United Kingdom may keep some troops in Afghanistan post-2014 for counter-terrorism purposes. Both officials requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. One of the key issues to be considered by the NATO leaders is who will pay for the buildup of Afghan forces as ISAF draws down its troops. Afghan security forces are expected to total 350,000 by 2015, according to CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. Afghan President Karzai, who is attending the summit along with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, can only afford to cover a fraction of the cost of building up his country's forces. The cost of building up forces is expected to total roughly $4 billion annually by 2014, Bergen said. Rasmussen said Sunday that he was optimistic that other countries will contribute. ""At the end of the day, it is less expensive to finance the Afghan security forces to do the combat than to deploy our own troops,"" he told CNN's ""State of the Union."" A user's guide to the Chicago NATO summit . As expected, France's new president, Francois Hollande, announced the withdrawal of French combat troops from Afghanistan by year's end. As part of ISAF, French trainers will remain. A Taliban spokesman said Sunday that Hollande's declaration ""is a decision based on realities and a reflection of the opinion of (his) nation."" ""We call upon all the other NATO member countries to avoid working for the political interests of American officials and answer the call of your own people by immediately removing all your troops from Afghanistan,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement, describing what he said was the ""savagery"" of troops in Afghanistan. ""The invasion of Afghanistan by America and its allies under the banner of 'war of terror' was an unjustified and tyrannical action which was only carried out for political and economical gains,"" he said. Also at issue at the NATO summit is Islamabad's continued blockade of much-needed NATO supplies shipped over Pakistani roads to Afghanistan. Pakistan closed the ground routes after a NATO airstrike in November killed two dozen of its soldiers. NATO insists the incident was an accident. The United States and Pakistan have not come to an agreement on the price of opening the supply lines, according to senior administration officials. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Sunday with Pakistani President Zardari to discuss the lines, reconciliation and Pakistani commitments to go after extremists, the officials said. Without a deal, officials said Obama would not meet with Zardari at the summit. The two were scheduled to hold trilateral talks with Karzai on political reconciliation in Afghanistan. Pakistan's support in reaching a deal with the Taliban is seen as critical in ending the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney was not at the summit, but he weighed in Sunday with an op-ed piece in the Chicago Tribune, arguing that many NATO countries have not contributed enough to the alliance. The Obama administration's defense budget cuts have further fueled the problem, he said. ""The administration's irresponsible defense cuts are clearing the way for our partners to do even less,"" Romney wrote. ""An alliance not undergirded by military strength and U.S. leadership may soon become an alliance in name only.""

"(CNN) -- Bangkok remains on edge after tens of thousands of anti-government protesters ""shut down"" the Thai capital Monday in an effort to force caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to step aside and postpone elections planned for February 2. The showdown is the latest chapter in a divisive political conflict that has convulsed the country since 2005 and shows no signs of a resolution. Who are the protesters and what do they want? The protesters insist they are not opposed to democracy but want wide-ranging reform to clean up Thai politics and root out corruption before elections are held. Their slogan is: ""Reform before elections."" They ostentatiously festoon themselves in red, white and blue -- the colors of the Thai flag -- and have adopted the practice of loudly blowing whistles to drive home their message to the government: ""Get out!"" Are you there? Send us your photos and experiences but please stay safe. The self-styled ""whistle mob"" is overwhelmingly drawn from two groups in society -- the wealthier residents of Bangkok, the middle and upper classes, and Thais from the south of the country, who have traveled to the capital to join the protests. Their apparent leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, is a southern Thai political strongman who has long been among the most powerful powerbrokers in the Democrat Party. The protesters have adopted much of the symbolism of recent political protests elsewhere in the world, wearing Guy Fawkes masks and calling their planned shutdown of the capital ""Occupy Bangkok."" But there are significant differences from global protest movements against the ""one percent"" -- the Thai protesters draw their support from wealthier members of society, and are staunchly elitist, royalist and nationalist. They also support the country's military, which has a habit of launching coups to overthrow elected governments. Many protesters have openly called for a coup to kick out Yingluck. They argue that poorer Thais, particularly in the rural northeast of the country, are uneducated and sell their votes to the highest bidder at election time, allowing wealthy political strongman Thaksin Shinawatra -- brother of the current prime minister -- to dominate the country even though he fled abroad in 2008 to escape a corruption conviction. How much popular support do the protesters have? Supporters of the whistle mob insist they represent ""the people"" and have made inflated claims about the number of protesters who have joined mass rallies over the past two months, saying several million Thais have regularly taken to the streets to demand political change. In fact, they represent a minority of Thais, and this is their problem. In every general election held in Thailand since 2001, the Democrat Party has been trounced by political parties controlled by Thaksin, and the same outcome is virtually certain if the February vote goes ahead. Thaksin's ability to dominate electoral politics thanks to his huge support from the urban and rural poor has caused immense resentment among wealthier residents of Bangkok, who believe they should be the people calling the shots. Besides the class divisions fueling the political conflict, there are also regional faultlines -- the relatively wealthy provinces of southern Thailand staunchly back the Democrat Party, while support for Thaksin is highest in the north and northeast. Rich Thais object to having their electoral choices drowned out by the votes of the masses, and southern Thais object to losing out in every election to the votes of the more populous, but poorer, north and northeast. Opponents of the protesters include the pro-Thaksin ""Red Shirt"" movement and also progressive pro-democracy Thais in Bangkok who have held several candlelight vigils calling for peace and have adopted the slogan ""Respect My Vote."" They argue Thailand's divisions can only be healed by embracing democracy, and say canceling the February election would be a disastrous step backwards. Several commentators have drawn parallels between the whistle mob and the Tea Party movement in the United States. Both groups have overwhelming support in some parts of the country and among some social groups, but are unable to win national elections at the ballot box, and so have increasingly adopted disruptive tactics in response. What's going on behind the scenes? One reason the Thai conflict can often appear so bewildering is that an important element of the story is routinely left out. One of Thailand's most sacred taboos forbids discussion of the royal succession when the ailing 86-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej passes, and the country's draconian lÃ¨se majestÃ© law imposes long jail sentences on those who discuss uncomfortable facts about the monarchy. The royal succession is absolutely central to the ongoing conflict that has engulfed Thailand since 2005. Although Thailand is nominally a constitutional monarchy in which the palace has a purely symbolic role, in fact the king controls a vast royal fortune conservatively estimated at more than $30 billion and wields enormous influence. Thailand has long been dominated by an oligarchy of immensely wealthy families connected to the palace through intermarriage and through business deals with the Crown Property Bureau, which manages royal wealth. The Thai establishment fears the rise of a new political and business elite revolving around Thaksin, which would spell the end of the dominance of the old elite. Will there be violence? Unfortunately this seems possible. Several people have been killed and wounded in recent weeks, and the casualty toll is highly likely to rise significantly after the Bangkok blockade gets under way. Both sides in the conflict between Thailand's old establishment and the new elite allied to Thaksin have sought to provoke chaos and bloodshed in recent years. The aim is to provoke a harsh crackdown from the other side that creates the impression it has lost legitimacy and become tyrannical. Opponents of Thaksin blockaded Bangkok's airports in late 2008 and succeeded in toppling the government. Thaksin's supporters occupied the center of the capital in April and May 2010, and Thaksin has been widely accused of funding an illegal militia that worsened the mayhem -- though he has emphatically denied supporting violence. The latest protest will use tactics from the same playbook. By paralyzing Bangkok, the movement's leaders hope to push the Yingluck administration into adopting a heavy-handed response, or to stir up violence among the government's Red Shirt supporters. They then intend to exploit the chaos to declare the government is unable to govern with legitimacy, and to provide a pretext for the conservative military to launch another coup. They know that they cannot win the February elections, so they will do all they can to prevent the polls from taking place. If they succeed, this will further inflame the resentment of poorer Thais who believe their electoral aspirations are routinely ignored by the establishment. If they lose, they will almost certainly become even more disruptive in the months and years ahead, until the unacknowledged succession struggle plays out. Either way, the prognosis for Thailand is depressingly bleak. The opinions expressed in this analysis are solely those of the author.","Bangkok lock down the latest chapter in a divisive political conflict that has convulsed Thailand .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer that helped revolutionize the way football's transfer system works has turned his sights on UEFA's new system of financial regulation. Jean-Louis Dupont, who helped Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman change European law in 1995 to allow players to move for free at the end of their contract, is representing a Belgian licensed agent who has lodged a complaint with the European Commission over UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. This season is the first since the rules were introduced and they will come more fully into force in 2014. They give UEFA sweeping powers, including exclusion from the lucrative Champions League, to punish financially recalcitrant clubs. The regulations are designed to prevent big spending clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses. However the complaint argues UEFA's ""break-even rule"" restricts competition -- a key principle of European Law -- and will reduce the number of transfers. That could potentially lower players' salaries -- and by implication agents' fees -- prompting Belgian agent Daniel Striani to lodge the complaint with the Commission. Unlike ""super agent"" Jorge Mendes, who represents Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho and forward Cristiano Ronaldo, Striani specialises in looking after the interests of a number of young players entering the professional game. His two most high-profile players are Yohan Benalouane at Parma in Italy and Denis Odoi at Belgian club Anderlecht. ""The ""break-even"" rule also infringes other EU fundamental freedoms: free movement of capital (as far as club owners are concerned), free movement of workers (players) and free movement of services (player agents),"" said the statement issued by Striani and Dupont. However UEFA expects the Commission to reject the complaint given the support it has received from a number of European bodies as well as clubs ahead of the new regulations' introduction. ""The European Commission, the European Parliament, the European clubs, leagues and players' union have all been fully supportive of FFP and have on many occasions commented positively on this UEFA initiative,"" said the European governing body in a statement to CNN. ""As is well known, the UEFA rules encourage clubs to 'live within their own means', which is a sound economic principle aiming to guarantee the long-term sustainability and viability of European football. ""UEFA believes that FFP is fully in line with EU law and is confident that the European Commission will reject this complaint."" In December, Malaga were handed a season-long ban from UEFA club competitions after falling foul of FFP. Any ban would come into place over any of the next four seasons should they qualify to play in Europe. Malaga, who were the first high-profile club to be punished under new tougher FFP rules, owed player wages and have debts with other football sides as well as the Spanish tax authorities, claim UEFA. However the Spanish club have lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport against UEFA's decision with a hearing set for May 14 and decision expected sometime in June. ""It is important to note this complaint does not at all question the legality of the UEFA rule (also included in the FFP regulations) that states that any club participating in the UEFA competition must prove -- before the start of the competition -- that it has no overdue payables towards clubs, players and social/tax authorities,"" said the Striani and Dupont statement. ""In our view, this rule is justified in principle for the attainment of the integrity of the football competition and proportionate to this objective."" Striani contacted compatriot Dupont, who is based in Barcelona, after the Belgian lawyer wrote in the Wall Street Journal about his opposition to FFP in March. ""Some of Europe's biggest clubs are, unsurprisingly, the loudest supporters of rules that entrench their dominance,"" wrote Dupont in March. ""The time is right for a strong reminder from the EU's antitrust authorities that football, like any other multi billion-euro industry, must comply with the law."" Dupont added that in a letter dated March 12, 2012, competition chief Joaquin Almunia had wrote to UEFA President Michel Platini to say that he welcomed the ""break-even rule"", stating that ""this principle is also consistent with the aims and objectives of EU policy in the field of state aid."" The European Commission must now decide whether to uphold or reject the complaint from Striani and Dupont. If the complaint is rejected, the Belgian agent and lawyer could then appeal to the European Court of Justice. The process could take between one and three years. ""Any person or party -- as the English Football Association or the English Premier League or individual clubs -- who can prove an interest in the outcome of a case may apply to join into in the proceedings,"" said lawyer Guy Thomas of English firm Taylor Walton. ""It sounds like there will be a lot of potentially ""interested"" parties for this one,"" added Thomas. ""If they all try to get involved the proceeding could be delayed even longer.","Belgian agent lodges a complaint with the European Commission over UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules .

"(CNN) -- Police in Oakland, California, took a 43-year-old former student at a small religious college into custody Monday after a shooting spree at the school that left seven dead and three wounded, the city's police chief said. The motive behind the killings at Oikos University in East Oakland remained a mystery Monday night, Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told reporters. Detectives had not yet questioned the suspect, identified as One Goh, and no charges had been filed, he said. ""With a case of this magnitude, with all the victims and witnesses and all the chaos, it's going to take a few days to put the pieces together,"" Jordan said. The college, which caters to the Korean American Christian community, offers degrees in theology, music, nursing and Asian medicine, according to its website. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said most of the victims appeared to be from the city's Korean-American community, and the city was working to find multilingual counselors to help survivors. ""No American mayor wants to have this situation,"" she said. ""It seems over the last decade, we've gotten used to seeing senseless mass killings like this, and we'll have to question the availability of guns and the need for other services in our community."" What is Oikos University? Gunfire erupted inside the single-story building that houses the private Christian college about 10:30 a.m. A witness, Brian Snow, said he was at a nearby credit union when shots rang out, ""and it started getting chaotic."" ""In Oakland, sometimes things like that happen, but it dies over,"" he said. But this time, he said, ""I went outside and the cops were coming and like 'Don't move, don't move,' and it started getting chaotic ... a pedestrian came out with a bullet hole and I was like, 'Getting really crazy right now.' "" Lucas Garcia, who was teaching an English class at the college when the rampage began, told CNN affiliate KGO-TV that he counted about six gunshots from a nearby nursing classroom. Garcia said he heard someone yell, ""He's got a gun,"" and he got his students out of the building while the gunfire continued. Jordan said the relationship between the suspect and any of those shot remained unknown Monday night, as detectives combed over ""a very bloody scene with lots of evidence."" ""Initially, we were told he was in a classroom when he stood up and began shooting at the victims,"" Jordan said. Several of the survivors, including the wounded, hid behind locked doors or desks as the shooting went on. The suspect took one of the victims' cars and drove off, but surrendered to police at a Safeway grocery in the Oakland suburb of Alameda a short time later, Jordan said. California Gov. Jerry Brown, who served as Oakland's mayor from 1999 to 2007, called the killings ""shocking and sad."" ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their families and friends and the entire community affected by this senseless act of violence,"" Brown said in a statement issued by his office.

"(CNN) -- A joint session of Pakistan's parliament will meet Tuesday to discuss new terms of engagement with the United States, a spokesman for the country's prime minister told CNN on Saturday. The parliament will debate the recommendations of a special commission and will vote whether to accept them or not, spokesman Akram Shaheedi said. Amid huge domestic and military pressure after NATO airstrikes on the Pakistani-Afghan border killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last November, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani created the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, a group of 18 members of parliament responsible for reviewing relations with the United States. The committee forwarded its recommendations to the government about a month ago, and these will be debated Tuesday. ""We kept in mind both the angles, domestic demands and the requirement by the international community, while compiling our recommendations,"" Hiader Abbas Rizvi, a committee member, told CNN. ""We were optimistic, progressive, but of course patriotic Pakistanis at the end while we were compiling the recommendations."" Rizvi expects that the recommendations -- which won't be made public until Tuesday -- will be approved, but not before several days of debate. President Asif Ali Zardari, in an address to parliament Saturday, described 2011 as a ""challenging year"" in the ""multi-dimensional and important"" relationship between his country and the United States. ""We seek to engage meaningfully with the U.S. on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect,"" Zardari said. ""We are looking forward to your recommendations for re-engaging with the United States,"" said Zardari, referring to the parliamentary committee. Zardari's speech mostly focused on domestic issues, including energy and inflation. Opposition lawmakers shouted during the leader's speech and said, ""End the corruption!"" and ""Stop the lies!"" The president's supporters slapped their desks, a customary sign of support in parliament. After 20 minutes of protest, members of the opposition walked out.","President calls 2011 a ""challenging year"" for the two countries .

"New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Friday asked Congress to provide $60.4 billion for states affected by Superstorm Sandy. Obama's request, made in a letter, falls short of the total damage estimate in affected states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said last week the latest estimates of storm costs in his state were $36.8 billion, while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters the total cost in his state was $41 billion. In a joint statement Friday, Christie and Cuomo said they have been working with Obama, administration officials and congressional delegates on relief. ""Today's agreement on the administration's request to Congress would authorize more than $60 billion in funding that will enable our states to recover, repair, and rebuild better and stronger than before,"" they said. The money will go toward recovery, as well as preparing their states for future natural disasters, the governors said. Four Democratic senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, said the funding would be a start. ""There is a great deal of flexibility that better allows us to help homeowners, small businesses, hospitals, beach communities and localities rebuild, repair and protect themselves,"" they said in a statement. The four expressed concern, though, for what they were sure would be future requests for additional funds as their ""states' needs become more clear."" ""This is going to be a tough fight in the Congress given the fiscal cliff, and some members have not been friendly to disaster relief,"" their statement read. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, acknowledged the deficiency in the request, but emphasized the need for quick action by Congress. ""While the total funding request released by the White House today is not everything requested, we have always been realistic about the fiscal constraints facing the federal government,"" Bloomberg said. ""We need a full recovery package to be voted on in this session of Congress. Any delay will impede our recovery."" Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo, R-N.J., said Obama's request was not enough. ""I disagree with President Obama's decision to not fully request the funding the states of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut say they need to recover and rebuild from the unimaginable, widespread damage caused by Hurricane Sandy,"" LoBiondo said.","Administration seeks $60.4 billion for Sandy relief .

"New York (Cnnmoney.Com) -- Once again, the high-profile Cadillac Escalade SUV is the car that thieves love to steal, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute. Each year, 10.8 out of every 1,000 late-model Escalades get stolen, broken into, or have parts ripped off. That's the highest rate of theft claims of any vehicle in America. The Escalade has topped the list since 2002. You may have heard that a lot of Toyota Camrys get stolen. They do. But it's only 1.6 out of every thousand. The institute looked only at cars from the most recent three model years. These cars all have the latest anti-theft technologies, including engine immobilizers that prevent hot-wiring. ""That won't stop a determined thief from loading a car on a flat-bed truck,"" said Russ Rader, the institute's spokesman. Take a look at the most-stolen vehicles . According to the institute, the top-ten car-criminal favorites, along with their ""theft claim frequency"" per 1,000 vehicles, are: . 1. Cadillac Escalade 10.8 . 2. Chevrolet Silverado 8.0 . 3.

This list excludes medium-duty work trucks, such as the Ford F-250. It also excludes the Dodge Charger Hemi, which the institute counted as a separate model with a theft rate of 7.1.

"(CNN) -- The last few years when he has played at his home grand slam, the Australian Open, Lleyton Hewitt has been asked: When are you going to retire? The former No. 1 has been hit hard by injuries in recent campaigns, undergoing multiple hip operations and another procedure to mend a foot, so it's not the silliest question. Hewitt perennially replies that he still thinks he can compete with the best players in the world when healthy -- or close to it. The feisty baseliner proved it Sunday when he beat his fellow 32-year-old, Roger Federer, 6-1 4-6 6-3 to win the Brisbane International. It was Hewitt's first title since downing Federer in Halle in 2010 and his first in Australia since Sydney nine years ago. The victory over the 17-time grand slam champion won't be enough to earn Hewitt a seeding at the Australian Open next week but once again he'll be a player the favorites want to avoid in the early rounds. ""Playing the best players in the world and finals of tournaments, always it's exciting,"" 60th-ranked Hewitt told the ATP's website. ""That's why you still play the game. ""For me, it was motivation enough just to try to get the win out there and obviously win another title. ""It's been a couple of years. So I was ready for the challenge today."" Federer, playing with a larger racket head this year in a bid to recapture old form, hadn't been broken en route to the final and struck 20 aces in the semifinals against Jeremy Chardy. But two-time grand slam winner Hewitt, a fine returner, broke the Swiss three times in the first set. Federer appeared to have taken control of the affair when he broke at 4-4 in the second but Hewitt grabbed an early break in the third and saved all seven break points he faced. Federer fell to 18-9 against Hewitt and has lost two of their last three encounters. ""I didn't play great today, which is a bit unfortunate,"" Federer said. ""But also Lleyton was the best player I played this week. ""He made it toughest on me. I have a clear idea what I need to work on, and I have a clear idea where my mind and body is at."" Both men will now spend the next week preparing for the year's first major. ""I'm very hungry and eager to attack the Australian Open,"" said Federer.

"(CNN) -- It's time for Chris Christie to come clean. At a dramatic press conference last week, the New Jersey governor tried to apologize and said he had no advance knowledge of the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge. But he came across mostly upset that his senior staff had lied to him instead of upset that the citizens of Fort Lee, New Jersey, suffered during days-long politically motivated gridlock. Plus, no amount of talking would mute the lingering questions: Even if Christie hadn't ordered the lane closings (a significant and still-to-be verified if), why wasn't he at least digging into the truth of the story in October and November, when the press and state legislators certainly were? Saying he just didn't know just doesn't seem credible. At worst, Christie seems like a bully who ordered or inspired his staff to punish political opponents. At best, Christie seems like a passive leader who doesn't have a handle on his top staff. Either way, Christie is taking a hit; as a new poll shows, Christie's approval rating among New Jersey voters has fallen from 65% to 59% in one month. Moreover, the incident has taken a toll on his personal reputation. A year ago, 70% of New Jerseyans held a favorable personal impression of Christie. Today, that number is just 44%. And cementing the sense that Christie hasn't told the full story, 51% of New Jerseyans said they believe Christie hasn't been completely honest yet about what he knows about the bridge closings. Adding to Christie's woes and image problems is news, first reported by CNN, that federal investigators are looking into whether the governor improperly used $25 million in Hurricane Sandy relief on a tourism marketing campaign that featured Christie and his family. The ads ran in the lead-up to the 2013 election, in which Christie successfully sought a second term. At the time, Democrats skewered the ads, as did some Republicans. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, like Christie considered a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, said in November, ""That's a real problem and that's why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayers' money wisely, they're offended to see our money spent on political ads. That's just offensive."" Of course, to New Jersey's hurricane victims, many of whom are still living in trailers and 75% of whom feel forgotten by the recovery, describing Christie using aid money as his personal slush fund as ""offensive"" is an understatement. Meanwhile, just 15% of federal aid for Hurricane Sandy had actually been spent as of last fall. And that's just what we know now. Ironically for Christie, scandals are like gathering storms that tend to gain momentum and sweep up everything in their path. In addition to previously reported stories about Chris Christie's bullying political persona, this week more New Jersey mayors came out of the woodwork to allege that the Christie administration retaliated against them for not endorsing his re-election. According to the Wall Street Journal, after declining to endorse Christie, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop found he was no longer able to get meetings with state commissioners to address key governance issues. Fulop's name came up in the cache of e-mails recently released on the Fort Lee scandal. The day of the lane closings, when Christie's deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly e-mailed Port Authority appointee David Wildstein to ask if Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's complaints had been responded to, Wildstein wrote back, ""Radio silence. His name comes right after Mayor Fulop."" Mayor Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken said she has also suspected retribution from the Christie administration after she did not endorse the governor for re-election. Zimmer said she believes her city received less post-Sandy storm preparation funding because of her lack of endorsement. Meanwhile, more e-mails and documents are coming out about the bridge scandal, implicating other members of Christie's senior staff and at least suggesting they knew about the alleged retribution scheme, or perhaps were more involved. That makes it even more far-fetched to imagine that Christie really only learned the truth a few days ago. The media started sniffing around about political motivations for the bridge closures in mid-September. By mid-November, the State Assembly was convening hearings. By mid-December, Wildstein and Bill Baroni, Christie's top appointees at the Port Authority, had both resigned over the growing scandal. Why did Christie finally ask his staff for the facts around the lane closures a few weeks ago? Was Chris Christie stuck in traffic for three months? Did he willfully rip the rear view mirrors off and put on blinders? NBC's Chuck Todd said that watching Christie try to defend himself was reminiscent of Bill Clinton's denying his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Indeed, the analogy is that Clinton was handicapped from the get-go by the common knowledge that he was a philandering cad, just as many New Jerseyans and voters across the country find it hard to believe that a governor known for being a political bully had absolutely nothing to do with the bridge scandal. Chris Christie built his political career with a reputation for directness. But increasingly, it seems as though he has something to hide. And so the questions will keep mounting until Christie comes clean. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn says Chris Christie needs to go further in commenting on bridge scandal .

"Washington (CNN) -- Which would bother you more? 1) Finding a notice in your luggage saying it was searched by federal authorities? Or, 2) Finding an inspection notice, but learning that no one had actually bothered to search it? It was the second scenario that led to last year's firing of 36 Transportation Security Administration screeners at Honolulu International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security's independent inspector general announced Tuesday that a whistle-blower triggered investigations when he came forward with video showing some TSA officers skirting procedures. ""Among other things, the (video showed screeners) opening bags, placing notices of inspection inside and transporting them back to the airline without screening them,"" read a report from the inspector general. Thousands of bags went on commercial jets unscreened, risking the safety of the traveling public, the report said. TSA reprimands Boston bag screeners over job performance . The video, shot in the overseas terminal at the Honolulu airport in December 2010, resulted in two investigations. The first, by the TSA's Office of Inspection, concluded that thousands of bags went unscreened between September and December 2010. The TSA fired 36 officers, including the highest-ranked TSA official at the airport, and disciplined a dozen others. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill requested the second investigation, which was conducted by the inspector general, to see if the blame extended beyond officials in Honolulu. The inspector general's investigation concluded that while screeners in Honolulu were responsible for screening bags, the situation ""might not have occurred"" if TSA leaders had provided better oversight, adequate staff and screening equipment, and had more thoroughly evaluated protocols before changing them. The inspector general said the agency should have tested protocols at large airports, instead of just small airports, before implementing them. And it said that since the TSA granted flexibility to screeners during busy, crunch periods, screeners ""could have inferred"" that alternate procedures were acceptable at all times. The TSA protested the conclusions. ""The manner in which (protocols) were developed had nothing to do with the (Honolulu) officer's failure to properly follow"" procedures, the TSA said in a prepared statement. ""TSA's investigation revealed that Checked Baggage Screening SOP violations became almost normal practice ... and at times some (Honolulu) officers were not screening any bags at all."" Lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday sided with the inspector general, saying the report showed flaws that extended beyond Honolulu. TSA behavior detection officers will be retrained after profiling complaints . ""This report and one TSA fiasco after another have demonstrated that this isn't the problem of a few bad apples. There are system-wide problems with this massive bureaucracy,"" Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican, said in a written statement. Wrote Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi: ""I am concerned that there is a disconnect between our TSOs (screeners) on the frontline and those at TSA headquarters who create policy and protocols."" In its statement, the TSA said it took actions to address the problems. It has conducted a review of supervisors' job duties, launched a new training course for supervisors and will work to create protocols to use when modifying standard operating procedures. It also has begun to develop measures to evaluate the supervision of checked baggage areas, it said.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A jellyfish sting has stopped an Australian endurance swimmer, just 11 hours into her attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida. Chloe McCardel was forced to end her journey prematurely ""due to a severe debilitating jellyfish sting,"" a spokesman said in a statement. The swimmer was on a boat heading toward Key West on Wednesday night, spokesman Tim Stackpool said. ""She will spend the next 24 hours recuperating before deciding on her plans going forward,"" he said. Earlier Wednesday, McCardel -- slathered in a thick coat of sunscreen -- lept into the waters off Havana to begin her daunting 100-mile swim across the Florida Straits. Her goal was to set a world record for the longest unassisted swim. Before diving in, McCardel said she expected her marathon swim through shark- and jellyfish-infested waters to take 60 hours. ""I think it will all work out well,"" said McCardel, 28. ""It will be tough though; it's not going to be an easy ride. But we will get through it as a team."" The attempt cost around $150,000 to finance, McCardel said earlier. She said she hoped to raise money for cancer research and try to improve U.S.-Cuba relations. Each stroke the Australian swimmer took was monitored by teammates in two boats escorting her and by scientists at three universities in the United States. But other than liquid meals handed to her in a bottle every half-hour by a kayacker paddling near her, McCardel said she would not receive help during the long-distance swim and not use any swim aids such as flippers or a wet suit. In 1997, fellow Australian Susie Maroney swam the straits from inside a shark cage. Since then, several high-profile attempts to cross the Florida Straits without a shark cage have been attempted. All have failed. McCardel said she would use ""a shark shield"" device that emits an electromagnetic pulse to keep away hungry predators. But forgoing a full body suit made her more exposed to jellyfish stings. Diana Nyad abandons swim after storm, jellyfish stings . CNN's Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of clicks per minute. More than 23,000 reader comments, with the counter spinning like an odometer in a ""Fast and Furious"" movie. With 45 murders a day in the United States and about one a minute worldwide, why have so many of us fastened on this one? Why do we care so much about the shooting death of someone for texting during a movie? It's clear from the headlines why the media are featuring the story: It's not just a fatal shooting. It's a fatal shooting over texting. As a crime story, it would be confined to the local Tampa paper. As an Internet story, readers can't look away. We're reading it because we think it tells us something about an issue we already care about. You can see this in the comments of people reading online articles about it. For some people, it's proof that the texting has gone too far. For others it's a lesson about gun control. Others use it to decry the loss of civility. That's how we take the story. But what does it actually tell us? That some people habitually text too much? We already knew that, but it's not clear at all that the victim, Chad Oulson, was one of those people. Maybe his 3-year-old had a question or just needed to hear from her dad. That some people are thoughtless about how what they're doing affects the people around them? We already knew that, although it could be that Oulson thought his texting was unobtrusive or was urgent enough to override the concerns of those he was disturbing. That the norms for Internet use are not yet fully agreed upon by everyone? We already knew that, although maybe the gunman was provoked not by the rudeness of Internet users but by what he perceived as the general rudeness of those who unwrap crinkly candies, talk back to the screen and whisper about what's about to happen. The truth is, I fear, that although we receive news of this horrible incident as evidence of something, there's really nothing to learn from it -- or from other individual events that are supposed to prove a point -- for two reasons. First, lots of people are rude in theaters without getting shot. So, we'd need to know what made this case different. Was the texter unusually persistent or obnoxious? Was he in a bad mood because his 3-year-old needed something from him, because he thought previews count as advertisements and thus can be disrupted? And why would this provoke someone to shoot him? Was the shooter mentally unstable? On bad meds? Convinced that this would send a message to texters everywhere? To understand this story, we would need to know the specifics -- why this texter got shot this time -- because humans don't act for general reasons. But, as we understand the specifics, the scope of what we learn decreases. This becomes less an example of, say, the push-back against the Internet than a story about particular people in a particular circumstance. The more specific the details, the less you can generalize from it. That holds not just for this story but for every time the media present a dramatic event in the life of individuals. Choosing to take something as evidence of what we already believe is the opposite of evidence. ""Man shoots texter"" is not evidence of a larger societal trend unless it is well-researched and part of a much larger, systematically gathered set of data. There would be no harm done, except stories like this actually get in the way of our learning something new. They encourage us to go ""Tsk,"" and sadly shake our heads as if one of our beliefs has yet again been shown to be right, because that's how we've chosen to construe it. In short, we learn nothing from stories like these except which narratives the media think will get us to pay attention, and which narratives actually do. But this killing is not a lesson. It is just a tragedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Weinberger.","David Weinberger: Media, readers riveted by story of shooting of texter in theater .
He says we look only because it raises issues people care about: guns, civility, texting .
As we learn particulars, story sheds ever less light on those broader issues, he says .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez committed his ""long term"" future to Liverpool Friday by signing a new four-and-a-half year deal with the English Premier League giants. The 26-year-old Uruguayan international has bagged a league-leading 17 goals in 11 EPL starts this season to lead Liverpool's title challenge. Suarez was the subject of two bids in the last transfer window from Arsenal, who currently top the standings, two points clear of second-placed Liverpool. But after his superb start to the current campaign he has chosen to extend his current contract, which was due to expire in 2016. ""I am delighted to have agreed a new deal with Liverpool and have my future secured for the long term,"" Suarez told Liverpool's official website. ""We have some great players and the team is growing and improving all the time. I believe I can achieve the ambitions of winning trophies and playing at the very highest level with Liverpool. My aim is to help get us there as quickly as possible,"" he added. Manager Brendan Rodgers was naturally delighted to persuade Suarez to sign on the dotted line, with the striker integral to his plans for the club. ""Luis is a world-class talent and securing his services is crucial for what we are trying to achieve here,"" he said. ""What's most important and most exciting is that, at just 26 years old, his best years are still ahead of him and we now know we'll be seeing him reach that potential in a Liverpool shirt."" Suarez was signed by then Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish from Ajax Amsterdam in January 2011 and immediately impressed observers. But his time on Merseyside has also been marked by two highly controversial incidents, resulting in lengthy bans. He was found guilty by the English Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra at a match in October 2011 and given an eight-game suspension. At the end of last season, Suarez appeared to bite Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in an EPL game at Anfield and was banned for 10 games by the FA for violent conduct. With Suarez set to miss out on the start of the new EPL campaign and reportedly wanting to leave Liverpool, Arsenal tabled a record bid of Â£40 million ($65.38 million) plus Â£1 bid, designed to invoke the exit clause in his contract. It was rejected by Liverpool, who proceeded to make a strong start to the season, boosted by the eventual return of Suarez in late September after his ban. He has acquired hero status with the Liverpool fans -- desperate for success after seeing arch-rivals Manchester United take over as the most successful club in English football. Suarez said their support had ""influenced his decision."" Suarez, who is expected to star for Uruguay in next year's World Cup where they will meet England in the group stages, added: ""We have a special relationship; they have love for me and in return I love them back.""","Luis Suarez signs new deal at English Premier League Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- A twisted boardwalk, a glowing carousel flooded with water and a cresting river breaching its banks. These are among the memorable images from Superstorm Sandy, but they weren't taken with fancy cameras -- they were shot with smartphones and immediately seen around the world via photography app Instagram. On the day the storm came ashore, users shared 800,000 images tagged #Sandy on Instagram. At one point, Instagram reported people were posting 10 Sandy photos per second on October 29, 2012. ""During Hurricane Sandy, we saw people along the Atlantic Coast using Instagram to document how the storm was affecting their communities, and to let loved ones know they were OK,"" Instagram founder Kevin Systrom told CNN this week. ""As Sandy made landfall, we saw photojournalists like Ben Lowy documenting in real time the storm's path of destruction. In the immediate aftermath, we saw local residents like Steph Goralnick sharing images that humanized the relief efforts in some of the hardest-hit communities like Rockaway Beach."" Goralnick: Let's not forget Superstorm Sandy's victims . Instagram reached a saturation point as Sandy hit, and the platform became a storytelling medium for the storm. After that watershed moment a year ago, it seemed apropos to do an Instagram-only project for CNN's anniversary coverage. Instagram friends Tim Lampe and Keith Weaver visited families in some of the hardest-hit areas, photographed intimate portraits of people and their new homes and highlighted the rebuilding efforts along the coast. Lampe is the manager of CNN's Instagram account, and Weaver is an Atlanta photographer. CNN sent Lampe back to New York, armed with an iPhone, and the full experience was only for the Instagram audience. He has 28,000 followers on his personal account and is one of CNN's in-house experts on the platform. Here's what Lampe had to say about this storytelling experiment. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN has never done an original photo and video series housed on Instagram. Why did you choose the Sandy anniversary to embark on this Instagram-only project? Lampe: Sandy itself was the biggest event Instagram had ever seen. Everything unfolded there. My personal experience was that I grew up in the area, and I knew a lot of people who were documenting it on Instagram. The mentality of a big organization like this is that these stories and these photos need to be in a lot of places. We put these stories together exclusively for Instagram, just for that platform, because we saw a lot of value in it. Time magazine photographers ditched their professional cameras for mobile phones to tell the story of Sandy last year. What is your take on news outlets using the storytelling medium of the average person? And, who's doing it well? Lampe: Instagram is a great spot for everyday stories. It started with just seeing what our own people were doing in the field. We have correspondents and producers out in really cool places across the world documenting everyday stories. For example, Patrick Oppmann, our correspondent in Cuba, is documenting stories in Cuba that nobody else is doing. It's not always something that fits in broadcast, but there's a lot of value in seeing that continuing story in Instagram. I like The New Yorker. Almost every week, they let someone take over their Instagram and document where they are, whether they're documenting something as simple as a small town in the U.S. or a war zone in a different country, where life is very different. Looking back at the Instagram images from Superstorm Sandy, there were compelling, verified ones but also false ones. How can we tease out the real from the fake? Lampe: The way that we currently feature images on the CNN account, we're only featuring stuff from CNN folks across the world and featuring images from CNN iReporters. If we're featuring citizen photos, we're going to the team behind CNN iReport and trusting how they verify photographs and stories. Location is one thing to help us verify photos. You can't falsely tag something that's geotagged on Instagram. Seeing the people who it's from is also helpful. If you look at their account if there's a genuine love for storytelling, you can see it in the everyday stories they tell. There's a consistency in how they shoot and tell stories. But with a suspicious account, you can tell because they're posting photos of various quality. Their feed isn't consistent. Some journalism experts say it's not the camera you have, but how you use it that's important. How do you use the phone's camera to your advantage? Lampe: For me, what I love about the mobile phone camera is this fixed-lens mentality. It has its own set of challenges. One of the best things about Instagram is that because of the challenges of shooting on mobile, people look to tell stories differently than they would with a traditional photo outlet. With this project, we did some things that have become popular on the platform. For example, the ""dear portrait"" is when you hold up a physical photo from the past in a current location. You try to line it up with what's there. You only get one photo or video to tell a story per Instagram post. What are some of the ways to tell long-form stories in this format? Lampe: It seems like because Instagram allows you to post as much as you want that you should post everything that you have. What works best is the idea of restraint: Which photos tell or continue your story the best way. I think portraits tell a story really well even if people don't read the caption below. For example, with the stories from Sandy, I was amazed that when I took peoples' portraits, you could see almost the whole experience of the year in their eyes. I didn't see that until I went back and reviewed the photos. This is the first of many long-form stories we're going to tell on Instagram. It's a huge success on the Instagram platform. We've got a lot of great engagement and would love to be able to tell another set of stories like this again. What are the limitations of working with such a small photo as a storytelling format? Lampe: It's probably the detail because with Instagram, when you're going to take portraits, you want to get close. With the square format, what is in the center is the focus, so you center the persons' eyes and face in the photo. There's no ability to zoom in and out on a photo, so you're presenting what you can in the space give to you. On social media, the tendency is to keep things short, yet you often write long captions on your Instagram posts. What's your rationale for long captions? Lampe: I start long and I reduce, reduce, reduce until I get to the story that needs to be told. From my previous experience in telling long stories on Instagram, I realized people read through the long captions based on the comments they left. The people who follow the CNN account are trained to read the caption, whereas on personal accounts, people see the long caption and are turned away. Fill in the blank: Storytelling magic happens when _______. Lampe: Storytelling magic happens when the subject is at its most comfortable, and you get their best story. The reason why some of these stories were so honest and so true was because they didn't feel like this huge media outlet was on them. They had the freedom to tell their whole story. We did our best to stay true to the stories.","For Sandy's anniversary, CNN tried an Instagram-only project .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ronald Reagan, shot and wounded by John Hinckley Jr., on March 30, 1981, was the ninth American president, in or out of office, to be the target of an assassination attempt since the Civil War. Four presidents were killed. Will Hinckley go free? 1865: Abraham Lincoln was murdered at Ford's Theatre in Washington by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth, who was tracked down hiding on a Virginia tobacco farm 12 days later and was shot to death trying to escape. Four co-conspirators, including a woman, were hanged three months later. 1881: James Garfield, only four months in office, was shot at a railway station in Washington by disappointed office-seeker Charles Guiteau. Garfield died 11 weeks later. Guiteau was convicted and hanged within the year. 1901: William McKinley was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, and died eight days later. Czolgosz was convicted only nine days after McKinley's death and was electrocuted the next month. 1912: Ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, who had succeeded McKinley in office, was making a campaign speech as the Bull Moose Party nominee in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, when he was shot and wounded by a New York saloon keeper, John Schrank, who was committed to a mental institution where he died 30 years later. Teddy Roosevelt finished the speech and lived the rest of his life with the bullet still inside his body. 1933: President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt survived unscathed when five shots were fired by Guiseppe Zangara in Miami, Florida, but Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, standing next to Roosevelt, was killed. Zangara pleaded guilty and was electrocuted less than five weeks later. His last words: ""Push the button."" 1950: Harry Truman, staying at Blair House while the White House was being remodeled, looked out the window as two Puerto Rican nationalists tried to storm the residence. A White House policeman and one of the attackers were killed, the other was to be executed, but Truman commuted his sentence to life, and President Carter eventually freed the gunman after almost 30 years in prison. 1963: John F. Kennedy was shot and killed by Lee Harvey Oswald as he was riding through the streets of Dallas. Oswald killed a Dallas policeman later that day in a nearby movie theater. Two days later, after police had arrested Oswald, he was shot to death by nightclub operator Jack Ruby as police led him through the Dallas Police garage. 1975: Gerald Ford was twice the target of assassination attempts. Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, a member of the infamous late 1960s ""family"" of convicted killer Charles Manson, was stopped by a Secret Service agent before she could fire during an event in Sacramento, California. Seventeen days later in San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore fired at Ford but missed when a bystander grabbed her arm. Fromme spent 34 years in prison, Moore served 32.

"(CNN) -- His name has been passed down for eight generations. It's steeped in tradition and family pride. Oh -- but he's not the royal baby. He's William John Kane VIII, a database specialist from Portland, Oregon. Kane is used to laughs and incredulous looks when he mentions his name. But the random guy at a bar who sang his name to the tune of ""I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am"" stands out among the bad jokes. ""It was funny for the first half-hour, and then the more he drank the louder he got,"" said Kane, 38. Despite the hecklers, Kane says he is proud of his name and the tradition it bears. ""I feel a modicum of responsibility, the pressure of carrying on this torch that has been passed to me, and passing it onto another generation,"" he said. Tradition also played a large role in how Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, named their son, Prince George Alexander Louis. The royal baby shares a name with some impressive ancestors -- there have been six King Georges, the most recent the current queen's father. The British royal family tends to pick traditional names, usually referencing monarchs of the past. It's expected of royalty, but what's the point of passing down a name when you're an average Joe? George or Alexander? Parents are often tempted to name their child after a family member or a childhood friend because of the positive connotations they have with a name, says UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian. But Mehrabian, who has studied how people perceive names, argues it's too personal of an approach. He tells parents to consider how an average person would respond to a name. He has crafted a system for rating a name's attractiveness based on whether people perceive someone with that name to be caring, loyal, humorous, adventurous, successful or to have other traits. It's all based on what impression a name makes before you meet a person, he says. Take George, for example. It's an ""established name,"" Mehrabian said, but ""there are names with a lot more positive connotations."" The name scores 36 on scale of one to 100. Alexander, on the other hand, gets a 92. ""Maybe at some point he'll be called Alexander,"" Mehrabian surmised of the young prince. Prince George and other royalty are typically bestowed with a long string of names. Take his uncle, Prince Harry, whose real name is Prince Henry Charles Albert David. He doesn't go by his given name. Related: See the royal family tree . Cases like these are exactly why Mehrabian reminds parents of the practical purpose of a name: It identifies a person. ""It kind of defeats the most fundamental function of naming when you name the child after the father, grandfather and great-grandfather,"" he said. When names cause confusion . William John Kane VIII goes by two names. He's Will at work and John to family and friends. He switches seamlessly between ""personas,"" but admits it can cause confusion for others. Kane's double name almost cost him a diploma. ""Because I had William on the books and I went by John, half of my high school credits were in each name. I almost couldn't graduate because there were two records."" While that was a one-time mistake, Kane is frequently confused with his father, William John VII. It's caused some issues over the years, like getting partly blended credit reports and receiving an AARP card when he was 31. But there are some perks, he says, like the time he used his father's boarding pass so he could take his place at a wedding. Bonus: No ticket cancellation fees! Despite the modern-day inconveniences of sharing a name, the father-son duo say that seeing the name repeated in the family tree helps them stay connected with the past. ""Every once in a while you might think about where you came from and we want to have a place to grab a glance at your past,"" said Kane's dad, who goes by Bill. ""I feel that I need keep the name unblemished in honor of those who have carried it before me,"" he said. The younger Kane is proud of his name and says he would like to continue the tradition.

"London (CNN) -- A London court heard closing arguments Wednesday in the trial of two men accused of the brutal daylight killing of British soldier Lee Rigby. Judge Nigel Sweeney told jurors at the Old Bailey criminal court he expected them to retire to consider their verdict on Thursday morning. Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are accused of murder and attempted murder of a police officer. They have denied the charges. The prosecution says the suspects deliberately attacked an unarmed man from behind using a vehicle as a weapon, ""and then they murdered him and mutilated his body with a meat cleaver and knives."" The killing of Rigby outside the Woolwich Barracks in southeast London on May 22 shocked the nation. He left behind a wife and a young son. Closing arguments . Defense lawyers on Wednesday finished their closing arguments. Lawyer David Gottlieb referred to his client Adebolajo by his Islamic name, Mujahid Abu Hamza, describing him as intelligent, totally sincere in his beliefs and as someone who has shown ""absolute honesty and moral conviction."" While Adebolajo took to the stand earlier this month, Adebowale has not given evidence during the trial. His lawyer, Abbas Lakha, also referring to his client by his Islamic name, Ismael Abdullah, asked jury members to set aside their prejudice and emotion in this case. He echoed Adebolajo's testimony regarding their intent. When he was asked earlier this month what his defense to the charge of murder was, Adebolajo said: ""I am a soldier. I am a soldier of Allah."" Both defense lawyers argue that is not the same as intent to murder. Adebolajo had told the court he killed the soldier because he is fighting a war. ""I do not dispute I killed him,"" he said under cross-examination. In regard to the charge of attempted murder of a police officer, Lakha said both defendants intended to make police feel threatened because they wanted to be shot. The gun Adebowale aimed at police was not loaded; he knew that he would not be able to harm police, the lawyer said. He then played to the jury the CCTV footage of the moment the defendants were shot by police. ""Here is a man who knows he has an empty gun in his hand and cannot harm anyone,"" he said, . Lakha said a note that Adebolajo later handed to a bystander was a joint note and could be regarded as a suicide note as part of it read ""If I live beyond this day."" In its closing remarks on Tuesday, the prosecution described the attack as ""cowardly and callous,"" saying, ""Islam, one of the world's great religions, is not on trial.""","Defense lawyers give closing arguments .

"(CNN) -- When the head of the World Health Organization says a new virus is her ""greatest concern right now,"" people worldwide may wonder whether they should be concerned. This new coronavirus, which experts recently named MERS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first surfaced in Saudi Arabia in spring 2012. It's in the same family of viruses as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus) as well as the common cold -- but the new virus is not SARS. ""There's not the same level of concern as there was in Hong Kong or Toronto during the SARS epidemic,"" says Dr. Mark Denison, a professor of pediatrics and longtime coronavirus researcher at Vanderbilt University. Unlike SARS which sickened more than 8,000 people in 2003 and killed 773 worldwide, this new coronavirus does not spread easily between humans -- at least not yet. It's too early to tell whether MERS-CoV is going to spread or just burn out, so it's essential that health officials stay vigilant, Denison says. ""What's important is continued reporting of active cases which allows for better surveillance."" 5 things to know about new coronavirus . Should I be concerned about MERS-CoV? So far only 49 cases of MERS have been reported, including 27 deaths. Most of those were older men with other health problems. And most contracted the virus in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar. Cases have been reported in three European countries (United Kingdom, Germany, France) and Tunisia. But those cases had either traveled from the Middle East or in a few instances were infected through close contact with someone who recently returned from one of the above countries. As of now, if you haven't been to the Arabian Peninsula, your chance of a MERS infection is probably considerably less than 1%, or even zero, as all the cases have been linked to that region, says WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl. What researchers don't know is how many people may have had mild symptoms and never were reported. The more information scientists have, the more can be done to try to combat the disease. I recently returned from the Middle East. What signs should I look for? If you've traveled to the countries above and have cold-like symptoms which are getting worse, and you're having increasing difficulty breathing and a fever, you may want to see a doctor. It's important to tell your physician where you have been, so you can be tested for regular flu and other illnesses that can cause these symptoms as well as MERS-CoV. The WHO describes the common symptoms as acute, serious respiratory illness with fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. According to Hartl, the real worry is that patients will develop pneumonia -- most, although not all, of the cases have. Many have also had gastrointestinal problems including diarrhea. New virus takes more lives, spreads . What should I avoid? The original source of the infection is still a mystery, so health officials cannot tell you what to avoid to prevent getting this coronavirus. Researchers haven't identified any animal that may be carrying the virus. Early on in the SARS outbreak, an animal called the civet cat was implicated -- maybe unfairly, because bats were later implicated too. It's not known how the virus spreads between humans, be it droplets in the air from coughing or sneezing or touching contaminated surfaces, but WHO isn't ruling out contact with surfaces as a possible mechanism of transmission. It's also not known how long the virus can live outside the body. The SARS virus was shown to live as long as four days. Other viruses, such as HIV, lose their ability to be infectious within hours. How can I help my family? While there's no cure for MERS-CoV, there are things you can do to protect your loved ones -- the same measures you would take to prevent spreading the flu or other viruses. If you've recently returned from Middle East and aren't feeling well, stay home and avoid contact with babies and people who may already be sick. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze (tissue, sleeve or elbow, not your hands) and wash your hands frequently. There currently is no vaccine or treatment for MERS-CoV. A lot has been learned about new coronaviruses over the past 10 years by studying the SARS virus because the National Institutes of Health have continued to support research on it, Denison says, adding that he's hopeful that knowledge could be ""potentially applied towards vaccines,"" if MERS-CoV develops into a pandemic. New virus is a 'threat to the entire world'","If you haven't traveled to the Middle East, your chances of being infected are low .
There's not the same level of concern as seen with SARS, an expert says .
There is still much experts don't know about MERS-CoV ."
"Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) -- France established Tuesday its first strategic foothold in the Gulf, when President Nicolas Sarkozy opened a French military base in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. The new military presence, named the 'Peace Camp', will accommodate up to 500 French troops, and comprises a French facility at the Emirates' Al Dhafra air base. It can accommodate Mirage and Rafale jets and includes a naval base of about 20 acres at the port of Mina Zayed, which can handle any French naval vessel except aircraft carriers. There is also an army camp at Zayed, specializing in urban combat training, according to sources close to the government of UAE. ""Through this base -- the first in the Middle East -- France is ready to shoulder its responsibilities to ensure stability in this strategic region,"" said President Sarkozy. The Gulf is of geopolitical importance both because of its gas and oil resources and because of its proximity to Iran. Iranian authorities did not comment Tuesday but has previously voiced displeasure at the new French presence. Sarkozy, in an interview with the UAE's official news agency WAM, described the base as a ""concrete and strong testimony of our desire to stand, whatever might happen, at the side of the United Arab Emirates."" ""The permanent French military installation in Abu Dhabi shows the responsibility that France, as a global power, agrees to assume with its closest partners, in a region that is a fault line for the whole world,"" Sarkozy said. Analysts described the new French base, as ""small in size but an important step."" ""Today France manage to break the United States' long monopoly to the Gulf region, which is important for the whole world,"" Mustafa Al'alani, from the Dubai based, Gulf Research Center. He added that the base Peace Camp gives France a strategic position on the vital Gulf shipping corridor, which carries about 40 percent of the world's petroleum supplies, and therefore, must be protected."" The U.S. maintains the predominant foreign military presence in the Gulf, with key air bases and logistics operations, and its Fifth Fleet headquartered in Bahrain. U.S. officials were not reachable for comment Tuesday, but Fifth Fleet senior officials told CNN.com Arabic last year that they welcomed the step, and described it as an extra hand in combating piracy. The base is France's first new overseas outpost since the end of its colonial era 50 years ago and is small compared with its installation at Djibouti, on the Gulf of Aden. Djibouti remains the base for French warships on anti-piracy patrols. Paris and Abu Dhabi also updated bilateral defense accords that were signed in 1991 and 1995. Officials would not confirm their talks included the possible sale of 60 new Rafale jets to the UAE in a deal worth up to $11 billion. One senior UAE official said: ""We always discuss with friends possible deals, and France is on the top of the list."" The multi-role Rafale -- which has yet to find a foreign buyer -- could replace the Emirates' fleet of French Mirage 2000 combat planes. Sarkozy also discussed oil prices with the UAE officials - saying: ""Why don't we agree, producer countries and consumers, on general price guidelines to give to the market? I would say even a price range which would guarantee investments over the long term but which would not overwhelm consumer economies."" The other agreement signed Tuesday by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and his Emirati counterpart ""outlines a cooperation framework for the assessment and possible use of nuclear energy for peaceful ends,"" WAM said.","French President Nicolas Sarkozy opens military base in United Arab Emirates .

"Big Sur, California (CNN) -- A nearly uncontrollable 550-acre wildfire showed no mercy Tuesday and burned several homes in California's Big Sur, including the fire chief's. That twist wasn't lost on Fire Chief Martha Karstens of the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade. She oversees firefighters in a coastal wilderness renowned for its raw beauty. ""The irony doesn't escape me, and again, I try to set an example for fire clearance,"" Karstens told CNN. With severe drought conditions in the chaparral and timberland, the erratic fire was burning nearly uncontrollably, with only 5% of it contained, authorities said. Are you there? Stay safe, share your images . ""The situation was too much,"" Karstens said of the wildfire, whose growth potential was rated ""high"" by fire officials. ""I went out to fight a fire. I had my purse, my cell phone and my glasses, and I didn't know I was going to be trying to save my own home,"" she said. Firefighters have 36 hours to put out the fire before a weather system brings 30-mph gusts to Big Sur, which could energize and expand the wildfire, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""It's the wind that's going to get so very bad,"" Myers said. ""It's going to get ugly, and it's going to get ugly fast. ""This is going to be a big fire if we don't get it out in the next 36 hours,"" he said midday Tuesday. ""It's going to get tragically bigger."" Residences in the Pfeiffer Ridge community were evacuated. About 500 personnel were fighting the Pfeiffer Fire, which started about midnight Monday, and its cause is still being investigated, officials said. The Pacific Coast Highway, also known as California Highway 1, remained open in Big Sur, authorities said Tuesday. Almost all of California is in a severe or extreme drought, the National Drought Mitigation Center website says. The Big Sur area is listed as being in a severe drought, and cattlemen such as Dick Nock are struggling with an extreme drought just down the coast. Nock's rangeland along California's picturesque central coast usually shimmers in a green grass blanket in December, but not in this dry spell. ""Everywhere you look, it's just dirt. This is the worst drought I've ever seen in 80 years,"" he said. Nock recently thinned his herd from 400 to 200 cattle to save money. His livestock require expensive hay, he explained. San Luis Obispo and neighboring Santa Barbara counties have been tagged with ""extreme"" conditions. For example, the 5,000-acre Lake San Antonio in the San Luis Obispo County coastal mountains has shrunk to 5% of its capacity, closing boat ramps in October, officials said. Fire officials south of Big Sur are on alert for brush fires there, said Robert Lewin, the Cal Fire Chief for San Luis Obispo County. CNN's Dan Simon contributed from the Big Sur, and Paul Vercammen contributed from San Luis Obispo County. Michael Martinez wrote from Los Angeles.","NEW: The wildfire burns several houses, including the fire chief's .

"(CNN) -- When it came to promoting other women in politics, Margaret Thatcher was a disappointment. In fact, her main legacy for women was merely that she was a woman holding the position of prime minister for 11Â½ years. My son was 5 years old when Thatcher first won election as prime minister, the first woman to do so. By the time she left office, he was a young man of 17. He didn't remember a country with a male prime minister. As a feminist and women's rights campaigner who opposed many of Thatcher's policies, I am still trying to work out how I feel about her. As prime minister, Thatcher did almost nothing to promote women's rights actively, but at the same time, an entire generation grew up assuming it was normal to have a woman as prime minister. During Thatcher's tenure, I interviewed Sir Bernard Weatherill, speaker of the House of Commons, for a documentary I was working on. Weatherill told me an anecdote about his grandchildren, a boy and girl of around 8 and 11. The children were dressing up in the speaker's robes, ""playing Parliaments."" The speaker said he overheard his grandson say, ""I'll pretend to be prime minister."" His granddaughter retorted, ""Don't be silly, I'm going to be the prime minister -- only women can be prime ministers!"" A woman prime minister had become so much part of the British way of life that for two or three weeks after Thatcher left office the media had become so accustomed to referring to the prime minister as ""she"" and ""her"" that several times TV and radio journalists slipped up on air and had to correct themselves and refer to the incoming prime minister John Major as ""he"" and ""him."" In the early 1980s, I founded and led the all-party 300 GROUP campaign to get more women elected -- we had 43 branches in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Thatcher attended a couple of 300 GROUP functions and spoke in support of the campaign for more women in Parliament. At an event to unveil a plaque to Nancy Astor, the first woman MP to take her seat in Parliament, I heard Thatcher refer in her speech to the House of Commons as ""a dreadfully male-dominated place."" Such sentiments were the exception rather than the rule for her. I don't think she understood women's rights, and her record of appointing only one other woman to her Cabinet for a brief period was desperately disappointing. Thatcher had such command over her Conservative Party that if she had chosen to do so she could have advanced large numbers of qualified women into public and political posts. She chose not to do so. It was a missed opportunity. Once I was invited to lunch by former Prime Minister Edward Heath. Thatcher had defeated Heath to become head of the Conservative Party in 1975. Heath hated Thatcher. He never referred to her by name during lunch. Instead he referred to her as ""that woman."" He had invited seven of us as guests, including pop singer Bob Geldof. It was a sunny summer afternoon. We ate lunch out on the terrace of Heath's garden at his beautiful Georgian house in the country town of Salisbury, Wiltshire. Conversation ranged over Northern Ireland, European politics and music. Knowing about my work with the 300 GROUP campaign, he suddenly turned to me and bristling with anger said: ""I tell you one thing Lesley, you'll never see another woman prime minister in this country in your lifetime after 'that woman.' "" Margaret Thatcher triggered strong emotions for and against her. She presided over a ruthless era in British politics. The reactions on social media at the news of her death are a Molotov cocktail of people's views -- not just vitriol, but vicious, misogynist vocabulary from people who are quite reasonable and rational in other circumstances. Thatcher is well-known for her quotation of the Prayer of St Francis after her 1979 election victory. The prayer includes the lines, ""Where there is discord, may we bring harmony."" What she achieved was the precise opposite of this. So what will be the Thatcher legacy? I once asked the then-Chinese ambassador to London what legacy he thought Confucius left to modern China. He smiled. His reply? ""Too soon to tell."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lesley Abdela.","Lesley Abdela: Besides being prime minister, Thatcher did little to promote women in politics .
Abdela says a generation in Britain grew up knowing only a female prime minister .
She says like many, she feels ambivalence toward Thatcher, a divisive but influential leader .
Abdela: So powerful, she could have advanced women in politics but chose not to do so ."
