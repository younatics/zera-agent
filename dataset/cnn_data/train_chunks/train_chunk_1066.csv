"The father of an 11-year-old girl, who has not been seen since Saturday night, has made a heartfelt plea to his daughter to return home to her family. After an argument with a family member, Michelle Levy, wearing a party dress, left her home on Glenayr Avenue at North Bondi about 6.30pm. 'Please come home, we all miss you, we love you, we just want you to be safe,' Michelle's father Adam Levy said speaking to Nine News on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Michelle Levy was wearing this white party dress (pictured) with black, orange and yellow flowers and a black sash at the time of her disappearance . Adam Levy has pleaded with his daughter to come home, saying she is in no trouble but is greatly missed by the family . 'You're not in trouble ... just please come home as soon as possible everyone's very worried,' he pleaded. Following reports Michelle was spotted at Centennial Park on Saturday evening - about 4.5 kilometres or an hour walk from her home - the site was scoured all day Sunday. A police helicopter was hovering above the park on Sunday afternoon and police officers were looking in the bushes for the young girl. SES volunteers will finalise their search on Sunday evening and are expected to return to looking for Michelle in Bondi, a NSW Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. Jewish medical emergency response organisation Hatzolah have dozens of volunteers on the ground on Sunday night searching for missing Michelle. A spokeswoman confirmed there are teams of people walking the streets, speaking to people and knocking on doors in the hope of locating the girl. She also said they have set up headquarters on Flood Street in Bondi and are allocating search areas to groups of people wanting to help the search. Earlier on Sunday Mr Levy told Daily Mail Australia: 'Its been very challenging and heart-wrenching,' 'We all love her and everyone is worried about her - she doesn't need to worry about being in trouble.' Michelle was last seen leaving the family home on Glenayr Avenue at North Bondi about 6.30pm on Saturday, and was reportedly seen at Centennial Park later that evening . Mr Levy said although she had run off to her grandparent's house nearby a few times, the disappearance was out-of-character. 'She doesn't usually go further than the front wall,' he said. 'We assumed if she wasn't within the block that she was at her grandparents.' He described his daughter as a very intelligent child who often displayed stubborn traits. 'She's very bookish - she's a real book worm but that doesn't mean she doesn't do other things,' he said. He told Daily Mail Australia that he hoped Michelle was hiding out somewhere that the family were unaware of. Michelle had an argument with a family member before leaving the family home in North Bondi . Michelle had left the home on previous occasions but had always gone to another family member's house which she has not done on this particular occasion . Despite extensive searches of the area including CCTV footage from local businesses, SES workers scouring the North Bondi cliffs, police officers door knocking and speaking to her school and friends, she hasn’t been found. Michelle is described as being of Caucasian appearance, about 150cm tall, with a thin build. She has long red hair, blue eyes and freckles. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a white party dress with black, orange and yellow flowers and a black sash. Police and family are concerned for Michelle’s welfare due to her age and are urging anyone with information on her whereabouts to come forward. Despite extensive searches of the area including police officers door knocking and speaking to her school and friends, Michelle hasn’t been found .","Michelle Levy was last seen leaving the family home on Glenayr Avenue at North Bondi about 6.30pm on Saturday .

"A British woman arrested in Iran after attending a men's volleyball match has been jailed for a year. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was accused of 'propaganda against the regime'. The London graduate was detained as she and women's rights campaigners tried to enter the Azadi Stadium in Tehran to watch a volleyball game. Under Iran's strict Islamic laws, women are forbidden from mixing with male spectators at sporting events. Detained: Law graduate Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25 (right with her mother Susan, 49) was accused of 'propaganda against the regime' and jailed for a year by the Iranian authorities. She was detained as she and women's rights campaigners tried to enter the Azadi Stadium in Tehran to watch a volleyball game . Evidence: This is the photo, taken after the women were prevented from entering the match, which was used by the Iranian regime as supposed evidence of propaganda against the state. Miss Ghavami is circled . Miss Ghavami was released on bail but then arrested when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station a week later, when the authorities discovered she had dual British-Iranian citizenship. She was thrown into solitary confinement in Iran's notorious Evin political prison and was held for more than 100 days, including 41 days in solitary. Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said: 'This is an appalling verdict. 'It's an outrage that a young woman is being locked up simply for peacefully having her say about how women are discriminated against in Iran. 'Ghoncheh is a prisoner of conscience and the Iranian authorities should quash the sentence and release her immediately and unconditionally. 'The authorities should also investigate allegations that Ghoncheh was subjected to death threats by her interrogators and provide compensation for her arbitrary detention and her prolonged solitary confinement.' The family were not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial of Miss Ghavami (pictured) Amnesty also insists that the charge against Ghavami did not amount to an internationally-recognisable criminal offence and that she has been jailed solely for her peaceful activities to end discrimination against women. Iran's judiciary denies that the charges against Miss Ghavami are linked to her attempts to watch the Iran-Italy volleyball match in June. She is accused of 'propaganda against the regime' in the Islamic republic and a spokesman said the charge was linked to national security. Miss Ghavami, a law graduate from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, carried out a 14-day hunger strike in protest against her detention. Her mother Susan (left) told supporters: 'When they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face' Her British-born mother Susan, 49, wrote to her daughter's supporters on Facebook last month. Mrs Ghavami said: 'Before the commencement, when they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face and gave her as much comfort as I could in that brief time.' The family was not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial but Mrs Ghavami said they were allowed a brief and emotional family reunion once the session had finished. She said: 'All of us gathered together for 20 minutes, [the] first time in hundred something days. Ghoncheh kept kissing her grandfather who she hasn't seen for all these 109 days and kept weeping.' Mrs Ghavami, who met and married Iranian surgeon Houshang Azam Ghavami after moving to Iran, said she had hand-fed her daughter to assure herself that her hunger strike was over. The family has spoken of their fears for her health after saying she seemed pale and weak during a prison visit. Ms Ghavami, 25, has been held in solitary confinement at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison (pictured) Detained: Miss Ghavami was arrested after trying to watch a men's volleyball match at the Azadi Stadium . Protest: Social media campaigns have sprung up in a bid to pressurise Iran into releasing Miss Ghavami . Iran does not recognise dual nationality and views Miss Ghavami as an Iranian citizen, but Prime Minister David Cameron has raised her case with Iran's president Hassan Rouhani when the two leaders met last month. Speaking before the hearing, her brother Iman, 28, said Miss Ghavami had only been allowed to meet her lawyer two days before the trial. He said she travelled to Iran to work for a charity teaching literacy to street children. Mr Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, West London, said his sister had thought women were allowed to attend international volleyball matches and has called her arrest was 'a truly tragic misunderstanding'. A petition organised by the family has gathered more than 600,000 signatures and Mr Ghavami told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We want the authorities to know the whole world is watching.'","Law graduate Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, tried to watch match in capital Tehran .

"A group of Gambian diplomats used their embassy in London as a front for selling duty free tobacco in a £5million scam, a court heard. The Deputy Head of the Gambian Diplomatic Mission, Yusupha Bojang, 54, and his colleagues are accused of ordering 32 metric tonnes of tobacco in just three years. They abused a scheme which granted them a duty-free tax exemption on goods for personal use by using delivery drivers to send them more than half a million 50g pouches of rolling tobacco, Southwark Crown Court heard. Deputy Head of the Gambian Diplomatic Mission Yusupha Bojang (left) and First Secretary Gaston Sambou (right) allegedly used the embassy as a front to sell duty free tobacco . In some cases they were ordering tobacco worth more than their annual salary but there is no evidence the eight defendants even smoked, the court heard. Deliveries to the Gambian High Commission were usually taken and signed for by Audrey Leeward, 48, who sat on the front desk, it was said. Witness Christopher Pelc worked as a driver at the time of the allegations and delivered huge quantities of tobacco to the Mission in Kensington. He saw Leeward so often that she had a pet name for Mr Pelc, the court heard. Boxes crammed with pouches of Golden Virginia and Old Holborn tobacco, were collected by Mr Pelc on behalf of International Diplomatic Supplies Ltd (IDS). He collected the high-value tobacco from the London City Bond Warehouse in Tilbury, Essex, before driving it to the Mission and leaving it in a ‘back room’. Officials at the Embassy, in Kensington, central London, was often made orders worth more than their annual salary, Southwark Crown Court heard . There were ‘frequent occasions’ when neither IDS nor second supply company Chacalli De Decker could meet the Mission’s extraordinary orders for rolling tobacco, the court was told. Prosecutor Jane Bewsey QC said: ‘You are asked about the size of the boxes, if you look at where we can see that on this particular document [an order form] the Gambian Mission, it says 5 x 50... in total to satisfy this order this order was 10 boxes? ‘That’s correct,’ replied Mr Pelc. The order was for 1.25kg of tobacco and only made up one part of a larger list of requests for deliveries to the Mission in May 2010. Another driver said he saw queues of people at the premises who appeared to be purchasing pouches of tobacco, the jury was told. Over the three-year period the eight defendants - Bojang, First Secretary Gaston Sambou, 48, finance attache Ebrima John, 38, welfare officer Georgina Gomez, 29, Leeward, secretary Hasaintu Noah, 60, driver Veerahia Ramarajaha, 54, and Ida Njie, 42 - collectively ordered or were invoiced for in excess of 530,000 50g pouches, it is said. Ms Bewsey said there was ‘systematic abuse’ of the privileges granted to diplomatic missions and their staff based in the UK to order goods free from excise duty and VAT. The ‘commercial’ scale scam led to a loss to the taxpayer of just short of £4.8m over three years, jurors heard. 530,000 50g pouches of rolling tobacco were ordered to the Diplomatic Mission, the court was told . Four of the defendants - Bojang, Sambou, John and Gomez - were employed as diplomatic staff and were therefore entitled to enjoy the tax-break on goods such as alcohol, perfume and tobacco for personal use. Leeward, Noah and Ramarajaha were locally employed and therefore not entitled to the privileges. Njie was employed by the Gambian Tourist Authority whose offices were in the same building as the High Commission. She was not employed by the Gambian Mission and accordingly she should not have enjoyed any diplomatic privileges, the court heard. Jurors were told that diplomatic immunity did not apply in this case and all the defendants were subject to UK law. The purchase of the duty-free goods were permitted on forms authorised by the Head of Mission at the time, Elizabeth Harding. But in her absence, Bojang was permitted to sign off the purchases and authorised 31 forms for more than 21,000kg of tobacco. Sambou signed off 29 forms, covering more than 9,000kg, and John signed four, authorising more than 2,000kg of tobacco. ‘In monetary terms this equated to a loss to the UK revenue of duty and VAT not paid of just under £4.8m,’ said Ms Bewsey. The cost of the ‘commercial’ quantity orders made in the names if individual defendants often exceeded their annual salary, jurors heard. Ramarajaha denies conspiracy to cheat the public revenue and a further charge of harbouring dutiable goods. The seven other defendants all deny a single charge of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue. The trial continues.

"Boris Johnson claimed yesterday that he suffers from extremely poor eyesight and can barely see anything around the house without his glasses on.

Mr Johnson, 50, who is occasionally seen with spectacles on, is now the prospective MP for Uxbridge in West London. He also claimed to have ‘no idea’ why he had such a popular appeal among non-Conservatives. He eventually put it down to interacting with people while cycling around London, and to his self-deprecating appearances presenting Have I Got News for You on BBC1. As seen on TV: Mr Johnson also spoke of his self-deprecating appearances presenting Have I Got News for You . ‘I’ve been able to inveigle myself under people’s natural defences’, he said. Speaking to the Observer magazine, he also happily confessed to trying cannabis as a teenager but said ‘it didn’t do much for me’. He revealed that at university – he read Classics at Balliol College, Oxford - he had been offered a substance ‘that was alleged to be cocaine and I made an effort to try and ingest this substance, and I failed. It was a pitiably small amount anyway’, he said. ‘It later appeared that it might not have been cocaine, but rather icing sugar.’","Admits: 'I’m now so short-sighted, I’m blind!

"The BBC Breakfast programme might seem an unlikely time and place for a sex symbol to emerge. Yet it is attracting a whole new audience of red-blooded males – thanks to presenter Susanna Reid. Her increasingly racy choice of outfits has ensured a huge following for the curvaceous mother of three on Twitter and YouTube. Short skirts and plunging necklines are now wardrobe staples for Miss Reid, who is 41 today. And she is clearly delighted with the reaction they provoke. ‘It is always fantastic when people think you look good on air because frankly that is part of the job,’ she told the Mail. Scroll down for the video . YouTube favourite: Susanna in a mauve creation on December 9 (left) and on Breakfast on September 30 . Miss Reid insists she shops mostly online, normally pays around £50 for her outfits, and has not made a conscious effort to adopt a raunchier look. However her appearance yesterday in a low-cut mauve wrapover creation caused a chorus of approval on Twitter. One fan wrote: ‘I forgot to say how delicious Susanna Reid looking this morning’. Another commented: ‘Susanna Reid was looking spicy.’ A third added: ‘Yowza. No news is bad news when she’s reading it.’ Miss Reid added: ‘I have not made any particular special effort, but I don’t want to seem ungrateful because it is always nice to hear that people like what you are wearing. ‘Perhaps it is because I am approaching my birthday and I’m in a more celebratory mood. ‘I am not going to be coy, I do most of my shopping online. And at that time of the morning it is important we all make an effort to look colourful and cheerful.’ This week, Matt White tweeted: ‘Tell me the news Susanna Reid, and may I say, what a smashing blouse you’re wearing.’ Miss Reid also has videos dedicated to her on YouTube, with clips of her on BBC Breakfast. Some titles are too lewd to mention, and others are entitled ‘Susanna Reid in a tight black dress and silk shirt’, and ‘Susanna Reid stunning in frilly blue dress.’ Fanbase: Susanna Reid on July 8 (left) and September 9 (right). She has built up an impressive following on YouTube and Twitter thanks to her raunchy look . The newsreader has three young sons with her partner-of-12-years, former sports correspondent Dominic Cotton, who is now the communications director for charity UK Youth. The couple have three sons together, Sam, 10, Finn, seven, and six-year-old Jack. Last month, Miss Reid told the Mail that the boys will stay with their father in their south-east London home when BBC Breakfast moves to its new Salford studio – 200 miles north of its current home at BBC Television Centre in West London - and she takes over from Sian Williams. She admitted: ‘It’s a challenge for everybody. We’re not moving as a family. Dom’s work is in London. The children are at school there. ‘It’s going to mean a long commute for me but I can do it. The best trains take just over two hours. I’ll zip up there, sleep overnight, do the programme, come back to pick the children up from school and zip back. I’ll just stay over for a couple of nights a week.’ Although she is the main breadwinner of the family, she stressed that was not the reason for her move to Salford. She said: ‘We could survive. I could do other work. But I love working for Breakfast. I love the BBC. If you cut me open I’d have BBC written through me like a stick of rock. Also, the key to our whole family is that we share the parenting. Dominic cooks for the boys, reads bedtime stories and does the ironing and half the washing.’ Miss Reid then insisted: ‘I’ve said I’m going and I’m committed to it,’ she says. ‘It’s definitely going to work out. We’ll make sure it does.’",Presenter has gained a large fanbase on YouTube and Twitter .

The plane costs up to £35million and is the main fighter-bomber of the Navy - it was also deployed in the Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraq War in 2003 . The fighter planes will target IS fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, supply trucks and armed vehicles . IS has declared a so-called caliphate in the areas it has taken, and is also holding a number of hostages. Although currently limited to Iraq and Syria, IS has promised to 'break the borders' of Jordan and Lebanon and to 'free Palestine'. Countries participating: US, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates . Targets: Islamic State fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, a finance center, supply trucks and armed vehicles in the vicinity of Raqqa, Dayr az Zawr, Al-Hasakah and Abu Kamal . U.S. missiles: 47 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles launched from the USS Arleigh Burke and USS Philippine Sea, operating from international waters in the Red Sea and North Arabian Gulf . U.S. aircraft: Air Force B-1 bombers, F-15E attack planes, F-16 fighters and F-22 fighters; Navy F/A-18 fighters; two types of drone aircraft . Other strikes: The U.S. alone also conducted eight strikes against the al-Qaida-affiliated Khorasan Group west of Aleppo, including training camps, an explosives and munitions production facility, a communication building and command-and-control facilities .","Pictures show the F/A-18E Super Hornet in action as part of the US strikes to destroy terrorist group, ISIS .

"Men will be banned from visiting a waterfall at a lake being developed as a major tourist attraction in Malaysia. Terengganu is to rebrand Tasik Kenyir, the largest artificial lake in Southeast Asia, as women-only in a £54m development project. The move in the country's northeast would mean only women could transport guests to the waterfall by boat - and women security guards would be used to patrol the area. Tourism drive: One of Malaysia's waterfalls will be rebranded as women-only . It comes after a request from women tourists from West Asia, according to spokesman Datuk Seri Ahmad. He said banning men from one of the many waterfalls in the area was one of measures being taken to promote the lake, sprawled over 260sq-km, with 340 man-made islands, as a unique tourism attraction. The plans also include turning it into the first duty-free lake in the world. Under the redevelopment, several islands have already been completed, with work on a £12.6m jetty now underway. Stunning: Tasik Kenyir, in Terengganau, is part of a £54m redevelopment programme . Tourism attraction: Banning men from a waterfall in Tasik Kenyir is one of measures being taken to promote the lake . Ahmad said work on a new four-lane bridge, which would become the main link between Pengkalan Gawi and Pulau Poh Besar would begin soon. He added the island, which covers about 40 hectares, would also get two jetties, one for passengers and another for cargo. 'We will build a hotel, a water recreation park and a 1,000-bay car park as Pengkalan Gawi does not have a large space for parking,' he said. 'I am confident that Tasik Kenyir can draw the tourists and become a choice tourist destination in the future.' The Terengganu government, through Ketengah, is targeting about 500,000 tourists to the the lake, which last year attracted about 400,000 tourists.","Banning men from waterfall forms part of a £54m development plan .

"President Barack Obama will today meet with military leaders from some 20 countries and form a plan to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more. Some three weeks before U.S. congressional elections, Obama will aim to show the U.S. public and allies abroad that he is committed to 'degrade' and 'destroy' the group that has taken over large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Obama will attend a meeting led by General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with foreign defense chiefs at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington  to discuss the coalition's work. No major policy decisions are expected. President Barack Obama will today meet military chiefs from around the world to discuss plans to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more to stop the terrorist group . Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the meeting was part of 'ongoing efforts' to build the coalition and 'integrate the capabilities of each country into the broader strategy'. The strategy is being called into question. Referring to ISIS, Republican Senator John McCain said on Sunday that 'they're winning and we're not'. The United Nations said yesterday that fighting in Iraq's western Anbar province had forced up to 180,000 people to flee after ISIS, captured the city of Hit. Analysts have said it is very important Obama shows that he is committed to fighting ISIS . Anthony Cordesman, national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the fight against ISIS 'hasn't gone badly, but it certainly hadn't gone well'. He added that it was 'very important' that Obama had to show both Americans and other countries that he was 'committed' to the fight. Representatives from Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were expected to attend the meeting. Colonel Ed Thomas, Dempsey's spokesman, said the meeting was about :'Coming together in person to discuss the vision, the challenges, the way ahead.' Having Turkey at the table will be key. Ankara has come under some pressure to send its own ground troops into Syria against ISIS. The country could announce after the meeting that it will join Saudi Arabia in training moderate Syrian rebels, Mr Cordesman said. Turkey has not reached a new agreement to let the United States use its Incirlik air base in the fight against but reached an agreement with Washington on training Syrian rebels, sources at the Turkish prime minister's office said.","Barack Obama to meet with military chiefs from some 20 countries .

"A Dallas, Texas tour company has sparked outrage with the questionable placement of John F Kennedy's face on a bus. An image of the president, who was assassinated there in 1963, is plastered on the side of the bus next to the words 'BIG THINGS HAPPEN HERE.' A reporter for Dallas Magazine took a picture of the bus's decoration and posted them online, and writes that in addition 'there is the rather unfortunate placement of the bus’s back door handle in the center of Kennedy’s forehead.' Inappropriate? A Dallas Tour company has been criticized for one of their tour vehicles, which has an image of JFK on the side next to the words 'Big things happen here' President Kennedy died after being shot in the head by Lee Harvey Oswald, while driving through Dallas with his wife. Now the owner of the tour company says he's received death threats for what he calls an 'honest mistake'. Ricardo Hernandez had the bus wrapped about eight months ago, and says he never received a complaint before this week. History: President Kennedy was shot in the head while driving through Dallas with his wife in 1963. He died from a fatal head wound . 'I looked it over and I never connected them...It was just a coincidence, just an honest mistake,' Mr Hernandez told MailOnline. While Mr Hernandez has covered up the words next to the assassinated president't head, he says he doesn't plan to move the image itself from its current position. He says the president's head wouldn't fit anywhere else on the bus, and it's likely it will always be partially obstructed by some part of the vehicle. Hernandez says only one bus has the design pictured on dmagazine.com. Response: Tour company owner Ricardo Hernandez has now covered up the lettering on the side of the bus, but plans to keep Kennedy's head in the same position .",The owner of the company has since covered up the words 'Big things happen here' which appear next to the assassinated president's head .
"Lord Tebbit today warned disabled people could be put under pressure to ‘do the right thing’ and end their lives if the law is changed to allow the right to die. In a moving speech, the former Tory chairman revealed his wife – paralysed by the Brighton Bomb – had once told him ‘you’d be better off without me’. He said the comment illustrated the way in which a change to the law would put countless people under pressure to end their lives for the sake of their families. Scroll down for video . Lord Tebbit said his wife Margaret had been in constant pain for the last 30 years, since she was injured in the 1984 IRA Brighton bombing, and the pain was getting worse . He made his comments as peers debate a controversial private member’s bill put forward by Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor to give some terminally-ill patients the right to die. The proposed legislation would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally-ill patients judged to have six months or less to live who request it. It was given an unopposed second reading in July after a marathon 10-hour debate featuring nearly 130 speeches both for and against the move. Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, was one of those voting in favour – even though he has previously opposed the move. In a debate today, Lord Tebbit said there needed to be changes so that there was some ‘deterrence against wrongdoing’ – to stop people putting pressure on people to end their lives. ‘Supposing there is wrongdoing, how do we deter it? At the moment, if somebody wrongfully puts pressure on, or wrongfully assists, a suicide, they know that the law is there and that its hand may fall on their shoulder. An IRA bomb ripped through the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984, killing five people and injuring 31 . ‘I may be wrong but, as I see it, if we enacted these measures we would only be adding to the procedures, not to the deterrents against wrongdoing.’ He said his wife Margaret had been in constant pain for the last 30 years, since she was injured in the 1984 IRA Brighton bombing, and the pain was getting worse. ‘I fear for the day when she will say again to me what she said to me a little while ago: “You know, you would be better off without me”. ‘There are many ways in which pressure can be brought to bear to make people who are perhaps approaching the end of their lives—although I hope that my wife is not—to “do the decent thing”. ‘These amendments do not do anything to avoid that, and that is what worries me.’ Lord Tebbit said that unless there was deterrence, some people would do wrong – something he said had happened with abortion because doctors who pre-sign forms are never punished although it is against the law. ‘A number of doctors, quite wrongfully, signed chits, or whatever they are called, to allow sex-selective and frequently late abortion of patients whom they had never seen and whose names they did not know, have gone unpunished,’ he said. ‘Where is the deterrence to that?’ Peers were given extra time to make progress on a controversial backbench Bill giving some terminally-ill patients the right to die. Some 170 amendments to the legislation had been lain down. With only limited parliamentary time available for private members' legislation, supporters fear the amendments could scupper its chances. Opinion outside Parliament is sharply divided, with disability campaigners voicing concern today about the attempt to change the law on assisted dying, while supporters of change claimed opponents were determined to ‘strangle’ the legislation. Lord Tebbit, who was a Cabinet minister at the time of the attack, was photographed being carried from the wreckage of the blast 30 years ago . Labour's Lord Campbell-Savours said there were people who 'desperately want out'. Despite being ill for 31 years, such a course of action had not crossed his mind. 'But one day it may cross my mind and I want that right - and I don't want the courts to interfere in it,’ he said. Fertility expert and Labour peer Lord Winston said that with increasing numbers of distressed elderly people in hospital, it was vital to have the safeguards in Lord Pannick's amendment to protect society. 'It is essential we have some kind of legal process which ensures that this Bill is properly policed,' he said. 'It cannot be left to the medical and nursing profession to make their minds up.' Justice minister Lord Faulks said the issue was for Parliament to decide. The Government was taking a 'neutral' position and would allow a free vote if any of the amendments was pressed to a division. Lord Falconer said he agreed that the decision should not be left to doctors alone and that there was a place for judges to provide confidence in the proposed system. 'In principle, I think although it may deter some people, ultimately it will give greater protection,' he said. 'I accept ... there needs to be some degree of judicial oversight.' Peers backed an amendment adding judicial safeguards to the legislation. Under the change a High Court judge of the family division would have to be satisfied that the person seeking the right to die had a 'voluntary, clear, settled and informed wish to end' their life.","Tory peer warns disabled people could be urged to ‘do the right thing’

"By most accounts, 19-year-old Brittney Wood was with uncle Donnie Holland the night of May 30, 2012, the last time anyone saw her. Holland - who was under investigation for horrific sex crimes at the time - died from a bullet within days in what was ruled a suicide. The investigation that followed has publicly unraveled what authorities describe as a dark, twisted tale of perversion in the working-class neighborhoods and piney backwoods of coastal Alabama. Mystery: 19-year-old Brittney Wood, pictured with her daughter, vanished in May 2012. She is believed to have been involved in a sex ring that involved eight of her adult relatives and three family friends . Investigation: Donald Holland (left) committed suicide two days after Brittney was last seen while his son, Donald Paul Holland Jr, has been arrested in connection with the sex abuse allegations . Accused: Brittney's mother, Chessie Wood, is charged with two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12 . Eight of Woods' adult relatives and three family friends have been charged with dozens of felonies in two counties as the alleged members of an incestuous ring that authorities say shared children for group sex. Holland was the leader, prosecutors say, of what has been described as the largest sex ring ever uncovered in Alabama. Wood was a victim and likely key witness. 'Brittney could have been huge,' said prosecutor Teresa Heinz. 'She could have corroborated so many things.' Wood is presumed dead, but authorities haven't found a trace of her and no one is charged in her disappearance. Even without Wood to testify, two of her uncles and an older brother already have pleaded guilty to sex charges, and jurors this month convicted a friend of Holland's of multiple sex charges in the first trial. Others - including the missing teen's mother, Chessie Wood, and two aunts - await trial. Chessie Wood denies committing any crime, but says some of her closest relatives are guilty of abusing children, including of abusing her daughter. 'There are innocent people in this and there are guilty people in this,' Wood, 39, said in an interview. 'I don't know how the judicial system is going to figure it all out because they're not the sharpest tools in the shed.' Linked: William Brownlee (left), a friend of the Wood family, has also been charged, while Jennifer Moore, 32, became the 11th arrest in the case . Under suspicion: Brittney's uncle Dustin Kent is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl while the father allegedly looked on . Chessie Wood, accused of having sex with a young female relative, said she had no idea what was going on in the family until after her daughter's disappearance. 'The No. 1 thing here is to find Brittney. The No. 2 thing is to get all these sick (people) off the streets,' she said. Authorities are making plea-bargain offers and getting ready for more trials, but questions persist. Perhaps most troubling, why didn't child welfare workers pursue charges following what prosecutors describe as multiple complaints about sexual abuse within the family going back at least six years? 'You'd be surprised how many of them had prior allegations. Nothing happened,' said Heinz, an assistant district attorney in Baldwin County. 'You have to wonder what wouldn't have happened to these children if something had been done. And Brittney might still be alive.' The case is so big officials don't know exactly how many kids inside and outside the family might have been victimized; estimates range from 11 to 16 children who were as young as 3 or 4 when they were first molested or made to watch adult relatives during drug-fueled orgies. The children of the suspects have all been placed in foster care or with relatives who weren't involved in the crimes. Brittney Wood isn't the alleged victim in any of the cases filed so far; each involved other young people, mostly within her family. But the investigation mushroomed only after she was reported missing and her uncle Donnie had died. Suspects: Randall Wood (left), who's been charged with second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second degree rape, and Brittney Wood's brother, Derek Wood (right), who's been charged with second degree rape and second degree sodomy . Authorities believe group sex and child sexual abuse went on for three generations in two families that merged when Holland married Wendy Wood, Chessie Woods' sister. 'Donnie was the manager. He'd say, `I've got this child and this adult, come on over,'' said Mobile County Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson. Brittney Wood, meanwhile, led a life that was troubled long before folks on the Alabama coast came to know her smile because of missing persons fliers posted in store windows and shared on social media. The single mother of a daughter born when she was 17, Wood was molested as a child by a step-grandfather who went to prison for the crime, said Patterson. Before she went missing, Patterson said, Wood was using drugs and had a gun for personal protection while bouncing between relatives' homes; others often cared for her daughter. Disappearance: A smiling Brittney Wood pictured here with her child . A relative reported Holland for allegedly abusing one of the family girls in February 2012, authorities said, and word spread through the clan. Private Facebook messages provided to The Associated Press by Stephanie Hanke, Brittney Wood's stepmother, show that a female relative informed Wood about being raped by three male relatives on May 27, just three days before Wood vanished. The night of the disappearance, cellphone records and witness accounts indicate Wood left west Mobile with Holland and crossed Mobile Bay into Baldwin County, where Holland was found two days later inside his SUV by his wife and one of her friends. He had been shot in the rear of his head behind an ear, which authorities considered an odd spot for a self-inflicted wound. Holland was scheduled to be questioned about allegations of sexual abuse the very day he was found in the car on an isolated dirt road. Wood's cellphone battery was in the vehicle with Holland, but there was no sign of the teen. Her gun was there as well, it was the only gun in the car. Holland never regained consciousness and died several days later. After Holland died, relatives and police wondered about Wood. 'We didn't even realize she was missing until after they found him shot,' said Hanke. Brittney Wood was last seen at Tillman's Corner, Alabama, in May 2012. She is presumed dead . Searches for the teen began and the sex abuse probe picked up, too. Two of Woods's uncles, Dustin Kent and Scott Wood, were arrested within three weeks and later pleaded guilty to rape and sodomy. Aunts and family friends were eventually charged. This month, family friend Billy Brownlee, 50, was convicted in Baldwin County on charges of sexually abusing a girl in the Holland family when she was about 12. Brownlee claimed Donnie Holland forced him into the acts against his will, but jurors needed only 20 minutes to return a guilty verdict. Donnie Holland's 35-year-old wife, Wendy, is set for trial in early December in what could be a key prosecution. Court records show she has pleaded not guilty, and Heinz said she shows no interest in a plea agreement. Still, authorities wonder how child sexual abuse could go on for years between so many people without anyone being charged until 2012. One girl accused an uncle of sexually abusing her as early as 2008, Heinz said, but welfare workers found the complaint unsubstantiated. 'You look at these reports and wonder, `Why? How did it not go anywhere?'' said Heinz. Barry Spear, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Human Resources, said privacy statutes prevent the agency from commenting. 'I can't even say whether we're had any involvement with this family at all,' Spear said. Chessie Wood, Brittney's mother: Two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12. Derek Wood, Brittney's brother: Second degree rape and second degree sodomy. Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan: Rape and sex abuse of a child under 12. Dustin Kent: Two counts of rape, sex abuse, sodomy and production of obscene material of a person under 17. He allegedly raped a 13-year-old while her father looked on . William 'Billy' Brownlee: Two counts of rape, sodomy and sex abuse. Mendy Kent: Sodomy and sex abuse. Wendy Holland: Sodomy, sex abuse and child torture. James Cumbaa: Rape, sodomy, and sex abuse. Randall Scott Wood: Second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second degree rape. Jennifer Moore: Production of pornography involving minors and second-degree child abuse.

"A 17-year-old has created a line of snap-on underwear for those who struggle to put them on the normal way - one leg at a time. Charlotte Robinson, who lives in South Salem, New York, came up with the idea for her line, No Guts No Glory, when she had to wear a large leg brace for 13 months. After being forced to wear itchy Velcro undergarments made by her mother, she learned to sew and started making her own snap-on underwear. 'It's nice to know you can have a pair of underwear that you can put on after surgery that's not too bad,' Charlotte told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Turning lemons into lemonade!

By the time she was 13, her right leg was . misshapen and a full two and a half inches shorter than her left. The week after she graduated eighth grade, Charlotte underwent a seven-hour surgery to . correct the growth, and was forced to wear a Taylor Spatial Frame, a . four-pound brace with large pins going directly into the leg bone. The brace would stay on more than a year - and, Charlotte, who'd previously filled her spare time with tennis, took up sewing instead. She said the frame eventually started feeling like a 'part of' her. 'It can be tough at times with everyone always staring at your frame but what I came to learn is that people are intrigued by the frame. I had more guys coming up to me and asking me all about it because they thought it was ""so cool,""' she says on her website. 'Everywhere I went I heard incredible stories, and every person gave me the same advice which was to not give up because it gets easier and life goes on' 'I met many interesting individuals who had faced all kinds of challenges in the past but you would never know it. I met an outstanding baker with only three fingers, a woman who had a tree fall on her in a storm and many others. Everywhere I went I heard incredible stories, and every person gave me the same advice which was to not give up because it gets easier and life goes on.' Charlotte even met former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who lifted up his pants leg to show her his own brace. Heavy metal! Charlotte had to wear her Taylor Spatial Frame for 13 months, and said it eventually started feeling like 'a part' of her . The long and short of it: Before her surgery, Charlotte's left leg was two and a half inches taller than her right, due to a rare disorder that caused vascular tumors to grow on her right tibia . The frame eventually came off - and her leg had successfully responded to all the treatments. 'It was a long journey but well worth it as I gained 2.5 inches and am now back on the tennis courts!' she said to MailOnline. Charlotte initially thought only others with Taylor Spatial Frames would be interested in her snap-on underwear, but realized there could be a larger interest after a followup operation. She overheard a patient next to her, who'd just had a scoliosis surgery, getting a lecture about how she could wear only snap-up pants. 'Snap, snap is all they have to do.

"Understaffed: The number of Army recruits has dropped by a third since recruitment was privatised in March . The number of rookie soldiers joining the Army has dropped by more than a third since the Government outsourced recruitment in a £440million deal aimed at saving money. The number of recruits attending selection interviews and tests has fallen by 35 per cent since a 10 year deal was made with private services company Capita back in March. The number of those signing up for officer roles has dropped by nearly half, according to the Daily Telegraph. The newspaper has obtained figures under the Freedom of Information Act that confirm that numbers are down more than 1,750 in the first four months of the Capita contract. Since March, 3,259 recruits have signed up compared with more than 5,000 in the corresponding four months in 2012. Less than 200 officers have been sent for selection compared to 379 last year. Senior officers have complained that cuts to the defence budget give off the impression that the Army is no longer recruiting. One officer said that although the service 'delivers savings, it doesn't deliver a result.' The drop in recruits has raised concerns that operations could become more dangerous for existing soldiers with the Army already more than 3,600 personnel short. Since Capita took over recruitment, new recruits are struggling to sign up online and some application forms are being lost or held up, claim understaffed Army regiments. They blame a heavy reliance on the internet to drive recruitment - new recruits used to be given guidance when filling out paper application forms. An Army source told the Telegraph: '(Recruitment) is less than half what it was last year. 'There's a big lack of knowledge about how many people are in the system and where they are in the process.' Both Capita and the Ministry of Defence have said that the contract is in its infancy and that any teething problems would be ironed out.

"Ashya King’s pioneering cancer treatment in the Czech Republic will be paid for by the NHS after all, it was announced last night. The parents of the five-year-old, who suffers from a brain tumour, sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from an NHS hospital last month without the permission of doctors. Brett and Naghemeh King had applied for their son to be given proton beam treatment while he was being cared for at Southampton General Hospital but the health service rejected the request and recommended radiotherapy. Scroll down for video . NHS England today confirmed it will now pay for Ashya King's  proton beam treatment in Prague, Czech Republic . After a row with doctors the couple took him out of hospital and went abroad in the hope of getting the proton beam treatment in the Czech Republic. It is believed to cost more than £60,000. A European Arrest Warrant was issued and the Kings, from Southsea, Hampshire, were arrested in Spain where they owned a holiday home. They were taken into custody and released only after Ashya had spent three nights away from his parents in a Spanish hospital. Eight days after they had removed Ashya from hospital a High Court judge gave them permission to fly to Prague to begin the treatment. Ashya was transported to the Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech capital to start his proton treatment earlier this month. Doctors at the clinic have previously told how 70-80 per cent of patients in his condition survive . Brett King (left) and his wife Naghemeh (right) were allegedlly warned that their son could have been taken away from them for 11 years if they questioned any decisions made by the authorities after the huge manhunt . Now, in a major U-turn, NHS England said last night that it would fund the treatment under the reciprocal healthcare arrangements that exist within the EU. A spokesman for the health service said the cost was not yet known. NHS England said in a statement: ‘Our thoughts are with Ashya and his family as he begins follow-on radiotherapy. ‘Now that Ashya is in Prague, it is clearly best that he continues to be treated uninterrupted so the NHS has agreed to fund this care, as requested by his parents, in accordance with relevant European cross-border arrangements. Ashya's parents have repeatedly told how they believe the proton beam treatment will help their young son . Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with Ashya after 72 hours in a Spanish jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow him to undergo proton therapy in Prague . ‘We all join in wishing him well, and greatly hope he makes a full and successful recovery.’ Ashya is already said to be ‘showing progress’ at the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague. Earlier this month the clinic said that he was ‘smiling more and able to move his limbs’. His attending doctor, radiation oncologist Dr Barbora Ondrova, said: ‘There is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as Ashya has. ‘There is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery.’ Ashya is having a type of radiation treatment that uses beams of protons – one of the building blocks of atoms – rather than X-rays. They can be targeted directly at a tumour and stop once they hit the target instead of carrying on through the body as conventional X-rays do. This means much less damage is caused to surrounding tissue, according to the NHS. Earlier this month it was announced that proton beam treatment will be available in this country from 2018. NHS England will spend £250million on two proton beam units in Manchester and London. The £30million Proton Therapy Centre where Ashya King is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer-fighting technology. Built in 2012, the gleaming white lobby of the five-storey building on the outskirts of Prague appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas. The centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target. For brain tumours, this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours, staff claim. A course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits. Sessions never last more than 30 minutes.

"In light of reports that Australia's most senior Islamic State militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in the Middle East, details about the terrorist's past have emerged. One source told ABC about Baryalei's love for gambling, women, drugs and painted him as someone who mixed with questionable characters. 'He gambled a lot ... He once won $8,000 or $9,000 on the pokies, then played it back down ... and he loved cocaine.,' the source told the 7.30 program. The friend also said they thought Baryalei, originally from Sydney, may have gotten 'in too deep' in the scene, and it seemed as though he saw more than he could handle. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in the Middle East, according to a friend . The wanted terrorist is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up, suffering extensive bouts of depression which saw him confined to his room for days on end. A neighbour of the man seemed to echo these sentiments when speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald, telling of the man's troubles growing up. He apparently suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of his abusive father, and left home at just 17. Despite this Baryalei would still help out around the neighbourhood, doing 'odd jobs' for those who needed the help. Baryalei recruited as many as half of the Australian militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in the Middle East . 'He was a clean cut young man. Somebody must have gotten inside his head,' a source told the website. Meantime the Federal government is still scrambling to confirm reports that Baryalei - the most senior Australian militant in the Islamic State terror group - has in fact been killed. 'We are currently seeking to confirm whether the 16th Australian foreign fighter has indeed been killed in this conflict,' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told parliament on Wednesday. The news came as Labor joined the coalition to pass foreign fighter laws. A friend visits the home of Mohammad Ali Baryalei's mother, Homira, in western Sydney on Wednesday evening . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the laws would make it easier to arrest and jail terrorists returning from overseas, monitor potential terrorists in Australia and stop 'preachers of hate'. As news filtered through of Baryalei's apparent demise, the neighbours of his parents in Sydney's northwest spoke about his mother's pain over her son's decision to join the radical group. The neighbour said Ms Baryalei had been devastated by her son's decision to take up arms with IS. 'She was crying. She couldn't believe it was her son,' she said. 'All she knew was he was overseas studying to be a cleric and would call her every so often. 'He was very protective of his mum.' Neighbours said Baryalei's mother believed him to be overseas studying to be a cleric . Despite this, authorities have told The Sydney Morning Herald Baryalei's death is unlikely to stop young Australians being recruited to fight for Islamic State. A senior security source told the publication that although he was a key recruiter , others were likely to step up into the position meaning Australians would continue to travel to the Middle East to fight. 'I think you'll always find there's be people who'll step into that void and they'll be people who are probably well known to us, to be honest,' he said. Baryalei was the ringleader of an alleged plot to behead a random member of the public in Sydney earlier this year. He was a senior recruiter for the Islamic State terror group. In a tribute Facebook post last night, a friend of Baryalei's, Abdul Salaam Mahmoud, said he had received news the notorious western Sydney militant had died. In his prior life, Baryalei (left and right) was an aspiring actor who played a bit part role in Underbelly (right) 'I've just received the news that our beloved brother Mohamed Ali who was recently strongly attacked by Australian media has been martyred,' he wrote. 'He was a brother a friend and our leader in street dawah Sydney.' 'Today we shall celebrate his martyrdom with tears of joy and sorrow.' 'Oh Allah accept him as another green bird.' Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the government has not yet confirmed whether Baryalei had been killed. 'It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger.' According to an ABC report, Baryalei was killed four or five days ago. It is unclear whether a Coalition air strike was responsible for Baryalei's apparent death. Terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton, from the Global Terrorism Research Centre at Monash University, said Baryalei's killing would be a 'significant' blow to Islamic State's recruitment efforts in Australia. A friend of Mohammad Ali Baryalei paid tribute to his friend in a Facebook post . Abdullah Elmir, the 17-year-old who fled Sydney to fight for the Islamic State, is believed to have been recruited by Baryalei . Omarjan Azari, 22, was arrested and charged in the nation's largest ever terror raids last month. Prosecutors allege Baryalei conspired with him in a beheading plot . We are currently seeking to verify reports (of Mohammad Ali Baryalei's death)... I can't confirm at this stage. It does highlight what the government has been saying that Australians who leave this country to fight in Iraq and Syria are putting themselves in mortal danger. They have a great risk of being killed. They are committing offences against Australian law. They are adding to the suffering of the people of Iraq and Syria. And they are likely to be come experienced in the ways of terrorism. We urge young Australians in particular not to be radicalised, not to fall for these false and toxic ideologies of the terrorists, who have only been using them for their own purposes. 'It doesn't mean a lot for Islamic State as a whole but it does mean a lot for Australia,' Prof Barton told Daily Mail Australia. 'If it's confirmed that he is no longer, and with the Operation Appleby (terror raids)... We would have really put a dent in the recruiting network.' Security officials believe Baryalei recruited as many of half the Australians who have joined the fighting in the Middle East - including the so-called 'Ginger Jihadist', Abdullah Elmir, 17. Baryalei was also accused of orchestrating an alleged plot for Omarjan Azari, a 22-year-old western Sydney man, to commit a public beheading in the streets of the nation's largest city. Before Baryalei fled to the Middle East in April 2013, he worked as a bit-part actor in the popular crime drama Underbelly and as a bouncer in the Kings Cross nightclub district. The AFP told Daily Mail Australia in early September a warrant had been issued for Baryalei's arrest over alleged terrorism-related activity. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Attorney-General George Brandis have been approached for comment.","Senior Islamic State recruiter of Australians and ringleader of alleged beheading plot is believed dead .

"A photographer has spent five years driving across America taking photos that represent a wide swath of the country. Curran Hatleberg, who has driven from coast to coast five times or more, says he was interested in looking for ‘sort of shared familiarity and human contact in a country I called home but I didn’t know much about’. He spent the five years shooting the two ongoing photographic series, Dogwood and The Crowded Edge, and says he never really knew where he was going when he got into his car. Sometimes he would travel with the intention of eventually landing on a friend’s or family member’s couch, but the destination could change on a whim. ‘Initially, it was spawned by a desire to see what I could see and learn something along the way and have an adventure,’ Hatleberg tells Slate. He says he tried to take pictures that serve as ‘open-ended imaginative space’ where the viewer’s interpretation of the image was not guided by preconceptions about the region. ‘If it becomes too specific, there's less room for creative imagination on the part of the viewer.’ Hatleberg says his journey was a quest to find moments that contained ‘colliding emotional spaces’, often a sense of beauty combined with a sense of sadness.

"Despite looking like it could be from a far off galaxy in a Sci-Fi film, this landscape is a natural sulphur spring in Ethiopia. With its vibrant yellows and deep dark browns the ground appears as though it could be home to some sort extra-terrestrial life form but is just created by high levels of salt. Neat hills of solid salt rise nearly as tall as the mounds of dirt next to them. This otherworldly landscape is really a natural sulphur spring in Dallol, Ethopia . Created by high levels of salt, the ground appears as though it could be home to extraterrestrial life forms . New Zealand-based photographer, Bradley Ambrose, captured these impressive sights . Photographer Bradley Ambrose, from New Zealand, battled oppressive heats up to 53 degrees Celsius to capture these landscapes in the Afar region of Dallol, Ethiopia. Bradley said: 'Experiencing Dallol is like stepping onto another planet.' And like a trip to space, this otherworldly destination can also cause distress to its visitors. 'The heat, sulphur, acidic waters and some of the ground was quite thin to the point where I thought I would break through and boil myself to death,' he added. 'There was so much colour and beauty that I wasn't sure that I could do it justice photographically.' Battling intense heats of up to 53 degrees Celsius, Bradley ventured to the Afar region to shoot . 'It's like stepping onto another planet,' Bradley said of visiting the springs . Although it may look like a lake, the salt ground is actually several kilometres deep in places . Though Bradley is from Rotorua, where they have their own springs, he was struck by the beauty in Dallol . Bradley is from Rotorua in New Zealand where they have their own geothermal springs, but was still taken aback by the Ethiopian landscape. He said: 'Due to its high salt levels and other minerals, Dallol was an extremely concentrated area of micro activity and was definitely brighter and more varied than what I've seen before.' 'There is a high concentration of salt as the entire area is lower than sea level and was once upon a time underwater.' 'We were told that the 'lakes' we drove across to get there [were made of] salt that was kilometres deep in places.' 'Besides the searing heat, the first thing that I noticed was the smell - very similar to rotting eggs, which reminded me of my childhood playing in Rotorua.' 'I thought I would break through the ground and boil myself to death, he says of the treacherous conditions .

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today defended the NHS reforms, amid reports senior Tories fear it is the biggest strategic mistake they have made in government . Ministers were today forced to defend the controversial overhaul of the NHS amid claims senior Tories believe it is the biggest mistake they have made in government. Insiders described the reforms as ‘unintelligible gobbledygook’ which had been a ‘huge strategic error’ for the Conservative’s reputation for looking after the health service. As health workers went on strike over pay, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today insisted the changes had been ‘very, very important’ in saving money which could be used to hire more doctors and nurses. In opposition, the Tories promised there would be no top-down reorganisation of the NHS. The controversial shake-up, which was not included in either Coalition party’s manifesto, was drawn up by Andrew Lansley, when he was the health secretary. One senior cabinet minister told The Times: ‘We’ve made three mistakes that I regret, the first being restructuring the NHS. The rest are minor.’ One ally of Mr Osborne, the Chancellor, said: ‘George kicks himself for not having spotted it and stopped it. He had the opportunity then and he didn’t take it.’ A former No 10 adviser said: ‘No one apart from Lansley had a clue what he was really embarking on, certainly not the prime minister. ‘He kept saying his grand plans had the backing of the medical establishment and we trusted him. In retrospect it was a mistake.’ The legislation was so badly written that it was amended some 2,000 times as it went through Parliament, with even supporters of the original plans saying the final outcome bore little relation to Mr Lansley’s vision. The Health and Social Care Bill scrapped primary care trusts and put billions in spending in the hands of GP commissioning groups. It was originally claimed it would save £7.7billion, but it was later downgraded to £6billion. Scroll down for video . Critics have complained that managers given pay-offs after health bodies were axed were quickly rehired by new NHS groups. An investigation by The Times found that a study carried out for ministers has found that at least £5billion is wasted every year on inefficiencies, such as overpaying for supplies, out-of-date drugs, agency workers and empty buildings. Two fifths of NHS chief executives told the paper that charges to see a GP or stay in hospital will be needed without extra money for the health service. Strikers protest outside Royal Liverpool Hospital in Liverpool in the first walkout since 1982 . Members of the armed forces today stepped in as more than 400,000 NHS staff staged their first walk out in more than 30 years, mounting picket lines outside hospitals. But it emerged only a fraction of workers who belong to unions taking part, voted to strike in the row over pay. Fewer than half those balloted for the controversial health strike voted in favour of the action, the Daily Mail can reveal. And Unison, one of the biggest unions, could persuade fewer than one in ten – 9.5 per cent – of eligible members to vote for the controversial walkout. None of the other six trade organisations involved managed to get a mandate from more than half of those balloted. Yet 400,000 nurses, midwives, paramedics, specialist health staff and hospital porters and cleaners staged the walk out from 7am for four hours . NHS workers strike outside University College Hospital in central London in a dispute over pay . The Times also found that ‘trolley waits’ to get into hospital from A&E are running at almost three times the level of 2011 and the cost of bed blockers is at a record high. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Let’s look at those reforms because they are very, very important. Former health secretary Andrew Lansley is blamed for forcing through the complex reforms . ‘What we are dealing with is an aging population, with cancer survival rates that we are trying to increase, with wanting to get better care for dementia… is a lot of pressure on the NHS which we need more staff for. ‘And what those reforms did, was we abolished the Primary Care Trust, the Strategic Health Authorities employed 19,00 people and we have put that money into the frontline. So, the NHS today has 7,000 more doctors, 3,500 more nurses overall than we had four years ago. Those are net savings. “We have saved actually as a result of those reforms over a billion pounds a year net, including the costs of redundancy, including the cost of the transition, all that. And as a result of saving that billion pounds a year we have more doctors, more nurses on our front lines, shorter waiting times than we would otherwise have had.’ Simon Stevens, head of the NHS, said that the health service needed more radical change to cope with a lack of cash. ‘Recent methods of balancing the books are not going to be indefinitely repeatable,’ he said. Clare Gerada, who led the fight against the reforms as chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, called the admission disgraceful. She said: ‘I think politicians and policymakers need to have a long, hard look at themselves. ‘They are saying this now but they should have said it then. The big issue is that nobody has been held accountable for it. If Mr Lansley was a doctor, he would have been referred to the General Medical Council.’","Controversial shake-up was a 'huge strategic error', insiders say .

"Ever since those two 'C's first interlinked in the 1920s, Chanel has been one of the most lusted-after brands on the planet. Its iconic pieces - the little black dress, the tailored suit and the luxe quilted bag to name but a few- have been worn with pride by the fashion elite and copied by designers worldwide for the best part of a century. From the catwalk to market stalls, fashion is infused with Chanel influence. Who hasn't been offered a plastic Channel bag on a street corner or bought an 'LBD' inspired by Chanel's original'? But this season the uber brand flipped the Chanel copycat trend on its head. Their current jewellery collection includes a rather more expensive copy of another iconic design - the sweetie necklace. Scroll down for video . Can you spot the difference? Left: Chanel sweetie necklace, £755; Right: 'Real' sweetie necklace, 20p . Yum: The 'real' sweetie necklace, modeled above, is £754.80 cheaper and tastes good too! Usually the beaded beauties are priced at around 20p, available at your local newsagent, but now the necklace can be yours for £755 at Chanel. And despite the eye-watering price tag, the designer version isn't even edible - or at best is extremely hard and very bland. Of course, as with any Chanel design, the fashionable set have latched onto the trend and have been wearing this new souped-up version of the sweetie necklace with pride. Alexa Chung, back in town recently for London Fashion Week, looked her usual stylish-self sporting the candy chain with a pair of dress-down dungarees. And Chanel are having no trouble shifting the pricey pastel goods from their stores, along with the matching £975 cuff. The designs have also been praised by fashion magazines and bloggers alike for their innovation. But perhaps there's a touch of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' about this latest trend. Isn't a £754.80 mark up on a 20p item, well, to put it mildly, totally and utterly and absurdly bonkers? Left: Fashionista Alexa Chung wears the Chanel necklace; Right: The edible version  is a favourite amongst the under-ten set . The matching £975 cuff: The famous interlocked 'c's are created out of plastic sweetie-like beads . 'It seems bonkers but it’s fitting with the general fashion movement,' says Daily Mail style editor Eliza Scarborough. 'First Moschino did the McDonalds fast food collection, and Anya Hindmarch did bags in the form of cereal and kitchen essentials (the Ariel and Daz clutch and Frosties and Coco Pops bags). Fashion seems to have embraced the kitsch idea of nostalgic food and items. 'Even though Chanel is known for being a traditional brand they have been mixing it up with their urban rucksack and trainers on the catwalk, so it’s not completely out of the blue. It’s a tongue in cheek take on the traditional string of pearls . 'This general trend has filtered onto the high street already with New Look creating a burger clutch bag and Zara selling a bagel phone case. So, perhaps you may see the 20p version popping up on fashion bloggers soon,' suggests Eliza. Six-year-old Mia, who recently bought the classic version of the candy necklace with her tooth fairy money, is also in favour of the upgraded designer version. When shown a picture of the Chanel piece she was enamored by the subtle glitzy detail. The six-year-old, whose fashion favourites include Hello Kitty necklaces and diamond stick-on earrings, asked: 'Can I have that one instead? I like the sparkly bits.' But when asked if she would pay £755 pounds for the added sparkle, 3,775 times more than she shelled out on her own one at the sweet shop, she found herself in a financial dilemma. 'I don't have that many teeth and four of mine have already fallen out already so I don't think I will have enough money,' she said. 'But maybe I can get one for my birthday?' She did have one important question, however: 'What do the sparkly bits taste like?'","The necklace is 3,775 times more expensive than the original edible version .

"Google has further demonstrated just how serious it is about making computers think like humans. The California tech giant has teamed up with two of Oxford University’s artificial intelligence (AI) teams to help machines better understand users, and improve visual recognition systems using deep learning. This partnership follows reports Google is also developing superfast ‘quantum’ chips modelled on the human brain, to make searches and software more intuitive. Google has teamed up with two of Oxford University’s (pictured) artificial intelligence (AI) teams. The first will lead research into helping machines better understand users, while the second has been tasked to improve visual recognition systems using deep learning . ‘It is a really exciting time for AI research these days, and progress is being made on many fronts including image recognition and natural language understanding,’ wrote Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind and vice president of engineering at Google in a blog post. ‘We are delighted to announce a partnership with Oxford University to accelerate Google’s research efforts in these areas.’ Google DeepMind will be working with two of Oxford’s AI research teams. Professor Nando de Freitas, Professor Phil Blunsom, Dr Edward Grefenstette and Dr Karl Moritz Hermann, who teamed up earlier this year to co-found Dark Blue Labs, will be leading research to help machines better understand what users are saying to them. The acquisition of DeepMind in January wasn't Google’s first foray into artificial intelligence and machine learning. Its recent Hummingbird search update was created to make Google 'more human' - searches can now understand context, like a human brain, for example. Its Google Now app uses ‘predictive analysis’ to predict what Android users will do next, before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked. Google also hired futurist Ray Kurzweil as Engineering Director in 2012. Kurzweil has famously claimed that in just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called singularity. He also claimed the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100. Its partnership with Oxford University follows reports Google is also developing superfast ‘quantum’ chips modelled on the human brain, to make searches and software more intuitive. Also joining the DeepMind team will be Dr Karen Simonyan, Max Jaderberg and Professor Andrew Zisserman, experts in computer vision systems. As co-founders of Vision Factory, their aim is to improve visual recognition systems using deep learning. Dr Simonyan and Professor Zisserman developed one of the winning systems at the recent 2014 ImageNet competition. Google DeepMind has hired all seven founders of these startups with the three professors holding joint appointments at Oxford University where they will continue to spend part of their time. ‘These exciting partnerships underline how committed Google DeepMind is to supporting the development of UK academia and the growth of strong scientific research labs,’ continued Mr Hassabis. As a part of the collaboration, Google DeepMind will be donating to establish a research partnership with the Computer Science Department and the Engineering Department at Oxford University. ‘We are thrilled to welcome these extremely talented machine learning researchers to the Google DeepMind team and are excited about the potential impact of the advances their research will bring,’ concluded Mr Hassabis. Google is also reportedly working on a super-fast 'quantum' computer chip as part its vision to one day have machines think like humans. Dr Karen Simonyan, Max Jaderberg and Professor Andrew Zisserman are among the experts partnering with Google.

The California-based group has teamed up with leading physicist John Martinis to build processors based on quantum theories. Google acquired artificial intelligence firm DeepMind in January . The new hire is part of a 'hardware initiative' to design and build chips operating on sub-atomic levels in ways that makes them much faster than existing processors. Standard computers deal with binary data expressed in zeroes and ones. However, quantum computing uses the behaviour of sub-atomic particles to encode data. Experts believe that a quantum bit, which can have two states at the same time, may be able hugely improve the speed and power of computing. Professor Martinis currently works at University of California, Santa Barbara, and is one of the most prolific researchers in the area of artificial intelligence. But Google is also aware of the dangers involved with AI and machine learning. So much so that in January it set up an ethics board to oversee its work in these fields. The ethics board is to ensure the projects are not abused. The DeepMind-Google ethics board is set to create a series of rules and restrictions over the use of the technology. Elon Musk is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars. But the Tesla-founder claims the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons. Last month, the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at a robot uprising, claiming ‘We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.’ Musk referred to the book ‘Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies’, a work by Nick Bostrom that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers. Mr Bostrom has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation. In a later tweet, Musk wrote: ‘Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.’ Musk's tweets follows a similar comment in June in which the Tesla-founder said believes that a horrific ‘Terminator-like’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand.","Google has teamed up with two of Oxford’s artificial intelligence (AI) teams .

"Duggy the parrot has got herself in a flap - because she thinks she is a chicken. The confused parrot started impersonating the farmyard animal after hearing the noise on a children's cartoon shown on TV. But the two-year-old African grey soon became so obsessed with clucking that she ditched her cawing entirely. Now Duggy spends all day long pretending to be a chicken - much to the delight of her owners. Scroll down for video . Who's a clever boy: Duggy the parrot began impersonating chickens from a children's TV show - and not cannot stop clucking . Michelle Lamond, 47, from Seafield, West Lothian, said: 'She does it all the time now. She's a chicken now from morning until night. 'I think she's hilarious. My family think the same. They just laugh at her.' The strange noises began after Ms Lamond left on the TV  o keep Duggy amused while she was out. Hours later, she came home to find the bird clucking away. She said: 'I just came down the other day and she was going on like a chicken, I was like ""Oh my God where did that come from?"" 'Then I realised it came from the telly. If I go out during the day, I either put the radio or the TV on so there is always some background noise. 'I put on Baby TV and it's obviously came from that. I don't know what programme it was but I know it came from Baby TV.' Not so bird-brained: The two-year old African grey, from West Lothian, also tries to bark like a dog and likes to sing along to Colonel Bogey . The multi-talented parrot also whistles Colonel Bogey and even tries her hand at being a barking dog, according to her owners. Ms Lamond, who has owned Duggy since she was a chick, said: 'Her first couple of outbursts in the morning are loud. She likes to let you know she's awake. 'She also whistles away to the Colonel Bogey song. She really keeps us amused. She can also whine like our Dalmatian Cal and I'm sure the bark will come. 'The dog is five months and its quite fun to watch the two of them together. It's a madhouse. 'I actually came down the other day and wondered whether it was the dog or her whining, and it was her. 'She makes various noises. She'll say ""I love you"" and ""Hello Duggy"" and she sings songs here and there. She's quite a tame parrot. She'll take food out your hand. 'If you have something and she wants it, she'll fly on to the plate and try get a bit. She can fly onto you and try steal your food.' Huband Kenneth, 50, added: 'The only thing we can think of is that she picked it up from the cartoons in the morning on the television.'","Duggy, from West Lothian, began mimicking a chicken on a cartoon show .

"He's not exactly known for his pro-democracy views and yet here's North Korean leader Kim Jong-un flashing a victory sign to student activists today on the streets of Hong Kong. And here he is again - standing in front of a wall with messages of support to protesters currently occupying part of the city's financial Admiralty district. Except, of course, it's not really Kim but a chap called Howard - a 35-year-old Hong Kong-born Australian musician... and a dead ringer for the dictator. Scroll down for video . V for victory, Kim? North Korean dictator lookalike Howard greets pro-democracy supporters on the streets of Hong Kong today. 'I don't really have to do anything to create awareness. Just my presence,' he said . Howard, who charges HK$5,000 (£400) for party appearances, said being a Kim doppelganger can be a funny experience but he also hopes to stir up dialogue about North Korea and its human rights issues. He is pictured above in front of a wall with messages of support to protesters currently occupying part of Hong Kong's financial Admiralty district . Howard made his satirical appearances in support of the protesters' movement in the semi-autonomous city. Last year, he became the world's first professional Kim Jong-Un lookalike and he's endured endless jokes about his double ever since Kim rose to power in 2011. Howard said: 'My friends and I joked back and forth. Maybe I should get dressed up and do some gigs with it. After all, I'm a musician, so it's about the performance.' Over time, Howard, who refuses to give his surname in order to keep his music and impersonation careers separate, has perfected his wave and stern smile - and even his recent limp. Will the real Kim please stand up... in case you're wondering, that's Howard on the left - and the real deal on the right . 'The key to becoming Kim is to always look unhappy and dissatisfied. It is his trademark,' said Howard, seen above checking his phone on the metro in Hong Kong . He may be four years older, slightly taller and thinner than Kim - and have bushier eyebrows - but that hasn't stopped Howard, above, drawing crowds . Last year, Howard became the world's first professional Kim Jong-Un lookalike and he's endured endless jokes about his double ever since Kim rose to power in 2011.

Howard, who charges HK$5,000 (£400) for party appearances, said being a Kim doppelganger can be a funny experience but he also hopes to stir up dialogue about North Korea and its human rights issues. The student leaders in Hong Kong are struggling to maintain momentum after aborting a weekend street referendum intended to shore up support. Organisers said they scrapped the vote because they hadn't adequately consulted with the public. Protesters (below) have been occupying main streets in three neighborhoods across Hong Kong since September 28, when police unleashed tear gas in a failed attempt to disperse thousands of them trying to rally outside government headquarters. Beijing has decreed that a committee will screen candidates for inaugural 2017 direct elections to choose the semi-autonomous Chinese city's leader, angering many who call it fake democracy. Protesters want Hong Kongers to be able to name candidates of their own choosing. Protesters marked a full month of their movement with an evening rally that began with the unfurling of umbrellas and a moment of silence that lasted 87 seconds - one for every canister of tear gas fired by police. 'I don't really have to do anything to create awareness. Just my presence,' he said. 'It brings the issue up in a light-hearted way. It's important to know about this country... If they launch a missile, it could start World War Three.' Howard added: 'The key to becoming Kim is to always look unhappy and dissatisfied. It is his trademark. 'The reaction whenever I step out in the Mao suit, make-up and hair slicked back is always crazy. 'Sometimes I have to wear a baseball cap and sunglasses to try and avoid the attention when going about my everyday business.' Howard said he fell into the role almost by accident when a picture of himself posing as the Dear Leader went viral on Facebook in April 2012. The reaction prompted him to set up a page on the social networking site advertising his body double services - and received a string of requests and offers. Within weeks, he had appeared in a controversial TV ad for an Israeli burger chain, threatening to nuke America. Then came more job requests. Howard said he was asked to do an ad for a pistachio company with Dennis Rodman, a retired professional basketball player who calls the reclusive North Korean leader his friend, but the plan fell apart when he could not get his US work visa in time. Howard added: 'Keeping up with Kim's look is extremely easy and enjoyable. All I have to do is eat and eat and then eat some more. 'It is fun to play him because it freaks people out. They don't expect to see this notorious dictator walking the streets of their city. 'But it is always nice to go back and just be myself at the end of the day.' Howard said his family have been supportive of his career path after his years performing in bands and producing music. He said: 'My friends and family all think it is hilarious that I have the guts to play an evil dictator. In fact they are quite proud of it.' Hey, where's the cheese?

"A popular 12-mile stretch of country A-road running through one of the most picturesque parts of Britain has been named the nation’s ‘most persistently dangerous’ highway. It is one of a number of ‘beautiful but deadly’ roads - many running through or near national parks and areas of outstanding beauty - where the toll of deaths and serious injuries are ‘unacceptably high’, says a major new road safety report. The single-carriage A285 from Petworth through the South Downs to the coastal town of Chichester runs north to south through West Sussex linking the A27 with the A272. Scroll down for video . The single carriageway from Petworth to South Downs named the UK's most 'persistently dangerous' road . The road in West Sussex linking the A27 with the A272 is particularly popular for those en route to Goodwood . 1. A285 - 12 miles - Petworth to Chichester, West Sussex A27 to A272 . 2. A809 - 10 miles - Glasgow to the A811 . 3. A937 - 8 miles - Montrose to the A90 (Laurencekirk) 4. A18 - 10 miles - Laceby to Ludborough near Grimsby . 5. A6 - 6 miles - M6 junction 33 to Lancaster . 6. A61 - 6 miles - Wakefield and the M1 junction 44 . 7. A36 - 4 miles - A3090 to Totton in Hampshire . 8. A589 - 5 miles - Full route around Lancaster . 9. A643 - 7 miles - Brighouse to Morely in Yorkshire . 10 A4300 - 4 miles - Full route through Kettering . Source: Road Safety Foundation . It is particularly popular with families and holidaymakers heading to the seaside and with visitors en route to events at Goodwood including horse-racing at ‘Glorious Goodwood’ the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Goodwood Revival. But the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) – the official measure of major road casualties – has risen there from 18 in the 2007-9 period to 21 in the period 2010-12 – an increase of 16.6 per cent. The report by the Road Safety Foundation notes how many routes through National Parks – as this one does – show a particularly high degree of risk. It says 64 people are killed or seriously injured on Britain’s roads every day with six out of ten fatal crashes occur on rural roads. The report concludes: ‘The UK’s persistently highest-risk road is a stretch of less than 12 miles in West Sussex. ‘The A285 between Chichester and Petworth runs north to south linking the A27 with the A272 and runs through the South Downs. ‘It tops the list of high-risk and medium-high risk roads which have shown little or no change over time or significant increases in the number of crashes.’ The route has ‘a significant number of bends’, it notes: ‘It has seen a 16 per cent increase in the number of fatal and serious crashes over time – at junctions, running off the road and even head-on collisions.’ A 10-mile stretch of the A809 between Glasgow and the A811 is the next most ‘persistently high risk’ road followed by an eight-mile stretch of the A937 between Montrose and the A90 (Laurencekirk), and 10-mile run of the A18 between Laceby and Ludborough near Grimsby where in April last year five people were killed in a head-on smash between a cat and a lorry. The Road Safety Foundation says the number of people killed on the road has risen in the period of 2010-2012 . North West: A537 - 7 miles - Macclesfied to Buxton . South East: A285 - 12 miles - A27 (Chichester) to Petworth . Scotland: A809 - 10 miles - Glasgow to A811 . Wales: A44 - 24 miles - Llangurin to Aberystwith .

The report called ‘How Safe are You on Britain’s Roads?’ sponsored by Ageas is to be published today (MON) at a briefing in the House of Lords and notes: ’Once again, the top route is a route that goes through a national park. ‘The safety measures taken so far are not enough to tackle the route. It requires a more far reaching intervention along the 12-mile length of the route which make junctions and roadsides safer in particular.’ The most improved road is the A404 (Amersham) between High Wycombe and Great Missenden in Buckingham shire where a major speed limit review in the county ‘resulted in the route being targetted with a speed limit reduction from 40mph to 30mph through two short sections of one-mile and half-a-mile through Amersham.’ Vehicle activated signs, road resurfacing and junction improvements, new reflective bollards, better street lighting, and renewed cats-eyes, all contributed, said the report. The report also highlights how low cost safety improvements carried out by highway authorities and council to coincide with routine maintenance have helped reduce fatal and serious crashes by 80 per cent on 15 of the previously most dangerous stretches of UK roads. This has seen deaths and serious injuries fall from 237 to 52 in the three years after action was taken. It says: ’The economic value of just these few low cost improvements is estimated at a staggering £0.4billion.’ Across all regions and highways, single carriageways were by far the most dangerous road type for drivers. Pictured: A6 road through the Borrowdale Valley in Cumbria . It points out how improvements including speed reductions on one notorious and ’infamous’ accident black spot – the so-called ‘Cat and Fiddle’ route on the A537 – had seen it fall from being the most dangerous to ‘28th in the list of ‘most improved’ routes. Half of the cost of all fatal crashes on the British road network occurs on the 10 per cent of roads surveyed and mapped in the Foundation’s report, it says. Britain suffers annual serious injury costs alone of £0.3 billion on motorways, £0.6 billion on national trunk roads and £2 billion on local authority ‘A’ roads. It says the safety of roads has not kept pace with safety improvements in cars: ‘We should not be driving five-star cars on one- and two-star roads. It is time to set a national goal that our ‘A’ roads should achieve a minimum three-star safety rating with four- and five-star ratings for our busiest trunk roads and motorways.’ The East Midlands has been revealed as the highest risk region in Britain for the first time . Regional breakdowns show that the risk and cost of death and serious injury on the major roads of the worst performing East Midlands is two thirds higher than the best-performing West Midlands. It notes: ‘This difference is larger than between many countries’. By contrast, the West Midlands and Scotland are the two regions improving most quickly. The report says: ‘The differing risk in each regions is mainly due to the amount of travel there is on safe roads and how much on risky roads. The motorways in the South East have been shown to have the highest risk of all motorways in Britain . However, for single carriageways, the highest risk of accident exists in the North West . ‘Even an average single carriageway ‘A’ road is seven times riskier than a motorway. Some roads represent more than 20 times the risk of others. James Bradford, engineering manager for the Road Safety Foundation said: ‘The busier the road, the more frequently any flaw in layout leads to death and serious injury.’ Road Safety Foundation chairman, Lord Whitty said: ‘We can no longer accept sudden, violent road death as such a significant cause of premature loss of life. The UK government must design, plan and legislate to put safety on roads on the same footing as safety in the air, sea or on rail.’ The dossier complements a second report also published today (MON) by the Road Safety Foundation called ‘Making Road Safety Pay’ which makes recommendations for the Government to adopt in a bid to achieve ‘zero road deaths’ within a decade. These include: a zero Insurance Premium tax (IPT) rate for insured vehicles fitted with a telematics unit for drivers under the age of 25; low speed Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) mandatory as standard on all new cars; and minimum inbuilt 4-star safety rating levels for the busiest national roads and minimum 3-stars for all other national roads by 2025.","Single carriageway from Petworth to Chichester named most dangerous .

"The shambles surrounding Blackpool FC took a dramatic turn on Thursday with the club’s Latvian president Valeri Belokon demanding that the Oyston family spend a final parachute payment worth millions of pounds purely on footballing matters. In an open letter to chairman Karl Oyston and majority shareholder Owen Oyston, which has been seen by MailOnline, Belokon – who owns a 20 per cent stake in the club – also accuses the Oyston family of paying themselves tens of millions of pounds.

"A mummified rat, dating back to the time when the Black Death ravaged Europe, has gone on display at a museum in Cornwall. The rat, which is said to have spent more than six centuries hidden behind the wall of a terraced house in Penryn, was discovered by builders during the late 1990s. And the museum believes the rodent may have been interred in the wall while still alive, to protect the home’s residents from the disease. The rat (pictured) was discovered in the late 1990s in Cornwall. It was originally found covered in black hair, which has since faded. It is said to be more than 650 years old, and experts believe it may have been interred while still alive, to protect the homeowners. But, no evidence of the disease was found on the rat’s body . However, no evidence of the disease was found on the rat’s body. The mummified remains were found during renovations to the staircase at 107 The Terrace, Penryn. It was originally covered in black hair, but this  has faded since the rat was removed. It is thought to have been mummified due to the dry conditions inside the cavity. Typically, microorganisms ‘eat’ the body, causing it to decompose, but in certain conditions, these microorganisms die before they get the chance, meaning the bodies don’t decompose in the same way. Following the discovery, the rat was taken to the Penryn Museum by builders J.R German and David Perry. It was then sent to experts who determined the rat had been undisturbed since the 14th century. The project was overseen by historian Dr Jo Mattingly. The rat was discovered inside a cavity at 107 The Terrace in Penryn (pictured) in the late 1990s, while renovations were being made to the property’s staircase. It was originally covered in black hair, but this has faded since the rat was removed . The rodent is thought to have been one of the millions of rats that spread the plague across Europe between 1346 and 1353. And, scratch marks found on the inside of the cavity suggest it was still alive when it was placed inside the wall. The dates, and these marks, led the museum to speculate that the homeowners deliberately interred it to protect them from the disease. Centuries ago, cats were placed inside walls to ward off evil spirits, and the rat may have been placed in the cavity for a similar reason. Another theory is that it simply got stuck behind the wall by accident. The specimen is on display inside a glass case at the Penryn Museum, whose staff describe it as a ‘prized treasure’ - despite its dark past. The Black Death (illustrated) is thought to have killed between 75 and 200 million people across Europe i the mid-14th century. Recent analysis of DNA from victims indicated the pathogen responsible for the plague was the Yersinia pestis bacterium . The Black Death is thought to have killed between 75 and 200 million people across Europe during the mid-14th century. Recent analysis of DNA from victims indicated the pathogen responsible for the plague was the Yersinia pestis bacterium. It is believed to have originated in central Asia, before reaching the Crimea by 1346. It then travelled across Europe until 1353. Rats are thought to have carried infected fleas on merchant ships throughout the Mediterranean and Europe. Research suggests it took 150 years for Europe's population to recover from the effects of the plague. The perfectly preserved rodent is thought to have been one of the millions of rats that spread this disease. It is currently on display at the Penryn Museum in Cornwall, whose staff describe is as a ‘prized treasure’ - despite its dark past.

"One of Britain’s biggest family house builders is moving into the retirement market to cater for the UK’s rapidly aging population. Barratt Homes - the firm that has epitomised property-owning Britain got the last three decades - is changing the way it designs and builds homes to try and tempt older homeowners. The company typically builds four-bedroom homes aimed at young families. It is now going to offer homes designed with a larger master suite and two more flexible bedrooms or studies. Scroll down for video . Barratt Homes, which typically builds family-size homes, is now going to design homes aimed at the over 55s . This is to try and tap into the growing market of over-55s who own their own homes but whose children have now fled the nest. At the same time, one of the largest specialist builders of sheltered accomodation and retirement homes, McCarthy & Stone, is also launching a ‘lifestyle range’ aimed at the over-55s - yet to retire but looking at more convenient, smaller accomodation. Homes in Britain are increasingly owned by older generations. Three-quarters of people aged 60 and over own their own home, whereas less than a third of those aged 25 to 34 do, according to the Office for National Statistics. And the younger group struggling to get a foot on the property ladder is forecast to grow by just 5 per cent over the next 20 years, while the number of those 60 and over in the UK is expected to double to 21m. Barratt is the first mainstream UK house builder to move into the retirement market. The over-55s housing market in Britain is dominated by a handful of specialist providers. However, these usually cater for the more elderly and infirm and there is not many alternatives for healthy people. A retirement flat in Porthcawl, built by McCarthy and Stone - one of the largest specialist builders of sheltered accomodation and retirement homes . Mark Clare, Barratt chief executive, told the Financial Times: ‘There is a growing segment of non-mortgage-constrained affluent downsizers – people who don’t need a mortgage in order to move house. ‘But if they thought for one minute you were trying to sell them retirement housing they would run a mile. They are not aged and infirm, they’re likely to be fit and active. They are not elderly, they’ve got full lives.’ The government has been trying to encourage downsizing to free up family homes but progress has been slow because of a lack of appealing alternatives for the over-55s. While some homeowners are lucky enough to be mortgage free, or have plans to downsize from a larger property, many people in their 50s will still have a mortgage.

"Computers in Whitehall were used to make insulting alterations to Wikipedia entries about the Hillsborough disaster, it emerged on Thursday. The Cabinet Office has pledged to make ‘urgent inquiries’ into the anonymous changes, which were made over three years. They began on the 20th anniversary of the April 1989 tragedy when ‘blame Liverpool fans’ was added to the online encyclopaedia. Tragedy: Supporters are crushed against the barrier as disaster strikes before the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in Sheffield on April 15, 1989 . The words ‘nothing for the victims of the Heysel stadium disaster’ were also added to a description of the Hillsborough memorial at the Anfield stadium. Computers on Whitehall’s secure intranet were used again in 2012 to change the phrase ‘You’ll never walk alone’ to ‘You’ll never walk again’. Further abusive revisions were traced to IP addresses of computers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Treasury and the Solicitor General’s office. On another occasion, the description of a statue of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on the Anfield Wikipedia page was revised to change the well-known quote ‘He made the people happy’ to the bizarre ‘He made a wonderful lemon drizzle cake’. Edit: The description of a statue of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on the Anfield Wikipedia page was revised to change the well-known quote 'He made the people happy'. The statue is pictured here at its unveiling in 1997 . The revelations came to light after 34 IP addresses of Whitehall computers were disclosed via a parliamentary question. 'We’ve sat listening to the most heartbreaking accounts of that day, and then you hear about things like this' Sheila Coleman, Hillsborough Justice Campaign . Analysis of Wikipedia’s revision history revealed at least two of these unique ID codes were used to amend the Hillsborough and Anfield pages with the sick comments. An investigation has now been launched. Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, described the references as ‘absolutely disgusting’ and said the families of the 96 victims who perished at the FA cup semi-final would demand a formal inquiry. Remembered: Players from Manchester City and Liverpool line up for a minute's silence on April 13 in front of fans at Anfield displaying cards to form a message in remembrance of the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives . She said: ‘We’re still in the inquests and we’ve sat listening to the most heartbreaking accounts of that day, and then you hear about things like this. It’s absolutely appalling, disgraceful. 'I hear something like that and it upsets me a great deal, it makes me incredibly sad' Margaret Aspinall, Hillsborough Family Support Group . ‘It’s shocking that these comments came from within the Government, no matter how spurious. 'The fact is that these changes came from within the Government and that’s very saddening. It warrants an investigation and we will be seeking formal advice from our legal team.’ Margaret Aspinall, of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said: ‘I don’t even know how to react, it’s just so sad. Investigation: The Cabinet Office (pictured) has pledged to make 'urgent inquiries' into the anonymous changes . 'I hear something like that and it upsets me a great deal, it makes me incredibly sad. I’m glad somebody has found out about it but I’m frightened to be honest that we haven’t known until now.’ 'This is a matter that we will treat with the utmost seriousness and are making urgent inquiries' Cabinet Office spokesman . Establishing exactly which computer or individual was responsible could be difficult as it is understood the IP addresses cover thousands of Whitehall computers. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘This is a matter that we will treat with the utmost seriousness and are making urgent inquiries. ‘No one should be in any doubt of the government’s position regarding the Hillsborough disaster and its support for the families of the 96 victims and all those who have been affected by the tragedy.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","'Urgent inquiries' by Cabinet Office into changes made over three years .

"Meet the ordinary families and couples who believe less is more. They choose to live with just enough furniture, hardly any clothes and a bare minimum of worldly possessions in a bid to declutter their lives and turn their backs on overconsumption. It's called minimalism - a choice to live with less stuff so they can have more time and money for the things they consider to be more important. Scroll down for video . Brooke and Ben McAlary chose to lead a minimalist lifestyle three years ago with their five-year-old daughter Isla and three-year-old son Toby . When Brooke McAlary first decided to take up minimalist living, the 33-year-old, her husband Ben and two children Isla, 5, and Toby, 3, threw out a whopping 20,000 items from their Blue Mountains home in NSW. That was three years ago and their home is even less cluttered today. 'We're pretty close to not having to declutter at all any more,' Ms McAlary told Daily Mail Australia. 'The only thing that's stopping us is that we do have two young kids and they grow out of clothes and toys, so every three months I'm decluttering. 'I'm finding things that were once sentimental or important six months ago aren't any more and I've now been able to let them go.' Brooke McAlary's wardrobe is now practically empty after she threw out a whopping 20,000 items from her Blue Mountains home in NSW . Ms McAlary, who blogs about her minimalist lifestyle, said her family stopped shopping for things they wanted and opted to only spend money on things they need. 'We typically only spend money on bills and food on a weekly basis,' she said. 'We have just enough furniture. There's no knick-knacks and we have a wall with some family photos. 'We've got two lounges and an armchair and dining chairs. We generally just shuffle furniture when needed. The kids just have a bed and a small bookshelf in their rooms and they have a handful of toys.' Ms McAlary, who blogs about her minimalist lifestyle, said her family stopped shopping for things they wanted and opted to only spend money on things they need . The couple say they have 'just enough furniture' to get by, including two lounges and several dining chairs . Ms McAlary says their family home has very knick-knacks and is clutter free . Mark Douglass and Jess Geerligs from The Entrance on the NSW Central Coast got rid of half the stuff they owned when they opted for the minimalist lifestyle in 2011. 'I was $13,500 in credit card debt. In a year, I had paid off the debt and was $10,000 on top.  That was on a part time job. I couldn't remember a time where I didn't have a credit card debt,' he said. 'We donated our stuff, gave to friends and sold on eBay. I was a bit of a bad eBay buyer and so now the tables have turned. 'I used to work as a magician and I fell into this trap of buying props and trick DVDs. Somehow I became a collector and had too much stuff - I had 500 items of magic that I had to get rid of.' Mark Douglass and Jess Geerligs from The Entrance on the NSW Central Coast got rid of half the stuff they owned when they opted for the minimalist lifestyle in 2011 . While the couple have chosen to live more simply, Mr Douglass, who also blogs about his experiences, said they don't deprive themselves of things they want. 'There's quite a few things I would never part with... like my laptop. I only have my favourite things. I don't have my favourites thing and 100 other things I kind of like,' he said. Brooke McAlary writes a blog on all things minimalist. Here are her tips on how to de-clutter: . The McAlary family also wiped clean any debts they had by choosing the minimalist lifestyle. 'We had a credit card debt, it wasn't staggering but it was enough. We were able to pay that off. Typically the money we would have been spending on useless stuff we can now spend on travelling,' Ms McAlary said. While her family has embraced minimalism, Ms McAlary said some found their lifestyle choice difficult to understand, especially around Christmas or birthdays when  presents were an option. 'We will gratefully receive gifts, we're not jerks about it. But that's when I sort of most notice the difference,' she said. 'It's really difficult, particularly with grandparents, my overall kind of rule is relationships before stuff. If someone is going to be really upset about you returning a gift, then don't do it. 'Before a birthday or Christmas, we'll do a big purge, which will give room for whatever we do receive.' The couple completely de-cluttered their home and now only keep possessions they really want . Mr Douglass was ruthless with his wardrobe after realising he had clothes he hadn't worn in 12 months .","Brooke McAlary and her family threw out 20,000 items from their Blue Mountains home when they first took up minimalist living .

The new all-aluminium, eight-speed coupe is the hard-top sibling of the existing open-topped F-Type Roadster. Up to half the aluminium used in the car is recycled, and there’s an option of a panoramic glass roofpanel in place of a standard roof. Prices start at £51,235 for the supercharged three-litre V6 F-Type Coupe, which develops 340 bhp, has a top speed of 161 mph and accelerates from rest to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds.

A thousand factory robots — and five times as many people — put the new Mini on the road this week, but it’s so crammed with high-tech gadgets that Britain’s best-loved small car is much larger than the original. Half-a-century after Sir Alec Issigonis designed his ‘10 ft square box’, it’s grown in girth. It’s 2½ ft longer, 7in wider and 2in taller than the 1959 original. Designed to fit four people, plus luggage, the new Mini hatchback is 'completely new from the ground up' with every component replaced, reworked or redesigned . The extra inches are to make room for ‘enhanced’ shoulder space, larger footwells and more wriggle room for adjusting front seats, with bases lengthened by an inch for extra comfort and support. Boot space has been increased by around a third. The new Mini had its world premiere at Mini’s Oxford factory before VIP guests, including Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. Designed to fit four people, plus luggage, the hatchback is 'completely new from the ground up’ with every component replaced, reworked or redesigned. There are three versions: the basic Mini Cooper, the diesel engined Cooper D and the Cooper S. It goes on sale in spring, priced from £15,300 to £18,650. New technology includes a large fighter aircraft-style head-up display, camera-based cruise-controlthat keeps you a set distance from the vehicle in front, a collision and pedestrian warning system, which applies the brakes, and a self- . parking assistant with camera. Also, the satnav ‘reads’ the road ahead and fine-tunes automatic gear-changes to make them more fuel-efficient. Thanks to three new turbocharged, but fuel-efficient engines, the Cooper S petrol version will accelerate from rest to 62 mph in just 6.7 seconds, up to a top speed of 145 mph. The new Cooper D diesel version offers average fuel efficiency of more than 80.7 mpg, or 90 mpg when cruising. __________________________________________________________ .

"British backpacker David Miller may have been trying to save Hannah Witheridge as she was being attacked on a Thai beach when the pair were brutally murdered, new evidence suggests. The 24-year-old from Jersey was captured on CCTV at around 1am on the night of his death, leading to claims the pair were not in fact together as Thai Police previously claimed. Traces of Miss Witheridge's DNA and that of one other person were found on a cigarette butt some 50 yards from where her body was found, suggesting the 23-year-old shared it with her attackers and even had a conversation with them before being killed. Scroll down for video . David Miller (left) may have been trying to help Hannah Witheridge (right) as she was being attacked by a group on the Thai island of Koh Tao last Sunday, new evidence suggests . The bodily fluids of two men found during forensic investigation are now thought to belong to Asian men, police revealed. The new developments come as police said they were hunting a western woman seen running near the beach in Koh Tao on Sunday. Police refer to Westerners as ‘foreigners’ but officers would not comment whether the woman might turn out to be Hannah Witheridge herself, fleeing from the killer or killers who were to soon battered her to death on . Koh Tao’s idyllic Sairee Beach. Thai police inquiries have been branded a 'joke' by locals after investigators mistakenly identified a couple in CCTV footage walking hand-in-hand as the murdered Brits. CCTV footage of the woman - who might also turn out to be a terrified witness to the double murders - has yet to be released. The FBI has been called in to assist , as officials concede they do not have sophisticated enough forensic technology. Yesterday bar and restaurant staff were lined up on the beach and had their feet compared to footprints found near where the youngsters' bodies were found last week. It comes as General Poompanmoung of Thai Police told MailOnline today that the team were not closing in on any suspects and agreed that he did not know whether the killers were still on the island. Asked specifically whether they could have already left, he nodded in agreement. The movements of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller in the hours leading up to their murders added to the mystery of their deaths as it was confirmed that CCTV footage of a couple walking hand in hand - said early to be the Britons - were not them after all. Thai police yesterday were measuring the feet of bar and restaurant staff after examining footprints left in sand near where the victims' bodies were discovered . Workers were forced to hold up signs with their names and a number on it as officials took their feet size and DNA n what has been branded a 'joke' by local people . Thai police have been criticised for leading a chaotic investigation into the deaths of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge in which the line of inquiry has changed several times. Here, a breakdown of the investigation shows how the frantic hunt for backpackers' killers has unfolded. September 15: The semi-naked bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller are discovered between 5am and 6am on Sairee Beach in Koh Tao on September 15. A British male, thought to have known the two, was named as a person of interested and hunted by police after allegedly fleeing the island on an early ferry for Bangkok. Later, police released CCTV footage which they claimed showed the students walking hand-in-hand down a street. It was later revealed the couple in the images were not Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller. Images of a migrant worker spotted later on the same CCTV tape are circulated, with police describing the man as a person of interest. September 16: DNA samples taken from the scene do not match those of any of a reported 12 suspects. Officers claimed they had 'strong evidence' to link six Burmese workers to the gruesome murders, though no forensic links could be made. Samples were taken from nine migrant workers and three foreigners including two brothers from Jersey who were friends of David Miller. Christopher and James Ware were stopped at Suvarnabhumi International airport on their way back to Britain for questioning. The brothers were never arrested. September 17: Thai police admit they have 'no idea' who killed David Miller and Hannah Witheridge after failing to link any of 12 suspects to the crime. They said it was 'difficult to say' whether the pair's killer or killers was still on the island, and then claimed investigations had pointed them to a group seen on the beach playing the guitar and singing 'western songs'. Earlier Thai Prime Minister said it girls wearing bikinis on the holiday island of Koh Tao were not safe unless they were ugly. 'Can they be safe in bikinis ... unless they are not beautiful?' said General Prayuth Chan-O-Cha in a televised speech. He later apologised for his remarks. Police later say Miss Witheridge may not have been raped as first suggested following an autopsy on her body. September 18: Police claim DNA from two men alongside that of Miss Witheridge has been discovered on a cigarette butt 50 yards from where the 23-year-old's body was found. They say traces of at least one man's DNA has been found on Miss Witheridge's body. Later it transpires there is evidence of one man's DNA on the cigarette, and of two men in the victim's body. It is suggested David Miller was killed with a blunt piece of metal and not the rusty garden hoe first discovered at the scene and named as a murder weapon. Evidence suggests the brave 24-year-old put up a fight before his death and that he was drowned. September 19: Thai officials collect DNA samples from workers in bars and restaurants in Koh Tao. Lining people along the beach, they measured their feet in order to make a comparison to footprints left in the sand near the murdered Brits' bodies. September 20: Investigators now say there is no evidence to suggest Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were together on the day they died, with CCTV footage showing Mr Miller walking alone at around 1am. It is claimed Miss Witheridge encountered her attackers, had a conversation with them and may have even shared a cigarette with them before being dragged to her death. There is a suggestion Mr Miller was coming to her aid when he was also killed. A CCTV video of a woman running near the scene is described but not released. Police say it could be of a witness to the double murder, a suspect or of Miss Witheridge herself. The FBI is called in to help analyse forensic evidence as the hunt for the pair's killers goes in to its sixth day. Thai police efforts are blasted a 'joke' by residents. New CCTV footage has emerged of Mr . Miller walking alone along the restaurant and club strip in the early . hours of Monday. The first clip was recorded as 1.27am, while the . second, in which he is seen walking in the opposite direction – towards . what would become the scene of his death – was captured at 1.56am. The DNA samples of a Thai worker is taken as investigators continue struggling to produce a suspect in the investigation . Where . both he and Miss Witheridge were in the intervening half an hour . remains a mystery. Divers were among officers continuing . the search for a second weapon yesterday. One was seen waist-deep in the . water drawing up sand with a rake. Police believe the killers used a garden . hoe – which has been found – to batter Miss Witheridge and a ‘metal . weapon’ to bludgeon Mr Miller. The evidence of a second weapon has left . police with what one officer today described as ‘unquestioned proof’ that at least two killers were involved. But one expatriate was critical of the . Thai police, who have been criticised for the haphazard nature of the . investigation. ‘All this activity leaves you with a feeling that this is . too little, too late,’ said the businessman, who declined to be named. ‘Surely anything of any use would have been washed away or stomped on by . now.’ The General replied with mixed answers when asked specifically whether post mortem examinations on the bodies had revealed the presence of drugs. At first he said no, then he said he did not know and when pressed one of his aides said such questions should not be asked ‘out of respect for the victims and the families’. Earlier it was claimed it was possible the Britons had either walked past their killers, who were lurking in the shadows between the lights of late-night waterside bars, or they were followed and attacked when they were on the beach beside boulders close to their holiday bungalows. As divers searched for the weapon, police finally conceded they were finding the double-murder 'quite difficult' An autopsy showed that Mr Miller had been struck with a metal bar, rather than the garden hoe used to strike Miss Witheridge . Tourists take pictures at Sairee beach spot where Mr Miller and Hannah Witheridge were killed on Monday . Tourists continued to arrive at the island today where local businesses are hopeful the double murder doesn't ruin the islands reputation . Relatives of the pair arrived in Bangkok on Thursday as police struggle to examine forensic evidence due to lack of technology . Thailand's prime minister today apologised for suggesting tourists in bikinis made themselves more vulnerable - comments which provoked outrage around the world. In an extraordinary outburst yesterday, General Prayuth Chan-O-Cha (right) suggested that only ugly tourists were safe when wearing beach wear. His remark appeared to blame murdered Briton Hannah Witheridge for exposing herself to a brutal attack on the paradise island of Koh Tao. In a speech broadcast live on Thai TV yesterday, he said: ‘There are always problems with tourist safety. ‘They think our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want, they can wear bikinis and walk everywhere. Can they be safe in bikinis ... unless they are not beautiful?’ He was last night accused of smearing a murdered British backpacker to protect his country’s tourism industry. Andrew Rosindell, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: 'What is most worrying about these comments is the underlying implication about those who have been murdered that they have somehow brought it upon themselves.' In a hastily convened press conference in Bangkok today, Prayut said: 'I'm sorry that it hurt people. 'I didn't intend to insult or criticise anyone. I just warned that sometimes people have to be careful... today Thailand is safe except there are some bad guys - like anywhere in the world.'","New evidence suggests the pair were not together at all on night of murders .

Those in charge of the 'Ferguson October' events are expecting 6,000 participants for the four-day event. But the initial protest Friday outside the St. Louis County prosecutor's office in Clayton didn't draw nearly that amount. Later Friday, tensions increased, with hundreds of people amassing outside the Ferguson Police Department and chanting anti-police slogans such as, 'Killer cops, KKK, how many kids did you kill today?' as a wall of about 100 officers in riot gear stood near them.

Some 300 people stood in the middle of the street screaming out: 'My hands on my head. Please don't shoot me dead' and 'Who shuts it down? We shut it down!' Roughly 30 regularly uniformed police officers stood guard outside the department. Soon after, most of the crowd left, with organizers urging people to avoid arrest so that they could come back for more protests throughout the weekend. Protesters renewed their call for prosecutor Bob McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson officer, in the August 9 death of Michael Brown, an armed black teenager. A grand jury is reviewing the case, and the US Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Brown's death and a broader inquiry into the Ferguson police force. 'We are here to demand the justice that our people have died for,' chanted protest organizer Montague Simmons of the local group Organization for Black Struggle. 'We are here to bring peace, to bring restoration, to lift our banners in the name of those who've been sacrificed.' In Clayton, officers escorted the several hundred demonstrators through the suburb's downtown as they marched past high-end restaurants, jewelry stores, banks and law offices in the rain, before the protests moved to Ferguson. After the Ferguson demonstration broke up, some protesters planned to go to the site of a police shooting in St. Louis.

People's demand: Protesters call for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch to withdraw from the investigation surrounding the death of Michael Brown . Meanwhile, the St. Louis Police Department announced it had encrypted its radio communications system, saying tactical information relayed to officers had been compromised during recent events, putting officer and the public at risk. Tensions remain high in the wake of another black 18-year-old's shooting death by a white police officer Wednesday night in St. Louis. Police say Vonderrit D. Myers shot at the St. Louis officer, who was in uniform but working off-duty for a private neighborhood security patrol. Myers' parents say he was unarmed. The officer's name hasn't been released. 'It's important for this country to stand with this community,' said protester Ellen Davidson of New York City, who was making her second trip to the St. Louis area since Brown's death. 'This community is under siege. ... The eyes of the world are watching.' On Saturday, the protests shift to downtown St. Louis, hours before the Cardinals host the San Francisco Giants in the first game of the National League Championship Series. And on Monday, a series of planned — but unannounced — acts of civil disobedience are to take place throughout the St. Louis region. 'I'm not planning to get arrested,' said Davidson, who was meeting up with other protesters from Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Tennessee. 'But I do plan to do what I believe are in my rights as a protester. If I get arrested, that's on the people who arrest me.' Outcry: Protesters march in the streets of Clayton, Missouri, near the St. Louis County Courthouse . Rain or shine: Bad weather did nothing to stop a protest against the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown . Protesters are calling for the arrest of Darren Wilson, the white Ferguson officer who killed Brown . Officers escorted the several hundred demonstrators through the suburb's downtown as they marched past high-end restaurants, jewelry stores, banks and law offices . Brown's parents, the local chapter of the NAACP and other organizations called for peaceful protests ahead of the 'Ferguson October' events. 'We understand first-hand the powerless frustration felt by people of all walks of life regarding their interactions with law enforcement,' they said in a statement. 'We ask that those coming to show support for our son do so within the law.' St. Louis police arrested eight people Thursday as hundreds gathered to protest Myers' death. At one point officers used pepper spray to force protesters back. A police spokeswoman said one officer was struck in the arm after someone threw a brick, and several cars were damaged. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said authorities are planning for large crowds and possible violence. Black leaders in St. Louis want the Justice Department to investigate Myers' shooting as well. Police said the officer fired 17 rounds after Myers shot at him. Preliminary autopsy results show a shot to the head killed Myers. The officer wasn't injured. Online court documents show Myers was free on bond when he was killed. He had been charged with the unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest in June.","Friday's protest kicked off a weekend of 'Ferguson October' events .

"The NHS could need an extra £8billion over the next five years from the Government to fill a black hole in its budget. It now receives about £110billion a year, an amount which has been ring-fenced from the public spending cuts that have hit other Whitehall departments over the past five years. A report on how to save money by reducing hospital admissions states that under a worst case scenario the NHS will have a deficit of £30billion a year by 2020/21. Budget black hole: A report on how to save money by reducing hospital admissions states that under a worst case scenario the NHS will have a deficit of £30billion a year by 2020/21 . This is because of the ever-increasing costs of caring for an ageing population, coping with rising obesity rates and paying for more expensive new drugs. David Bennett, chief executive of the hospital regulator Monitor, said the NHS budget would need to increase by at least an additional 1.5 per cent excluding inflation. This would amount to £1.6billion extra – but Mr Bennett said it would probably need even more to cover the costs of the changes recommended by the report. In addition, the NHS would need to make unprecedented ‘efficiency’ savings to its own budget of between 2 and 3 per cent a year. This could lead to further rationing of treatments such as cataracts and hip and knee replacements and cuts to frontline staff. NHS England chief: Simon Stevens (pictured) wants to avoid patients having to go to hospital wherever possible by improving health services closer to home . Over the past five years it has been making annual savings of just 1 per cent – and these have resulted in heavy cutbacks. Measures suggested in the money-saving report include: . Firms should reward staff with iPads, cash prizes or vouchers for losing weight, according to the head of the NHS. Simon Stevens says stopping patients becoming ill in the first place – chiefly by tackling obesity – will save money. He is also urging bosses to hold Weight Watchers sessions and lunchtime running clubs for staff. In return, the employers would receive Government tax breaks. ‘We’re going to absolutely have to up our game across the board in terms of prevention and public health,’ said Mr Stevens. ‘The large increase in obesity is associated in large rise in diabetes and we are now spending £10billion a year treating diabetes.’ Mr Stevens lost nearly three stone thanks to a weight-loss incentive scheme at his previous job, the US insurance firm United Healthcare. His report also includes plans to recruit an army of volunteers to help feed elderly dementia patients in hospital or care for them in their own homes. The Conservatives have promised that if they remain in power following next year’s election they will continue to ring-fence the NHS budget, but not necessarily increase it. Labour meanwhile have said they will increase it by £2.5billion a year on top of inflation – although that money will not arrive until 2017. Ed Miliband, the party’s leader, last month announced that the funding would be raised by a mansion tax, revenue from tobacco firms and cracking down on tax avoidance. But he later conceded that these would all require legalisation before they could be implemented and the money would take at least two years to come through. His claims that the money would be spent on more nurses have also been questioned by those who point out that the NHS is already billions in debt. Simon Stevens, the NHS chief behind the report, said today that pay freezes are not the solution. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ‘NHS staff have made a huge sacrifice during this period of global economic recession and austerity. 'Over the next five years, the same is not going to continue to be successful. ‘We are going to have to fundamentally change the way care is organised. ‘A pay freeze is not an option. We will have to compete with pay rates across the rest of the continent if we are going to attract the best, most committed staff.’ ‘We have actually had big increases in the number of skilled health professionals working in the NHS in the last 15 years. ‘We know that there are real pressures - people are working incredibly hard, that’s why we have got to change.’ Despite fears of increasing privatisation, he also insisted that the 'vast majority' of health services would continue to be delivered by the NHS in the future, but added it was ultimately the patient's choice. ‘Most health services are delivered in this country by the NHS,' he said. 'That’s bound to continue to be the case under any foreseeable future. The test is we should think like a patient, and act like a taxpayer. ’94 pence in every pound is going to NHS providers. It is not the case that all work is going to private companies. ‘I think that the vast majority of services will continue to be delivered by the NHS. But ultimately patients are the people that should make the choice.’ He added: ‘It’s an important debate, but it’s not the main debate. There are much bigger issues – we are growing as a population, the kinds of diseases we are now responding to is very different from 20 years ago. ‘My commitment is to the NHS. It’s where my career started. If I didn’t fundamentally believe in the values of the NHS, I certainly wouldn’t have taken in this job in what I’m sure most people will agree is a difficult time. 'I’m actually very optimistic.' Mr Stevens wants to avoid patients having to go to hospital wherever possible by improving health services closer to home. He said: ‘There are big changes to the way in which care is going to be provided and that is going to take national and local efforts. ‘The NHS is now at a crossroads – as a country we need to decide which way to go. ‘It is perfectly possible to improve and sustain the NHS over the next five years in a way that the public and the patients want.’","NHS now receives £110bn a year, ring-fenced from public spending cuts .

"The act of sex with a new person can often be an embarrassing experience. But it appears carrying out the motions in a brightly lit room full of people, cameras and sound equipment with a man shouting directions is mortifying. A new video has surfaced on-line that shows a behind-the-scenes look at what it's like for actors when they have to pretend to make love for a part on a movie. The two-minute clip shows Brooklyn Decker and Patrick Wilson acting out a sex scene for a film that they co-starred in called Stretch, with a running commentary from the director Joe Carnahan throughout. Scroll down for video . Brooklyn Decker and Patrick Wilson are seen joking around in a moment in between takes for a sex scene on a film they co-starred in called Stretch . A member of the make-up team is on hand in between takes to spray fake sweat onto Patrick Wilson . The scene opens with Patrick lying naked on top of Brooklyn, with the noise of several crew members busy at work in the background . Shortly after Joe tells the actors to 'Knock a couple of these [sex scenes] out,' Patrick asks Brooklyn if she feels okay. The actress replies that everything is fine and that she was just moving 'it', referring to Patrick's private parts. Then the volume on a track by James Brown is turned up and  the sex scene starts, with Joe telling the actors that he is going to: 'Let Big James show you the rhythm, ready and action!’ Brooklyn and Patrick oblige with 20 seconds of simulating sex before Patrick pauses deadpan and says, ‘And then I’m out.’ The director cuts in laughing and says, ‘Nice, that was great! All right guys, do another one like that and we’ve got it, I swear to God.’ Patrick asks, ‘Was that enough f***ing?' And director replies, ‘That was a lot of f***ing, great f***ing!’ While Brooklyn laughs. The actors are then sprayed with fake sweat before another member of the crew gives them directions. Although they are being watched by several members of the crew, Patrick manages to share a joke with Brooklyn . When director Joe Carnahan shouts 'Action' Brooklyn and Patrick start to simulate sex . The director then says to Brooklyn, ‘Babe, when you’re looking at him, really engage with him, like you don’t want to let his eyes go. And then give him a little back pat, as if to say, “You did so great.”’ Referring to his faked climax, Patrick then asks, ‘Do you like no words or do you think Stretch is a guy who tells you what he’s going to do?’ The director responds, ‘Oh absolutely, I think he definitely does.’ The clip ends with Joe telling Brooklyn, 'And then babe you should go, “Good, good, good, yes, come, come, come.”’ Several high-profile actors have spoken out in the past about the awkwardness of filming Hollywood sex scenes. Brooklyn and Patrick have several close-up kisses , with a camera right next to the bed focused on their faces . Patrick Wilson takes direction froma member of the film crew while Brooklyn looks on . Keira Knightley claims her intimate moments opposite James McAvoy in the 2007 film Attonement were some of her most cringe-worthy because they were good friends outside of work. She said: 'There's a scene where we're having sex up against a book shelf as you do. 'And it's with the lovely James McAvoy who's a friend, and it's always really awkward because he's a friend. 'And we're in the middle of it and suddenly this voice shouts, 'Keira! W*** him off!' Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson has revealed that having to act out sex scenes usually involves an audience of several men on set. He said: 'People don't know when they're looking at the film that there's 15 guys standing around and a guy with a sandwich who's shouting, ""Faster!'"" 'It's kind of tough for us too, because you come into a room and say, ""Okay, so where can I touch you? Where can I not touch you?

"Garry Monk insists his Swansea City side are not over-reliant on Wilfried Bony's goals. Bony has supplied over a third of Swansea's Barclays Premier League goals, as well eight of the last 13, and captain Ashley Williams said after last weekend's 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham that they must find a way to lift the scoring burden on the Ivorian. The 26-year-old's importance to Swansea could be underlined next month when he is away at the African Nations Cup, but Monk refutes the suggestion they are a one-man team. 'We're very much a collective here and it's not just about Wilfried scoring goals,' Monk said at his press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Hull. Wilfried Bony celebrates scoring against Tottenham in last weekend's Premier League clash at the Liberty . The goal was Bony's eighth in his last 10 Premier League appearances . 'The way we've produced the chances for Wilfried to contribute shows that. 'Yes, that's not to say there's six or seven players producing goals freely but look at the league and there's no massive amount of variation apart from the top teams. 'We create chances for each other and we don't care who scores as long as the team wins and we are creating those chances and someone's there to put in the back of the net.' Monk must cover the absence of Bony and midfielder Ki Sung-yueng who is set to skipper South Korea at the 2015 Asian Cup in Australia next month following the New Year's day trip to QPR. The pair will not return to Swansea until the start of February. Ki has been an ever-present in the league this season but Monk says he will only add players to his squad during the January transfer window if they are the right fit for the club. Swansea manager Garry Monk insists his side are not over-reliant on the Ivorian striker . Bony has scored more Premier League goals in 2014 than any other player . 'We've got a very good squad and I'm not going to be making wholesale changes at all,' Monk said. 'There are certain positions we will look to strengthen and if we can get the right player to fit into the squad that's the only time I'll do business. 'Other than that we'll go with what we've got. I've got full confidence in the squad right now and it's just adding quality to accompany what we've got. 'When Bony and Ki are out for that period it's for someone to step up to that level.' Ninth-placed Swansea head to Hull on the back of two straight league defeats and the omens ahead of their trip to the Humber are not good. They have failed to score on their three previous visits to the KC Stadium and a 1-0 defeat there in April ranks among one of their poorest performances under Monk. Ki Sung-Yueng is set to represent South Korea at next month's Asian Games . Monk looks on as Harry Kane goes down under the challenge of Wayne Routledge . But Hull have won only once at home all season and have dropped into the bottom two after going nine games without a win. 'Every team in this league is a different challenge, the way they set up and the different personnel and styles they have,' Monk said. 'It's getting your team to concentrate on themselves but adjust enough to know where the threats are from the other team. 'I would imagine they're looking at this game to turn around their form. 'They've got a very experienced manager who will be looking at how to get them back to winning ways and we expect a very difficult game. 'Hull will be different to what we've played before, so the challenge for us is to perform well enough to take the points.'","Wilfried Bony has scored eight of Swansea City's last 13 league goals .

"Blackpool boss Lee Clark sees no reason why his new employers cannot start dreaming of top-flight football again in the near future, despite the fact they are already seven points adrift of safety in the Sky Bet Championship. On Thursday the Seasiders announced that Clark would take the reins at Bloomfield Road just 10 days after fellow Sky Bet Championship strugglers Birmingham parted company with him following two seasons at St Andrew's. His brief hiatus from the game was swiftly ended by the only club below Blues in the table, as Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston opted to bring Clark on board after the inevitable sacking of embattled boss Jose Riga on Monday. Lee Clark has joined Blackpool after leaving Birmingham, who are also in trouble in the championship . Clark understands that Blackpool face a struggle to stay in the Championship, but is looking upwards . The task facing Clark, who is the Seasiders' fourth manager of this calendar year, appears gargantuan, with the Fylde coast club having won just once all season and only four times in the past 11 months. Yet the 42-year-old has set his sights much higher than just safety this term after recalling Blackpool's one season in the Barclays Premier League in 2010-11. Speaking to TangerineTV, Clark said: 'I'm just pleased to be back in the game and back in a management position in the Championship with a club that not too long ago was living the dream in the Premier League. 'Can we bring those good times back to the club? That has to be started with the club stabilising and staying in the Championship and then we can push on from there again. Why not? The club's done it in the past - why can't it do it in the future?' The former Birmingham boss has only been out of work for 10 days after being sacked by the midlands club . In the short term, there is no escaping the fact Blackpool desperately need points if they are to avoid a fate which almost befell Clark's Birmingham last term. On a dramatic final day of the season at Bolton last May, Paul Caddis' strike three minutes into stoppage time kept Blues up on goal difference at the expense of Doncaster. Clark may have to rely on similar heroics to get Blackpool out of their current rut, yet it is a prospect which he is not daunted by. 'It is a big challenge because of our position in the league but it's a challenge which can be overcome,' he said. Blackpool are seven points from safety after a dire start to the season, including this defeat to Derby . 'If we achieve what we're setting out to achieve - which is staying in the league - it will be a tremendous feat by the whole group, but I'm very confident with the players I've got here in going forward that we can achieve those goals.' Former Huddersfield boss Clark also insists the thought of taking a lengthy break away from football after his time at Birmingham never came into his mind. He added: 'I love the game. The longest I've been out was my time between Huddersfield and Birmingham, which was three-and-a-half, four months. 'It's what I know, what I love, I enjoy this job and I'm determined to give everything I can by working night and day to help us achieve our primary goal and our short-term objective which is to stay in the Championship.' Clark is keen to bring back the 'glory' days of 2010, Blackpool's only season in the Premier League .","New Blackpool boss says promotion is a possibility in near future .

"He seemed like an ordinary suburban man and father of four, but Ali Reza Sonmez was abducted and murdered in an execution style killing and his body dumped in a river across a state border. NSW Police are now acting on the possibility that 44-year-old Sonmez may have had a secret, dark past, and  have travelled to South Australia to investigate the posting of a mysterious letter interstate. It is almost 28 years since the disappearance of Sonmez, a disabled pensioner of Turkish descent who lived quietly with his family in Mildura, Victoria. Mr Sonmez left his home at around 5pm on January 23, 1986. Witnesses saw him walking along the footpath of Ninth St, Mildura, past the Mobil service station. Scroll down for video . Gangland killing: Ali Sonmez was abducted and murdered execution style in January 1986, and the killing of this father-of-four has confounded police for nearly three decades . Lonely spot: Turkish-born Ali Sonmez, 44, disappeared off a street in Merbein, Victoria and his bullet-ridden body was found by fishermen at a lonely spot on the Darling River (pictured) three days later . Do you know this man: Police released this snapshot (above) of this as yet unidentified man who is possibly of Turkish descent. The photo was found in the glove box of murdered Ali Sonmez's car following his murder . About 90 minutes later, Mr Sonmez was seen 11km away, outside the post office in Merbein, a tiny town  northwest of Mildura on the banks of the Murray River. A witness saw him argue with a man who was standing on the street with two women. No further known sightings were reported of Mr Sonmez alive. On the afternoon of January 25, 1986 Mr Sonmez's family reported him missing and the following morning, on Australia Day, fishermen on the Darling River 20km north of the NSW border town of Wentworth discovered a body snagged in the water. When forensic police examined it, they found several bullet holes. Com-fit photo of the man Ali Somnez was seen arguing with on the evening he disappeared in the tiny town of Merbein, Victoria . Ali Sonmez had been shot above each eye, in the back of the head and sustained other bullet wounds.  His body was floating off a river bank 50km from where he was last seen arguing on the street in Merbein. At the time, police said Mr Somnez had been abducted by someone he possibly knew, taken interstate and his body dumped. Com-fit pictures were made of the three people with whom Mr Sonmez was last seen outside the Merbein post office. Mr Sonmez was described as a  family man, who helped people in trouble. Following his detah, his wife and four children, on e of whom was disabled, left Mildura and the case remained unsolved, with detectives saying they did not believe Mr Sonmez had any gangland connections. In 2008, NSW Police formed Strike Force Pender to investigate the murder with the assistance of detectives from South Australia and Victoria, making inquiries within Turkish communities in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. A $100,000 reward for information relating to Mr Sonmez's shooting death was posted. Last year, police released a snapshot of a man which they had found in the glovebox of Mr Sonmez's car. The man looked to be of middle-eastern, possibly Turkish descent. They also released an artist's impression of a vehicle the three people Mr Sonmez was seen with in Merbein were believed to have been travelling in at the time.

"Dane Cook bared all on Thursday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live. The 42-year-old comedian appeared on the Bravo talk show, hosted by Andy Cohen, alongside CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley, and dished about his former costars, what his sex life is like when he is on the road touring, and the one man in Hollywood he would go gay for in a question and answer game wittily called called Cheese Dane-ish. Cohen asked Cook a slew of very personal questions and, if he failed to answer any, Crowley had a can of spray cheese she would pump into his mouth. Scroll down for video . Candid answers: Dane Cook talked about sex with groupies on Thursday's episode of Watch What Happens Live . Good question: Dane, shown with Jessica Simpson in Employee Of The Month revealed the dumbest thing she said on the set - and claims she didn't know what they were filming was a movie . The game kicked off with Cohen asking Cook who the most overrated comic is, to which the 42-year-old replied 'Gallagher,' the prop comic who became a semi-hit in the 70s and 80s and was known for smashing watermelons with a large wooden mallet. Then, things got a bit more interesting when Cook, who has starred in films alongside actresses including Jessica Alba, Anna Faris, Lizzy Caplan and Demi Moore, was asked to reveal who was his worst onscreen kiss. 'Kate Hudson,' he quickly replied, who he starred with in the Razzie nominated 2008 flop My Best Friend's Girl. He then added, 'I think she purposefully ate like a feast of onions before the scene.' Next, Cohen asked Cook to talk about his Employee of the Month costar Jessica Simpson, and share with the world the dumbest thing she said while they were filming the comedy. 'She said one day, ''Are we making a movie?'' That was kind of dumb,' Dane laughingly replied. Feast of onion: Dane, shown with Kate Hudson in My Best Friend's Girl, said she had the worst on-screen kiss . In the clubhouse: Dane and Candy Crowley of CNN were guests on the chat show . Having properly shamed his leading ladies, the talk then turned to his sex life, and how many college girls the comic slept with while on the road and touring at campuses around the country. 'In my younger days, I would say a few hundred,' Dane replied. At this point Crowley put the cheese down, realizing Cook was not going to leave any of Cohen's questions unanswered. Going gay: Cook revealed that if he had to sleep with a male comic, it would be Gary Gulman (pictured above with cook) No laughing matter: When asked to reveal who he believed to be the most overrated comic, Cook went with famed watermelon smasher Gallagher (above) Finally, the very heterosexual Cook was asked by Cohen what male comic he would go gay for, to which he responded 'Gary Gulman,' who appeared on his Tourgasm tour. And then, with nothing else left to reveal, the game was over. Dane was stopping by the show to promote his new stand-up special, Dane Cook Troublemaker, which will air this Friday on Showtime.","Dane Cook was a guest on Watch What Happens Live Thursday night and opened up about his former costars and life on the road as a comic .

"Every year, the month of November brings out the best - and worst - of sportsmen's moustaches. All for a good cause, raising money for men's health, stars from the world of football, rugby, cricket, and more, leave their facial hair alone for an entire month. Here, Sportsmail's Movember picture special takes you through the 20 best of the bunch. To donate, or for further information, visit the Movember website. Joe Hart - Manchester City and England footballer . Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is head and shoulders above his team-mates when it comes to his Movember effort. Needless to say, he's got a fair amount of growth - a good effort from England's number one . Gary Lineker - Match of the Day presenter and ex-footballer . Movember stalwart Gary Lineker's moustache/goatee is making him look more and more like previous Match of the Day presenter Jimmy Hill every day... we're not sure whether wife Danielle is a fan, though . Ugo Monye - Rugby union player for Harlequins and England . Rugby Union's Ugo Monye has gone for a more sophisticated look with his Movember 'tache. Unlike some of his sporting counterparts, the Harlequins winger has styled his effort, even using a 'Monye Mo Wax' Michael Nelson - Cambridge United defender, formerly of Norwich . Cambridge defender Michael Nelson has been scaring League Two defenders for the month of November with this stern effort. The U's have won three of their five matches this month, so it seems to have done the trick . Eric Lichaj - Footballer for Nottingham Forest and the USA . Eric Lichaj's effort doesn't appear to have had the same effect though... Nottingham Forest's form reads two wins and three losses. A 3-0 away win at Wolves (pictured) has to be a highlight though . Greg Rutherford - Long Jump Olympic Gold Medallist . Greg Rutherford has really embraced the spirit of Movember, regularly posting pictures on social media of his growth. Not only is he a record-breaking, medal-winning long jumper, we reckon he'd get a gold for this too! Christian Atsu - Chelsea winger, on loan at Everton . Okay, so on-loan Everton winger Christian Atsu is technically cheating with this effort, but we thought it fair to include it as he's gone to some trouble to post this photo. Hopefully it raised some money for charity . Dan Hanford - Carlisle United goalkeeper, formerly of Floriana . Earlier in the month, Carlisle goalkeeper Dan Hanford said of his growth: 'It’s going quite well at the moment. I’m a fair haired lad so it isn’t showing up as much as it could be.' Danny Care - Rugby Union scrum-half for Harlequins and England . Danny Care's moustache has an Italian feel about it. The Harlequins scrum-half looks to have taken some tips from team-mate Ugo Monye, with a Movember effort styled very carefully . Jonny Bairstow - Cricketer for Yorkshire and England . The epitome of cool. Lounging by the pool with a coffee, Yorkshire and England cricketer Jonny Bairstow has produced a fantastic effort for this year's Movember. Potentially the best of the lot. George North - Rugby Union winger for Northampton and Wales . Simple but effective. Pictured last Saturday during Wales' national anthem before their match against New Zealand, George North is standing proud with an impressive moustache to match. Tom Wood - Rugby Union flanker for Northampton and England . Yet another rugby player on our list of top Movember 'taches. England flanker Tom Wood is pictured (right) with another moustachioed man - a Movember raffle prize winner. Wood has really got into the spirit . James Haskell - Rugby Union flanker for Wasps and England . Anything his England team-mates can do, James Haskell can do better. Pictured during England training this week, the fair-haired Wasps captain has grown an impressively long moustache . Liam Williams - Rugby Union fullback for Scarlets and Wales . Sticking with rugby - after all, they do seem to produce the best moustaches - we have Liam Williams of Wales. It's a slightly more subtle effort, and to be honest, it actually suits him . Richie McCaw - Rugby union flanker and captain for New Zealand . Richie McCaw is the final rugby player to make our list, and what a way to finish. He's the leader of New Zealand's impressive rugby side... and, well, leaders look better with facial hair, don't they? Joey Barton - Queens Park Rangers midfielder . Joey Barton is next, and the QPR midfielder has gone for the unkempt look. He was all smiles before Rangers' game against Leicester on Saturday (pictured) and we're pretty sure he was smiling at full-time as well . Justin Fontaine - NHL Ice Hockey player for Minnesota Wild . Justin Fontaine isn't particularly well-known on this side of the Atlantic, but the 27-year-old Canadian NHL player's moustache was too good to ignore when compiling this list . Keith Lowe - York City defender, formerly of Cheltenham . York City defender Keith Lowe, formerly of Burnley, QPR and Swansea, looks as though he's just caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. A frightening, but brilliant, 'tache . Steve Claridge - Football League Show pundit and ex-footballer . BBC pundit and ex-footballer Steve Claridge looks as if he's grown a small animal above his top lip. The less said about this one, the better . James Taylor - Cricketer for Nottinghamshire . Last, but by no means least, is Nottinghamshire cricketer James Taylor. His county side tweeted this week that they weren't convinced the 'tache wasn't stuck on... don't worry James, we believe you!","Sportsmen from football, rugby, cricket and more have grown moustaches .

"John Bercow's chief spin doctor resigned today after launching an astonishing political attack on the Conservatives, Labour and UKIP. Justine McGuinness dramatically quit barely 24 hours after describing the three parties as a ‘collection of clowns’. In an extraordinary rant at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow, she accused the Conservatives of trying to ‘buy the election’, and blasted Ukip’s ‘utterly perverted notion of patriotism’. Commons Speaker John Bercow is supposed to be politically neutral, but his spokesman Justine McGuinness (right) used a speech to the Lib Dem party conference to launch an attack on other rival parties . She also attacked Labour for trying to ‘steal the election’ by supporting a ‘biased’ electoral system. Miss McGuinness, a longtime Lib Dem activist, was speaking in a personal capacity. But her comments appeared to breach the longstanding convention that the Speaker’s office must remain neutral on party political matters. Last night Tory MP Michael Fabricant  said the tirade called into question Mr Bercow’s judgment in hiring Miss McGuinness – and called on him to sack her. Today it was announced Miss McGuinness had resigned. In a statement, Mr Bercow's office said: 'After a year in post Justine McGuinness has offered her resignation to the Speaker, which has been accepted. 'The Speaker thanks Ms McGuinness for her hard work and commitment over the last 12 months. 'She has contributed considerably to the running of the Speaker's Office but now wishes to pursue other interests.' Miss McGuinness, a former media adviser to Kate and Gerry McCann, has been involved in Lib Dem politics for years. She previously stood for Parliament against Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin. She is employed by the Commons on a freelance basis for an undisclosed sum, and is not a civil servant. But the highly political nature of her comments is likely to raise concerns at Westminster. Tory MP Michael Fabricant said Mr Bercow could not employ someone who was so overtly political . Addressing activists from the main podium, she said: ‘The next general election campaign will be a really ugly business. ‘The Tories will aim to buy the election with the millions of pounds donated to them by their hot money, hedge fund friends. ‘Labour will seek to steal the election, relying on an electoral system so biased in their favour that 35 per cent of the vote could deliver them 55 per cent of the seats. ‘Ukip will try and hijack the election, turning the whole event into an argument about Europe and immigration as Nigel Farage swans around suburbia selling himself as some sort of suburban, saloon bar Socrates. ‘And the one thing that will connect this collection of clowns will be a desperate determination to marginalise the Liberal Democrats, for what they all fear above all else is that once again the British people will put the balance of power into our hands. ‘The Lib Dems will offer this country a fair deal. Labour have their warped sense of the term equality, the Tories are welcome to their twisted notion of freedom, and Ukip are welcome to their utterly perverted notion of patriotism. Fairness is what we will stand for.’ Speaking last night, Mr Fabricant said the remarks meant Mis McGuinness could not remain in post. He said: ‘The Speaker has to be politically neutral and has to be seen to be so. How then can he employ someone as his official spokesman who has nailed her colours to the mast in a political rant against the Conservatives and Labour? ‘This calls into question yet again the judgment of John Bercow. If she is still employed by him this evening after this then she should no longer be so. It is essential for the integrity of Parliament that the neutrality of the Speaker’s office is maintained.' The row is an unwelcome development for Mr Bercow, who is already embroiled in controversy over his bid to appoint Australian Carol Mills as the new Commons Clerk despite widespread concerns she is not qualified for the job.","Justine McGuinness used a speech at Lib Dem conference to attack rivals .

"Louis van Gaal is known as a man who does things his own way.  When it comes to formations, he is certainly bucking the trend and reaped the benefits in his first game in charge at Manchester United when a new-look side in a 3-4-3 formation demolished LA Galaxy. Very few people have managed to use the system successfully in England. So, what does the change mean for the United squad? Who fits in? Who doesn't? Sportsmail takes a look... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney and Reece James score against LA Galaxy . Master tactician: Louis van Gaal, pictured here watching Manchester United's friendly win against LA Galaxy with No 2 Ryan Giggs, is set to deploy a 3-4-3 formation this season . It looks like Juan Mata will finally get to return to the central role in behind the forwards where he plays his best football. There he won Chelsea's player of the year two seasons running before Jose Mourinho and David Moyes decided to predominantly stick him on the wing. In those first two seasons in England playing in the centre he scored or set up a goal every other game and created almost three goal-scoring chances per match. When Mourinho forced him out wide at the start of the last campaign he failed to score and provided just two assists. The three forwards in Van Gaal's system are more centrally focused, with the impetus on the wing-backs to fly up the flanks when they are in attack, leaving Mata to concentrate on what matters. On the ball: It looks as though Spaniard Juan Mata will finally get his chance to impress in a central role . That system, with the wing-backs providing a lot of the attacking width, will allow Wayne Rooney to concentrate on his lethal finishing inside and around the box. Rooney loves to drop deep but if Van Gaal can convincing him to leave that to others, his goal return could soar. It would seem Danny Welbeck will be hard-pressed to get in the side when Robin van Persie returns from his holiday and he will also be competing against Javier Hernandez. A poacher like the Mexican could also flourish in a system designed around getting the ball into the box from all angles. Spot on: Wayne Rooney scoring a penalty against LA Galaxy and the England star could thrive under Van Gaal . Ashely Young may have come from the bench to score twice against LA Galaxy but surely his days are numbered. He is an out-and-out winger but possesses none of the defensive skills required to play directly on the flanks for Van Gaal. Similarly Nani and Wilfried Zaha could also struggle. They could all be an option for the attacking three up top, but would find it difficult to compete there. Where Adnan Januzaj fits in is also a conundrum. The 19-year-old was a revelation last season, but there is no obvious place for him either. Days are numbered: Ashley Young scored twice against the MLS side, but his future is uncertain at United . VIDEO Van Gaal delighted with new-look United . One thing is for certain, world record full-back Luke Shaw will thrive. At Southampton he often played more as a left winger than a left-back and will have no problem with the physical demands of tearing up and down that flank all match. He has both the fitness levels and ability on the ball to form part of a lethal attack when they have the ball and drop back into a formidable defence when they don't. That role, on the opposite side, suits Antonio Valencia too, who possesses enough muscle and skill to handle himself defensively. Coem in No 28: Luke Shaw made his first outing in a Manchester Untied shirt during the friendly victory . Ander Herrera was awarded man of the match after pulling the strings in central midfield against LA Galaxy. The new £29million man dominated the centre of the pitch, showing off his array of passing. Van Gaal needs central midfielders who can control the tempo and tie together the rest of the side with a high level of passing ability. Michael Carrick, when he returns from the ankle injury that has ruled him out for 10 weeks, will also fit perfectly into that mould. Darren Fletcher, who was afforded the full 90 minutes on Wednesday night, and Tom Cleverley, although not popular among many fans, have a similarly suitable skill set. Smiles better: Darren Fletcher captained United and was afforded the full 90 minutes in Los Angeles . Van Gaal instructed Manchester United to sell Marouane Fellaini while he was still in charge of Holland during the World Cup – and there does not appear to be a place for him in the side. The Belgian is not strong enough in attack to warrant a place in the front three nor adept enough in the middle to command a place there. He can float between the two, but in Van Gaal's system it is one or the other. Both Anderson and Shinji Kagawa also look like they do not fit in anywhere and will be concerned for their futures. Hair we go: Marouane Fellaini is not on Manchester United's tour and is set to leave Old Trafford this summer . At the moment, following the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic and Van Gaal utilising three at the back, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are virtually certain to start. That is surely an area Van Gaal has identified as one that needs reinforcing, but as it stands there is no serious competition for places. Case for the defence: Phil Jones is virtually certain to start in the Van Gaal era .","Van Gaal deployed system in Manchester United's 7-0 win over LA Galaxy .

"Jack Wilshere is set to be handed the chance to play as Arsenal’s new midfield anchor next season. Manager Arsene Wenger believes the 22-year-old has the football brain to play as his side’s holding central midfielder — a move that could save the club millions in the transfer market. The club had identified a new defensive midfielder as one of their transfer priorities, with the Gunners looking at moves for Sami Khedira, Lars Bender and Morgan Schneiderlin. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Southampton fan beg Arsene Wenger not to sign Schneiderlin . Decision maker: Wenger will have a lot of choices to make in midfield this season including with Wilshere . But Wenger and his backroom staff believe they may already have the answer to the problem position. Wilshere was part of the Arsenal squad that flew to America on Wednesday ahead of Saturday’s clash against New York Red Bulls. The squad arrived in the early hours on Thursday morning. And Wenger could use the clash to examine the England international in the position. In addition to Wilshere, the Arsenal manager also has Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini who can play the role, while Abou Diaby is also fit again. The news will come as a boost to Wilshere, who has not had the most memorable few months. Tradition: Wilshere poses for a selfie on the plane with Arsenal goalkeeper Szczesny . All aboard: Jack Wilshere boards the flight with a copy of the Daily Mail, and he is joined by Mikel Arteta . A foot injury sustained while playing for England wrecked the final few weeks of last season, while he was forced to play a peripheral role during the World Cup. He was under the spotlight again last week after he was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a summer break in Las Vegas. Major question marks have been raised over Wilshere’s long-term role in Wenger’s plans given the manager’s extensive midfield options. With Aaron Ramsey established as the club’s premier central midfielder, Wilshere’s place in Arsenal’s engine room looks far from guaranteed with Arteta, Flamini, Diaby, Tomas Rosicky and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all vying for a place alongside the Welshman. Targets: German pair Sami Khedira (left) and Lars Bender (right) are thought to be on Wenger's hit list . Faith: But Wenger may leave all his targets, including Morgan Schneiderlin (above), and opt for Wilshere . Sitting pretty: Wilshere takes a break from training at London Colney on Wedneaday . But a transition to a deeper-lying midfield role could help Wilshere maintain a regular spot in Wenger’s starting XI next season, as well as strengthen his England chances. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid believe they can persuade Arsenal to part with Santi Cazorla this summer. The Spain international is a long-term target of Diego Simeone and the Argentine hopes this could be the year he lands the attacker. Cazorla has been an integral member of Wenger’s plans since his arrival from Malaga two years ago. But competition for attacking midfield positions is fierce at Arsenal, particularly after the £30million arrival of Alexis Sanchez. Heavy lifting: Wilshere (left) and Santi Cazorla (right) take part in training before the side jetted off to the US . Arsenal . kicked off their pre-season schedule with a 2-0 win at Boreham Wood on . Sunday before Saturday sees them start their USA tour with a match . against Gunners legend Thierry Henry's New York Red Bulls. In addition to the Chilean, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott will all compete to play in positions behind the central striker next season. And Atletico, who are also interested in Nacho Monreal, are hopeful that Wenger can be persuaded to part with Cazorla, despite the fact he only signed a 12 month contract extension earlier this year. Arsenal have handed a trial to Serbian midfielder Mladen Micanovic, 17. FK Javor Ivanjica youngster Micanovic can play in various positions in defence as well and is likely to train with the first team.

"The owners of a restaurant have been forced to change its name after millionaire designer Sir Terence Conran threatened legal action. Alex McElhoney, principal owner of the Albion in Crosby, Merseyside, which opened in the summer, says he was shocked to get a letter demanding the change. 'I registered the company some time ago but didn't think to check for trademarks as Albion is the oldest name for Britain and I just didn't comprehend how that could be trademarked,' he said. Alex McElhoney, principal owner of the Albion in Crosby, Merseyside, which opened in the summer, says he was shocked to get a letter from Sir Terence Conran demanding he change his business's name . Sir Terence and business partner Peter Prescott established Albion Cafe in London's Shoreditch area in January 2009, the year he trademarked the name, and has since opened another branch near the Tate Modern. Mr McElhoney and head chef Steven Burgess will now change the name to Albina after an exiled Greek Princess, from whom the name Albion derives. 'It was completely out of the blue and somewhat baffling to be honest,' said Mr McElhoney, who named his restaurant after the traditional British dishes which are Mr Burgess's speciality. 'Why would a small high street restaurant in Crosby be any threat to London-based ventures? All we could think of was that we were receiving positive social media messages from the likes of Michelin-starred chef Aiden Byrne, or perhaps a Q&A Steven did with The Caterer magazine brought the attention.'

"Raffles, cake sales, coffee mornings… all would have gone down a treat and made a tidy sum. But the women of one village were set on doing something rather more risque to raise funds for their crumbling community hall – volunteering to strip for a charity calendar. And they became even more determined when some members of the village hall committee unkindly suggested they might have more success if they kept their clothes on. Naked ambition: The Castleside Calendar Girls were set on doing some rather more risque than cake sales and raffles to raise money for the community hall . Some feared the calendar would damage the reputations of villagers in positions of responsibility, while others argued the idea was a little tired, after the success of Calendar Girls starring Helen Mirren, the hit movie based on the antics of the Rylstone Women’s Institute in North Yorkshire. But for those brave enough to flick through the pages, the calendar starring the ladies of Castleside in the Durham Dales is perhaps more daring than the original, in which strategic positioning of cakes helped protect the modesty of the models. The Castleside girls are made of sterner stuff. In one shot ten ladies pose naked on hay bales – with the farmer’s permission, of course. In another a local beautician, the parish council clerk and a sales rep run hand-in-hand – bottoms bared – across a cornfield. Castleside Calendar organiser Heather Thompson, 45, said: ‘The original Calendar Girls calendar is lovely, but they are hiding behind their buns. We are in for a penny, in for a pound and it is all out there. It is more Geordie than North Yorkshire in that respect.’ After Miss Thompson’s idea was rejected at the hall’s committee meeting, she decided to take matters into her own hands. ‘It made me quite annoyed,’ she recalled. ‘I was so determined, I literally went out that night and knocked on people’s doors to ask them if they were willing to do it. Daring: The group of women from Castleside, Durham, who are attempting to raise funds by appearing in the calendar . ‘I was amazed how many people said “Yes”, even though we didn’t know each other.’ Soon well-wishers – many of them men – were pouring money into the project to cover publishing costs, and local photographer Sarah Thew offered her services for free. All were keen to save the 100-year-old hall, built through steelworker subscriptions, which is the centre of the community, hosting everything from bingo to dance classes. The Castleside Calendar girls include parish council clerk Gemma Donaghy, 27, who is seen tending her plants in the buff. Pensioner Sadie Ayton, 76, known locally for her bra-fitting skills, was the oldest of the group to undress. She said: ‘My wedding reception was held in the village hall, so I knew I had to do something.  First of all, I thought it was just sponsoring them, then they asked me to take my clothes off. I am naked when I go to bed each night anyway, so I thought, “Why not?”’ Film: The Castleside calendar is perhaps more daring than the original, which inspired the 2003 film starring  Penelope Wilton (left), as Ruth, Helen Mirren (centre), as Chris Harper, and Julie Walters (right) as Annie Clarke . Now even the women’s critics are starting to come round to the calendar, which costs £10. Dawn Kentish, 42, a committee member, explained her initial opposition. ‘Even if the calendar pictures are classy, there will still be a minority who won’t approve,’ she said. ‘We didn’t want to offend anybody. As a committee, we decided we didn’t want to commit to funding it ourselves.’ David Dixon, 70, chairman of the committee, said: ‘There were a few members who were rather circumspect. There were concerns it had been done before and wouldn’t work. ‘But having seen how the whole community has got into the idea, we are delighted to have their help. It’s certainly a talking point in the village.’","Women of Castleside, Durham Dales, have stripped for a charity calendar .

"A 10-year-old Boy Scout accidentally hanged himself while practicing knot tying for a merit badge. AJ Underwood was found hanging from the top bunk in his bedroom in Oneonta, Alabama, on Friday night. The family was heading to a birthday party when the boy's mother went to check on him. Tragically, she found him hanging from the same rope he had been given to practice knot tying, police said. Tragic: AJ Underwood, 10, accidentally hanged himself from his bunk bed with a rope he had been given to practice knot tying for a Boy Scout merit badge . Investigators said they believed AJ (pictured with his mother), who was 'in good spirits', hanged himself by accident on Friday . His mother got him down and ran outside screaming for help. Neighbors began CPR until paramedics arrived, but they could not resuscitate him, the New York Daily News reported. AJ was taken to St. Vincent's Blount hospital, where he was pronounced dead. It is believed that his death was instant. Investigators believe AJ's death was a freak accident. Oneonta Police Chief James Chapman said: 'There's absolutely nothing to indicate he did this on purpose. He had been in good spirits, he was making good grades.' The 10-year-old's aunt, Dana Wiesman, told WBRC: 'We had been learning how to tie rope, tie knots in ropes in Boy Scouts. He came into the house and had unpacked his Boy Scout bag, and he went in his room and was apparently playing with the rope and slipped and got caught in it. 'It's unreal, it really was, it still is. I still expect him to come running out to play with the kids. 'He's a mama's boy. She needs him more than he ever needed her. He took care of things. He was always smiling and happy. He would do anything for anybody. He's the best kid I have ever known. 'We will never be able to say thank you enough for everything that everybody in this community has done for us. We will never be able to say thank you enough.' Amazing: In a tribute to AJ on a GoFundMe page set up to raise funds for his funeral, his family said he would 'be missed by so many' A GoFundMe page has been set up by the family to raise $20,000 for AJ's funeral and they have made just under half of that figure. A short statement on the page says: 'AJ was killed in a freak accident this past Friday night in the small town of Oneonta, AL. 'The outpouring of support from our small town and the surrounding communities has been absolutely amazing. You are all appreciated more than you will ever know.

Robinson lashed out at the schoolgirl after getting into an argument about boys she had spoken to, Bristol Crown Court heard. Kayleigh-Anne Palmer, 16, was strangled with her scarf by Aston Robinson, 18, Bristol Crown Court heard . The lifeless mother-to-be was rushed to hospital where she was placed on a ventilator and her unborn daughter died a day later . While Kayleigh lay dying, Robinson fled the scene before calmly heading to a local bookies to check the status of a £20 bet. Her mother Helen Bage, father Dean Palmer and grandparents, Michael and Carole, said the verdict would help bring closure on the distressing time in their lives. In a statement they said: 'Justice has been done for Kayleigh and we wish to thank the jury for their verdict which will help us bring closure on what has been a very distressing time. 'Kay will be remembered by her family and friends for her huge personality and radiant smile and our lives are so much richer for having known and loved her. Robinson lashed out at the schoolgirl after getting into an argument about her speaking to other boys . 'She was a young girl who loved life yet always found time for others, which is why she will be remembered for being beautiful inside and out. 'To us, Lily Rose will always be the little girl who would have been welcomed into our lives and loved very much. 'While her loss of life has caused much grief and suffering, we will try to take some comfort from knowing that she rests in peace together with her mummy.' The lifeless mother-to-be was rushed to hospital where she was placed on a ventilator and her unborn daughter died a day later. During an interview with police Robinson told officers he grabbed her red tartan scarf from the table and wrapped it around Kayleigh's throat, pulling it tight at both ends . Kayleigh's mother, Helen Bage, issued a statement with the rest of the family saying: 'Kay will be remembered for her huge personality and radiant smile and our lives are so much richer for having known and loved her' She tragically passed away three days after the incident. Robinson handed himself into police and confessed to killing his girfriend, but denied her murder. He later wrote a letter to Kayleigh's mother from prison where he insisted he had not meant to kill the 16-year-old. Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, said: 'He said, 'I'm so sorry for your loss. I didn't want that to happen. I was hoping that when she woke up, and after my jail sentence, I would go back to her arms. 'God took her way in peace, away from my accusations and my controlling behaviour.' Robinson (right in both pictures) handed himself into police and confessed to killing his girlfriend, but later denied her murder . Mr Quinlan added: 'But God didn't take Kayleigh away, this jealous and controlling young man murdered her. 'His senseless act of violence also destroyed the life on an unborn child. 'He said he used her own scarf and did it because he was jealous and wanted her to 'be quiet'.' Kayleigh had reported her boyfriend to police on a number of occasions after he had punched and kicked her following fights, the court heard. On one occasion Kayleigh even went to hospital with a bloody nose when he punched her hard to the face. The court heard that when the schoolgirl, from Cheltenham, told Robinson she was pregnant he reacted badly, pushing her to the ground before shouting at her, 'this will stop you having a baby'. The day before her death Robinson sent Kayleigh text messages and told her: 'Make sure my name is not on your s****y kid's birth certificate' Just days later police were called after a distressed Kayleigh told a stranger she had been punched in the face following another argument with her boyfriend of six months, the court heard. She was taken to accident and emergency where staff reported the abuse. Mr Quinlan said: 'He suffered with paranoia where she was concerned. He was jealous and became jealous when he even thought that she was, or might, have lied to him. 'She said he had become jealous and accused her of looking at another boy so he punched her to the face causing the injuries. 'These episodes of violence, hostility towards the fact she was pregnant, and his jealousy manifested itself in accusations that she was seeing other boys. 'Their relationship was punctuated by his inability just to let her be.' The day before her death Robinson sent Kayleigh text messages and told her, 'Make sure my name is not on your s****y kid's birth certificate'. The message was swiftly followed by another, to her mother, which read, 'Make sure you tell Kayleigh I'm having nothing to do with her or the baby'. Robinson, also from Cheltenham, then turned up to Kayleigh's house where the pair rowed once more before he left. The following day Kayleigh got ready for school, kissed her mum goodbye and left for Robinson's house. Another argument developed there over boys Kayleigh had been talking to, and when she said 'how would you like it if I had met some boys?' Robinson lashed out. During an interview with police he told officers he grabbed her red tartan scarf from the table and wrapped it around Kayleigh's throat, pulling it tight at both ends. He said she offered no resistance and did not struggle, and he dragged her from the sofa to the floor. When she stopped moving he rolled her over and, after discovering she was blue, immediately bolted from the property at 11.45am. He ran into his sister, Michaela, who discovered Kayleigh lying face down on the living room floor and attempted to resuscitate her. Robinson later handed himself in at Cheltenham police station. Handwritten letter Robinson sent to Kayleigh's mother Helen Bage . 'Helen I can't get over the fact that Kay is gone, my Kay is gone. It's hurting me so much. I haven't slept for days, all I can think of is Kay. My mind keeps replaying the day when it happened. 'I know that she loved me. She used to cry loads when we'd argue and I'd say let's have space for a while, she always used to say 'I can't Ast, I need you all the time, FOREVER, she used to say that I made her complete, and happy. 'I know that she had changed since with me, but it wasn't all bad, she would always have a smile on her beautiful face when she saw me. 'She trusted me with everything and I ruined it all. I just can't get my head around her lying about saying she had chucked her phone when I knew that she didn't. 'I blame myself of that because I never let her say negative things about herself and she obviously needed someone to talk to. 'Our 14 months together were absolute perfect, from when we first started talking we both knew we was going to be together, the way we looked at each other was just love glistening in our eyes. 'Helen I am wordless for the pain I have caused to your family. Just forgive me one day would you please. 'I'll always remember Kay, from when we went to Birmingham and tried to runaway, and the hotel wanted I.D. and neither had any so we got the train back and snuck into my house lol x all the sleepovers we had, the nights when we just used to lay there and stare at the stars with her in my arms, I used to pick her up in my shoulders. 'She used to scream when we walked up Leckhampton Hill at night to get over her fears, she would squeeze my hand hard as she could. 'Look, what I'm trying to get at is I will always love Kayleigh there's no-one out there what will ever replace her in my heart - single forever me... 'I'm so sorry for the loss I didn't want that to happen - I was hoping that when she waked up and after my jail sentence, I would get back into Kay's arms, but God took her away in peace, away from my accusations and my controlling behaviour... 'All that because I loved + adored her. R.I.P Snay.'","Aston Robinson, 18, strangled his pregnant girlfriend Kayleigh-Anne Palmer .

"Fancy views of Melbourne's midnight fireworks on New Year's Eve and the use of your very own beach all-year-round? Maybe it's time to move to Clifton Springs for a slice of your very own piece of paradise. Located on an elevated seaside block Ballerine Peninsula, south-west of Melbourne, is a five-bedroom home on sale for the first time since it was built back in 1978. Up for auction this month, the home is  expected to fetch about  $1.5 million, which may well be considered by many a buy of a lifetime when you consider what's included. The five-bedroom home was built in 1978 by the same couple who live in it today . The north facing view across Port Phillip bay on the Bellarine Peninsula . The home is one of a handful of neighbouring properties with a private beach and a path which leads to it . The home has views across to Melbourne where the New Year's Eve fireworks can be seen . But of couse, the most amazing feature of all in the five-bedroom property is its location, perched 30-metres above the ocean with its own zig-zagging path winding down to the water's edge. Both the path and the beach are completely private, and there's a boatshed that juts out into the shallows, which the owners, Pam and Barry Whitford, built themselves. There's also a pavilion on the cliff's edge and unobstructed views all the way to Melbourne, which is 100 kilometres away. Pat Whitford said her home is one of only a handful of properties across the Ballerine Peninsula, and 20 in total in Victoria, that comes  equipped with a private beach. 'We're 90-feet above the waterline and we have our own zig zag path,' she told Melbourne's 3AW radio. The beach is completely private, but the couple allow beach goers to swim and walk on the sand as they please. Mrs Whitford said the beach is protected and safe enough for children play in, and there's even your very own boatshed to house water craft. Set on more than 3700 square metres of land the home itself  offers three expansive living areas, a rumpus room with built in bar, and a formal lounge with combined dining. Built by the Whitfords in 1978, the couple are the only two people who have ever lived in the house. Clifton Springs is about 100 kilometres south west of Melbourne across from Port Phillip bay . There are five bedrooms, this with its very own private balcony . The home's north facing aspect is one of the its most desirable attractions . Agent Nathan Ashton said the home is a rare find and is expected to sell for between $1.5 and $1.8 million . They lobbied against the building of a nearby marina eight years ago, which is the only problem they've faced in 36 years, but it went ahead against their wishes. They said they've rectified part of the problem caused by the marina - beach erosion - by building a groyne or permanent barrier to stop the shore line from eroding. She said the home is particularly attractive to prospective buyers because of its north facing aspect - a requirement fast becoming the number one asset people consider when buying a home on  Australia's east coast. The point at which a home faces affects the amount of sun it receives, and north facing homes receive more light than most. Gartland Real Estate agent Nathan Ashton said the 3762 square metre property, on the Bellarine Peninsula at 39 Clifton Street, was a rare find. 'My understanding is there are only 11 properties on the Bellarine and seven on the Mornington Peninsula where the title extends into the ocean,' he said. He said interest for the October 11 auction has pushed the property's price tag to between $1.5 to $1.8 million.","Barry and Pat Whitford built the home 34 years ago and are selling it for the first time this month .

"Having a daughter who resembles a heroine from a Barbara Cartland novel is an unusual bargaining chip to have when negotiating a property purchase. Yet that’s what swung it when Maureen and John Adkin bought their cottage in Hertfordshire. For half a century, Dame Barbara lived and worked at the ten-bedroom mansion Camfield Place near Hatfield – and owned the many other properties on the 400-acre estate in which it sits. But the only one ever to have come on to the open market is Wyndham Cottage, which Maureen and John bought in 1986. Alluring: Wyndham Cottage, once owned by Dame Barbara Cartland, is on the market for £1.395million . Spacious living room: Dame Barbara lived and worked at the Camfield Place mansion, near Hatfield, where dozens of other properties, including Wyndham Cottage (pictured), sit . ‘Barbara Cartland wanted to meet whoever was going to buy the house,’ Maureen says, adding that the romantic fiction novelist invited the couple’s daughter Tracie to tea. ‘My daughter would have been about 20 and had tea with Barbara Cartland and Glen and Ian, her sons. They all sat round this huge table having tea and cucumber sandwiches. She was a very formal lady! ‘She poured the tea and they chatted – and then she said to my daughter, “You are just like one of the heroines out of one of my books, the place is yours!”’ John, 72, a builder, says he can see why prolific romantic novelist Dame Barbara took to Tracie. ‘I think she saw a kindred spirit, because my daughter is really dynamic. Nothing gets in her way.’ Tracie now has a make-up business with a salon in London’s Knightsbridge and a number of celebrity clients. There would be no Dame Barbara-style formalities for anyone wanting to buy Wyndham Cottage today, which is on sale for £1.395 million through Hamptons International. The property, which has five bedrooms, has been run as a bed-and-breakfast for the past couple of years by Maureen and John. It also has three reception rooms and a separate one-bedroom annexe. Romantic novelist Dame Barbara, pictured with her Pekingese dog, died in 2000 . Maureen, 71, a retired hairdresser, says she occasionally did Dame Barbara’s hair when the author’s stylist was on holiday. She adds: ‘She used to have her hair done every single day. I would go in at about 11 in the morning. Her secretary would be reading her mail to her and I would do her hair and her nails, if she would sit still long enough. She was very busy – she used to smudge them! ‘I would help her with her make-up and she would take me into her gown room where she had all these magnificent gowns – racks and racks of gowns.’ Dame Barbara died in 2000 at the age of 98, and the estate is retained by her family. She is buried in the grounds, under a tree planted by Elizabeth I. But she is not the only writer with connections to Wyndham Cottage. The property was once two separate homes, owned by Beatrix Potter’s paternal grandfather. Beatrix would visit on holiday as a young girl and wrote in her journal: ‘It is the place I love best in the world… where I have been so happy as a child.’ It is said that she wrote The Tale Of Peter Rabbit while staying there. And Mr McGregor’s garden in the book is partly based on one of the estate cottages’ plots. ‘Living here has been magical,’ Maureen says. ‘I can see why you would be inspired to write.’ The couple have referenced Beatrix Potter by naming the B&B’s bedrooms after characters and places in her books. For instance, there is Bluebell room, Peter’s room and Flopsy’s room. Maureen feels that the time is now right for the property to have a new owner, saying: ‘We’re in our 70s now and it’s too big for us. We should step down so that someone else can have the same pleasure we’ve had from it.’ Nuala Easter, associate director at Hamptons’ St Albans office, says: ‘Wyndham Cottage occupies an enviable position with captivating views of the surrounding countryside. It provides excellent accommodation, and has a beautiful garden, which is about one third of an acre.’ Hamptons International, St Albans (01727 890770, hamptons.co.uk)","Barbara Cartland sold Wyndham Cottage to Maureen and John in 1986 .

"A convicted murderer sentenced to more than a half-century behind bars is suing the state of Connecticut, saying its ban on pornography in prison violates his constitutional rights. Dwight Pink Jr., 44, says in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in July that guards have used the policy to deny him an art book, The Atlas of Foreshortening, which uses nude models to help show how to draw the human form. Pink says the ban is a violation of his free speech rights and serves no meaningful objective in prison. The state filed its response Monday, saying Pink has not been harmed by the ban and none of his rights were violated. My right to porn: Dwight Pink, Jr., 40, said he is suing the state of Connecticut because the ban on pornography in prison violates his constitutional rights . 'Any injury or harm, if any, was caused solely by plaintiff's own acts, omissions, or conduct and was not due to any wrongful conduct by the defendants,' Assistant Attorney General Steven Strom wrote. The state Department of Correction put out the administrative directive in 2011. It bans all material that contains 'pictorial depictions of sexual activity or nudity' from the prisons. But it also says the ban should not apply to 'materials which, taken as a whole, are literary, artistic, educational or scientific in nature'. A prison spokesman at the time said the ban was intended to improve the work environment for prison staffers, especially female staffers, who might be inadvertently exposed to pornography. It led to a letter-writing campaign and threats of lawsuits from inmates upset with the policy. Jaclyn Falkowski, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office, said about a half dozen lawsuits have been filed since then challenging the ban in both federal and state courts. She said those cases are still being litigated. But a judge in 2012 refused to issue a preliminary injunction allowing inmate Akove Ortiz to possess magazines like Playboy. 'Although prisoners do not forfeit all of their constitutional rights upon incarceration, the fact of incarceration and the needs of the prison system impose limitations on prisoners' constitutional rights, even those derived from the First Amendment,' the judge wrote in his ruling. Prison: A convicted murderer at Cheshire Correctional Institution in Connecticut thinks he should be able to view sexually explicit materials . William Dunlap, a law professor at Quinnipiac University, said courts have generally sided with prison officials in such cases if they can prove the ban has a legitimate goal other than to simply suppress material that some people might find objectionable — such as maintaining safety in the prisons or keeping the material out of the hands of sex offenders. But he said the lawsuit has a chance of succeeding if Pink can show it was improperly used in his case to suppress art or literature. 'I think that's a much stronger argument than saying the statute itself is facially unconstitutional,' he said. Pink is serving a 56-year sentence for his part in the 1998 slaying of a 35-year-old father of two in Old Saybrook. Scott Rufin was shot up to five times in the head with two guns and stabbed in the heart seven times with a sword, authorities said. Pink led authorities to the skeletal remains two years after the killing, which he said was committed by another man.","Dwight Pink Jr., 44, was sentenced to 56 years in prison for the 1998 execution-style murder of a father-of-two .

"The Queen's decision to stay elsewhere on her Balmoral estate to let tourists wander her castle home has paid off. Visitor numbers have increased five per cent this summer - edging past 70,000, the best for five years and nearly a record for the Royal retreat. Some 40 per cent of the tourists came from overseas, underlining the foreign attraction of the British Monarchy. Good move: The decision by the Queen, pictured with Prince Philip, to let tourists wander Balmoral has paid off . Tourist boom: Balmoral Castle has seen visitors reach a five-year high . Because of a timetable clash this year, the Monarch was in Scotland earlier than usual for the Commonwealth Games, meaning tourists were still wandering around her summer residence before it closed at the end of July. So, following her visit to the Glasgow Games, the Queen moved into the seven-bedroom Craigowan Lodge on the 50,000 acre estate instead, which is about a mile away from the castle. The arrangements were made so the estate could stay open to the public for its normal seasonal period of April to July. The 88-year-old monarch's move to Craigowan was prompted by the growing need to maximise tourist revenue to make the estate pay for itself. Running costs: The increase in visitor numbers to Balmoral means half the £3m costs will be met . It costs around £3m-a-year to run Balmoral - which is owned privately by the Queen - and tourist revenue meets about half the bills. But her decision to let the castle remain open as normal has helped ring the cash tils louder at Balmoral. Adults pay £11 - and children £5 - to visit part of the castle and its grounds. Gary Marsden, the estate's visitor enterprise manager, said it had been 'a very good year'. 'We are about five per cent up on last year and we are very pleased,' he said. 'They are the best figures for five years and a near record. 'We had a good number of overseas visitors too. About 40 per cent of our visitors come from abroad - with Germany the biggest market. As well as numbers being up, so was the visitor spend too.' The Queen's decision to stay at Craigowan means that the estate has been able to generate as full a revenue as possible from tourism at the close of its season. The success has also helped the it freeze next year's admission prices. Craigowan Lodge has been well-used by the Royal Family in the past. Prince Charles stayed there with Diana after their 1981 wedding, as did Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson after their marriage. Visitor numbers have increased five per cent this summer - edging past 70,000, the best for five years . The estate has also tried to maximise income from activities such as running holidays, cottage rentals, fishing, wildlife safari trips, weddings and corporate hospitality events. Balmoral's golf club, used by the Royal Family, was hired out for 11 corporate days - bagging more than £25,000 for the Monarch - with even clubhouse barbecues arranged for sunny days. Balmoral was beloved by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and has remained a favourite with the Queen and her family. The castle is located on a working estate which aims to protect the environment while contributing to the local economy. Earlier this year MPs heard that the Queen was to be down to her last £1million and her palaces are 'crumbling'. The Public Accounts Committee criticised the Household for failing to make more savings and also said it should be making more money. Balmoral is privately owned by the Queen and who meets its costs personally. Balmoral was beloved by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and has remained a favourite with the Queen . Meanwhile Christmas is to come more than two months early at the Queen's Scottish retreat this week. Balmoral has decided to hold its Christmas sale on Tuesday - because an historic Deeside Bridge that is near it will be closed for several months over the winter to allow work to strengthen and improve it. The Balmoral Bridge, close to the Queen's home, will close on Wednesday (October 8) and is scheduled to reopen at the start of February 2015. The £450,000 work is essential to its long term future. Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Balmoral Bridge was constructed in 1857 for Prince Albert. It is a category-A listed heritage structure which carries the B976 South Deeside Road over the River Dee near to Balmoral Castle. But the current bridge decking has been subject to the elements for 35 years. The bridge will also be repainted to protect it. The next available vehicular crossing over the Dee is at Ballater, meaning a total diversion of around 14 miles for those living on and around the Balmoral Estate. So Balmoral has decided to hold its annual festive sale on Tuesday (October 7), the day before the bridge closes. Gates will be open between 3pm until 7pm.","Visitor numbers to Balmoral Castle have edged past 70,000 .

"From Shakepeare's terrifying crones to the Hansel and Gretel sorceress with a taste for cannibalism, witches have long exercised a malevolent hold on the popular imagination. Now the witch is the subject of a new exhibition at the British Museum which runs until January and charts the journey of the wicked enchantress from the medieval era to the beginning of the 20th century. Featuring works by Durer, Delacroix and Rossetti among others, it delves into the near universal terror of witches - and the equally dreadful consequences for the women caught up. Scroll down for video . Iconic: This engraving of the Three Weird Sisters  is one of the most famous witch images ever made . But early witches weren't the horrid hags of the Middle Ages. Many, among them Lilith, thought to be the first wife of Adam and his equal, sorceress Circe and Hercules' unfaithful wife Medea, were as beautiful as they were powerful. The theme of the witch as a powerful woman resurfaced again in the Middle Ages, when witches, although no longer lovely to look at, were presented as having the ability to control the weather or strike down grown men and infants alike. Pagan associations with classical gods and goddesses, in particular Diana the Huntress, compounded the malevolent reputation of the witch as Christian priests railed against what they saw as an abomination and a heresy. But although most witches were women, men and children were also accused of witchcraft during the medieval period as people, seeing catastrophes such as the Black Death and internecine warfare unfold around them, blamed sorcery for their ills. Terrifying: Works by Hans Baldung Grien (left) and Albrecht Durer (right) entrenched the idea of evil witches . Unsurprisingly, this led to persecution, mostly of women, with attempts to eradicate witchcraft gathering speed as the 14th century began. By 1563, it had been made a capital offence in Britain as well as in much of Western Europe; a law that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 200,000 women between 1484 and 1750. But the terror induced by the thought of witchcraft wasn't entirely the fault of imagination alone - as the new exhibition makes plain, the flowering of the arts went hand in hand with an uptick in witchcraft cases. Leading the charge were the print-makers, whose cheap and cheerful pamphlets, books and engravings meant that terrifying images of evil hags spread among all sections of the population. From 1500 onwards, pamphlets outlining the supposed malign powers of the witch became commonplace, while cheap copies of the notorious Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Witches) were available to all. Witch trials, as a result, became increasingly common during the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular during periods of civil unrest. Frightening: Veneziano's The Witches’ Rout (The Carcass) is typical of the terrifying witches of the 15th century . Terror: Witches were often depicted riding supernatural creatures as seen here in Jan de Bisschop's work . Much of the art that fuelled them, however, was striking. Among them were single-sheet prints made by the Renaissance print-makers Albrecht Dürer and Hans Baldung Grien - both of which rapidly became popular with collectors. One that did particularly well was Grien's The Witches' Sabbath, a colour woodcut print from 1510 that depicts four nude female figures sitting on the ground with a cauldron. The cauldron is emitting big plumes of smoke and traces of a potion with frogs round the figures, the ground is littered with bones, pitchforks and to the right of the image a cat is sitting with its back turned. In the night sky, another two witches, one barely visible, the other riding a goat and carrying a pitchfork with another cauldron and animal bones. The figure of a witch riding backwards on a goat in Baldung’s work is said to have been inspired by Dürer’s engraving of the very same name. Made circa 1500, A Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat is an allegory for how witchcraft was thought to reverse the natural order of things, so the hair of the witch streams out in one direction, while the goat and the trail of drapery go the other way. Change: Works such as the Siren Vase showed witches as beauties - a stance embraced by the Victorians . Finely wrought: However horrid their subject matter, works by Luis Paret y Alcazar and Goya remain lovely . But not every witch was depicted as a horrid hag. Witches were also shown as bewitching seductresses intent on ensnaring their male victims, a type loved by Giovanni Battisa Castiglione, an artist famous for his etchings of Circe. By contrast, Francisco de Goya  turned the subject of witches into an art form all of its own and took the grotesque to new heights courtesy of his penchant for compositions that showed women conducting hideous activities on animals and children. During the eighteenth century, Henry Fuseli’s Weird Sisters from Macbeth influenced generations of theatre-goers, and illustrations of Goethe’s Faust were popularised by Eugène Delacroix. By the end of the 19th century, hideous old hags with distended breasts and snakes for hair were mostly replaced by sexualised and mysteriously exotic sirens, most famously in Dante Gabriel Rossetti's depictions of Lilith. This new approach to witches was mirrored in the treatment of suspected witches in the real world too, with witch trials and burnings finally consigned to history as the 20th century dawned.","Witches & Wicked Bodies includes works by Durer, Goya and Delacroix .

"Alexis Sanchez was afforded a well-deserved night out after firing Arsenal into the Champions League group stages. The Chile star notched on the stroke of half-time during a nervy one-goal win against Beskitas at the Emirates. And Sanchez, who cost Arsenal £30million from Barcelona in the summer, celebrated his first goal for the Gunners at London nightclub Chinawhite. Having a ball: Alexis Sanchez was pictured leaving Chinawhite on Wednesday after Arsenal's win . Thumbs up: Sanchez scored the only goal as Arsenal qualified for the Champions League group stages . That's better! Sanchez notched his first goal for the Gunners in the win against Beskitas . The 25-year-old’s role in the Arsenal side – whether he plays wide or centrally - has been up for debate over the last week. But Sanchez indicated to manager Arsene Wenger that he is able to operate through the middle in the absence of Olivier Giroud. The Frenchman is set to miss the next four months after surgery on a broken tibia but Wenger isn’t unduly worried. 'Sanchez can play his whole life at centre forward,' said the Arsenal boss. 'I bought him as a striker, not only to play on the flanks. He had a good game. He was mobile, dangerous and has shown as well he has great fighting spirit, qualities that will be very important in the Premier League. 'He produced the performance we wanted, technically, tactically and mentally. We needed that against a good team. It was nervous in the last 10 minutes when we were down to 10 men.' Neatly struck: The Chilean whipped home the winner against Slaven Bilic's side just before the break . VIDEO Sanchez showed fighting spirit - Wenger . Sanchez wasn't the only sporting superstar that enjoyed himself at the Chinawhite club on Wednesday night after sprint king Usain Bolt also made his way to the London nightspot. Beaming for the cameras after dining with his friends at trendy London restaurant Nozomi, Bolt was wearing a floral shirt and donned a baseball cap and sunglasses before he headed to Chinawhite. The world's fastest man was also showing off on Instagram, posting a video of himself performing a bizarre rap.

"Britain's booming housing market is making it harder for youngsters to get their first home . Young workers will get guaranteed cheap rent to allow them to save a deposit for their first home, under a new government scheme. The 'rent to buy' programme will offer first-time buyers a 20 per cent discount off their rent for seven years. They will then be given the right to buy the home. The £400 million plan from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles aims to give young workers a 'springboard' on to the property ladder without having to pay an expensive cash deposit at the start. The scheme is designed for single people earning £33,000 or less and couples on up to £66,000. Local housing associations will run the scheme, but ministers will insist that the new one and two bed flats are given to 'hard-working' people who have never owned a home. The proposal is the first part of a package to address the housing crisis, set to be unveiled at the party conference next week. It comes amid growing concerns over the length of time it takes to save for a deposit. It now takes an average first-time buyer 22 years to save enough for a deposit without their parents' help. 'The government is standing by people who work hard and do the right thing, and helping them move on and up in life,' Mr Pickles said. Under Mr Pickles' proposals housing associations will compete for a share of £400 million of cheap government loans to build 10,000 homes over two years between 2015 and 2017. Landlords of the flats will then be forced to keep their rents low to give young workers the time to build up a deposit so they can buy their place. Whitehall sources said that the scheme was aimed at 'aspiring professionals' living with parents or friends who were finding it impossible to raise the deposit for a home. Deposits can cost up to £60,000 for a two-bed property and most young people in their 20s or 30s cannot afford the sum without help from their parents. Mr Pickles said: 'Both house building and the number of first-time buyers are now at their highest rate since 2007. 'As part of our wider housing programme this new scheme will help increase the provision of low-cost rented accommodation and provide a spring-board for young people to upgrade to home ownership down the line. 'This government is taking action and supporting people who want to get on in life. 'The Labour party plans to do the opposite by introducing rent controls, compulsory registration and blanket local authority licensing which would destroy private and institutional investment in the rented sector, push up rents and reduce choice and supply.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hopes the 'rent to buy' scheme will make it easier for youngsters to save for a deposit . Under the scheme, housing associations will have up to 16 years to pay back the low-cost loans, and until these are repaid the homes have to be available at below market rents. After seven years, tenants will be able to buy the home for the market price, move out and buy another property or rent an-other home, either privately or with the housing association. Stuart Ropke, of the National Housing Federation, said: 'We welcome any measure which can help to accelerate the supply of new homes. 'However, we still need more clarity about what the policy aims to achieve. We are concerned most tenants will be unlikely to be able to afford to buy after seven years and we need to consider how we will meet their long-term housing needs.'

"While Real Madrid fans were celebrating their side's Super Cup victory, some may have been concerned by the the sight of Cristiano Ronaldo. The 29-year-old winger was photographed on the treatment table with a large ice-pack strapped to his troublesome knee. Ronaldo has suffered from tendinosis around his left kneecap for some time - it plagued his World Cup and was a contributing factor towards some below-par performances in Brazil. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo double secures Supercup . Mixed emotions: Ronaldo poses with the Super Cup while a large ice-pack is strapped to his troublesome knee . Tendinosis is caused by the long-term wear and tear of tendons which are put under consistent pressure without enough recovery time between periods of activity. The doctor for the Portuguese Football Federation said during the World Cup: 'Pain and difficulty moving are common and rest is the main treatment. 'Recovery times for tendinosis depend on the scale of the damage, but in the most severe cases could be several months.' There has been no suggestion that Ronaldo is facing a time on the sidelines but Madrid fans may be worried that, after only their first competitive game of the season, their talisman is having to take such measures. Tendinosis: Portugal's captain suffers from long-term wear and tear of the tendon . Helping hand: Ronaldo is helped to his feet after having his knee treated during the World Cup in Brazil . The Ballon d'Or winner played in 47 matches for Los Blancos last season. After a shorter than usual summer there may be concerns about how the winger's knee will hold up under the rigours of another arduous campaign.

"An oil painting by a famous Welsh artist was stolen from the Royal Festival Hall – but nobody noticed for more than a week. Sir Kyffin Williams' work, Landscape At Llanaelhaearn, vanished from a secure room at the London venue at the end of September. It was not reported missing until October 6 when a member of staff found its smashed frame in a toilet cubicle. Stolen: Landscape at Llanaelhaearn by Sir Kyffin Williams, whose works now fetch up to £50,000 . Sir Kyffin, pronounced Cuffin, completed the 20in by 24in piece in 1947. He was renowned for his subtle use of pastel greens and greys to recreate the Welsh countryside. Nowadays many of his works fetch up to £50,000. The painting, which depicts a figure looking out at a dark and rugged landscape, had been on display since November 2013, and was on loan from the Arts Council Collection. The landscape was stolen from the Royal Retiring Room, which is kept locked when it is not being used for concerts and events. The theft is an embarrassment because it was on loan from the Arts Council. Missing: The painting Landscape At Llanaelhaearn by Sir Kyffin Williams has been stolen from London's Southbank Centre .

"A child and two adults were killed and 15 others were hurt when an out-of-control monster truck ploughed into spectators at a car show in the Netherlands. The tragedy in the eastern city Haaksbergen happened after the truck drove over five parked cars. It veered into the watching crowd, careering into dozens of onlookers. Panicked spectators, including young children, were forced to dive to safety as the out-sized vehicle ploughed through a guard rail. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Dutch policemen inspect the site of an accident after a monster truck drove accidentally into the audience during a demonstration in Haaksbergen, killing three people and injuring dozens . Paramedics and firefighters at the scene shortly after the accident in the middle of a monster truck display . The event was held in a car park in the centre of Haaksbergen, a town of 25,000 people. Hans Gerritsen, mayor of Haaksbergen, said between 15 and 30 people were injured in the accident, five seriously. Three people were killed, including one child, he told local media. Hundreds of people could only watch as the massive monster truck, with tractor-size wheels, rolled into the packed crowd of spectators. One local man, whose name was given only as Bob, had a clear view from his window above the car park where the event was held. He told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'It was awful to see. It was not too bad in terms of speed. But such truck is so heavy, there is nothing can be done. 'I think people did not have time to jump away. It was too late.

"Forced out: Lotto rapist Iorworth Hoare has put his mansion up for sale at a bargain price after death threats forced him to move .

Three . months ago he was forced to leave the exclusive Darras Hall estate in . Newcastle after the words 'Leave or Die' were spray-painted on the gates . of his home. Hoare bought the six-bedroom detached house for £700,000 following his release from a life sentence in 2005. According to the Daily Mirror, it is now up for sale at the bargain price of £595,000. After leaving Darras Hall, Hoare rented a luxury flat . on the city's expensive Quayside - much to the horror of residents. However, . he has not been seen there for weeks. His new flat on the Quayside sold for more than £130,000 back in December 2007 and can bring in around £750 in rent per month. One neighbour, who asked not to be named and lives in the block with his partner and child, previously said: ‘I have seen him walking in and out of the premises quite a few times. ‘I . understand that someone has the right to start a new life but the fact . that it's in a property which has so many corridors and public areas is . just wrong. ‘People are petrified. We don't want him living here.’ Since his release from prison, Hoare, . originally from Seacroft, Leeds, has faced a catalogue of abuse and . threats, most notably in 2006 when he received silver bullets through . the post. One letter was addressed to him ordering him to leave the estate or face ‘hired hands who use real ammunition’. Threat: This graffiti was left on the gates of Hoare's £700,000 home in the exclusive Darras Hall estate in Newcastle . A . second letter was sent to his neighbour Claire Redhead warning that .

Hoare was believed to be furious that he could not get his hands on the money.

"When the talk turns to the greats of European football it is easy to rattle off the names of Paisley, Guardiola and Mourinho. Last night, as his Real Madrid team contested the Super Cup with Sevilla, the most successful coach in Champions League history was taking it all in his stride. Carlo Ancelotti is modest about his achievements after winning the Champions League twice with Milan and again last May with Real. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo double secures Super Cup . Quality: Carlo Ancelotti remains the most successful coach in Champions League history . Modest: Ancelotti remains a very level-headed individual despite all his success in the game . Assets: Ancelotti can call upon the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale at the Bernabeu . VIDEO Ronaldo double secures Super Cup . More than Mourinho’s two titles. More than Guardiola’s two with Barcelona. One more final than Paisley’s three. He knows there is pressure to deliver another, perhaps even more now that Los Blancos have added James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos to their stable. They are, as they proved yet again last night, a phenomenal team. The trick is to manage them, to negotiate those tricky moments when he is asked about this player or that in the frenzy before Super Cup finals. After naming Gareth Bale as the best player on the planet before this clash, he quickly added Sergio Ramos and Cristiano Ronaldo. He doesn’t want to upset anyone. This dressing room is bulging with big names, superstars with enormous egos and worldwide acclaim from millions of supporters. They all want a slice of the action. Ancelotti’s man-management skills are perhaps unequalled, and he is seemingly liked and respected in equal measure by his squad after he landed the Big One — La Decima — last May. That thrilling night in Lisbon, when Real eventually dismantled Atletico Madrid and beat them 4-1, was his third Champions League triumph as a coach. He also won it twice as a player with Milan. This is the man who was sacked by Chelsea in 2011 a year after winning the Double in his first season in English football. Despite the success, Chelsea’s defeat against Mourinho’s Inter over two legs in the Champions League second round in 2010 was the beginning of the end. This victory, confirmed by the brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo and his two goals, adds to the aura of Ancelotti. He fended off a remarkable question about the possibility of him being sacked by Real president Florentino Perez if he fails to land La Liga this season. Truth is, as club captain Iker Casillas explained, there is pressure to appear at Cibeles Square at the end of every season for the trophy parade. Pedigree: Ancelotti has a fabulous record at both domestic and European level . Remember Mourinho had three cracks at the Champions League during his spell at the Bernabeu and failed to reach the final with this extraordinary squad. Ancelotti is racking up the trophies, having won league titles in Italy, England and France. The challenge this season is to wrestle La Liga back from Atletico and fend off the inevitable threat of Barcelona when the domestic season gets under way on August 25. Between now and then they have a two-legged Copa del Rey final against Atletico before the league opener at the Bernabeu against Cordoba. Everywhere you look, they are competing for trophies and they will go deep into the Champions League again with this incredible front line rampaging across Europe. Behind it all is the quiet man of continental football, making the subtle tweaks to his team as they chase honours at every turn. Ronaldo remains the face of this football club, but Ancelotti is the brains behind it all.","Despite many others being mentioned before him in terms of managerial esteem Ancelotti is the most successful coach in European football .

"Two female bank employees were subjected to years of sexual harassment and bullying by managers and clients, a tribunal heard. Maria Rayworth and Deena Rosario Al Bazi claim they were subjected to lewd behaviour by customers and were not backed up by bosses at the Arab National Bank in London. In one incident, Mrs Bazi, 57, kneed a former chairman of the bank in the groin to stop him making advances to her in a lift. ‘As soon as the doors of the lift closed, he threw himself against me and tried to kiss me,’ she said. ‘I managed to bring one of my knees up and knee him in the private parts. I was very scared but also really shocked.’ Deena Bazi, left, says she was subjected to constant bullying by male bosses. Maria Rayworth, right, said she was bombarded with lewd texts by a bank client . But when she reported it to her boss, general manager Safwan Afifi, he was surprised at her attitude. ‘I went upstairs and told Mr Afifi what had happened. He was shocked I had pushed him away and resisted,’ she said. ‘He told me, “My God, This is the chairman of the bank and you did this to the chairman of the bank, you will get into trouble for this”.’ The incident took place in 2006. Mrs Bazi, who was the bank’s £39,000-a-year relationship manager, said that on another occasion a customer, who knew her husband was dying of motor neurone disease, asked intimate questions about her sex life. Mrs Rayworth, 46, said a former board member had asked her why she was childless – then offered to impregnate her. When she complained to Mr Afifi, she said, he laughed and told her: ‘What do you want me to do about it, he’s a board member.’ Mrs Rayworth, who was the £36,000-a-year head of customer service, said a client cornered her and fondled her belly when she did fall pregnant, saying: ‘How’s my baby?’ Another client would grope her legs when sitting next to her in meetings and started texting her ‘all times of the day and night’. ‘He would tell me he was in the shower, and ask me if I was thinking of him,’ she told the tribunal. ‘I felt shocked, degraded and physically sick. ‘Nothing was ever done. It was absolutely clear to me that management expected female members of staff to put up with harassing behaviour from clients, particularly if they were VIPs.’ However the bank claims no such harassment took place and there were no records she had ever made a formal complaint. Mrs Rayworth said Mr Afifi’s deputy, Stephen Blyth would constantly scratch his groin and play with himself through his trousers in front of her. Mrs Bazi alleges that she and other female staff were subjected to constant bullying by Mr Blyth and Mr Afifi. However Rebecca Tuck, for the bank, said of Mr Afifi, who left the bank in March 2013: ‘He was a bully to male members of staff, not just female ones.’ The two women who claim sex discrimination, each worked for the bank for more than 20 years. Mrs Bazi, who also claims unfair dismissal, was sacked by the bank for allegedly authorising a fraudulent payment in the summer of 2013. Mrs Rayworth resigned last December after she received a formal warning over the same fraud and was left suffering from severe depression. Maria Rayworth and Deena Rosario Al Bazi claim they were subjected to lewd behaviour by customers and were not backed up by bosses at the Arab National Bank in London. Above, the bank's London offices . The women were disciplined after they transferred $170,000 from a client’s bank account to accounts in America, after being tricked into believing the transactions had been authorised by him. A fraudster had hacked the client’s email accounts to request the transfer and also hacked Mrs Bazi’s emails. The bank claims the women should have called the client to ensure he had wanted the money transferred. Mrs Rayworth told the tribunal that in 2012, when there was a $520,000 fraud the bank employee involved had not even received a verbal warning. Mrs Bazi told the tribunal: ‘I was treated less favourably than male colleagues. Mr Blyth and Mr Afifi believed that I thought I was above them and that as a woman I had got too big for my boots.’ The bank said the women had made up or overstated their claims, and that bosses did act on their complaints about customers’ behaviour. Miss Tuck said of Mrs Bazi’s claims: ‘These were scurrilous allegations. When there was a grain of truth in them you grossly exaggerated them.’ The tribunal continues.

"A grandmother has spent £4,000 covering her house in 'anti wi-fi' paint after claiming wireless signals are causing her health problems. Stefanie Russell paid for her house in Steyning, West Sussex to be covered in four thick  coats of the special paint, and has banned mobile phone and computers from her house. Ms Russell says that she is highly sensitive to the rays emitted by wi-fi signals and it often leaves her suffering from headaches and nausea. Stefanie Russell, pictured outside her house in West Sussex, which is currently being covered with 'anti wi-fi' paint by workmen . Both her interior and exterior walls are being covered with the paint and Ms Russell also owns a special device, which detects unwanted wi-fi signals in her home . She believes that her symptoms are so severe she cannot travel on public transport because of the number of portable devices being used. Now, she is having the inside and outside of her home covered with the special paint, which costs £28 a litre and claims to block wi-fi signals from entering or leaving her house. The 72-year-old said: 'I've not been diagnosed by a doctor but my GP surgery is aware of my condition. 'Every time I am near wi-fi or mobile phone signals I feel ill. 'It makes it difficult for me to get around and see people. I don't touch the internet or email - it's not safe. The grandmother claims that the wi-fi signals severely affect her health and leave her experiencing headaches and nausea . 'The painting inside and outside my house is nearly complete. I feel much better now I'm more protected.' The paint works by containing aluminium-iron oxide, which resonates at the same frequency as wifi. It means that when it is coated on walls, signals are absorbed and blocked from entering the rooms. Ms Russell also has a special device, which detects unwanted signals in her home.

"Nick Clegg will promise tax cuts, a crackdown on foreign workers who cannot speak English and free childcare at the next election, secret documents reveal. The Lib Dems' red lines for a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour were revealed as photographers snapped papers carried by the party's strategy chief Ryan Coetzee as he left a meeting in Westminster. The front page demands include tackling the deficit, an income tax cut worth £400, increasing spending on mental health and protecting budgets for nurseries, schools and colleges from cuts. The front page of the Lib Dem manifesto, which will carry the red lines for a new coalition in 2015, were revealed in documents captured by photographers . It includes a promise to balance the budget, cut income tax by £400, improve mental health care and protect spending on nurseries, schools and colleges from cuts . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg hopes the manifesto, leaked in a blunder today, will help to keep him in power after May next year. The files were revealed by the Lib Dems' director of strategy Ryan Coetzee (right) Mr Coetzee was pictured on Whitehall today, where he was seen walking (centre) next to Lib Dem election chief Lord Ashdown (second right) and Energy Secretary Ed Davey (left) Senior Lib Dems met today to discuss the blueprint for the party's pitch to voters in May 2015. It came hours after Mr Clegg admitted the party risks appearing 'invisible' to the public as the smaller party in the coalition. However, he hopes that a small list of eye-catching policies will win enough support to ensure his party again holds the balance of power. Mr Coetzee was photographed leaving Mr Clegg's Whitehall HQ this afternoon clutching copies of the draft manifesto. South African Mr Coetzee is paid £110,000 as head of strategy and spends much of his time advising Mr Clegg on how to boost the Lib Dems’ dismal poll ratings. One poll yesterday put them behind the Green party. The document he was carrying states: 'Only the Liberal Democrats will create the opportunity for everyone by building a stronger economy and a fairer society.' It promises to 'balance the budget' by 2018, bringing down Britain's debts. There is a pledge of an income tax cut worth £400-a-year for low and middle earners by increasing the income tax threshold to £12,500 paid for by increasing taxes on the richest. Page two of the document includes what are likely to be key demands for the Lib Dems in coalition talks . The promises include language tests for benefits claimants, increased childcare for all children and help for renters to buy their own home . Nick Clegg has revealed he would like to install a webcam inside Number 10 to film his rows with David Cameron. The Lib Dem leader admitted that being in the smaller party of a coalition meant he was at risk of being 'invisible' to voters. It came as a poll put the Lib Dems behind the Green party for the first time, raising fresh fears Mr Clegg's party will be hammered in next year's general election. In other European countries, the smaller coalition party has often paid a heavier price at the ballot box. Voters often choose to punish them for breaking promises while the larger party is able to claim credit for the good news. Mr Clegg said it was a problem the Lib Dems face but insisted he had not disappeared from view and suggested a live internet feed to record his influence in the corridors of power. He told ITV's The Agenda: 'I certainly accept, and you see this across Europe, the fate of smaller parties in coalition. 'Sometimes I wish I could persuade David Cameron to have a webcam.' However he also admitted: 'I don't think that's going to happen.' On mental health, there will be guaranteed waiting times equal to physical health conditions. And on education it promises every child will have a qualified teacher, with spending protected for nurseries, schools and colleges. This goes much further than the Tory promise to protect the schools budget from cuts. The four areas will be seen as 'red lines' for the Lib Dems to enter a new power-sharing deal with Labour or the Tories. However, a second page of pledges will be regarded as key demands for a future coalition. They include an ambitious promise to offer up to 20 hours free childcare for almost all pre-school children by 2020. Under the plan, all parents with children aged two to four will be offered 20 hours of free childcare every week. At present, all three and four year olds get 15 hours a week, with the poorest 40 per cent of two year-olds also getting 15 hours. In a major extension of the promise, the Lib Dems will say that eventually the 20 hours should also be offered to all toddlers over the age of 9 months, as long as both parents are working. Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson said: 'Liberal Democrats want to help families with childcare support and nursery education right the way through from the end of parental leave to the start of school.' The document, photographed outside the Scotland Office on Whitehall, also reveals the Lib Dems are planning to toughen their stance on immigration. All new claimants for Jobseekers Allowance will have their English skills assessed, and those who are considered to have 'poor' English will have their benefits cut unless they take language lessons. There is also a promise to 'bring back proper border checks so we know who's coming in and leaving the UK, allowing the government to identify and deport people who over-stay their visa'. On housing, more help is promised for people struggling to get on to the property ladder. It includes a 'new model of affordable housing' where rent payments earn a stake in a home, 'creating a path to home ownership for lower income working families'. Under-21s are promised to pay just a third of their bus fares so they can get to college or work. Other pledges include a £250 'Carer's Bonus', a mansion tax on properties worth more than £2million and at least one GP in every area open from 7am to 7pm, seven days-a-week. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'The fact that the key sentence on this document is 'only the Liberal Democrats will create opportunity for everyone by building a stronger economy and a fairer society' shouldn't surprise anyone. 'The public will have already heard it many times from us and everyone will be hearing a lot more about it between now and May. 'The subjects mentioned – tax, mental health and education – were the key themes of Nick Clegg's Conference speech. And unlike Ed Miliband, we think tackling the deficit should be a top priority for the next government. 'Like all political parties, we're currently discussing our priorities for the next Parliament and we'll provide more details in due course.'","Lib Dem strategy chief Ryan Coetzee caught carrying draft file in Whitehall .

"It's a name that won’t register with many Manchester City supporters, but Sevilla’s Spanish midfielder Denis Suarez, no relation to you know who, played two League Cup games for the Premier League champions before moving to Barcelona last year. There he played for the Catalans’ B-team before going on loan to Sevilla this season.

"There have been rocks that look like traffic lights, and even a perfectly rounded stone discovered on the surface of Mars. But the latest bizarre formation appears to show a rock in the shape of a cannon. Nasa has been beaming photos from the red planet since its Curiosity rover landed in August 2012, and this latest discovery was spotted by amateur astronomer Joe White, 45, from Bristol. Scroll down for video . Nasa has been beaming photos from Mars since its Curiosity rover landed in August 2012, and this latest discovery (pictured left) was spotted by amateur astronomer Joe White, from Bristol. Mr White said: 'I think it looks like an artillery piece - but it's way too small for that really.' Stock image of a cannon pictured right . The 45-year-old space video journalist said he noticed a chuck of rock in the corner of footage while scanning Nasa's official images. He said: 'I think it looks like a gun - as in an artillery piece - but it's way too small for that really.' Last month, a perfectly rounded rock was also spotted on the Martian surface, and continuing the cannon analogy, it looks similar to a cannonball. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The same week, a rock shaped like a traffic light was also spotted as Curiosity roamed around the base of Mars' Mount Sharp. In the image, a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are shown being stacked on top of each other. They bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on Earth. But it’s highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation. The image was shot from the six-foot (1.8 metre) high, left-hand side mast cam on the Curiosity Rover. The 'traffic light' rock was also spotted by Mr White, who runs a YouTube channel called ArtAlienTV. ‘I saw this one and I thought “hang on, that looks a bit strange”. I think it looks like a traffic light. ‘It is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference, but I would estimate it was about 12 inches [30.5cm]. ‘I posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole.’ The Curiosity rover recently spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on Mars (shown in the red ring in this image). Washington-based Nasa is yet to comment on the latest discovery. The finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on Mars can be . The 'traffic lights' (left) were spotted by Curiosity (right) on its way to the base of Mount Sharp, a geologically fascinating region that could explain how Mars lost its wet and habitable environment. Other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole . The rock was spotted by space video journalist Joe White. Mr White said: 'I saw this one and I thought ""hang on, that looks a bit strange"". I think it looks like a traffic light' (stock image shown). The image from Curiosity is just one of many fascinating rocks on the red planet that resembles something we are familiar with on Earth . Just days earlier, Curiosity spotted the ball-shaped rock on the surface of Mars. Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter, according to Discovery News. Curiosity is currently at the base of Mount Sharp, which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago. The area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of Mars. And, scientists hope the region might reveal how and why Mars lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment, with water flowing on its surface. This, in turn, may provide answers on the future of Earth. The discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the Martian surface (shown). Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter.

"A working men's club in the north of England is the world's biggest consumer of French Benedictine liqueur, downing 1,000 bottles a year of the alcoholic beverage. The golden tipple has been a favourite at the Burnley miners' working men's social club for more than a century after being popular among soldiers who developed a taste for it during the First World War and drank it to keep warm. Since then the drink has become a best seller at the 600-member club – which has even introduced a 'Bene Bomb' in a bid to keep it popular among the younger members. Scroll down for video . Barman Dan Jakes pours Benedectine liqueur at the Burnley miners' working men's social club - the world's biggest consumer of the beverage where 600 members down around 1,000 bottles of the drink every year . The drink became popular in Burnley after soldiers from East Lancashire were drafted to Normandy in the First World War and developed a taste for it after drinking it to keep warm. Pictured: Members try the 'Bene Bomb' Several members round off their evenings with a 'Bene'n'hot' - the liqueur served with hot water - while others take it on the rocks. It has even been 're-branded' to appeal to the newest members of the club – by being mixed with an energy drink as an alternative to the infamous JagerBomb. Club secretary Alan Kennedy said: 'The soldiers used to drink it in the trenches and the hot water obviously kept them warm but it also made it last longer. 'When the lads made it back they all wanted Bene'n'hot so in November 1918 they club managed to get 18 bottles delivered. 'It was difficult to get hold of but they managed it in then end. I think they had to order more before Christmas so it went quickly. 'They also drink it in Colne, Nelson and Accrington because the soldiers came from those areas. 'I don't know anywhere else that drinks Bene'n'hot but it's the most popular way to drink it here. The club is the world's biggest consumer of the beverage with the majority of members enjoying it with water . The drink was discovered by the men of the 11th battalion of the East Lancashire regiment after they were drafted to Fecamp in Normandy - where it is made. They asked the club to import it on their return from the war . 'Most of the members - about 60 to 70 per cent - drink the Bene'n'hot. 'A few would have Bene and ice and one or two will have a straight Bene at the end of the night. 'Most of the lads who come in here will finish with a Bene'n'hot at the end of the night.' He added: 'Some of the younger ones are drinking it now, the 30 and 40-year-olds, so it is still popular. 'We have just started selling the Bene Bomb - like a Jager Bomb except with a shot of Bene in the energy drink. 'We've only just started with it but I reckon it will be popular one.' The club has even dedicated an entire part of the clubhouse to the drink by unveiling the Benedictine Room . Benedictine liqueur features up to 27 ingredients, including an array of herbs and spices, such as Lemon Balm . The drink was discovered by the men of the 11th battalion of the East Lancashire regiment after they were drafted to Fecamp in Normandy - where it is made. After being imported to the UK by the working men's club, it also became tradition for Burnley Football Club to sell the liqueur on match days, making it the only English club to do so. Describing the spirit's unique taste, Mr Kennedy said: 'It has a peculiar taste all of its own but I think it is a taste between brandy and whisky. 'It doesn't have the heat of whisky and tastes sweeter. The hot water just makes it seem so palatable.' In recent years, the drink has become so popular that the men's club has even opened a 'Benedictine room' especially dedicated to it. Benedictine is produced at Fecamp in Normandy . According to legend, the recipe for Benedictine liqueur was invented in 1510 by Benedictine monk Dom Bernardo Vincelli. However, it was developed by Alexandre Le Grand, with the help of a local chemist, in the 19th century. The recipe is shrouded in secrecy and there are only three people in the world who currently know the complete recipe for making the spirit. It is has been produced at the Benedictine Monastery at Fecamp on the coast of Normandy, France, since 1510. The monastery was destroyed during the French revolution and it has since been produced by Mr le Grand. Benedictine features up to 27 ingredients, including an array of herbs and spices. Its three main ingredients are Angelica, Hyssop and Lemon Balm. It is aged for up to 17 months before bottling and each bottle has the initials D.O.M. on the label - which stands for 'Deo Optimo Maximo' ('To God, most good, most great'). The Burnley miners' working men's social club is the world's biggest consumer of the liqueur, while Burnley Football Club is the only one in England to sell the beverage on match days.","Working men's club in Burnley is world's biggest consumer of Benedictine .

"Whether it's Y-fronts, boxers or patterned trunks, when it comes to underwear most men stick with what they know and like. And while different pockets of the nation yield their own outerwear trends, few would imagine that undergarments are as heavily influenced by geography. But it seems men in some parts of the country have more in common with their neighbours than once thought, with different styles of underwear sweeping Britain's regions. Scroll down for video . The underwear map highlights the different trends among male shoppers by region in Britain last year . While those in Scotland stick with trusty jersey trunks, men in Norwich and across the north west prefer Y-fronts - the favourite of local fictional character Alan Partridge. Label-loving football cities like Manchester and Liverpool sell more designer underwear than any other kind, with Armani boxers a favourite among the male population. Tight, bright and patterned pants are the firm favourite in the north east, while further south,comfort triumphs over style, with those in the south west sticking with loose fitting, woven boxers. The trends were highlighted by consumer trends among male shoppers across Britain in a report carried out by John Lewis. And while most would think a man's underpants were safe from ever-changing trends, experts say what goes on underneath is just as important as what the rest of the world sees. Nick Keyte, Head of Menswear, said at the department store said: 'Understanding regional trends is a really important part of our job. 'While comfort is key to men’s shopping behaviour when it comes to clothing, a continued trend to experiment with colour and prints has been reflected in our shoppers’ underwear choices. 'The modern man wants to express his personality throughout his wardrobe.' Y-fronts were the common choice in the North East made popular by the fictional Norwich DJ Alan Partridge played by Steve Coogan (pictured) Tight, bright and colour underwear is what men in the North East prefer as modelled by Geordie Shore stars . Designer boxers in label-loving  Manchester and Liverpool were the most popular with local footballers like David Beckham, a former Manchester United player,  modelling the cities' favourite brand, Armani (pictured) Londoners opted for more eccentric colours and patterns with the capital showing the highest number of sales for pink boxers and socks, a favourite of Prince Harry (pictured) The 2014 report revealed the changing ways Britons shop, with a fifth of all money spent on retail now being handed over online. This Christmas was the first year online shopping was more popular on mobile phones and tablets than at desktop computers. Sunday was the most popular day for web-surfers and certain events saw a surge in specific items throughout the year. Bank Holiday weekends brought about a rise in the number of SatNavs sold, while the popularity of Channel 4 programme Goggle Box encouraged more people to buy TV dinner trays. Speaking of the research, titled How We Live, Shop and Look, John Street, Managing Director of the department store said: 'It seems fitting that in our 150th year as a retailer we are reflecting on the nation’s shopping habits. 'Since our first shop opened in 1864, John Lewis has a barometer for changing trends and tastes. 'This year’s report is even more insightful than last year’s, with richer data, including new sections, such as how the nation shops for its children. We hope that in years to come people will turn to our report for a nostalgic glimpse of the trends that shaped the nation’s shopping habits.'","Consumer trends showed different trends among male shoppers by region .

The Great Flood battered the east coast of England as high spring tides, deep atmospheric low pressure and exceptionally strong northerly gales led to sea water surging over coastal defences and sweeping two miles inland. By the morning of February 1, the death toll on land was estimated at 307 in English coastal towns and villages. Many more died on the continent and at sea. A policeman carries a child to safety at Canvey Island, Essex, during the great floods of 1953 . The UK is 'better prepared than ever before' to respond to major flooding, the Environment Minister has said today. Sixty years ago, the Great Flood battered the east coast of England as high spring tides, deep atmospheric low pressure and exceptionally strong northerly gales led to sea water surging over coastal defences and sweeping two miles inland. By the morning of February 1, the death toll on land was estimated at 307 in English coastal towns and villages. Many more died on the Continent and at sea. It has been named one of the country's worst peace time disasters. Today, Environment Minister Richard Benyon will attend a commemorative service in Humberside and visit the Hull Barrier, which has had a £10million refurbishment over the last 18 months. He said: 'The floods of 1953 saw the terrible loss of over 300 lives and devastating damage to thousands of homes. 'The tragedy was made all the worse by the fact that no flood warning system was in place. 'Today, people have a much better chance to protect their lives, loved ones and possessions and stay safe by signing up for the Environment Agency flood warnings. 'While the risk of extreme weather has never gone away, the country is better prepared than ever before to respond to major flooding and I thank the emergency services and Environment Agency for their hard work during the recent floods.' The Environment Agency said that, despite major improvements to sea defences and warning systems, 1.3 million people or one in 25 homes in England and Wales remain at risk of coastal flooding. The situation is likely to be exacerbated in coming years as a result of climate change, the agency added.","Environmental Agency has 36 flood warnings and 153 flood alerts in place as Britain is blasted by more rain .

"Frank Warren has revealed he has hit a wall of silence in efforts to make a world-title fight between Tyson Fury and Wladimir Klitschko, with Fury all but giving up hope that the bout will happen. The veteran promoter has written to Klitschko’s representatives to make a fight in March between the Ukrainian world champion and Fury, the mandatory challenger for his WBO world title. But there has been no reply to the email and Warren confirmed there have been no positive indications that the younger Klitschko will fight Fury. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tyson Fury: I'm convinced Wladimir Klitschko won't fight me . Tyson Fury, who destroyed Dereck Chisora, may not get his chance to fight Wladimir Klitschko . Frank Warren and Fury were at the Landmark Hotel in London to promote his next fight on February 28 . Klitschko is scheduled to fight in March and will then have to fight Fury or vacate the WBO portion of his collection of world titles. Warren said: ‘We wrote to klitschko’s people, “Why don’t we cut to chase and do the fight in March?” They have not even responded to say “s** off” or “not interested”. ‘I’ve heard nothing at all. The fight will be mandated by the WBO after his next fight. They will then have to sit down with us.’ Should Klitschko vacate it will validate a prediction unbeaten Fury made three years ago.

I can’t see that happening. I would like to fight for the title and take it off him rather than fighting for a vacant title. ‘It is OK (Klitschko) fighting bums, but a guy who can change tempo and style? That is different.

'So now I need to get pregnant by Christmas so both babies are in the same year at school.' The controversial mother-of-three, from Leeds, who fell last week on a drunken night out in London, doesn't mind if she conceives through a night of casual sex. Last month, she looked worse for wear as she enjoyed a night out in London's Soho just weeks after giving birth to her daughter Grace. Showing off her platinum blonde locks, Josie pole-danced in a nightclub, before flashing her pink bra and falling over several times in the street. She first made headlines after getting a boob job on the NHS to help her become famous, she reportedly received taxpayer-funded taxi rides worth £6,000 a year - because she's too infamous to use the bus. Recently, the 24-year-old deemed breastfeeding 'vile and borderline incest'. Left, Josie Cunningham flashes her bra on a night out in Soho, London, and right, she laughs as a passer-by offers assistance . Her comment sparked outrage among mothers who slammed her view as 'disgusting' and 'uneducated'. When asked on Twitter whether she would breastfeed her daughter like new mother Kimberly Walsh, she wrote: 'No I'm not! I think the idea is vile and borderline incest!' But then she revealed an unusual cash-making venture to sell her breast milk to new mothers for £2 an ounce - and £10 an ounce to men with 'milk fetishes'. Her controversial pregnancy also saw her offering tickets to strangers to watch her give birth, and announcing that she would quit smoking and drinking alcohol when she learned she was having a girl. Before going into labour, she revealed she had been 'fooled' into thinking the father was a Premier League footballer.","The 24-year-old mother-of-three gave birth to daughter Grace in September .

"A woman has been found guilty of people trafficking after she forced two Nigerian women into prostitution by making them eat snakes in an African black magic ceremony. Lizzy Idahosa, 24, and her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, made more than £70,000 out of the women, who were terrified with voodoo and made see a witchdoctor for a sinister 'juju' ceremony. Both are now facing jail after Idahosa was convicted of trafficking the women, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property, while Omoruyi was found guilty of money laundering. Couple: Lizzy Idahosa, 24, found guilty of people trafficking after she forced two Nigerian women into prostitution by making them eat snakes in an African black magic ceremony, while her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, was convicted of money laundering . During the couple's trial at Cardiff Crown Court, the jury was told that the two  victims, aged 23 and 29, had their pubic hair shaved and forced to eat live snakes and snails as part of the ritual, and then flown to Britain in the belief that they were going to find a better life. However, when they arrived in the UK they were put to work as prostitutes, working in brothels at massage parlours across England and Wales. They were told they had to give all the money they earned to Idahosa, and believed the black magic curses would make them go insane or die if they refused. 'The couple were involved in the exploitation of two women brought into the UK from Nigeria to work as prostitutes,' said Caroline Rees, prosecuting, during the trial. 'They were bound to this by something called a juju ritual. It was a ceremonial ritual used to full effect to terrify both women into doing what was demanded of them. 'It was used to ensure compliance, secrecy, and they believed if they broke the bond dire consequences would follow: illness, madness, infertility or death. Facing jail: Heavily pregnant Idahosa (left) and Omoruyi (right) were both told they could expect lengthy prison sentences for their part in the trafficking . 'They genuinely believed the powers would work.' The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013. She told officers she had been living rough in Nigeria after her mother died and had wanted to travel to the UK to find her father. She had then met a woman, claiming to be Idahosa’s sister, who promised to make arrangements for her to travel to London, and as part of the agreement had to take part in the ceremony. 'She did not know what was expected of her,' said Ms Rees, who said the woman had been able to pass through immigration at Heathrow. Investigation: The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013 . 'She was taken to a premises full of women dressed in their underwear. There was no explanation as to what was going on but it soon became clear.' The woman started to work as a prostitute and was forced to have sexual intercourse with seven or eight men every day, working in brothels across the UK, including in Cardiff and Swansea. When interviewed, she claimed she had given Idahosa £45,000. The second victim told the court she had paid the defendants £31,400 over two years after working in brothels in Cardiff, Swansea, Barking and East Croydon, and said she had worked in South Wales for a year and eight months. The woman, who like her fellow victim cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had stopped working and changed her sim card so Idahosa could not contact her. However, within a month she received a phone call from her mother in Nigeria. 'I had a call from my mum who told me Lizzy’s people had been to her house and threatened her,' the victim told the jury. 'Lizzy said if I did not pay her she would kill my mum and make me go mad.' Idahosa and Omoruyi, who were arrested at their home in London, denied any wrong doing. But police checked their bank accounts and found a series of transfers with Omoruyi acting as a 'financial middle man'. Idahosa had denied forcing the women to take part in a black magic ceremony, but claimed that she herself had been trafficked into the UK and forced to work as a prostitute. She told the jury she did not know the two women had been trafficked. 'It was only when I told them I was trafficked into the country that I found out they were trafficked,' she said. Idahosa, who is heavily pregnant, said she made an oath with her trafficker before leaving Nigeria and was forced to eat the roast heart of a cockerel. She said: 'I wouldn’t do the things they say I did because I’ve been through it.' The jury was told that cash payments of several hundred pounds a time had been deposited into Omoruyi’s account from locations all over the country, including Glasgow, Sheffield and Southampton. Trial: A jury at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) took just five hours to find the couple guilty after the trial . He had claimed that money came from his friend. 'I am the kind of person who likes clothes and shoes and I’m known for that - I like to find bargains,' he said. 'It is not that it is any fraud money or anything. My account has not been used for anything like that.' During an interview with police, he said: 'I am here to say I do not even know the people you are talking about - I have never seen them. 'I have never involved myself in that kind of activity in this country, even before this country. I have not and I would not,' he had claimed. Idahosa was convicted of a total of eight counts including trafficking two women into and around the UK, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property. Omoruyi was convicted of two offences of money laundering. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court took just five hours to find them guilty. Both were remanded in custody today to be sentenced next month, but judge Tom Crowther QC warned them they will face lengthy custodial sentences. Speaking after the verdicts had been given, Ms Rees said: 'This was a despicable and callous crime. 'These two defendants were involved in an elaborate deception, taking advantage of cultural and financial issues in order to gain a devastating hold over their vulnerable victims. 'Once the victims had entered the UK, they were exploited and abused in the most brutal manner. Human trafficking is totally unacceptable in our society. 'I hope today’s convictions will send a clear message that those who seek to degrade and demean others for their own personal gain can expect to be pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 'It took an immense amount of courage for the victims to come forward and seek to break free from their ordeal. I hope that their courage will act as an inspiration for others who may find themselves in a similar position. 'Whilst we cannot undo what has already happened to these victims, we can hope that today’s convictions will help them as they try to move on from their ordeal.' A spokesman for the Home Office, which led the investigation, said: 'Trafficking is an appalling crime that has no place in today’s society but, as this case has shown, it is taking place here. 'That is why we are taking action on a number of fronts. 'We are working with law enforcement overseas, the law is being strengthened and the Modern Slavery Bill, one of the first of its kind in the world, will make it easier to prosecute the criminals behind trafficking and improve the protection of victims.'","Lizzy Idahosa and husband Jackson Omoruyi made £70,000 from victims .

"Ally McCoist has hit back at claims he is putting his own bank balance before the financial welfare of Rangers. The 52-year-old discussed his resignation as Ibrox boss for the first time on Thursday after being branded greedy by some fans for refusing to tear up his contract following a string of poor results. With his team languishing nine points behind leaders Hearts in the Championship, McCoist bowed to public pressure last week by telling the board he would serve his 12-month notice period. Rangers manager Ally McCoist says he intends to run out his notice after announcing his decision to resign . It was business as usual as McCoist was all smiles as he lead a Rangers' training session at Murray Park . McCoist intends to speak with new chief executive Derek Llambias about the future of the club . And the Ibrox icon says he intends to honour the full terms of his contract with his salary controversially set to rise to £750,000 for the last year. In a rebuke to the board, McCoist also questioned the public exposure of his salary on two different occasions but insisted the decision to resign as manager was ‘a relief’. ‘I can understand the opinion of those who say go now, of course I can, and I respect it,’ he said. ‘But I have got a contract to honour and that is what I am going to do because I ain’t walking out on a contract - it’s not the right thing to do. The bottom line is, until someone tells me otherwise, I’ve got a contract I want to honour.’ McCoist met director Sandy Easdale for brief talks on his resignation on Wednesday. Unable to pay the lump sum required to terminate his contract early, the Ibrox board hoped the manager might volunteer to sacrifice any pay-off and walk away. ‘I went into the meeting on Wednesday looking to discuss me handing in my notice,’ added McCoist. ‘But at no time did I think that I wouldn’t be walking out of it as Rangers manager. I was expecting to walk out of it as Rangers manager for the next 12 months and that’s the case.’ Asked if he expected to see out the full 12-month notice period set down in his one-year rolling contract, McCoist added: ‘Yes. Absolutely. ‘I don’t know if it’s realistic or not but I expect it to happen because it is in the boundaries of the contract. Rangers captain Lee McCulloch in hysterics as he didn't seem to be too affected by his manager's decision . McCoist (left) shares a joke with former player Nacho Novo during the training session at Murray park . ‘Whose court is the ball in now? I wouldn’t say the ball is in anybody’s court. I think it has been made quite clear by the board and myself that it is business as usual.’ Defending himself against the accusations of greed, McCoist drew a distinction between himself and the stream of directors who have walked away from the club with large pay-offs, saying: ‘I worked for nothing for months. I decided to take a 45 per cent cut, I then took a 40 per cent cut. ‘I’m not saying: “A big pat on the back for Ally” but there’s a wee bit more to it than meets the eye. ‘When I signed my contract for Rangers there was no negotiation. ‘Martin Bain (former Rangers chief executive) put a contract down and I took a pen and signed it. I was just delighted I was getting the job so that’s what I did. ‘During the administration period I worked for nothing so there are other factors that should be taken into account as well. I can understand different views and opinions on it but there’s a wee bit more to it.’ The Rangers statement to the Stock Exchange confirming McCoist’s resignation came on Monday morning. Pointedly, it also revealed that the manager’s salary would rise for the final year of his contract. David Templeton (centre) looks to close down the ball during the team's training session on Friday . ‘Did it disappoint me that my wages were highlighted?’ McCoist asked. ‘When I became the first Rangers manager in history to have his salary put in the accounts that made me realise that probably nothing should shock me. ‘It didn’t disappoint me because it didn’t surprise me. Was it unnecessary? That would be the opinion of many, yes. If I said it was unnecessary that would give the impression I was upset about it. But I’m not. ‘I have nothing to hide, I have nothing to be ashamed of. It is what it is. ‘People will have their own opinion of it and see it for what it is. But it’s past now. Put it this way, I was surprised more when my salary was put in the Rangers accounts.’ Uncertain if he will now attend what is sure to be a heated club AGM on Monday, McCoist said the response from the ‘vast majority’ of the Rangers support to his resignation has been positive. ‘The vast, vast majority of them have been very good in the respect that they’ve thanked me. The majority are appreciative of the fact it’s a very stressful job and it might be time for me, in a year’s time, to enjoy my life.’","News of Ally McCoist's resignation from Rangers came last Friday night .

"An Australian couple has made the shock discovery that they have no biological connection to their child, who was born via surrogate in India. The case is the latest in a string of international surrogacy controversies, with three new cases revealed in a new report into surrogacy by the Attorney-General’s office. The couple, who chose not to be named, have come forward after the report exposed a range of startling problems within Indian surrogacy, according to Woman's Day. The report reveals that another Australian citizen discovered he had no genetic link to the twin girls he ‘commissioned' through a surrogate in India, due to a crucial IVF error. Scroll down for video . More cases are coming to light, revealing the Australian couples who discovered they have no genetic link to their babies, born via surrogate in India . It was agreed that the babies would be conceived using the father’s sperm and a donor egg, but a paternity test showed the Australian is not the twins' biological father. In a third case, an Australian couple is in custody of a child born via India surrogate who is not be their genetic offspring, according to the report. Indian surrogacy is under the spotlight due to the confirmation a baby born by an Indian surrogate was abandoned by its Australian parents in 2012. It’s understood the couple left their child in India due to its gender, but returned to Australia with the baby’s twin. Federal Circuit Court Chief Judge John Pascoe has called for a national inquiry into surrogacy . Australian Family Court Chief Justice Diana Bryant said in a statement that she was told by Australian embassy officials in New Delhi that the couple's decision to leave the baby they paid an Indian surrogate to deliver was based on its gender. The twins were a brother and sister. Bryant did not know what gender the parents wanted. Family Court Chief Justice Diana Bryant revealed that a surrogate mother gave birth to twins in India in 2012 but their Australian parents only took one home . ""They explained that when the commissioning parents were advised that twins were born, the commissioning parents refused to agree to take both children,"" Bryant said. ""It is believed that they only wanted one child as they already had one and wanted one of a different gender,"" she added. The Australian High Commission in New Delhi delayed giving the Australian parents a visa for the wanted child while they tried to persuade them to take both children, Bryant said. A person claiming to be a friend later took the unwanted that baby. But embassy officials doubted the person was a friend and suspected money had changed hands, Bryant said. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the High Commission's role had been limited to assessing the parents' application for citizenship and a passport for the chosen twin. ""As the parents decided to apply for citizenship for only one child and consequently the other child was not granted Australian citizenship, India became responsible for the welfare of the other child and adoption arrangements became a matter for its legal system,"" the department said in a statement. ""Since this case, the Indian Government has tightened controls on commercial surrogacy arrangements in India,"" it added, without elaborating. The news comes only two months after it was revealed West Australian couple David Farnell and his wife Wendy allegedly abandoned Mr Farnell's biological child Gammy, who was born with Down Syndrome to an Indonesian surrogate mother. The Farnell's controversially took Gammy's healthy twin sister Pipah home with them while Gammy was adopted by his birth mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua. Further controversy ensued when it was revealed Mr Farnell was a former convicted paedophile. Gammy's story soon led to demands that Australia's surrogacy laws be reviewed while the Thai government discussed banning commercial surrogacy altogether. Consular officials told her the abandoned child was passed to another family. 'But they expressed to me their great concern that in fact money had changed hands,' she said. 'If that's true, that's basically trafficking children.' The news comes only two months after it was revealed West Australian couple David Farnell and his wife Wendy allegedly abandoned Mr Farnell's biological child Gammy, who was born with Down Syndrome to an Indonesian surrogate mother . Federal Circuit Court Chief Judge John Pascoe has called for a national inquiry into surrogacy. He told the ABC that the Family Court and Federal Court had been left to deal with a process that did not have appropriate legislation in place. 'I am really concerned that this issue has not received the attention it properly deserves,' he said. Comment was being sought from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

"Northampton broke Leicester hearts in last season's Aviva Premiership play-offs - and Saints boss Jim Mallinder believes the Tigers will be 'hurting' ahead of Saturday's showdown at Franklin's Gardens. The dramatic 21-20 victory for Northampton, which was secured by a late Tom Wood try, ended Leicester's run of appearing in every Premiership final since 2004. Northampton marched on to Twickenham, where they beat Saracens in similarly dramatic circumstances to be crowned English champions for the first time, and victory this weekend would guarantee they lead the Premiership heading into Christmas. Northampton boss Jim Mallinder wants his team to be wary of Leicester looking for revenge on Saturday . 'It is going to be massive again,' Mallinder said. 'Leicester have had a few sort of ups and downs a little bit this season, but generally they are getting back up there, they are playing well, they have got lots of players back and we know that games against Leicester are good spicy affairs.' While Tigers will arrive in the hotbed of an East Midlands derby following back-to-back European Champions Cup games against French heavyweights Toulon, Saints hardly broke sweat in racking up more than 100 points at Italian side Treviso's expense. Mallinder, though, does not not believe such contrasting derby build-ups will have any bearing on their fierce rivals' latest meeting. 'Sometimes, it can help you in that you are playing at that level and intensity, but I think all our players are used to it,' Mallinder added. 'They play in enough big games over the season, and we are going into it in good shape. We have got a good fit squad. 'What a cracking game it was last time (against Leicester). Courtney Lawes is looking forward to being involved in another exciting encounter against Leicester . 'It was so close and could have gone either way, so they will be hurting, but we also remember they've had the better record against us over the past few outings. 'We won the last one, but generally they've done the job on us.' England lock Courtney Lawes, who signed a new Northampton contract this week, said: 'It is a local derby, and all the boys know it's going to be ferocious. It's always exciting. 'It is the first time we have played them since last season's semi-final. They will be ready to get some revenge on us, and we have to be ready for that.' Local bragging rights are also up for grabs in the west country on Saturday when Gloucester and Bath clash at Kingsholm. Last season's corresponding clash - won 18-17 by Bath following a late converted penalty try - proved eventful for all the wrong reasons after Gloucester finished the game with only 11 players. Scrum-half Tavis Knoyle was sent off following a mass brawl close to full-time, while home prop Sila Puafisi received a red card earlier in the game. Gloucester also had two players sin-binned, and Bath picked up three yellow cards. Bath's star rugby league recruit Sam Burgess returns to the bench this weekend after making his full debut on the European stage against Montpellier last Friday, with Kyle Eastmond partnering Jonathan Joseph in midfield. Sam Burgess is set to return to the bench for Bath after making his European debut against Montpellier . 'Since I've arrived (at the club), nearly every Gloucester supporter I've met, the one game they've talked about is Bath,' Gloucester rugby director David Humphreys said. 'But we have spoken about it this week as being just another game, it's game 10 of 22 across the course of the season. 'In this league, every game is important and it's a big run for us coming into the Christmas period. 'We've got a little bit of momentum, based on the last three games. We've actually played quite well. 'But Bath is going to be a huge test. They've been outstanding this season, so for us it's another chance for us to measure ourselves against one of the top teams in the country.' Elsewhere on Saturday, Saracens host rock-bottom London Welsh and Harlequins entertain Newcastle, while Sunday's Premiership action sees Wasps - watched by a crowd of more than 28,000 - play their first home game at Coventry's Ricoh Arena, with London Irish providing the opposition.","Northampton won 21-20 against Leicester to end their Premiership final run .

"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes that three points against Arsenal on Sunday could be the catalyst for change at Anfield. Brendan Rodgers' side have stuttered through the first half of this season, and sit 11th in the Premier League after 16 games. Gerrard, though, is confident that a win against fellow strugglers Arsenal could kick-start their season. 'We are a strong dressing room with a good manager - it will only be a matter of time before we turn it around,' he told the club's website. 'I've got confidence it will happen - and hopefully it will start with a victory over Arsenal because that could really kick-start things for us. Steven Gerrard is confident that things are moving forward at Liverpool despite a disappointing start . Brendan Rodgers has come under fire and needs a win on Sunday to take the Reds into the top half . 'We're still moving forward, I really believe that. I'm the first to admit it's been tough this season, it's been a bit of a roller-coaster. We aren't where we want to be in the table and nobody is happy about that. 'But we're determined to put it right. It will take time. But I have that belief that we'll get it right and we will get there. If we can come through a big game against Arsenal and get a win then that could be the catalyst for us to go on a run of results.' When the two sides met at Anfield last season, Liverpool put five past Arsene Wenger's side, and three points this term can move them into the top half for Christmas.

"Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet will target Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick in a quest for derby glory while hoping the rookie does not suffer another disaster. The 21-year-old will line up against the Black Cats on Sunday in the biggest game of his fledgling career to date having conceded a total of eight goals in his first two senior starts for the club inside five days. Alnwick, the Magpies' third-choice keeper, could hardly have made a better start to his spell in the limelight when he played his part in a famous 2-1  victory over Chelsea after Rob Elliot joined the already injured Tim Krul on the sidelines. Gus Poyet plans to put Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick under a lot of pressure in the Tyne-Wear derby . Alnwick was passed fit for the game after sustaining an injury in Newcastle's 4-0 loss to Newcastle in midweek . However, his full debut at Arsenal last weekend resulted in a 4-1 defeat, and he was culpable on at least two occasions on Wednesday evening as Tottenham also scored four times, injuring a shoulder in the process to leave Pardew desperately investigating the possibility of making an emergency loan signing for the derby before the his stand-in was declared fit. Poyet, who looked on with interest from Wearside as the drama unfolded, said: 'It's obvious that that position in particular is very special, the goalkeeper one is unique. 'Planning to do something different? No. Hitting the target? Yes. Putting the ball in the box? Yes. But that's every week, not because we are playing against this goalkeeper. 'Now, that doesn't mean that we are going to have a free-kick in our half and we are going to put it in the air and smash the goalkeeper. 'I hope it's a normal game, no accidents. I would like the game to be played normally, of course to win it and Alnwick to play 90 minutes and that there are no issues and there are no misunderstandings. 'But football, I cannot predict the future at the moment. We are going to play the game normally, I hope it's a normal game. Despite putting a lot of pressure on the young goalkeeper, Poyet says he wants it to be a normal game . Alwick's form will need to improve if he is to cope with the pressure Poyet (left)  intends to put on him . The 21-year-old Newcastle goalkeeper catches the ball in training as he prepares for his first Tyne-Wear derby . 'Now, are we going to have a shot? Yes. Are we going to have a few crosses? I hope he is going to be under pressure. But it's more up to him than to the rest. The rest is all talking.' Sunderland, of course, have won 3-0 on each of their last two visits to St James' Park, and that famous double came either side of a 2-1 success over the Magpies at the Stadium of Light in October last year. That was just Poyet's second game at the helm and followed a 4-0 drubbing at Swansea in his first, so he understandably has fond memories of his derby encounters to date. He said: 'I hope it continues. Listen, there's no better feeling. There are games when football is very nice, but special games are incredible and this is a special one, and when you are on the winning side, there is no better feeling than that. 'I only miss as a player finals and big games, derbies. The rest of the games... sometimes here on Monday nights, raining, in the north in winter, no, I don't miss those games whatsoever. 'These are the ones you want to play in, really. They're the ones in which you want to be involved because it's a great feeling when you are on the pitch, scoring and making your team win or helping your team win. That's a great feeling.' Poyet's side currently sit in 15th place in the table having lost just four games all season, but they have won only two, a situation he is desperate to remedy this weekend. The Uruguayan said: 'There are key moments during the season and we are looking for that. Our idea is to go and win two or three in a row, which we haven't done, and that will change the season around. 'The biggest and best game to do it is in the derby, so it would be a perfect start.'","Gus Poyet said Sunderland plan to put a lot of pressure on Jak Alnwick .

"Derek McInnes has shot down suggestions he would be willing to abandon Aberdeen to replace Ally McCoist at troubled Rangers. And the manager who has revitalised the Pittodrie club took a veiled dig at the current Ibrox regime by declaring: ‘There’s a lot to be said about being happy at your work and I’m extremely happy here.’ Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne admitted this week that McInnes is bound to be attracting covetous glances after leading the club to their first silverware in 19 years with last season’s League Cup triumph - but he still expects the former Rangers midfielder to stay with the Dons. Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes has rejected speculation linking him with the Rangers job . And, despite speculation about a return to Govan, McInnes insisted that he and No 2 Tony Docherty are perfectly content to remain with a team who are currently one point off second place in the Premiership and with a League Cup semi-final to come against Dundee United. ‘I think (talk about the Rangers job) is unfair. There is still a manager in place at that club, he’s a friend of mine as well,’ said the 43-year-old. ‘I have no desire to leave Aberdeen at the minute. I’m really enjoying myself here and I feel we have work to finish. ‘There’s a lot to be said about being happy at your work and I’m extremely happy here. ‘The chairman and I speak on a regular basis and we have the same aspirations for the club. We have just started something and as good as things are at the minute we still feel there is a lot of improvement to come both on and off the pitch. Ally McCoist has resigned from the post at rangers but might be made to serve his 12-month notice period . ‘I have a really special relationship with him, a helluva lot of respect for him and I love my job here. And Tony would echo that as well.’ McInnes, meanwhile, has praised Shay Logan for his handling of the racism row with Celtic’s Aleksandar Tonev. Bulgarian international winger Tonev this week lost his appeal against a seven-match suspension for racially abusing the Dons defender during a match at Celtic Park in September. McInnes has been impressed by the way Logan has refused to let the three-month saga affect the quality of his performances on the pitch. And the Dons boss called on all parties to ‘move on’ after hoping the appeal verdict can draw a line under the affair. ‘We can’t comprehend how much pressure Shay has felt under the scrutiny of it all but he has never allowed his performances to dip,’ said McInnes. McInnes said he is 'extremely happy' in his role with Aberdeen and is not looking to move . ‘That says a lot for him but he is a confident, bubbly boy and very popular with everybody here. He loves his football and is committed to us. He loves being at Aberdeen, loves his training and is a very popular player. ‘Getting the full support from everyone at the club was important to him and rightly so. ‘We have always supported him, just as we would support any of our players or employee who had been wronged. ‘Now Shay and everyone else at the club just wants to move on and talk about football. I am delighted we can draw a line under it and now the appeal has been completed I think we can all move on now.’ McInnes also praised Shay Logan for the way he handled the fallout from the Aleksandar Tonev issue . In happier events off the pitch, Aberdeen this week announced an agreement to wipe the club’s historic debt of £14.5million. The club will now press ahead with building a new training ground at Bridge of Don in time for next season, while plans to move to a new 21,0000-seater stadium at Loirston Loch will be revisited. Despite those developments, Milne indicated that money would not be available for transfers in January and McInnes backed his chairman’s decision. He said: ‘The debt has hung about the club for so long and this does give us an opportunity to maximise where we are as a club. But we reiterate the chairman’s words – it doesn’t mean all of a sudden everything is rosy in the garden and we can start splashing cash everywhere. ‘I know what I have to work with. We have used the budget well this year and we have to continue to do that.’","Derek McInnes has rejected speculation linking him with the Rangers job .

"Former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice wasted no time celebrating his NFL reinstatement over the weekend, heading to a club in New York just after winning his appeal. An arbitrator ruled Friday that his suspension for punching his fiancee, now his wife, should be vacated immediately. The NFL said Rice, a free agent, is 'eligible to play upon signing a new contract.' Rice was clearly in the party mood as he posed for pictures and signed autographs in Manhattan’s Bounce Sporting Club on Saturday night. According to TMZ his wife Janay, whom he knocked out in an Atlantic City casino in February, was present but avoided the cameras. Ray Rice is pictured left as he enjoys a night of clubbing with friends in Manhattan on Saturday . Despite the vicious attack, Janay and Ray Rice (pictured in November) married in March . Former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice is now able to sign for another NFL side after his appeal . TMZ added that people at the club noted that Rice was not drinking. He swore off hard liquor after revealing that the vicious attack unfolded on an alcohol-fueled night. Rice's one-punch knockout of his then fiancée put his NFL career in jeopardy and thrust the issue of domestic abuse into the national spotlight. The first video of the fight that went viral in February showed Rice calmly pulling an unconscious Palmer from the elevator and he was suspended for two games. But after TMZ obtained a second video taken inside the elevator - which showed Rice knocking her out  - he was released by the Ravens and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him indefinitely from the league. However, an independent arbitrator on Friday said that Rice, in essence, was sanctioned twice for the same crime and ruled he was free to sign with any National Football League team. Another image shows the football player pictured with a couple on Saturday night in Manhattan . Former Baltimore Ravens running back Rice was released by the Ravens after punching his wife Janay . The NFL said it accepted the decision, spokesman Greg Aiello said. 'Ray Rice is a free agent and has been eligible to be signed by an NFL team since he was released by the Ravens,' he said. 'Based on Judge Jones' decision, he will be eligible to play upon signing a new contract.' In a statement, Rice said:  'I would like to thank Judge Barbara Jones, the NFL Players Association, my attorneys, agents, advisers, family, friends and fans - but most importantly, my wife Janay. 'I made an inexcusable mistake and accept full responsibility for my actions. I am thankful that there was a proper appeals process in place to address this issue. I will continue working hard to improve myself and be the best husband, father and friend, while giving back to my community and helping others to learn from my mistakes.' In an interview with the Today show, Janay Rice stood up for her husband and insisted that he had never hit her prior to their fight in the New Jersey casino elevator. Shocking: Rice was suspended by the NFL for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey casino in February. CCTV captured the attack . Janay Rice wipes away a tear on the Today show on Monday as she recounts the horrific incident in February . 'There's no way,' she said in the interview that aired on Monday. 'He knows what he would have to deal with. I'm not going to sit there in silence and let something happen to me and, God forbid, in front of my child.' After the incident, she said that she initially thought she was 'done' with Rice - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him because it was not like him. 'Everybody makes mistakes,' she said. 'You would think that we lived in a country of people who have never made a mistake, who've never sinned ever in their life.' While Rice is now free to join any club, it remains unclear if any team will sign the 27-year-old, three-time Pro Bowl running back.

"Child sexual exploitation has become the ‘social norm’ in some towns, a report warns today. Schoolgirls are routinely being approached by much older men who ply them with alcohol, drugs and gifts as a way of grooming them for sex, says the study commissioned by police. Figures in the report suggested almost 650 children reported missing in towns across Greater Manchester in 2014 were at risk of child sexual exploitation or serious harm. Schoolgirls are routinely being approached by much older men who ply them with alcohol, drugs and gifts as a way of grooming them for sex, according to a study commissioned by police (file picture) But despite almost 13,000 reports of child sex abuse in the past six years, only 1,078 people were convicted, figures from Greater Manchester Police revealed. The report’s author – Labour MP Ann Coffey – insisted police were making progress on the issue, but this prompted furious claims last night that the study ‘whitewashed’ the extent of police failings to deal with on-street grooming. The study was also criticised for failing to address the fact that many street grooming gangs are made up by men of Asian origin. The inquiry was commissioned following the 2012 Rochdale grooming scandal when a gang of Asian men, including the eight pictured, preyed on vulnerable young girls . The inquiry was commissioned following the Rochdale grooming scandal in 2012 when a gang of nine Asian men preyed on vulnerable young girls. Today’s 148-page report – Real Voices, Child Sexual Exploitation In Greater Manchester – was commissioned by the local Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd. It said that in some districts young girls are regularly approached by men at the school gates or urged to get into cars while walking home from school. Victims were sometimes blamed for the abuse, with descriptions of child prostitutes or ‘slags’ recorded by officers – even about children as young as 13. In one case, officers did not consider a girl of 13 to be a victim as she was wearing ‘sexualised’ clothes, including a crop top. The report’s author - Labour MP Ann Coffey (left) - insisted police were making progress on tackling grooming, but Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk (left) said the study 'lacks the independence needed to confront the deep problems in GMP that have allowed far too many paedophiles to get away with terrible crimes' Miss Coffey, chairman of the Commons’ all-party group for runaway and missing children and adults, said the child sex abuse cases in Rochdale, Rotherham, Derby, Oldham, Oxford, Stockport and Peterborough were a ‘deafening wake-up call’. The Stockport MP added: ‘I have been concerned about the number of people who have told me that in some neighbourhoods child sexual exploitation had become the new social norm.’ The former social worker recommends a radical new approach to tackle the problem to be led by young people, which recognises that the police, justice system and children’ s services alone cannot succeed in protecting children, especially at a time of deep spending cuts. She called for more thorough child sexual exploitation training of police officers and for the issue to be declared a public health priority just like drugs and obesity. But her report ran into criticism last night. Simon Danczuk, Rochdale MP, said: ‘This was a report commissioned by GMP and it lacks the independence needed to confront the deep problems in GMP that have allowed far too many paedophiles to get away with terrible crimes.​ This is the only report suggesting the police are making progress and it’s the first report commissioned by GMP.’ Home Secretary Theresa May (left) said the report showed the way police were dealing with the problem was 'not good enough' and Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, said there was always more that can be done 'to safeguard and support young people' Samantha Roberts, who was raped by an Asian gang in Oldham when she was 12, said: ‘This report makes very depressing reading when I’ve done so much work campaigning against child sexual exploitation – I hoped we would have seen some improvements by now, but that just hasn’t been the case. ‘The report makes a valid point that not all grooming gangs across the country are Asian but it’s very clear that in Greater Manchester there’s an issue of girls being targeted by men from Pakistan and Bangladesh in particular.’ Home Secretary Theresa May said the report showed the way police were dealing with the problem was ‘not good enough.’ As the report was released, police in Manchester urged parents to be aware after a girl of 11 was sexually assaulted by an Asian man as she stood outside a shop on Tuesday at 5.45pm. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, said: ‘There is always more we can do to safeguard and support young people.’ Troubled girls who were ignored . Here are some of the victims’ harrowing experiences revealed in Ann Coffey’s report into child exploitation in Manchester: . CROP-TOP GIRL . In a normally confidential file, prosecutors spell out how a young abuse victim dressing in provocative clothes was enough for them not to take the case to court. It states: ‘The victim is known (as highlighted by social workers) to tend to wear sexualised clothes when she is out of school, such as cropped tops.’ ‘While her age at the time and the date of the decision are not given, it gives two similarly disturbing examples for prosecutors not proceeding with abuse allegations. One said how a girl’s “unsettled background” made her “far from an ideal victim”’, while another pointed out, “I note her father has referred to her to a social worker as being a slag, saying she is responsible for what has happened”.’ VICTIM TOLD TO MOVE HOUSE . Another troubled young girl who was groomed by a 44-year-old man said her family was told by social workers to ‘move house’ when they tried to report him. She told the authors: ‘One social worker was very snobby... One looked down their nose at me [and] another said: “Why don’t you move?”’ Her abuser eventually pleaded guilty in court, but she was failed again by the authorities as the family were not notified. GIRL PASSED BETWEEN 12 SOCIAL WORKERS . A girl who was abused by a 19-year-old man when she was just 12 gave a withering assessment of social workers. ‘There were so many services, that nothing was being done,’ the girl – referred to as F – told the report’s authors. ‘They were just sort of bouncing off each other,’ she said. She saw a total of 12 social workers, but no-one seemed ‘really interested’. ‘They just came for an hour and then went.’ She eventually testified against some of her abusers, but it was like ‘one attack after another,’ she said. ‘One of the barristers was not even asking me questions; he was just shouting at me…’","Police-commissioned study finds schoolgirls routinely approached by men .

Solicitors for the woman said the apology was part of a 'confidential settlement' in which the 'vulnerable woman', who suffers from mental health problems, brought a claim for damages against him. A Lib Dem spokesman said Mr Hancock had quit before an internal party disciplinary hearing. Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had previously called on Mr Hancock to resign his membership and said he had 'no future' in the party. A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'I can confirm he has resigned from the party. 'We have received a letter confirming his resignation. Obviously, there was due to be a disciplinary hearing imminently, so before that has happened he has resigned.' Donna Jones, the Conservative leader of Portsmouth City Council, called for Mr Hancock, who failed to hold his seat as a councillor in this year's local elections, to also stand down from his seat in Parliament. She said: 'Yet again this is another example of Mike Hancock jumping literally seconds before he is pushed. 'Nick Clegg had suspended him from the Liberal Democrat Party and removed the whip back in 2013 with an agreement there would be a review of his membership and before that happened, he has resigned from the party, so I am not surprised at all. 'Mike has had a long career in Parliament, in excess of 40 years, it's very sad his parliamentary career has ended the way it has but it was only a matter of time that his past has caught up with him in the form of this alleged sexual assault by a woman he came in contact with through Portsmouth City Council and it is a very sad indictment of his parliamentary career and now it's time for him to stand down.' The 68-year-old had repeatedly denied the allegations by the single mother during her four-year fight to obtain an apology. But as part of a High Court settlement earlier this year he apologised unreservedly for any distress. In a statement read at the High Court, Mr Hancock said: ‘In October 2009 you first came to me as a constituent to seek my assistance as your MP and councillor. The resignation came after the veteran Portsmouth South MP (pictured) was forced publicly to apologise to a vulnerable woman constituent for making improper sexual advances . 'Subsequently and over several months I came to your home on several occasions, sometimes unannounced and conducted a friendship that was inappropriate and unprofessional. ‘I understand that you felt degraded. I did not treat you with sufficient respect. I made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against and I crossed the line. 'As a political representative, there is a significant power differential with any constituent seeking help and particularly with your vulnerability of which I was aware. ‘You had a right to trust me. Everyone should feel safe and should be able to have confidence in their political representatives and I am sorry I made you feel otherwise. I have learnt from my mistakes and pledge not to act in the same way again.’ He added: ‘I also recognise that hurtful and untrue statements were made publicly about your motivation in bringing the claim. These statements sought to discredit and undermine you. ‘This should never have happened. I accept that you did not bring the claim for financial gain and any statements to the contrary were wrong.’ The 39-year-old woman had attempted to complain about Mr Hancock’s behaviour through the police, the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, as well as the Liberal Democrat party and Portsmouth City Council, but her solicitor  said she had been ‘blocked from achieving a remedy at each stage’. ■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat. ■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’ ■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office. ■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann, a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’ ■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. 'He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’ She said after the apology: ‘I am pleased that there has finally been a resolution to what has been a long and hurtful ordeal for me. Since the incidents about which I complained happened back in 2010, my physical and mental health have suffered and I am grateful that I may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both myself and my son.’ The woman first met Mr Hancock in October 2009 at his constituency office in Southsea, after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours. A year later, he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged sexual advances. He was never charged after police found there was no case to answer. In March 2011, the woman complained about Mr Hancock to senior Lib Dem officials at the party’s Westminster headquarters, but no action was taken against him. In a letter to Mr Clegg’s office in February last year, she said Mr Hancock had exposed himself to her, made numerous unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her, but he was still not disciplined. Portsmouth City Council did ask Nigel Pascoe QC to investigate the allegations. But his report was never published and the Lib Dem-controlled council voted to keep it under wraps. In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe wrote: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock.’ Mr Hancock was suspended from the Lib Dems in January after the case became public.","Liberal Democrats confirm Mike Hancock has resigned party membership .

"Winger Brek Shea has left Stoke and returned to the United States to join Major League Soccer side Orlando City. The 24-year-old was signed by former Stoke boss Tony Pulis from FC Dallas for £2.5million in January 2013 but made only five appearances for the Potters in nearly two years at the club. Shea was loaned to Barnsley last season and returned to Stoke earlier this month after another loan spell with Birmingham but has failed to force himself into manager Mark Hughes' plans. Brek Shea, in action during a rare appearance for Stoke City, has moved back to America after two years . The American spent time on loan at Birmingham this season, but has been unable to establish himself . Stoke announced the news in a short statement on their website on Friday evening, saying: 'Stoke City can confirm that Brek Shea has left the Britannia Stadium to join American Major League Soccer side Orlando City. 'Stoke City would like to wish Brek every success in the future.' Shea has 27 caps for the USA but did not make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil.

"CLICK HERE to read Sami Mokbel's match report from Loftus Road . Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp believes that Manchester City will recover from their 2-2 draw with QPR on Saturday, but he is not certain it will be in time to catch runaway leaders Chelsea. The reigning Premier League champions were forced to come from behind twice before settling for a draw at Loftus Road, which leaves them eight-points behind Chelsea who defeated Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield. Manuel Pellegrini claimed his side were unlucky for a second successive away game and insisted that he is not concerned by the results being racked up at Stamford Bridge. Manchester City could only manage a 2-2 draw with QPR in their Premier League clash at Loftus Road . Jose Mourinho's Chelsea have opened up an eight-point lead over City following a 2-1 win at Anfield . 'I think we were very unlucky – we are not playing well but we had enough chances to win the game. It was the same against West Ham in our last defeat where their goalkeeper was the best player,' said Pellegrini. 'I'm not worried about Chelsea – they are in a good moment but we have a lot more games to play. At this moment we are just thinking about returning to our style of play,' he added. However, speaking in his role as Sky Sports pundit, Redknapp said: 'Not worried about being eight points behind the Chelsea of last season would be alright, but eight points behind Chelsea from this season is a different matter.' City boss Manuel Pellegrini, greeting Harry Redknapp, claims he is not worried about Chelsea's results . Argentina striker Sergio Aguero kept City in the game by equalising twice to earn his side a point . The former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder also claimed that the Manchester club were fortunate not to have lost the game against his father Harry's side. 'City got away with it. If it wasn't for Aguero they would have lost that game,' he said. 'Fernandinho and Yaya Toure have not been anywhere near the right level. Defensively as well, they are giving away too many silly goals. Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp believes that players like Yaya Toure are not performing to their potential . 'They will come back because they have too many good players – but they have to comeback quickly because this Chelsea side can run away with it.' Sergio Aguero may come away with the plaudits after his exquisite brace prevented City from leaving empty handed, but Redknapp was equally impressed with Rangers striker Charlie Austin who opened the scoring after having two previous efforts disallowed. 'I'd never have believed at the start of the year if you'd have said we'd be talking about him for England. I'd have said 'do me a favour'. It just shows you,' said Redknapp. Charlie Austin celebrates in Saturday Night Fever style after scoring his sixth goal of the season . City keeper Joe Hart explains to Austin why his opening strike was disallowed . 'Five years ago he was playing for Poole Town. Now look at him; he is giving top centre-backs real problems. It's a great story.' Austin's opening attempt was disallowed after City keeper Joe Hart touched the ball twice in his area meaning his goal kick had to be retaken, although the QPR striker was unaware of the decision. When asked if he knew that his strike had been ruled out, he said: ‘No, didn’t you see from my celebration? I turned around and no one was with me!'","Manchester City twice came back to draw 2-2 with QPR at Loftus Road .

"Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard insists Ross Barkley has no problem handling expectations as his team-mates are always on hand to bring him back down to earth. The 21-year-old midfielder enhanced his reputation further with a brilliant opening goal in Monday's 3-1 win over QPR. He has regularly been likened to Paul Gascoigne and touted as the most gifted footballer of his generation. Ross Barkley scored a stunning goal during Everton's 3-1 victory against QPR on Monday . QPR goalkeeper Rob Green cannot get his hands to Barkley's bullet as QPR fall behind on their travels again . Howard believes he has more in common with former Everton prodigy Wayne Rooney, now Barkley's international captain, and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard. The Toffees goalkeeper is confident the youngster can handle the pressure of such comparisons but admits the Everton dressing room ensures he remains grounded. 'He is special. He has a lot to learn but the thing I love about Ross - which I have not seen in a ton of other players, and I think that is why he gets named with some of the best - is he is fearless,' said the United States international. 'In this country Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard, those guys were 'throwing fire' in their teens and early 20s, and they flourished and that is why Ross is special. Tim Howard lauded Barkley as a special talent and said he can cope with the pressure of expectation . The Everton midfielder wheels away after opening the scoring against QPR . 'He wants the big moments, he wants the ball and he doesn't shy away from it - when I was his age I wanted nothing to do with being near the pitch or the spotlight because it was too daunting but he is special in that regard. 'I think Ross can handle it. He enjoys that pressure, he is not afraid of it. 'His football education has been here and it continues to be here and he has guys around him. 'As special as he is, we don't let him drift off with his head in the cloud. We keep him grounded.' Barkley played in a deeper, orthodox central midfield position against QPR instead of his more familiar attacking role. Barkley has had to deal with comparisons to former England midfielder Paul Gascoigne . Howard said that Barkley wants the big moments and doesn't shy away from the spotlight . He excelled there and both Howard and manager Roberto Martinez are confident it is something he can do again if required, although Barry returns for the trip to Southampton so he may not be needed. 'I think he has to learn the intricacies of playing in the deeper role, it is more disciplined,' added Howard. 'Number 10 is a bit more flair, he has a licence to go forward and his tackling doesn't have to be as precise. 'It was a good learning experience for him and we can use him in that position.' Martinez has said previously it may turn out to be Barkley's best position but the Spaniard wants the youngster to be adaptable. 'He is someone who can develop into a player who can master a few roles,' said the Toffees boss. Tim Howard reveals the Everton players keep Barkley's feet on the ground . 'The most impressive aspect of his goal was how he got into that position - not many players have that power, pace, ball control and ability. 'I think it (a deeper role) suits Ross really well. With certain players the shorter the distance they have to cover to have an influence in the game the better but Ross is the opposite - the more ground he has to cover the more effective he is at times. 'He controlled the game, not just the goal. The way he measured his positioning and tactical awareness was very impressive. 'That deeper role brings a bit more understanding of being aware of what is around you. 'You need to have good experience and a good footballing brain because it tests you and gets you thinking all the time, and it is very important young players have to think while they are on the pitch. 'Ross is clearly benefiting from that and I do see him being able to master those two roles.'","Ross Barkley is developing into a key member of the Everton team .

"Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has proclaimed his innocence in the face of allegations of match-fixing in Spain. Herrera and Swansea midfielder Jefferson Montero are among 41 players, coaches and directors named in an investigation. Prosecutors allege almost €1million (£795,000) was used to pay Levante players to lose their match against Real Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season. Manchester United star Ander Herrera has said he knew nothing of the match-fixing that involved his old club Real Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season when Levante players were allegedly paid to throw a game . Herrera is one of 41 people cited as possible witnesses in the ongoing legal proceedings . Herrera said: ‘In an on-going legal process involving Real Zaragoza (Spain), the club I was honoured to play for from 12 until 22 years of age, there are 41 people cited as possible witnesses, of which I am one. 'I have never had and will never have anything to do with manipulating match results. 'If I am ever called to testify in any judicial hearing, I’ll be happy to attend, as my conscience is totally clear. 'I love football and I believe in fair play, both on and off the pitch.’ A Swansea spokesman said: 'We have had no contact regarding this matter.' Prosecutor Luzon filed the case at a court in Valencia on Monday. The court document alleges Herrera was one of 10 people who withdrew tens of thousands of euros funded by Zaragoza in order to pay bribes. Herrera left home-town club Zaragoza to join Athletic Bilbao in August 2011 and moved to United last summer . Swansea's Jefferson Montero, who was in the Levante side who lost to Zaragoza, is also involved . The 25-year-old left Zaragoza to join his home-town club Athletic Bilbao in August 2011, before signing for United in June this year. Montero, who joined Swansea from Mexican club Monarcas Morelia in July, was in the Levante side beaten 2-1 by Zaragoza on 21 May, 2011. It is alleged Levante’s players were paid to lose the match, which Zaragoza needed to win to avoid relegation. Montero’s alleged involvement is not described in the prosecution case. Also named in the document are the current Atletico Madrid captain Gabi and Zaragoza’s former coach, Javier Aguirre - now manager of the Japan national side. Zaragoza's former coach Javier Aguirre, now in charge of Japan, is also caught up in the allegations . Aguirre claimed his innocence on December 5, telling Japan Football Association lawyer Yutaka Miyoshi that he was 'very angry and that he has never done such a thing as a professional coach.' The Japanese association has backed their coach. Gabi recently admitted that he received a transfer of 85,000 euros from Zaragoza at the time of the game in question but he immediately returned it to the then-owner of the club, Angelo Inglesias. He told El Mundo: 'I did what Agapito asked me to do. I'm unaware if the money went to Levante players or what happened to that money.' Asked whether he regarded the money transfer as suspicious, Gabi replied: 'As the club was going into bankruptcy, I thought it was.'","Ander Herrera is among 41 players, coaches and directors named in a match-fixing investigation ongoing in Spain .

"Ally McCoist insists he does not plan on walking away from Rangers any time soon - and wants talks with new chief executive Derek Llambias on new signings. The Ibrox boss has tendered his resignation but insists he will see out the full 12-month notice period stipulated by his contract. The club's record scorer hopes to meet Llambias - whose new role was confirmed to the London Stock Exchange at 7am on Friday morning - to discuss strengthening his squad. Ally McCoist insists he won't be leaving Rangers and will see out the full 12-month notice period . The Ibrox boss wants talks with Rangers' new chief executive Derek Llambias about strengthening the squad . It was business as usual for the Scot as he watched on during his side's training session on Friday . He said: 'I'll have to have a discussion with Derek regarding what the plans will be for the future. I spoke to him today regarding his own position and him and I will certainly sit down and discuss (adding to the squad), because that will be one of the topics that need to be discussed.' The Light Blues board announced on Monday that McCoist had decided to quit after three-and-a-half years in charge. Press Association Sport understands the likes of football board chairman Sandy Easdale and his PLC brother James want McCoist to go now but showdown talks with Llambias on Wednesday broke down without a settlement. The manager refused to divulge details about those talks at his weekly pre-match press conference or reveal the reasons behind his decision to resign. But when asked if he planned to see out the full 12-month notice period set down in his one-year rolling contract, he did say: 'Yes. Absolutely. 'I don't know if it's realistic or not but I expect it to happen because it is in the boundaries of the contract, which I look to honour. 'Whose court is the ball in now? I wouldn't say the ball is in anybody's court. I think it has been made quite clear by the board and myself that it is business as usual.' News of McCoist's resignation emerged just hours before the League One champions were due to take on Queen of the South last Friday night. McCoist, who famously said he 'did not do walking away' after the club's liquidation crisis, batted off questions about why he had chosen to resign following the shock 2-0 defeat at Palmerston. And a week later, he was still in no mood to disclose why he was choosing to bring his reign to an end. 'I would keep that private,' he said. 'I wouldn't comment at all about why I have made that decision but now that I have, I can assure the Rangers supporters, who are the most important people, that I am 100 per cent focused on continuing the job. 'The most important thing is to say that it is business as usual. That is exactly how it has been. McCoist intends to sit down with new chief executive Derek Llambias (pictured) to plan for Rangers' future . Rangers captain Lee McCulloch (right) didn't look troubled by McCoist's resignation as he joked in training . 'Our last game was not good enough so we are concentrating all our efforts on tomorrow against Livingston. 'Have I been considering this for long? Not really. It was a very difficult decision but once I had made it, there was no turning back. 'And I can assure everybody I am 100 per cent committed and focused (on the job) for the remainder of my contract. 'The Rangers fans would expect nothing less than that.' A statement released to the Stock Exchange on Monday confirming his impending departure also revealed that under the terms of McCoist's contract, his salary would almost double to £750,000 a year. That was seen by many fans as an attempt to heap pressure on the manager at a time when the business needs £8.3million before April 1 just to keep the lights on. McCoist, though, insisted he 'wasn't surprised' that the board had chosen to announce those details. He also tried to play down reports claiming he had fallen out with former Rangers strike partner Mark Hateley. The duo helped fire Walter Smith's side to nine successive titles but headlines this week suggested McCoist was angry over the Englishman's close relationship with the Easdales. McCoist said: 'Mark and I go back a long way. We've been through a lot together. I've not had the chance to speak to him but we definitely will have a chat - there's no problem about that. 'We are big boys, we will sit down and have a chat.' The former Scotland striker had been in charge for only a year before Craig Whyte's chaotic reign as owner brought the Glasgow giants to their knees. The 52-year-old insists he would be sad to say goodbye to Rangers once the end finally comes. He said: 'Would I miss the job? That's a good question! I would think you would have to miss the job. I don't think there is any doubt about it. 'It's been a massive, massive part of my life so you would definitely miss it. Have I enjoyed it? At times, yes.'","News of Ally McCoist's resignation from Rangers came last Friday night .

"An army officer and seven soldiers have been detained in connection with the killing of 22 gang members in rural southern Mexico. The incident was originally portrayed as a 'fierce gun battle', but physical evidence from the scene suggests that the killings had been summary executions. Journalists at the site found splattered blood marks, indicating that at least some of those who died had been shot at around chest level as they were standing against a wall. State police stand inside a warehouse where a black cross covers a wall near blood stains on the ground, after an alleged shootout occurred between Mexican soldiers and gang members . The Mexican Defense Ministry said the eight men were under a form of detention pending investigation of the June 30 killings in the town of Tlatlaya. They were being held at a prison in Mexico City on charges of crimes against military discipline, disobedience and breach of duty. Shortly after the confrontation, the army reported that 22 suspected criminals had been killed in a firefight with troops. But just one soldier was wounded, raising questions. At the time, a spokesman for federal prosecutors said all the dead - 21 men and one woman - were believed to be gang members. Journalists at the site found splattered blood marks, indicating that at least some of those who died had been shot at around chest level as they were standing against a wall . The shooting started after soldiers came under fire from the suspected gang members, resulting in a gunfight lasting several minutes, the government said. When the Associated Press visited the scene soon after the killings, there was no sign of a prolonged battle. Journalists found evidence, including blood spatters on walls, that suggested not a battle but a one-by-one killing of the gang members. They found few spent bullet casings that would have been typical of a battle. Last week, a woman who says she witnessed the events told the AP that only one person died in the initial confrontation, and the rest were shot after surrendering. The witness said the dead included her 15-year-old daughter, who had been wounded in the leg and was lying on the ground when she was killed. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto came to office in December 2012 pledging to quell gang violence that has killed more than 100,000 people since 2007 . The U.S. State Department and international rights groups recently expressed concern and called for an investigation. The statement said the military charges are being pursued 'independently of the investigations that civil authorities are carrying out under their jurisdiction'. The federal Attorney General's Office, which is conducting its own probe of the killings, had no immediate comment. Raul Plascencia, president of Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, reserved comment, saying the Defense Department statement was not clear on the soldiers' connection to the killings. Plascencia's commission is also investigating the case. Recent reforms require that alleged military offenses against civilians be tried in civilian courts, but nothing appears to bar the military justice system from pursuing its own charges. 'In relation to the events that took place on June 30, 2014 ... (the attorney general's office) affirms that there is an investigation into what took place,' a statement from the attorney general's office said. 'A complete and thorough investigation is needed to get to the truth,' it added. In a separate statement, the army said it had every interest in a deep investigation and that it would cooperate completely. 'The army and air force are obliged to conduct themselves with the full respect for human rights,' it said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto came to office in December 2012 pledging to quell gang violence that has killed more than 100,000 people since 2007.

"Stoke supporters have defended their right to sing a crude version of the popular Tom Jones song 'Delilah' following a call in Wales for it to be ditched as a rugby anthem. Stoke fans can regularly be heard bellowing the 1968 UK number two hit, replacing the lyric about killing a woman with wording that could be considered sexually offensive. Former Plaid Cymru president Dafydd Iwan has called on Wales rugby supporters at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to find something else to sing, claiming the song 'trivialises the idea of murdering a woman'. Stoke supporters celebrate Jonathan Walters' goal against Arsenal at a heaving Britannia Stadium . Delilah, written by Les Reed, Barry Mason and Sylvan Whittingham, tells of an opportunistic killing by a man, who waits until his former partner's lover leaves her home before making his move. The Welsh Rugby Union appears disinclined to ban the song, and Stoke fans may also be reluctant to give it up. Bryan Shaw, a spokesman for the Stoke City Supporters' Club, said: 'It's just a song we sing to encourage the team. 'Delilah' has become an unofficial anthem for Welsh rugby fans and Sir Tom Jones has even sung it to the crowds at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. However, a campaign to ban it has now been launched . I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window . I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind . She was my woman . As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind . My, my, my, Delilah . Why, why, why, Delilah . I could see that girl was no good for me . But I was lost like a slave that no man could free . At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting . I cross the street to her house and she opened the door . She stood there laughing . I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more . My, my, my Delilah . Why, why, why Delilah . So before they come to break down the door . Forgive me Delilah I just couldn’t take any more . 'I don't think anybody among the fans would ever even think it has anything to do with domestic violence. 'It's all tongue-in-cheek and I'm sure it's just an issue of today's society where 99 per cent of the country just get on with it but someone looks for a hidden meaning.' The song, in its original form, includes the lyrics: 'At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting. 'I cross the street to her house and she opened the door. 'She stood there laughing....I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more.' The Stoke supporters' version changes the central lyric to: 'I put my d*** in her hand and she laughed no more.' Iwan, who held his senior role with Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, from 2003 to 2010, is also a folk singer. Iwan said: 'It is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem. I think we should rummage around for another song instead of Delilah.' A spokesman for the Welsh Rugby Union said: 'Within rugby, Delilah has gained prominence through its musicality rather than because of its lyrics. 'There is, however, plenty of precedent in art and literature, prominently in Shakespearean tragedies for instance, for negative aspects of life to be portrayed. 'The Welsh Rugby Union condemns violence against women and has taken a lead role in police campaigns to highlight and combat the issue. 'The WRU remains willing to listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of Delilah but we have not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter.'","Stoke fans react following a call in Wales for the song to be ditched as a rugby anthem .

"It's all to play for in the Copa Sudamericana final after Atletico Nacional and River Plate drew the first leg 1-1 in Colombia on Wednesday night. Nacional dominated the first-half and took a 34th-minute lead when Orlando Berrio fired past River goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero from a tight angle after being played in by Edwin Cardona. But Leonardo Pisculichi equalised with a half-volley midway through the second half to hand the Argentine side a draw heading back to Buenos Aires for next week's deciding leg.

"When Real Madrid romped to a 4-0 win against Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets on Tuesday, they became the first side to have won each of their Champions League group stage matches twice. Los Blancos first achieved the impressive feat back in the 2011-12 season when they beat Lyon, Ajax and Dynamo Zagreb across six fixtures. AC Milan, Barcelona, CSKA Moscow and Paris Saint-Germain have also managed to emerge victorious in every one of their group games in the past, although none of these sides have gone on to lift the trophy.

Having won 19 successive games in all competitions, Real are one of the favourites to triumph in this season's Champions League, along with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. But the La Liga leaders will need to break a curse which stretches back to the 1992-93 season, when Milan lost 1-0 to Marseille in the final after cruising through a group which also included Porto, PSV and Gothenburg. The same thing happened to  PSG two years later when, after gaining maximum points from group fixtures against Bayern, Spartak Moscow and Dynamo Kiev, the French outfit lost to Milan at the semi-final stage.

"Which sporting champion has decided to resemble Star Wars hero Chewbacca? After a year of success it appears this sportsperson has decided to find a way to go into hiding from the public eye.

"Arsene Wenger may have come out fighting against his growing number of detractors this week but the cold, hard truth is that Arsenal remain staggeringly short of what's required. While staunch supporters of the Frenchman will point towards yet another season in the Champions League knockout stages, a glance at the Premier League table shows just how short they've been since August. The Gunners are astonishingly 12 points worse off today than they were at this stage last season when, heading into Christmas, Wenger found himself top of the tree. Arsene Wenger (pictured after defeat at Stoke City last weekend) has seen his Arsenal side struggle this year . Bojan's goal for the Potters went to show how far the Gunners have fallen away compared to last season . West Ham United find themselves a staggering 14 points better off in the Premier League . Everton's Roberto Martinez has some questions to answer after finding it difficult to pick up where he left off . Steven Gerrard's Liverpool have endured a difficult start to the season after the highs of last year . That lead was cut in the end - Arsenal finished fourth - and what's followed has been definite regression. But they aren't the only ones. The Merseyside pair Everton and Liverpool have dropped a combined 19 points from this time last season. Roberto Martinez, heralded as the man who has the stylish brand of football to drag the Toffees into the top four, has struggled; Everton have conceded far too many goals. Then there's Brendan. Red legend Steve Nicol pulled no punches after they were dumped out of Europe, but the domestic form is actually more of a concern. ‘If things don’t change then ultimately Brendan will pay the price,’ he said. And you do wonder whether Daniel Levy is getting twitchy with Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham already, given their negative six-point swing. For others, however, the comparisons are very welcome indeed. None more so than Sam Allardyce, who will be crowing at an incredible 14-point difference in their tallies. This time last year the Hammers were fourth-bottom and Allardyce was for the chop. Now they find themselves in the top four and - perhaps more strikingly - comfortably in the European running, four points ahead of Arsenal down in sixth. Sunderland might have a case to be pleased after accumulating seven additional points in 2013-14, but looking at where they were last year - rock bottom with just eight points - Gus Poyet won't draw too many conclusions. Interestingly, the high-flying Southampton and Newcastle are just a win away from the same totals - suggesting they are at home in the upper echelons of the top flight. It's Wenger who won't want to look. What a difference a year makes. Manchester United are six points better off under Louis van Gaal than they were with David Moyes .

"Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti hailed his 'extraordinary' team after they set a new Spanish record of 19 straight victories with Tuesday's 4-0 triumph over Ludogorets. The European Cup holders beat the Bulgarians at the Bernabeu to finish their Champions League Group B campaign with a 100 per cent record. Only five teams had previously managed to win all six group games in the competition. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti barks out some instructions during his side's 4-0 win over Ludogorets . 'It is not easy preparing for each game with the same levels of motivation and eagerness that these players are showing', Ancelotti said. 'After losing to Atletico (Madrid on September 13), I couldn't have imagined stringing together 19 consecutive wins. 'I was sure that the things that weren't going well would be fixed, but not to this extent. Cristiano Ronaldo hit his 72nd Champions League goal during the trouncing of Ludogorets . 'It is a result we have achieved with extraordinary seriousness and an incredible amount of professionalism. 'I know that I have an extraordinary group of players. 'I have a very good relationship with the players. I care a lot for them and I thank them for the work they're doing as much as I can.' Tuesday's win allowed Madrid to pass the consecutive wins mark of Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona, a side that won 18 straight games in the 2005-06 campaign. Gareth Bale leaped above Ludogorets' defence to score his side's second goal of the night . Ancelotti's squad are five wins away from equalling the world record of 24 straight victories set by Brazilian outfit Coritiba FC in 2011. 'We are enjoying a great moment: the players, the technical staff and the club, which has always supported us,' Ancelotti said. 'We have to keep this run going.'

Oblivious: The truck driver said he thought fellow motorists were telling him to speed up, so he did . Oblivious to what was happening, lorry driver Xiong Feng, 45, carried on for six and a half miles before being flagged down by another trucker. 'The first I became aware of anything was when I heard some loud honking beside me,' he said. 'He had his window down and was shouting something but I couldn't hear him, and then he started pointing at the back of my truck. 'But I thought he was telling me to speed up, so I did.' He added: 'Eventually I pulled over and it was only then that I saw the car stuck on the back.'

'When officers arrived they not only found a drug dealer we've been hunting a long time, but his boot was full of cocaine too,' a police spokesman said.

"An army forces charity has given murdered drummer Lee Rigby's family incredible garden makeovers that includes  brand new trampolines and playhouses for his young son to play on. The transformations to both his mother's and widow's homes features pavers, shrubbery, flower garden, a beautifully constructed playhouse and a brand new trampoline for four-year-old Jack. Charity Forces Support was the group behind the heartfelt gesture - their members, who are professional builders and landscapers, undertake free maintenance work for bereaved army family members across Britain. Lee Rigby's son Jack, pictured in the brand new playhouse built at his mother's home by Forces Support . The garden makeovers included trampolines and playhouses filled with toys for four-year-old Jack (pictured) Forces Support also filled Jack's playroom, at his mother's house, with Thomas the Tank Engine toys . After: The charity transformed his mother's backyard into a beautiful area for his son Jack to play in . Before: Her home pictured before the renovation, showing the broken fence and muddy lawn . Lynn Rigby has said her backyard, pictured, was her 'safety zone' where she could reflect in peace . The group undertook work on both Rigby's parents' home in Middleton a few months ago and then in the past few weeks, completed a renovation of his widow Rebecca's home. Bill McCane, Forces Support chief executive, said he was approached by Mrs Rigby for a playhouse for Jack, but when he arrived he realised there was other work needed. He said: 'We were approached by Rebecca. We have put out play areas for the children  - it's one of the things we do and Rebecca saw that and thought it would be a nice thing for Jack, and when I went and visited there were other bits and pieces that I thought needed doing. 'The playroom was a bit of a mess, it needed decorating. So with Jack's birthday coming up we thought we'd get it done in time for his birthday celebrations.' The renovation team then spent three 12-hour days to get the job done as quick as possible, in time for Jack's fourth birthday on September 1. 'The guys said she was thrilled. It's the reaction on your children's face that usually makes the biggest impact, and I know Jack was running around between his room and his playhouse. 'For a lot of people, it takes a huge amount for a family to come forward and ask, and when you get out to a families home - we found this in Rebecca's case - she didn't want anything done for herself, she wanted the playhouse. The charity did the same for his widow Rebecca Rigby. Pictured is the playhouse and trampoline installed for their son . Forces Support recently received a heartfelt thank you note from Rebecca Rigby. Although she made the first inquires about he possibility of having a playhouse made for her and Lee Rigby's son Jack, when Forces Support arrived they realised the home could do with a few extra fixes. Eventually this ended with a makeover of their son's indoor playroom and fixes to a few damaged parts of the home itself. Her note read: 'I honestly can not thank you and your team enough for what you've all done for us. The playroom is fantastic, and I'm sure Jack will spend many hours having fun in there. 'He's got a lovely playhouse in the garden now and an area he can enjoy outside. 'I don't feel like thank you is enough for what you've done, we now have a home we can enjoy and be proud of.' Drummer Lee Rigby with his son Jack, who was two years old when his father was killed in Woolwich, London . 'But the trampoline was set in boggy ground and the playroom walls were sort of damaged and I saw a few problems with the hall. 'People are quite shy of coming forward, so Rebecca had initially said: ""We've seen your playhouses, Jack would love one of those, is it possible?"" 'Families are usually consumed with grief and little bits and pieces around the home don't seem so relevant as they would on a normal day.' Mr Rigby was on a London high street when he was attacked and butchered by crazed Islamic fanatics wielding cleavers and knives. In broad daylight, the 25-year-old drummer was run over then hacked to death in front of horrified onlookers. During: A TV crew films as the group carries out his mother's garden makeover . The team work on the  playhouse they constructed for Lee Rigby's son, Jack, at his grandmother's home . Pavers were also laid down to replace grass and bushes, helping reduce the garden's maintenance workload . His mother Lynn told ITV her garden had become too much work to manage during the turbulent events following his murder. She said: 'It was my safety zone away from everybody, somewhere I could iust have a think, have a cry. 'But it just got too overgrown we never had time to get on top of it. I felt like my safety net was gone.'

"Forget black and white, red and white, love and hate, if you’re a good footballer you’ll be just fine. That is what Lee Clark always told himself, the Geordie boy who swapped Newcastle for Sunderland in 1997. Like Clark, Jack Colback was raised on Tyneside and has now made the controversial switch between the North-East rivals, a move only 14 have dared to undertake. Jack Colback joined Newcastle on a free transfer this summer after leaving Sunderland . Colback spent 14 years on the books at Sunderland and made his first team debut in 2009 . Former midfielder Lee Clark (right) swapped Newcastle for Sunderland in 1997 . For Colback, though, his defection represented a homecoming – not that the direction of travel and childhood allegiance makes any difference, says Clark. ‘It doesn’t matter if you’ve gone from Sunderland to Newcastle or Newcastle to Sunderland or which team you supported – if you’re a good footballer and playing well then fans will take to you,’ the former midfielder told Sportsmail ahead of Colback’s first Tyne-Wear derby for the Magpies. ‘And in that respect Jack will be just fine. He’s been one of Newcastle’s best players so far this season. Midfielder Colback (centre) has impressed since during his early Newcastle career . The 25-year-old's performances in the first part of the season earned him a call up to the England squad . ‘It probably helps a little bit that he’s a Geordie coming back to Newcastle, but if you’re playing poorly that doesn’t make any difference really. ‘It’s all about the football, it always is. Jack scored for Sunderland at St James’ last year and I bet their fans loved him that day. ‘I always told myself when I went to Sunderland, “Play well, hit the ground running, and the fans will clap me”. ‘What matters for Jack now is that the Newcastle fans have taken to him – and they’ve done that for one reason, he’s been excellent this season.’ Former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn spoke out this week expressing his regret that 25-year-old Colback – who joined the Black Cats at the age of 10 - had been allowed to sign for Newcastle on a free transfer. Clark, though, sits on the other side of that fence. ‘It was one of the best bits of business of the summer getting Jack for nothing,’ said the current boss of Championship Blackpool. ‘He’s the sort of player you want in your team – he keeps the ball, works hard and you can rely on him. He’s been a massive part of what Newcastle have done this season.’ Clark enjoyed two years on Wearside before being pictured supporting Newcastle at the 1999 FA Cup final wearing a t-shirt that read 'Sad Mackem B******s'. The t-shirt was, in fact, thrown over him by a supporter and the photo snapped in a flash. The incident forced him to quit Sunderland for Fulham. Nonetheless, he has no regrets about making the move to the Stadium of Light. ‘The group of players and the manager, Peter Reid, made it easy for me when I went there,’ he said. Clark says Colback has won the Newcastle fans over by producing excellent performances . Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats scoring five goals, including against Newcastle last season . Colback will come up against his former team-mates for the first time on Sunday . ‘They were first-class and I had a great couple of years. We reached the play-off final in my first season then won the First Division with a record points total the year after, and I played a big part in that.’ Clark – a former England schoolboy captain and Under-21 regular – was included in full squads but never made his senior debut. Colback, meanwhile, was called up by Roy Hodgson in August only to withdraw because of injury and hasn’t been involved since. That, however, will change before the season is out says Clark. ‘Without a doubt he is good enough to get back in,’ he said. ‘Roy Hodgson obviously liked him earlier in the season and he’s probably playing better now. I think Jack should be aiming for another call-up. For me, it would be deserved.’","Jack Colback joined Newcastle after leaving Sunderland on a free .

Jackie McNamara's side halted the Hoops' run of eight successive league wins as they moved to within four points of the Scottish Premiership leaders with a 2-1 win. Stefan Scepovic had a goal wrongly chalked off for offside late on as United held on for their first victory over the Glasgow giants since May 2012. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (right) watches on during his side's 2-1 loss to Dundee United at Tannadice Park . Deila refused to point the finger at referee Steven McLean or his assistants, but the Norwegian did reveal his anger at the way his team allowed Nadir Ciftci and Stuart Armstrong space to put the home side in front. Leigh Griffiths gave Celtic hope with a late strike but John Guidetti's recent lean spell in front of goal continued. The on-loan Manchester City frontman is the top Parkhead scorer with 11 strikes but has now gone four games without netting. Deila said: 'Today it was two things that were most disappointing. We conceded two easy goals. We can't give them such easy goals as we did. Dundee United's Nadir Ciftci (right) celebrates after he put the home side ahead in the fifth minute . 'Secondly, it's the fourth match now that we have created eight to 14 chances but when you score one goal that is way too little. We have to be more effective at putting the ball into the net. 'The disallowed goal is disappointing. But over a whole season it is even-Steven.' Ciftci punished Efe Ambrose's fresh-air swipe at a loose ball inside the Celtic box when he fired United ahead after four minutes. The Turk then set up Armstrong's header 20 minutes into the second period when he wriggled past Emilio Izaguirre before standing up a fantastic cross to the back post. Scepovic was onside when he prodded home from Izaguirre's chested pass but was hard done by as the linesman's flag went up. But the Serbian did well to play in Griffiths for Celtic's late score. Stuart Armstrong (second left) celebrates after he doubles Dundee's advantage in the 65th minute . 'I'm annoyed about the way we defended. It is easy to keep the ball, push them out - don't let them go in and open up the goal. We did that twice and then you see what happens,"" said Deila. 'Could Guidetti's place be under threat? Yeah. We have big competition in the team, we need all the strikers we have. We play with the players we think are the best to win games. 'There is one thing you have to remember with John, he hasn't played football for two years before he came here. He started very well and now he has had a little dip. That is because he has to be physically stronger and play matches over time. 'All strikers go through periods like this. But we have to focus on what is going to get him out of this situation.' Deila insisted United are now right in the hunt for the title but McNamara said: 'It's still too early to say that. We have to be more consistent. Celtic's Scott Brown (left) puts in a strong challenge on Dundee United's John Rankin . 'We were flat last week against Aberdeen, so we need this same level of energy and desire every week. Today we also had bits of luck. 'I did think Celtic might be further head by now with the resources they have. Competing with that is very difficult. 'If something is not working, they can spend a few million and then sit him on the bench.' Keeping hold of players will be McNamara's main concern next month. The likes of Armstrong and Ciftci are certain to attract interest during the January transfer window. But McNamara said: 'Speculation has been part of it since I came here. And it will be until the end of January when the window closes. 'I'm hopeful I'll still have the same squad, maybe one or two coming in, instead of going out. 'It's a compliment to the players. But for the manager it doesn't help. Last year it wasn't one or two, it was six or seven. And we lost a couple mentally for a few weeks because of that. We sent Ryan Gauld and John Souttar on holiday because they took a little dip. 'It's hopefully not as many this year - and there were no signs of losing focus today. No doubt as we get closer to the window, everybody will be linked with somebody.'","Dundee United halted Celtic's run of eight successive league wins .

Sunderland are unbeaten in their last five Premier League games against Newcastle United (W3 D2), winning the last three in a row. The Black Cats have never won four successive league derbies against Newcastle United. There have been five red cards in the last eight Premier League meetings between these two sides, though none in the last three. No side has picked up more yellow cards than Sunderland (37) this season, while only Swansea (4) have more red cards than Newcastle (3). Sunderland's Darren Bent, Phil Bardsley and Danny Welbeck look on as Newcastle players celebrate Kevin Nolan's first strike in a 5-1 Premier League win for the Toon at St James' Park in October 2010. Nolan grabbed a hat-trick on the day which remains Newcastle's last home win over their bitter rivals .

The Magpies have been leading at half-time in just one of their 16 Premier League games this season. Sunderland have scored three goals in the opening five minutes of PL games this season; more than any other side.

Papiss Cisse has scored five goals in his last seven Premier League appearances as a substitute, but has netted just four goals in his last 26 PL starts.","Newcastle United host Sunderland at St James' Park (Sunday 1.30pm)

"Alan Pardew says the decision to tell Jonas Gutierrez to find a new club following his recovery from testicular cancer last year was made on a ‘pure football’ basis. The Newcastle winger returned to Tyneside last December having had a testicle removed, but was loaned out to Norwich in January after being told he did not feature in the manager’s first-team plans. Gutierrez has now successfully fought the illness for a second time and will be back in training with United next month.

Gutierrez ran a marathon for charity after being given the all clear and will return to Newcastle next month .

However, the 31-year-old has this week spoken of his disappointment at events of 12 months ago, indicating he was unhappy with the actions of his manager. Pardew, though, has defended that decision and is looking forward to welcoming Gutierrez back to the club in the coming weeks. ‘It was a pure football decision, and those are decisions that have to be made,’ he said. ‘We’ve supported him and tried to do what we could when his illness was made known to us, before it was known publicly. Alan Pardew, taking a Newcastle training session, insists the decison was 'purely football' ‘What he has done is absolutely marvellous, to recover like he has. I believe he’s picking up an award. We’re very proud of what he has done. He needs to rest assured it was purely a football decision.’ Pardew added: ‘We have been very supportive since the illness and hopefully he will come back all guns blazing. He is a great character and we miss him dearly and look forward to seeing him. ‘His quotes more or less say it was a footballing decision and we have to make these tough decisions. That was one based on football and nothing else.’","Jonas Gutierrez has successfully fought testicular cancer twice .

"Niall Quinn says Sunderland did not spend 14 years developing Jack Colback into an England hopeful just to allow him to join rivals Newcastle on a free transfer. The former Black Cats chairman believes something went badly wrong when their academy product quit the Stadium of Light for St James’ Park in the summer. On Sunday Colback comes up against his old club for the first time in the Tyne-Wear derby. Jack Colback joined Newcastle on a free transfer this summer after leaving Sunderland . Former Sunderland striker Niall Quinn says it hurts to see Colback playing for the club's biggest rivals . Colback spent 14 years on the books at Sunderland and made his first team debut in 2009 . Colback battles with Benjamin Stambouli during Wednesday's Capital One Cup defeat . And Quinn regrets both the loss of Colback and the fact they missed out on a fee, unlike the £20million they received from Liverpool for Jordan Henderson in 2011. ‘Jack had been a really strong player for Sunderland for three years (in the first-team) and we didn’t bring him through and work on him to make Newcastle stronger,’ said the ex-Sunderland striker and manager, who retains close links with the club. ‘He and Jordan Henderson have been the pick of our academy players in recent years and we got good money from Liverpool for Jordan, but to lose Jack for nothing certainly hurt. ‘Something went wayward there.’ Colback has since won a call-up to the England squad and is being tipped for a return to the international set-up in light of his recent good form at Newcastle. Quinn believes Three Lions recognition would be deserved, although he is dismayed that such honours will not be achieved as a Sunderland player. ‘I’ve got no problem with him going to Newcastle and I said at the time he would make an England squad because he’s getting to that stage where he can take a game by the scruff of the neck,’ he said. ‘But from a Sunderland point of view we’re very proud of our academy products and to see Newcastle benefiting from that and us getting nothing in return, it’ s difficult. ‘It’s a shame for us because he was just becoming the player we knew he could be. ‘And I feel a bit for Gus Poyet. Losing Jack was undoubtedly a blow.’ Midfielder Colback (centre) has impressed since during his early Newcastle career . Quinn, who had a spell as manager at Sunderland, said he felt sorry For Gus Poyet after losing Colback . Colback made 135 appearances for Sunderland and one of his five goals came in last season’s 3-0 win at St James’. But with the 25-year-old’s contract having expired in the summer, he decided to join hometown club Newcastle in what has proved a controversial move. Colback, though, has impressed in black and white. He is one of the first names on Alan Pardew’s team-sheet and his new manager has also touted him for England. The 25-year-old's performances in the first part of the season earned him a call up to the England squad . Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats scoring five goals, inclusing against Newcastle last season . Colback will come up against his former team-mates for the first time on Sunday . Quinn understands why the midfielder is so highly-rated within the game and hopes Sunderland supporters do not turn on him this weekend. ‘Jack’s not the type of player who always catches the eye but he’s such a good, hard-working player, vigilant and disciplined,’ he added. ‘He was Mr Dependable at Sunderland and I certainly wouldn’t encourage Sunderland fans to boo him - although diehard fans might think differently!’","Jack Colback ended his 14-year association with Sunderland this summer .

"A mother who lost her leg in an horrific car crash has found a new lease of life... thanks to pole dancing. Lisa Eagleton, 40, had to have her right leg amputated below the knee following the smash in 2007. But, after months of rehabilitation and support at a specialist centre, she regained her confidence and learned to walk again. Scroll down for video . Lisa  had to have her right leg amputated below the knee following a car crash in 2007 . Lisa now takes part in competitions as Britain's only below-knee amputee pole dancer . The mother-of-four from Wigan - who is also known as Lady Lush Lisa - went on to become an alternative catwalk model. Now she is also wowing crowds and takes part in competitions as Britain's only below-knee amputee pole dancer. Lisa, who had enjoyed dancing before the crash, said: 'Even months after my amputation, I was in pain every day, living on morphine. The socket in my prosthetic leg rubbed, causing blisters that resulted in me being barely able to walk. 'I had lost my life as it was. I thought I had to accept my limitations. I was told I would never be as I was before my accident. Everyone was telling me what I couldn't do, what I no-longer was. I was depressed and in pain.' Lisa was referred to the Pace Rehabilitation Centre in Cheadle, where the support helped her walk again. Lisa shows off some of her incredible skills on the pole, which took a long time and determination to master . Out of the blue she was offered a chance to take part in a photoshoot, which led to her becoming an alternative model and taking up pole dancing. Lisa said: 'Since the accident, I felt unattractive, had low body confidence and was uncertain of what the world thought of a limbless woman. However, I felt it was time to accept that this was me, and rebuild myself. 'I had missed dance so much, but decided a route to return to it was pole dancing, as that was low impact on my leg and offered me support. 'My teachers helped me learn the moves, some of which took a long time to master, but I was determined to dance again.' Lisa no longer feels the same low body confidence she had directly after her accident . The challenges of pole dancing meant there were days when Lisa struggled to walk afterwards . The challenges of pole dancing meant there were days when Lisa struggled to walk afterwards, but her determined spirit saw her through. She said: 'After lots of practice, I eventually managed to compete in some competitions and became Britain's only below-knee amputee pole dancer.' Lisa, who swims eight hours a week and does yoga to help ease the pain she still suffers, said: 'There's always a way to do things to make you happy. The hardest thing is to take the first step.' Victoria Bryne, from Pole Seduction, the Wigan pole dancing and fitness school where Lisa learned how to pole dance, said: 'The things she can do on the pole now are unbelievable. She does move after move and she's an inspiration to other girls in the class. I'm really proud of her.'","Had her right leg amputated below the knee following car crash .

"A man's body was left on the floor of an ambulance station near to bins because paramedics wanted to go home on time, it has been claimed. A whistleblower has alleged that the body of 32-year-old James Harrison was left at Ely Ambulance Station for over an hour when it should have been taken straight to a hospital mortuary. They said that his body was left dumped next to bins because the medics were determined to finish their shift on time when it should have been taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Ely Ambulance Station, pictured, where it is claimed the body of James Harrison was left on the floor because paramedics wanted to go home on time . The alleged incident has now prompted an investigation, which has been launched by the East of England Ambulance Service. The ambulance service insider said the 999 crew from Downham Market responded to the call to collect Mr Harrison's body from outside Ely Fire Station. However, he claimed that because the crew were about to finish a night shift, they didn't want to make the trip to Cambridge. The anonymous whistleblower said: 'Standard practice would be for paramedics to transport the body to the mortuary. 'But on the day the body was left on the station floor next to the bins for more than an hour, which raises serious issues of dignity and decency. 'I have never experienced anything like this in my career, it was totally wrong. 'When the day crew came in, about an hour later, they found the body there. Mr Harrison was found dead in the early hours of September 24 near Littleport fire station. Police spent three days at the scene, pictured, before it was ruled there was no evidence of foul play . 'I understand there have been statements taken but they [the ambulance service] haven’t done anything about it yet.' An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed: 'An incident last month involving the transportation of a deceased patient is under investigation and as such we cannot comment any further.' He added that they would be contacting Mr Harrisons’s family to keep them up to date with the progress of the probe. Mr Harrison was found dead in the early hours of September 24 near Littleport Fire Station. Police and forensic experts spent three days at the street scene before a post mortem examination ruled there was no evidence of foul play. Further tests are set to be carried out in a bid to establish how Mr Harrison died. An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned until January 14 by William Morris, senior coroner for North and East Cambridgeshire.","Whistleblower claims body of James Harrison was left on the floor by medics .

In addition to being forced to cancel last month's trip to Malta, which was completed by Prince William instead, she also missed Prince Harry’s enormously successful Invictus Games.

"Jonas Gutierrez could make an 'emotional' return to the Newcastle United first-team squad within two weeks - with manager Alan Pardew vowing to give him 'an even keel' with other players as the Argentine fights back to full fitness. The 31-year-old recovered from cancer this year - having had a testicle removed in order to beat the disease - and was given the all-clear last month having undergone chemotherapy in Argentina. And he returned to training with the Magpies this month following an extended recuperation period in his native Argentina. Jonas Gutierrez revealed in November that he had beaten testicular cancer after receiving chemotherapy . Newcastle's Gutierrez found out he had cancer after a challenge from Arsenal's Bacary Sagna (right) Gutierrez, who has not played for Newcastle in 12 months, will be given every opportunity by his manager to prove he can work his way back into the first-team fold. Speaking at his press conference ahead of the Magpies' trip to White Hart Lane for their Capital One Cup quarter-final clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, Pardew said: 'Jonas is one of those people who livens up the training ground just by his personality. Of course, with him recovering from his illness, that's been magnified. 'We are really pleased to have him back. He is finding his feet a little bit.

"The 'Never Ending Pasta Pass' card from Olive Garden not only promised weeks of unlimited pasta, but a look into why the chain is fighting to hold onto customers. The Italian-themed chain sold the $100 card last month that allowed 1,000 people to dine on endless pasta, breadsticks, soup and salad for 49 days. The passes sold out in less than an hour, with some turning up on eBay for hundreds of dollars. It was a successful publicity stunt for Olive Garden's parent company, Darden Restaurants. But the company's troubles aren't over: It's fighting to hold onto customers, with sales at its flagship chain declining for each of the past three years. And a hedge fund last month sent shareholders a 294-page treatise criticizing Darden's management as part of a push to take control of the board at the company's annual meeting on Friday. This image provided by Darden Restaurants shows Olive Garden's ¿Never Ending Pasta Pass.' The Italian-themed chain had just announced to let 1,000 people pay $100 for the pass that gave them unprecedented free reign to its pasta. The passes sold out less than an hour after they went on sale online. (AP Photo/Darden Restaurants) Darden says it's making changes to turn around business. That includes modernizing its menu with 'small plates' like crispy risotto bites and updating its marketing. To get a firsthand look at Olive Garden's troubles, I paid for a Pasta Pass. I mostly enjoyed my meals, but the reactions of my companions shed some light on why the chain is struggling. Some think the menu is overwhelming and the service is slow. Others feel bad about eating all the empty calories. And one colleague who ordered the meat lasagna said: 'I can make this at home.' THE FOOD . Olive Garden has become a punchline in some circles that don't see it as serving authentic Italian food. One night, I asked my fellow diners what they thought about the criticism. Eric McGarvey, 40, said he considers Olive Garden's food to be 'American Italian' and likes the consistency it provides. I found the food to be tasty too, if basic. My main complaint is that the noodles are on the soft side, but others might not prefer their pasta al dente. The bigger issue is nutrition; My go-to dish of corkscrew pasta with meat sauce and meatballs probably wasn't the best option. The dish is 920 calories. Olive Garden did add a 'Lighter Italian Fare' two years ago with options that include a chicken breast served with potatoes and spinach at 550 calories. But those aren't part of the pasta promotion. That does, however, bring me to another problem Olive Garden has: an overwhelming number of options. Executives acknowledge the need to simplify the menu, which has been criticized for mushrooming to nearly 100 items, including burgers. Still, Darden president Eugene Lee recently said it's hard deciding what to get rid because 'everybody has their favorite.' THE PRICES . The other common complaint among my companions was that the prices are too high, with dishes like Fettuccine Alfredo costing $18 in New York City. A steak and potatoes dish cost $30. Olive Garden notes prices vary by market but that in most places, those dishes cost $9.49 and $19.99, respectively. Still, Olive Garden acknowledges it needs to get better at offering value. In fact, the Pasta Pass was intended to promote its Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which lets people eat as much pasta as they want in one sitting for $9.99. That promotion has run every year since debuting in 1995. Like other aspects of its business, though, Olive Garden has acknowledged that it hasn't been as effective as it could be. As a result, the promotion was pushed to late September this year, instead of early August. Jay Spenchian, Olive Garden's executive vice president of marketing, said Olive Garden realized the idea of a hot bowl of endless pasta isn't as appetizing when it's hot out. The Never Ending Pasta Bowl is Olive Garden's most popular deal, but I never saw it advertised in the restaurants. That's likely because the chain doesn't want to distract customers who are likely to pay more for something on the regular menu. While it may make sense from a business perspective, it was inconvenient and confusing. I had to look up the options for pasta, sauce and toppings available on my phone or ask the waiter. Another problem? The Never Ending Pasta Bowl made Olive Garden's regular prices in New York seem more inflated. Just a single plate of pasta and meat sauce costs $17 on the regular menu. A waiter told me on one visit that a man at a nearby table was on his seventh bowl, so maybe he got his money's worth. But Olive Garden said about a third of people don't even ask for a second plate.","The Italian-themed chain sold the $100 card last month that allowed 1,000 people to dine on endless pasta, breadsticks, soup and salad for 49 days ."
"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman expects Jay Rodriguez's rehabilitation from a long-term knee injury to keep him out for at least another six weeks. An awkward fall at Manchester City in April saw the 25-year-old rupture an anterior cruciate ligament, the injury ruling him out of the reckoning for England's World Cup squad. Rodriguez has yet to make his return more than eight months later and, having gone under the knife again last month to clear out his knee, a comeback does not appear imminent. The news is a blow to Tottenham's hopes of signing the striker in January. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Preview: Southampton vs Everton . Jay Rodriguez is given oxygen as he is taken off on a stretcher after injuring his knee at Man City in April . The Southampton striker, 25, scores against Tottenham at White Hart Lane in March . Before the routine operation Saints had hoped to have last season's top scorer back for the hectic festive period; now it looks like a return will not come until February. 'He had to make a step back in his recovery,' Koeman said. 'That was a pity because I remember when we spoke about the squad in the pre-season I said Jay will be like a fantastic signing for December or January and he isn't. 'All these kind of unlucky moments are part of the difficult time that we have. 'After a big injury, you don't have to rush. He needs time and we give him the time to come back, but it's a pity because he's a great player. The former Burnley man made his England debut against Chile at Wembley in November 2013 . 'It's always difficult now because it's not good to fix on a special date to come back. He's now making steps forwards and he needs more time and that's the most important. 'To fix a date makes pressure on the player and the medical staff.' While keen not to say when Rodriguez would make his comeback, Koeman did admit a return before February was unlikely. 'I think now, in this situation, he will not be available before the end of January,' he said. 'No, no.' Rodriguez is one of a host of players unavailable for the visit of Everton this weekend, with Jack Cork, Dusan Tadic, Sam Gallagher and Jake Hesketh also sidelined by injury. Morgan Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Florin Gardos are suspended for the St Mary's encounter, while Graziano Pelle and Steven Davis are doubts. Key midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (right) is suspended for the clash against Everton . The string of absentees means Koeman will be relying on Southampton's much-vaunted youth system to help end a five-match losing streak. Koeman said Harrison Reed would 'probably' start his first Premier League match on Saturday, while Lloyd Isgrove is pushing to join him. Jason McCarthy, Dominic Gape, Jake Flannigan, Sam McQueen and Ryan Seager are others vying for a place in the squad to face Everton as Saints look to end their worst losing run of the 21st century.","Jay Rodriguez ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in April .

"A care home where vulnerable patients were subjected to horrifying ‘institutional abuse’ put shareholder profit ahead of the ‘humane delivery of treatment’, a devastating report found yesterday. An independent inquiry into the Winterbourne View scandal also revealed that residents of the home attended accident and emergency departments 76 times in three years – yet no medics alerted the authorities. The report lambasted the local NHS, police, and health watchdogs for not acting on dozens of complaints by patients and their families dating back up to five years. Scroll down for video . Inquiry: Panorama filmed residents at Winterbourne View being assaulted . and bullied. This poor woman was dragged across the floor in this undercover footage obtained by a whistleblower . Disgusting: Staff played games with the patients, shown here placing one . person under furniture with the other sat in the seat above. Campaigners have warned that another scandal like this could happen again . But some of the most scathing . criticism was reserved for Castlebeck Ltd, the firm which owned the home . – and was paid £3,500 a week by the NHS for every mentally ill patient . placed in the home, which is technically classed as a secure hospital. The report, by independent expert Dr . Margaret Flynn, said the company ‘appears to have made decisions about . profitability, including shareholder returns, over and above decisions . about the effective and humane delivery of assessment, treatment and . rehabilitation’. It said Castlebeck – which is owned . by a Swiss private equity group – ‘took the financial rewards without . any apparent accountability’. Dr Flynn said: ‘Unwittingly, the hospital has become a case study in institutional abuse.’ The report was commissioned after . Winterbourne View, which was on a business park outside Bristol, was . exposed by BBC1’s Panorama last year. An undercover reporter recorded secret footage of patients being abused by carers. The video appeared to show sickening scenes of vulnerable residents being pinned down, slapped, doused in water and taunted. Since the broadcast, Castlebeck has . closed Winterbourne View, at Winterbourne in South Gloucestershire, and . two other of its string of residential homes in the UK. On Monday, Michael Ezenagu, 29, . became the 11th ex-member of the home’s staff to admit offences relating . to the ill-treatment of patients. They will be sentenced at Bristol . Crown Court at a later date. Yesterday’s report laid bare the catalogue . of failings which allowed the abuse to go unchecked for years. Between January 2008 and May 2011, . residents at Winterbourne View were taken to hospital 76 times – . including to be treated for epileptic seizures, injury, self-harm, . lacerations, removal of a foreign body and for a fall. Abusers: (Left to right) Kelvin Fore, Michael Ezenagu, Neil Ferguson, Sookalingun Appoo and Wayne Rogers. (Bottom left to right) Alison Dove, Charlotte Cotterell, Danny Brake, Graham Doyle, Holly Draper and Jason Gardiner. Horrific: This member of staff stamps on the patients hand in yet another shocking image from the now-closed home. The private hospital should have been a safe place for patients to be treated with compassion and care . But the report said: ‘Putting to one . side emotional, verbal and psychological harm… there was considerable . visible, physical and quantifiable violence at Winterbourne View for . which patients required hospital treatment and yet there were no . safeguarding alerts from accident and emergency.’ Brave: The abuse at Winterbourne was uncovered after this whistleblower spoke out . Meanwhile, South Gloucestershire . Council received 27 allegations of abuse by staff to patients at the . hospital, ten allegations of patient-on-patient assaults and three . family-related alerts. Avon and Somerset Police recorded 29 . incidents – including nine carer-on-patient incidents. These included . staff head-butting and punching patients. Castlebeck itself recorded a total of . 379 physical interventions – such as restraint – during 2010 and 129 . for the first three months of 2011. Yet it was only after the Panorama investigation that the authorities woke up to the true scale of the abuse. Complaints had either been viewed in . isolation, or the authorities had sided with the accounts given by staff . rather than patients. Dr Flynn said the ‘silencing’ of complaints by the victims was ‘scandalous’. Peter Murphy, chairman of the South . Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board, expressed the ‘deep regret’ of the organisations that make up the board for what happened at the . home. A Castlebeck spokesman said: ‘We . believe we have responded [to the criticisms in the report] in a way . that demonstrates our resolve to ensure that the events of Winterbourne . View will not be repeated.’ Failure: The local primary care trust said many of the systems that could have stopped the shocking abuse of patients at Winterbourne View hospital failed but insisted standards had now improved .","Winterbourne View condemned by an independent inquiry for putting profitability before care .

"While we're still yet to find concrete evidence it exists, scientists now think there might be half as much dark matter in the Milky Way as previously thought. By observing stars at the edge of the galaxy, astronomers claim we may have overestimated how much we should expect to find. And the discovery could also help explain another mystery of our galaxy - namely why it has so few other galaxies in orbit around it. Astronomers at the University of Western Australia studied our Milky Way (illustration shown). They found the mass of dark matter should be 800 billion suns. This is half what the previous estimate for dark matter in the galaxy was. The discovery helps solve a mystery as to why we had so few satellite galaxies . Australian astronomers used a method developed almost 100 years ago to discover that the weight of dark matter in our own galaxy is 800 billion times the mass of the sun - half what was previously thought. They probed the edge of the Milky Way, looking closely at the fringes of the galaxy about three trillion miles (5 trillion kilometres) from Earth. Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. To make the discovery, they used a robust technique developed by British astronomer James Jeans in 1915 - decades before the discovery of dark matter. It involves measuring the speed of stars moving through the galaxy. Astrophysicist Dr Prajwal Kafle, from The University of Western Australia node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said we have known for a while that most of the Universe is hidden. 'Stars, dust, you and me, all the things that we see, only make up about 4 per cent of the entire universe,' he said. 'About 25 per cent is dark matter and the rest is dark energy.' Dr Kafle, who is originally from Nepal, was able to measure the mass of the dark matter in the Milky Way by studying the speed of stars throughout the galaxy, including the edges, which had never been studied to this detail before. Earlier this year, in separate research scientists created the most detailed computer simulation of the history of the universe called Illustris, revealing dark matter density in the universe (illustrated here). The simulation was developed by a team led by astrophysicist Mark Vogelsberger of Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Dr Kafle's measurement also helps to solve a mystery that has been haunting theorists for almost two decades. 'The current idea of galaxy formation and evolution, called the Lambda Cold Dark Matter theory, predicts that there should be a handful of big satellite galaxies around the Milky Way that are visible with the naked eye, but we don't see that,' Dr Kafle said. 'When you use our measurement of the mass of the dark matter the theory predicts that there should only be three satellite galaxies out there, which is exactly what we see; the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.' University of Sydney astrophysicist Professor Geraint Lewis, who was also involved in the research, said the missing satellite problem had been 'a thorn in the cosmological side for almost 15 years.' 'Dr Kafle's work has shown that it might not be as bad as everyone thought, although there are still problems to overcome,' he said. The study also presented a broader model of the Milky Way, which allowed the scientists to measure several interesting things such as the speed required to leave the galaxy. 'Be prepared to hit 3640 miles [550km] per second if you want to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy,' Dr Kafle said.","Astronomers at the University of Western Australia studied our Milky Way .

"A young girl suffered through months of pain, sickness, and numerous medical visits before doctors could figure out what was causing her mystery illness. When she was just four years old, Sophie Oliver was playing with her older sister when she suffered a severe coughing fit. Her mother, a nurse, rushed her to the doctors immediately. But it wasn't until five months later and after almost a dozen medical appointments that doctors found a steel Barbie ring lodged in the toddler's throat, the NZ Herald reported. Sophie Oliver, now eight, suffered through months of pain as a child after she got a steel Barbie ring lodged in her throat . Sophie's mother Sue-Anne Oliver took her young daughter - now eight years old - to many doctors but no one managed to discover the cause of her sickness. She was repeatedly prescribed antibiotics but nothing seemed to be working for Sophie. 'She lost weight. She was looking like a walking skeleton with her head on one side. She couldn't eat,' Mrs Oliver, from Tuakau south of Auckland, told the website. However when it was suspected their may be a problem with Sophie's tonsils, the young girl was taken to an ear, nose and throat specialist. This was a relief to Mrs Oliver who admitted the grim thought of cancer had crossed her mind. A x-ray done by an ear, nose and throat specialist revealed the ring was embedded in her trachea . At the doctor's private practice he took an x-ray on the suspicion that Sophie may have swallowed a foreign object. His suspicions were confirmed when the scan showed Sophie's sister Siobhain's ring firmly stuck in her throat, blocking her trachea. 'The radiologist was struck speechless momentarily as the x-ray revealed a ring was lodged in Sophie's trachea. We were overwhelmed with emotion, both relief and terror,' Mrs Oliver said. The Oliver family still have the ring that caused their youngest daughter so much trouble . The toddler was then taken to the Starship Children's Health centre in New Zealand and had to undergo surgery to remove the piece of jewellery which had become embedded in her throat after being there for so long. After being put in an induced coma for three days and two more rounds of surgery Sophie was given the all clear by doctors.

"Saturday Night Live has been accused by veteran LA comic Ian Gary of ripping off a Tina Turner sketch that aired on Saturday night that featured guest host Sarah Silverman. The funnyman, who is a tutor at Los Angeles' legendary Groundling comedy troupe, said that the skit which lampooned Tina Turner impersonators on a river cruise was originally performed by his students, Vanessa Ragland and Kimberly Condict over the summer. In both sketches, impersonators of the superstar wear sequined red mini-dresses and wigs in the style of Turner's iconic 80s hairstyle and sing along to 'Proud Mary' while taking it in turns to make jokes about their prior, failed lives. Scroll Down for Video . Saturday night: Sarah Silverman (left), Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata (right) performed their Tina Turner sketch over the weekend on the iconic NBC live comedy show . Controversy: Vanessa Ragland and Kimberly Condict perform their Tina Turner sketch as part of the Los Angeles comedy troupe, the Groundlings in September . However, while both sketches have striking, almost identical similarities, the SNL skit featuring Silverman, Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata is shorter, has different punch lines and is tighter paced according to the LA Times. After SNL's Turner sketch aired on Saturday, Gary, who is a teacher at the Groundling troupe claimed enough was enough and took to Facebook to vent his anger at the iconic NBC show which is helmed by Canadian, Lorne Michaels. Taking care to praise SNL as a promoter of comedic talent and a chief influence, Gary said he is not out to 'attack' the show, but wanted everyone to know his protégés performed their Turner sketch first, in September. However, he goes on to say: 'But, over the years I have seen MANY MANY sketches flat out stolen from my friends by Saturday Night Live. Defence: Ian Gary (right) took to social media over the weekend to point out the similarities between the Groundlings Tina Turner sketch and SNL's . 'Nearly verbatim. Word for word... And everyone in our community goes 'Oh man. That sucks.' and nobody says anything because I guess SNL is still some dream for some people or they don't want to get involved, or a million other reasonable things that stop people from standing up for each other when things are blatantly wrong.' To prove his point, Gary posted pictures to the social media network of the stars of Groundlings and SNL each wearing their very similar costumes. Warming to his theme, Gary said that he felt that in this particular case, he had to speak out. 'This is stupid. And we have the means to make people aware of blatant rip offs of other peoples material,' wrote Gary. 'It doesn't need to be a witch hunt. It doesn't need to be pointing fingers, assigning blame, or taking sides. But a simple case of what's right and wrong.' Kimberly Condict also wrote her opinion of the controversy as a post to Facebook. Spot the difference: Ian Gary uploaded to Facebook this split picture of his students, Vanessa Ragland and Kimberly Condict (left) in their Tina Turner outfits as compared to the costumes Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata (right) wore over the weekend . 'If you liked the sketch SNL did last night about a Tina Turner tribute band musing and singing to 'Rollin' on a River,' then you'll LOVE this sketch Vanessa Bruiser Ragland and I wrote and performed for six weeks this summer at Groundlings about a Tina Turner tribute band musing and singing to 'Rollin' on a River!' A source at SNL told the Hollywood Reporter that they had no knowledge of the Groundlings sketch and totally refuted any accusations they stole it. 'It's a common idea since Tina Turner is such an iconic figure. The similarities represent parallel thinking in the comedy world,' the source said.","Member of Groundling comedy troupe claims SNL ripped-off his protégés .

"The BBC was accused of reporting Britain’s veto of the eurozone rescue plan as a national catastrophe rather than a tough decision David Cameron was forced to make. Conservative MPs said the broadcaster’s ‘biased’ coverage began on Radio 4’s flagship Today programme and continued throughout the day on radio and television. Presenters used solemn tones to inform listeners about Britain becoming isolated following David Cameron’s refusal to sign a new treaty. Biased? Presenter Sophie Raworth began her broadcast of yesterday's One O'Clock News by saying Britain had failed to sign the treaty to 'resolve' the eurozone crisis - even though critics said the treaty was only ever meant to stabilise Europe . In some cases, it was several minutes into news bulletins before the BBC got round to reporting Mr Cameron’s explanation of why he had resisted pressure to hand over more powers to Brussels. On Radio 4’s 6am news bulletin, Justin Webb announced gravely: ‘Leaders of 23 EU countries are to draft a new fiscal pact to help stabilise their currency WITHOUT the involvement of Britain.’ He added: ‘President Sarkozy accused David Cameron of making a deal between all 27 countries impossible.’ It was a full two minutes into the broadcast before listeners heard Mr Cameron’s remarks explaining why he was forced into exercising Britain’s veto. Mr Cameron’s refusal to give in to Germany and France’s demands was the lead story on most of the BBC’s outlets yesterday. Grave: BBC Business Editor Robert Peston (left) said listeners on the Today programme should be 'concerned' by the veto, while Justin Webb (right) gave a sombre declaration on Radio 4's 6am bulletin today . Tory MP Peter Bone complained: ‘The BBC seemed to be using language that suggested it was a disaster. It was being pro-EU and anti-British, and it was in marked contrast to how other major news organisations reported it. ‘In fact, it was a triumph for Britain and a triumph for the Prime Minister. When it comes to Europe, the BBC is institutionally biased.’ Downing Street declined to comment, but insiders said Mr Cameron’s aides were resigned to him coming under attack from ‘pro-EU media outlets’ including parts of the BBC. Critic: Tory MP Peter Bone said the BBC was being pro-EU and anti-British in contrast to other news organisations . On Today, Business Editor Robert Peston informed listeners they should be ‘concerned’. He warned gravely: ‘For Britain, frankly, that is massively important because, if the eurozone goes down, the impact on the British economy will be hideous. 'It would inevitably tip us back into a very severe recession. So we should be concerned that this deal to save the world doesn’t seem to have materialised.’ On the BBC TV One O’Clock News, presenter Sophie Raworth began with: ‘David Cameron has dramatically refused to sign a new treaty designed to resolve the eurozone debt crisis’ – even though critics pointed out that the proposed treaty had merely sought to stabilise, rather than to resolve, the crisis. Viewers then had to wait until almost 1.03pm to hear Mr Cameron’s remarks on the story. Last year, BBC Director General Mark Thompson accepted the corporation had previously been guilty of a ‘massive’ left-wing bias. He also confessed that the BBC’s coverage of Europe had been ‘weak and rather nervous’. A BBC spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister’s comments on the developments in Europe have been a central part of our coverage throughout the day. 'The coverage has reflected the story as it has unfolded and featured a wide range of voices.'",Tory MPs claim broadcaster's coverage was biased .
"A St Louis County police officer working in Ferguson, Missouri in the aftermath of Michael Brown's shooting death has been suspended from duty after disturbing video emerged of him referring to black people as 'little perverts' and President Obama as an illegal immigrant. Officer Dan Page, who was caught live on CNN News earlier this week pushing the network's anchor Don Lemon and threatening to arrest him, made the hate-filled speech in April of this year during an Oath Keepers of St Louis/St Charles meeting. His offensive remarks weren't limited to black people - he also had vitriol to spew about Muslims, women who have abortions, gay people and people who suffer domestic violence. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hate-filled rant: Officer Dan Page spoke for more than an hour at an Oath Keepers meeting in April airing his ignorant views on black people, domestic violence, homosexuals, President Obama and Muslims, among others . Excessive force: CNN's Don Lemon was repeatedly pushed and threatened with arrest by Page during a live cross for the network on Monday . The raving speech goes on for more than an hour as Page, brandishing a bible, enlightens his audience with his unique views. Page is the second St Louis county police officer to have been relieved of his duties during the Ferguson protests. Lieutenant Ray Albers, 46, was caught on camera screaming, 'I will f***ing kill you!' and pointing his rifle at civilians. An investigation is underway and he has been placed on indefinite unpaid leave. The incidents have highlighted the racial divide in Ferguson, a largely black town where the police force and local politicians are almost all white. Civil rights activists say Brown's death was the culmination of years of police unfairly targeting blacks. Protests in Ferguson, Missouri, were muted for a third straight evening on Friday as the National Guard began withdrawing from the St. Louis suburb racked by racial turmoil after a white police officer shot dead an unarmed black teenager. Hundreds of protesters marched in the hot summer night near the site of the August 9 slaying of 18-year-old Michael Brown, chanting 'Hands up, don't shoot,' while police vehicles observed the demonstration, without intervening. Clergy volunteers wearing bright orange T-shirts discouraged protesters who wanted to defy police orders to keep moving, while live singing and drums boomed out from a flat-bed truck. Muted: People march down St. Louis Street to the NOPD First District station to protest the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer on August 22, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri . Continuing protests: Police reportedly let protesters march unimpeded in Ferguson in further demonstrations which have drawn attention to the police force in the area . The St Louis County Police released a statement saying the Police Chief Jon Belmar was 'disturbed' by the content of Page's speech. 'We hold our officers to a high standard of honor both on and off duty. While we as a department do not have an issue with officers expressing themselves, this was disturbing and unacceptable,' it reads. 'The officer is a 35 year veteran of this department and has been deployed numerous times in military service. He had passed the evaluations upon returning from deployment and there was no indication of this attitude.' Early in the video, Page tells his audience that the bible is the foundation of the Constitution and that you cannot have one without the other, saying, 'I don’t know what them black little perverts don’t understand down there. But they need me to talk to them. I’ll square them away for you. Take me about a minute. To the letter: Page brandishes  the bible in his right hand, which he believes is the basis of the Constitution, which he holds in his left . Offensive: Don Lemon described Page's speech as 'wide-ranging inflammatory remarks' He reads from the Constitution, stumbling over several words, the meanings of which clearly elude him. He rages against hate-crime laws, saying there are 'four sodomites on the Supreme Court' and describing himself as being 'into diversity - I kill everybody!' 'And I’m real good with a rifle. My best shot is 1,875 meters, I got me a gold star on that one. You run from me you’re gonna die tired,' he rants. Page claims to be a Vietnam War Vet and a sergeant major in the U.S. Army who took retirement two years early in 2012 because he didn't want to take orders from President Obama. He refers to the president as an 'illegal alien' and claims to have flown a plane to Kenya to see where 'my undocumented president lives at.' Police Chief Jon Belmar says that while Page has never been involved in an 'officer-involved shooting,' his attitude and description of himself as an 'indiscriminate killer' was extremely concerning. Smiling on the other side of his face: Page has been suspended pending an investigation after the speech was shown to St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar . 'I personally believe in Jesus Christ as my lord savior, but I'm also a killer. I’ve killed a lot. And if I need to, I'll kill a whole bunch more,' Page tells the OathKeepers. 'If you don't want to get killed, don't show up in front of me, it's that simple. I have no problem with it. God did not raise me to be a coward,' he said before launching into a rant about the government indoctrinating children to spy on their parents in public schools. The OathKeepers is an association of former and present military personnel, police officers and first reponders who 'defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.' Don Lemon, who was repeatedly pushed by Page during a live report from Ferguson Monday, described the video: 'It’s wide-ranging inflammatory remarks about a lot of people, about women, about gay people,' he said. '[Page] talks about the president of the United States. He speaks out against affirmative action, women in the military and on and on.' Following his interaction with Page in Ferguson, Lemon told audiences, 'We’re on national television, so imagine what they’re doing to people when you don’t see it on national television, people who don’t have a voice like we do.' According to St Louis Today, an internal review of Page will begin Monday.","St Louis County police officer Dan Page has been suspended after a video of him giving a hate-filled speech to far-right group surfaced .

"Britain's recovery is slowing down, after new figures showed the economy grew by only 0.7 per cent in last three months. The figure is down on the 0.9 per cent seen between April and June, and comes amid fears for the health of the global economy that have brought turbulence to stock markets. Ministers insist they will 'keep a steady hand on the economic tiller' but face new pressure over lower than expected tax revenues and rising levels of borrowing. The UK economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months to September, down from 0.9 between April and June . The Office for National Statistics said every sector of the economy grew in the third quarter of 2014, from July to September. There was growth of 0.7 per cent in services, 0.5 per cent in production, 0.8 per cent in construction and 0.3 per cent in agriculture. It means the economy is now 3 per cent bigger than it was a year ago, and 3.4 per cent higher than the pre-economic downturn peak at the start of 2008. Chancellor George Osborne boasted the UK is 'leading the pack in an increasingly uncertain global economy'. He added that it was a 'critical moment for the UK economy', warning: 'We face a choice: return to economic chaos of past or work through plan that's creating a brighter future.' Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'Our recovery is now well established and creating jobs in record numbers. These GDP figures show the UK economy has good momentum to deal with a less certain global outlook. 'Our plan is working and we need to stick to it. The families and businesses of Britain whose hard work is powering this recovery will judge harshly any party that threatens to squander this progress. 'Britain can't forget the deficit or believe unfunded promises. Being sensible with the nation's money is the bedrock of the Liberal Democrat approach. 'We will keep a steady hand on the economic tiller because that is the only way to produce the stronger economy and fairer society that Britain needs.' Chancellor George Osborne said the UK was at a 'critical moment' and warned against a change of economic course . Mr Osborne yesterday tried his hand at using a nail gun during a visit to Rotunda Living, a manufacturer of wooden buildings, to highlight investment in housing and jobs . Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'For all George Osborne's claims that the economy is fixed most people are still not feeling the recovery. Working people are over £1600 a year worse off since 2010 and these figures now show a concerning slowdown in economic growth too. 'We need a strong and balanced recovery that works for all working people, not just a few at the top. But under the Tories we have stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs which, as the OBR said last week, are leading to rising borrowing. This plan isn't working for working people.' The stagnating performance of the eurozone, Britain's main trading partner, is a key concern. Last week the Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane signalled that gloomier prospects would push back the likely date for an interest rate hike well into next year. Minutes from the latest meeting of the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee also showed a pessimistic view, arguing that gathering problems in the eurozone increased risks to a sustained recovery. Uncertainty both abroad and at home - with the prospect of a looming general election in the UK - has led experts at EY ITEM Club to forecast strong expected growth of 3.1 per cent for 2014 edging down to 2.4 per cent next year. The UK is also enjoying record numbers in work, and unemployment recently dipped below two million to an eight-year low, while inflation is at a five-year low of 1.2 per cent. Yet productivity is flat-lining and wage growth, currently at 0.7 per cent, has been lagging behind the rise in the cost of living for six years.","Growth in last three months was lower than 0.9% seen from April to June .

"Police are struggling to identify two children found wandering the streets of Long Beach alone without any adult supervision. California's Long Beach Police Department has now asked for the public's help in identifying the children - thought to be aged one and two - as well as tracking down their parents. Police said the African American boys appeared to be in good health but were unsure exactly how long they had been without supervision. The two unidentified children (pictured) found wandering the streets are thought to be one and two years old . Police were called at 8.45am yesterday to check on the children after a concerned passerby spotted them without any noticeable supervision on Atlantic Avenue and 60th Street. The older child was found wearing a brightly colored Incredible Hulk themed t-shirt, shorts and sandals, while the younger boy was wearing a stripey t-shirt and diaper. Police said: 'Witnesses in the immediate area were interviewed but no one was seen with the children or dropping them off. 'The area was searched for any possible video but none was found. A two-block area was also canvassed, however, no one recognizing the children was located.' However, security camera footage from a nearby liquor did show the two toddlers wandering down the sidewalk, KTLA5 reported. Security camera footage shows the two children wandering along the streets as locals stop to help . The footage was taken from a nearby liquor store but the owners were unable to identify the parents . The liquor store owner told the network she knew the family, who were regular customers, but was unable to provide names. Police added that law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles County, as well as five surrounding counties, had been notified, and the children had been handed over to the Department of Children and Family Services. Anyone who recognizes the children, has information regarding their identity or the identity of their parents is urged to call Long Beach Police Communications at (562) 435-6711, or 911 if calling from the city of Long Beach.","Police are trying to identify two children found wandering the streets alone .

"Former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride was forced to resign for smearing opposition MPs while working for Gordon Brown . Ed Miliband was always the first down the pub for a drink and a gossip but now spends his time ‘walking round Hampstead Heath in a suit approaching people like a Mormon’, a disgraced former colleague has claimed. Damian McBride, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, said the Labour leader - a 'white wine man' - was ‘very sociable’ and the one to say: ‘Right, down to the bar’. But Mr McBride, who was forced to resign for smearing Tory MPs while working for Mr Brown, said Mr Miliband now had far too many people around him ‘saying he should do this or do that’ which was stopping him from being himself. Mr McBride said one of the Labour leader’s greatest assets was that he was normal but was making ‘ludicrous’ decisions which were harming his chances of making it to Number 10. The former Downing Street aide, speaking to Fubar radio, also criticised Mr Miliband’s conference speech – accusing him of forgetting to mention the deficit because he believes it’s Ed Balls’ responsibility. He also hit out at the ‘unnecessary’ anecdotes which Mr Miliband littered through his address about meeting ordinary people. Mr McBride said: ‘I didn’t think it was his best week.’ He said he should have come out and said: ‘Look it is my programme for government, this is what I want’. But he said Mr Miliband got ‘muddled up with all this stuff about wandering around Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill and meeting people’. He added: ‘That was just unnecessary.’ He said the Labour leader was much more normal than he came across, adding: ‘I tell you what he doesn’t show that side of himself.’ Mr McBride added that this was ‘the best, almost the great thing, about him.’ He said: ‘Ed Miliband’s a fantastic gossip, he is one of those people always wanting to know which civil servants were going out which civil servants, and if someone had had a break up and, you know, what happened and you know, was so and so cheating on so and so. ‘He was interested in people and a very funny guy; a very dry wit and you don’t see that at all. That doesn’t come a cross and I think he needs to do more.’ Asked if he had ever seen Mr Miliband drunk, Mr McBride said: ‘Probably not drunk, I think he handles his drink quite well.’ But he said on one foreign trip with Gordon Brown ‘Ed was the man in charge deciding what we were all doing and every night he was the person saying, “right down to the bar at seven o’clock” and choosing where we would go to for dinner and that sort of thing’. He added: ‘He is very sociable.’ Mr McBride said the Labour leader and his shadow chancellor Ed Balls were ‘two lively guys and they were very close at that time’. But he said that Mr Miliband had changed after his spin doctors had got hold of him. He said: ‘The only time I met Ed Miliband in the last five years was wondering around a park. ‘He was out pushing his daughter in a pram with his wife. ‘I was coming up to this guy and I thought, you want to be the Prime Minister and you are wearing a light orange T-shirt and some luminous pink shorts and I just wanted to say to him, “You have got to start dressing better if you are going out in public”. ‘I think he now walks around Hampstead Heath in a suit approaching people like a Mormon asking what they think about our country’s future.’ Mr Miliband and his shadow chancellor Ed Balls were ‘two lively guys and they were very close’ when they worked for Gordon Brown at the Treasury . Mr McBride said the Labour’s leader’s conference speech gaffe, when he forgot to mention the deficit, was ‘a revealing slip’. He said: ‘As far as he is concerned the deficit is Ed Balls problem. He think Ed Balls has to deal with that.’ Mr McBride added that the Labour leader also feels ‘uncomfortable with the question of immigration’. ‘As the son of immigrants he feels positive about immigration and feels uncomfortable with aping the Nigel Farage rhetoric,’ he said. But Mr McBride said the Labour leader needed to ditch his gang of spin doctors. He said: ‘He has too many people around him saying he should do this or do that. ‘When Tony Blair was about to become Prime Minister, he had one person around him – Alistair Campbell. In the days before Gordon Brown became Prmie Minister, that was my job. Ed Milliband has literally a dozen people advising him on the Press and that is too many. ‘You get pulled in all different directions. That leads to ludicrous things like The Sun embarrassing him because he didn’t wear this wristband doing Help For heroes.’ * Mr Miliband made the comments on ‘Latch and Halina's Weekend Hangover Show’ on Fubar Radio, which airs tomorrow morning between 10am and 12pm. It is available on listen again afterwards.","Mr McBride worked with the Labour leader under former PM Gordon Brown .

"A man slashed an eight-year-old boy to death and severely injured two others today in China's latest random 'slasher' attack. The man slashed the three children with a knife while they were walking home from school for a noon break in Luojia village. A suspect who was released from jail in April attacked the children in the eastern province of Jiangxi and then fled to a nearby mountain, the official Xinhua news agency reported. An eight-year-old boy was slashed to death and two classmates injured in the latest violent attack on China's children. Picture posed by models . 'They were almost home when it happened,' said Han Li, a propaganda official for Yiyang county in the southeastern province of Jiangxi. He added police were searching for the man, but the motive for the attack was not immediately clear. China has seen many high-profile slashing attacks targeting schools over the past ten years by culprits often identified as being mentally ill or angry at society. In September, a man fatally stabbed four children as they were walking to their elementary school in the southern province of Guangxi. The man was later found having killed himself, media reports said. A spokesman said police are searching for the suspect, whose motive remains unclear . Also in September, a 40-year-old man stabbed students and teachers with a fruit knife at an elementary school in the central province of Hubei, killing three children and injuring six other people before jumping to his death. And in May 2010, an attacker hacked seven children and one teacher to death and wounded 20 other people in a rampage at a kindergarten in northwest China. At the time, it was the fifth in a string of savage assaults at the country's schools in the space of just three months. Many of the attacks have been carried out by adults with no connection to the schools, with authorities saying the assailants suffered from mental illness or were lashing out at society because of some personal grievance. These attacks have prompted waves of tightened security but little in the way of lasting policy changes. Some cities including Beijing require ID and registration for the purchase of some kinds of knives. Several communities have temporarily stepped up security in response to the latest murders, including the confiscation of knives at the gates of school compounds and in the surrounding community. Many schoolchildren are also now receiving self-defence training.","The man attacked three children as they were walking home from school .

"Johnny Cash's 44-year-old son was arrested in Newfoundland, Canada on Monday after stripping nude in an airport terminal while waiting to catch a flight home. John Carter Cash, the only son of the country music legend and his second wife June Carter, was returning home to Tennessee from a hunting trip when the incident happened Monday afternoon. Police were called to Deer Lake airport around 2:10pm for reports of a man taking his clothes off in the terminal. Scroll down for video . Country music prince: John Carter Cash (left), son of country-music legend Johnny Cash (right), was arrested Monday at an airport in Canada after stripping off his clothes in the terminal . By the time local authorities arrived at the scene, security had convinced Cash to put his clothes back on and ascertained that he was inebriated. Cash was held in police custody until he was sober, missing his flight. He was rebooked on another flight and scheduled to return home Tuesday morning. Police arrested Cash for disturbing the peace and public intoxication, but reportedly will not press formal charges since Cash was cooperative and has no previous criminal record. Security said few people actually witnessed the event. Family history: Police in Newfoundland held Cash until he was sober, and decided not to charge him since he had no prior record. Pictured above in 1971 at London's Heathrow airport with his father (right)  and mother June Carter (left) Cash's arrest is an unfortunate case of history repeating, since his father also struggled with alcohol abuse. The country star was in and out of rehab for most of his career. His last stint in rehab was in 1992 at a center in Loma Linda, California. Several months later, his son followed him to the facility for treatment as well. Johnny Cash died in 2003, just four months after the death of wife June. The two met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955, and were married 13 years later in 1968. When they first met, Cash was married to Vivian Liberto, with whom he had four daughters. The couple divorced in 1966, with Liberto citing Cash's drug and alcohol abuse as a major factor in their split - as well as his close relationship with June. Two years after tying the knot, Johnny and June had only-son John. John Carter Cash works as a record producer in Nashville. Following in his father's footsteps: Cash works as a record producer in Nashville, and he also performs his own music.

"Ed Miliband has been warned he faces ‘catastrophe’ at the next election if Labour continues to haemorrhage support in Scotland to the nationalists. Senior party figures believe as many as 15 of its 41 seats north of the border are at risk – putting Labour’s hopes of victory at Westminster in May under threat. One former Scottish first minister said that, just weeks on from helping to win the independence referendum, Labour risked ‘snatching defeat from the jaws of victory’. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband has been warned the collapse of the party in Scotland could scupper his hopes of becoming Prime Minister in May next year . The warnings came in the wake of Johann Lamont’s resignation as Scottish Labour leader late on Friday night. She accused Mr Miliband of treating Scottish Labour like a ‘branch office’ and dubbed some Labour MPs ‘dinosaurs’. Two new polls, covering the whole of Britain, showed that both Labour and the Tories were tied on 33 per cent of the vote, with just over six months to go before the next election. Labour has traditionally relied on the near-certainly of a large number of seats in Scotland to help it on the way to general election success. But the SNP, resurgent despite losing the referendum, is threatening to take a large number of their seats. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond accused Mr Miliband of being responsible for the ‘meltdown’ of Scottish Labour. Former Labour first minister, Henry McLeish, told The Sunday Times that Mr Miliband had ‘not got a clue about the realities of Scottish politics’. ‘What we’ve got is a situation after a decade that labour is still in denial in the UK and if there’s any hiccup in the number of MPs we sent to Westminster in 2015 this could be catastrophic for Ed Miliband’s effort to become prime minister,’ he said. He questioned whether Labour could ‘survive as a social democratic party in the modern age’. ‘Electors are unwilling to vote the same way as previous generations,’ he said. ‘The power of Labour is diminishing and will continue to do so.’ Johan Lamont quit as Scottish Labour leader yesterday, accusing Mr Miliband of treating the party north of the border like a ‘branch office’ and describing some Labour MPs as ‘dinosaurs’ Miss Lamont has said the final straw came when the UK party sacked the Scottish Labour general secretary, Ian Price, last week without consulting her. Jack McConnell, another Labour ex-first minister of Scotland, said the issue of authority between the Scottish and UK Labour parties needed to be sorted out once and for all. ‘[The referendum victory] should have been an amazing opportunity for Scottish Labour to set out its vision and values for Scotland,’ said Lord McConnell. ‘We are in serious danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of that victory and it really is time for all of those in positions of responsibility to get a grip, to sort out this issue of authority once and for all. ‘And then for us to have a debate and the election of a new leader who can take us forward, not thinking about the internal workings of the Labour party, but with a vision to be First Minister of Scotland and help change this country for the better.’ Scottish Labour's executive committee met today to discuss the process and timetable for selecting a new leader. Among those tipped for the leadership are Jim Murphy and interim leader Anas Sarwar. Gordon Brown has also been linked to the role but reports have suggested the former Prime Minister has ruled himself out of the running. A new group of Labour activists want the party north of the border to make radical changes, such as changing the name to the Independent Labour Party and becoming fully autonomous from Labour's London leadership. The Labour for Scotland group also supports Holyrood being given full control over income tax as well as complete responsibility for welfare - a position which goes further than Labour's existing plans for further devolution.","Senior Labour figures think 15 out of 41 seats in Scotland are now at risk .

"Actress Daniele Watts, who played the slave CoCo in Django Unchained, and her boyfriend have formally been charged with lewd conduct, one month after claiming Los Angeles Police racially profiled her and cuffed her because she is black. Watts maintains that she and boyfriend Brian James Lucas were only kissing in her car, parked outside the CBS Studio Center, when police approached them on September 4. However, witnesses told police that the two were having sex in public and the LAPD stepped in to investigate the claims. Scroll down for video . Charged: Actress Daniele Watts (right) and boyfriend Brian James Lucas have been charged with lewd conduct after a witness called police last month to report them having sex in a parked car . Watts maintains that she and her boyfriend were only kissing. A witness snapped this picture of the couple before police broke up the public display of affection . Watts was cuffed when she refused to show a responding officer her identification. She was later released without charge. An arraignment is scheduled for November 13, and if convicted of the misdemeanor the two could face a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Her boyfriend took a picture of her crying after her arrest, and it quickly went viral. While civil rights activists initially rallied around the actress, she is not being asked to apologize after the LAPD viciously denied that any racial profiling happened in the incident. Sobbing: Lucas posted a picture of his girlfriend to Facebook. She claimed the LAPD had racially profiled her but it has since been revealed that her arresting officers were minorities . They backed that claim by releasing an audio recording of the arrest in which officers struggle to explain the arrest to a hysterical Watts. 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me,' she says through tears. 'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' Allegations: Watts is perhaps best known for her small role in Django Unchained, playing a slave called Coco. She also posted the picture on the right to Facebook, claiming she was injured in the arrest . Watts' claims were not taken well by the responding officers, which included a woman and a hispanic. Sgt Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the force, who is openly gay, was another one of the responding officers, and says she picked the wrong group to allege profiling. 'How funny it is. She kind of didn’t really get the right mix there. It’s quite comical.' 'It’s a new generation. It’s not about who you are or what religion you are or what color you are, it's about who you are and what you do in uniform,' he told MailOnline.","Daniele Watts and boyfriend Brian James Lucas have each been charged with one count of lewd conduct, a misdemeanor .

"At  the end the scoreboard said the difference was only three points. In reality, the gulf in class between these two teams was seismic. England huffed, puffed and attempted to blow down the New Zealand wall but ultimately the world champions had too much nous, too much power and too much quality. And in Richie McCaw they had one of the greatest players ever to have picked up a rugby ball. The 33-year-old open side won his head-to-head with England captain Chris Robshaw by a distance and showed yet again the value of having a genuine scavenging No 7 in the pack. England simply had no answer. England lost 24-21 against New Zealand at a rain-soaked Twickenham after an impressive second half from the All Blacks on Saturday .

Replacements: Keven Mealamu, Ben Franks, Charlie Faumuina, Patrick Tuipulotu, Liam Messam, TJ Perenara, Beauden Barrett, Ryan Crotty . Referee: Nigel Owens (WAL) In truth, New Zealand could have won this game by 15 points as they dominated the second half after England had given the record 82,223 crowd hope with a high-octane display to lead 14-11 at the break. But, with McCaw — one of three New Zealand try scorers — playing so low to the ground he was practically in it, the All Blacks won the all-important breakdown battle and with it the match. Once or twice the All Black skipper, winning his 135th cap, fell foul of referee Nigel Owens. But more often than not his hands did enough to slow down England’s ball or turn it over. One piece of second-half larceny following a charge by Billy Vunipola enabled fly half Aaron Cruden to scuttle up-field before punting the ball away for a gain of fully 80 metres. Even with hooker Dane Coles in the sin bin following a petulant kick at opposite man Dylan Hartley, the All Blacks continued to play with calm authority. Almost every decision they took in the second half proved correct. By contrast, England kicked poorly and failed to gain the territory they craved. With the industrious Kyle Eastmond at inside centre, England lacked a second kicking option alongside Owen Farrell. Well as Eastmond played in marshalling the hulking Sonny Bill Williams, England will surely consider playing Farrell at 12 alongside George Ford next week against South Africa. Coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘The weather turned and New Zealand maximised that opportunity well. When the hooker was in the sin bin they managed that opportunity well, too. ‘We couldn’t get enough territory in the second half to get close. But we don’t think we’re too far away. ‘We had New Zealand on the ropes but we didn’t finish them off.’ England will put a brave face on this. They have to because they still have three QBE internationals to play this autumn. But there will be serious concern about their continued failure to put chances away, despite Jonny May’s wonderful early try, which will live long in the memory.

The England team gather together to celebrate the opening try against the All Blacks, though the conversion was missed afterwards . The Gloucester winger, without a try in his previous seven internationals, received a wonderfully weighted pass from the excellent Brad Barritt and glided past Conrad Smith with astonishing ease before taking the outside line after being offered it by Israel Dagg. The try, finished from 40 metres, provided hope for a repeat of the stunning triumph over the same opponents two years ago. But it was not to be. The All Blacks have lost only twice since lifting the Webb Ellis trophy three years ago and dug deep as England blew two gilt-edged chances. First, May gathered a bouncing ball superbly but failed to spot Owen Farrell on his outside as Dagg made a desperate last-gasp tackle before Mike Brown — normally so reliable — dropped a dipping Eastmond pass with the line at his mercy. England failed to stick the knife in when they had the chance. With almost their first foray into England’s half, the visitors crossed when fly half Aaron Cruden touched down. The crowd were incensed that referee Nigel Owens, who endured one of his poorest internationals, declined to go to the Television Match Official. Replays suggested Cruden may have been inches short. ‘We went to the TMO quite a lot of times but not on that occasion, which we probably need to have a chat about at some point,’ said Lancaster. ‘But we’ll focus on our own performance. It was disappointing not to finish off one or two chances.’ New Zealand's Aaron Cruden dives on the  line to score the try that brought the two teams level early in the first half at Twickenham . Cruden of New Zealand takes his kick during the QBE International match  at Twickenham on a soggy Saturday in London . England's Owen Farrell takes a penalty  during their clash with New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon . The inconsistency in referring to the TMO certainly irritated Lancaster’s opposite number Steve Hansen. He was left fuming at the decision to refer Charlie Faumuina’s 72nd-minute try as replacement fly half Beauden Barrett was lining up the conversion following replays on the big screens. ‘The television producers are starting to have an influence on the game,’ said Hansen. ‘If something goes wrong we see a replay 10 times when the referee, touch judge or TMO hasn’t seen it. It’s not in the spirit of the game. The producers are starting to annoy me.’ England began this game with seven injured British Lions missing and fans have every right to ask serious questions about why a showpiece occasion such as this should be devalued by their absence. There is a lot of talk about the demands put on England players but not enough action to provide adequate rest periods. It would be churlish to ignore the positives, however. Dave Attwood — playing because of injury to Joe Launchbury — was outstanding in the second row. New cap George Kruis also impressed after replacing Courtney Lawes when he suffered a nasty head injury 23 minutes into the game. Fijian-born soldier Semesa Rokoduguni barely put a foot wrong out on the right wing on an occasion charged with pageantry a day before Remembrance Sunday. It was just a shame he didn’t see the ball enough as possession dried up and the rain came down in the second half. The diminutive Eastmond marshalled Sonny Bill Williams well, while Brad Barritt was almost faultless. But ultimately, with 11 games left before next year’s World Cup, there appears to be an inescapable gulf in class that looks increasingly hard to bridge. England have much to ponder.

"While not everything that glitters is gold, the sparkling new polish from celebrity manicurist Deborah Lippmann most certainly is. The celebrity nail maestro has created a dazzling new varnish, appropriately named Gold Digger, using flecks of real 24-carat gold. And with famous fans that include Lady Gaga, Lena Dunham, Kelly Clarkson and Sarah Jessica Parker, the luxury lacquer has already secured the A-list seal of approval as well as an A-list price tag. Celebrity favourite: Deborah Lippmann, who paints the nails of Lady Gaga, left, and Kim Kardashian, right, has created a dazzling new varnish, appropriately named Gold Digger, using flecks of real 24-carat gold . The polish, which aims to create a textured manicure, will go on sale for £50 at Selfridges later this month. As well as gold flecks the varnish is packed with green tea extract and biotin and was used by Deborah herself backstage at the SS15 Badgley Mischka show at New York fashion week last month. And this isn't the only Lippmann polish to contain an unexpectedly expensive ingredient: also available are polishes that contain powdered diamonds and crushed pearls. As a result, the brand has become a regular on the fashion circuit with Valentino, Bulgari and Burberry among those to enlist Lippmann for their shows. That's one expensive top coat! The £50 polish aims to create a chunky gold manicure . The manicurist has also created bespoke looks for some of the biggest celebrity names in the business. Most famously, Lippmann did the nails of Reese Witherspoon on the night she took home an Oscar for her part in Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line in 2005. Lippmann has also teamed up with some of her celebrity clients to produce bespoke shades that are available for the rest of us to buy. Among the A-list approved hues are Lara's Theme, a bright orange-coral created with the help of model Lara Stone, and the glamorous deep red Just Walk Away Renee, which was originally made for Renee Zellweger, Sarah Smile for Sarah Jessica Parker, and Bad Romance for Lady Gaga. And Deborah isn't the only beauty buff with a taste for lucrative polish. Shoe designer Christian Louboutin, whose clients include Victoria Beckham, Blake Lively, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian, recently launched his debut nail range complete with 31 varnishes inspired by his famous shoes. The reason the soles of all Louboutin shoes are red is because he 'felt as though something was missing' when he saw his first prototype shoe and decided to paint the bottom with his assistant's red nail varnish. So it was only a matter of time before he unveiled a range of lacquers. The range of polishes will set you back £36 a bottle... but at least that's a fraction of the price of his £600 shoes. Is that practical?

"Film director George Lucas has unveiled plans for his $300m (£187m) art museum... and it wouldn't look out of place on the set of Star Wars. The space-age Lucas Museum of Narrative Art was designed by noted Beijing architect Ma Yansong, who was inspired by the works of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. Expected to open in 2018, it features a floating disc above four levels of exhibition space in 'infinite loops' and an observation deck with 360-degree views of the city and Lake Michigan. Space-age: Plans have been unveiled for the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Chicago . The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art will house pieces from the Star Wars creator's $600m personal collection, including works by Norman Rockwell and Alberto Vargas and props from his ground-breaking movies. The museum will be 'a gathering place to experience narrative art and the evolution of moving images - from illustration to cinema to the digital mediums of the future,' it wrote in a statement on its website. As well as the permanent collection, the museum will host temporary exhibitions as well as educational events. Futuristic: The $300million structure sits on Lake Michigan and features a 'floating disc' above four floors of exhibition space . 'It looks like a nuclear reactor': Reactions to the design have so far been mixed . Yansong's MAD Architects collaborated with Studio Gang from Chicago, who contributed the design for a bridge connection the property to Northerly Island and as well as the landscaping. The building 'explores the relationship between nature and the urban environment,'  MAD Architects said in a statement, adding that it 'is both futuristic and timeless'. 'The Museum is not an isolated object, but a spatial experience that is defined by the people who occupy and interact with it. Its uninterrupted stone surfaces are as primitive as it is futuristic, evoking the great achievements of architectural history. The museum will show works from Lucas' collection. It's designed by MAD Architects, the firm behind Toronto's Absolute Towers (R) 'It is a place to discover and explore, to communicate and contemplate. More than a building, it is an urban vista for social interaction, bringing people closer to each other and to nature.' Chicago residents have had mixed reactions to the plans. In opinions compiled by the Chicago Tribune, readers compared the structure to Jabba the Hut's desert spaceship, a nuclear power plant, a child's volcano science project, and Space Mountain. The city's mayor Rahm Emanuel is standing by the plans, saying in a statement: 'George Lucas has revolutionised the art of storytelling over the last four decades and we are honored to be the recipient of this incredible legacy investment that will allow everyone to learn about and experience narrative arts.'","Lucas Museum of Narrative Art on Lake Michigan set to open in 2018 .

For sale: Queen Victoria's 52 inch waist silk bloomers will go under the hammer on Sunday . Popular: Queen Victoria was one of Britain's longest-reigning monarchs and ruled from 1837 until 1901 . The garments, which are equivalent to a modern size 26, were given to a member of royal staff following Queen Victoria's death and have been passed down through generations of the same family. Due to go under the hammer on the 12th October at the Westernhanger auction house in Kent, auctioneers say that the items are some of the most unusual ever to pass through its doors. 'This is definitely one of the strangest items I have ever had the opportunity to sell in my 40-odd years in the business,' said auctioneer Michael Hogben. 'This really is a once in a blue moon sale'. Intimate though the latest sale is, this is not the first time Queen Victoria's personal belongings have gone under the hammer. In 2011, another pair of royal bloomers - this time dating from the 1860s and boasting a much smaller 35-inch waist - were auctioned off, fetching £9,375 for the anonymous seller. Like the current set, the knee-length knickers were made from fine silk and bore a VR [Victoria Regina] monogram on one leg. Other items of royal memorabilia to go under the hammer in recent years include a piece of her wedding cake and an unused pair of her black silk stockings. Queen Victoria ruled Britain and its Empire from the 20th June 1837 until her death on the 22nd January 1901 and is one of the longest reigning monarchs in British history. Also for sale: The knickers - and a silk chemise with a 66 inch bust - are monogrammed with VR . Pretty: The bloomers, which are expected to fetch up to £2,000, also boast delicate lace detailing . Along with the Queen and the rest of the British royal family, Queen Victoria's descendants include the royal families of Belgium, Norway, Spain and Sweden, as well as the world's only other reigning queen, Queen Margrethe of Denmark. Famously private, Victoria fell into a prolonged period of grief following her husband Prince Albert's death and was rarely seen in public after his demise. Despite her reluctance to engage with her subjects, under Victoria's reign, the UK went from strength-to-strength, becoming one of the world's most powerful countries and ruler of the biggest empire ever to exist. Queens regnant: The world's only two reigning queens, Elizabeth II and Margrethe of Denmark, are related . Part of the family: Descendants also include the British royal heirs as well as those of Belgium and Sweden . Related: King Felipe of Spain is also among the many royal descendants of Queen Victoria .","The 100-year-old silk bloomers have a 52 inch waist and a VR monogram .

"A blonde mother-of-two nicknamed 'Mental Maxine' stabbed her own father with a kitchen knife after starting a huge family row with him over her missing pet Staffordshire bull terrier. Tattooed Maxine Tattersall, 27, from Accrington in Lancashire, turned up at the home of Paul Higgins to pick up her belongings in October last year shouting 'where's my f**king dog' and told him 'if you stop me I will chop you up' before lunging at him with an eight-inch blade. As family friends looked on in horror, Mr Higgins managed to throw his arms up in self-defence in order to protect himself and luckily managed to escape with just cuts to his hands. 'Mental Maxine' Tattersall (pictured left) lunged at her father Paul Higgins (right) with a knife during a row . A court heard shortly before the attack in October last year Tattersall had been staying intermittently with her father, but had decided to go the house with her boyfriend to collect her belongings - including her pet dog . Tattersall,  who has previous convictions for violence and a problem with binge drinking, goes by the name of 'Mental Maxine' on Facebook and has posted a variety of pictures showing off her star facial tattoos. Preston Crown Court heard in the lead up to the attack in October last year Tattersall had been staying intermittently with her father, but had decided to go the house with her boyfriend to collect her things and move out. Michael Goldwater QC, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant is the owner of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which the father had last seen five days earlier. Mother-of-two Tattersall, who has facial tattoos, pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm but managed to escape a prison sentence . 'On October 19 at 5.45pm she said she was coming to the property to collect her belongings. She arrived at 6pm. 'Virtually the first thing she said was ""where's my dog?"" Paul Higgins said he didn't have it. 'She was accompanied by her boyfriend, Mark Gallagher, who Mr Higgins did not get on with so he ordered him out of the house.' The court heard Tattersall began picking up her belongings, instructing Mr Gallagher to put them into a waiting taxi. Mr Goldwater said: 'Paul Higgins' account is she had a kitchen knife, which was eight inches long. 'She asked him ""where's my f**king dog"" and said she would take another dog from the house if she did not get hers. 'She also said ""if you stop me I will chop you up"" and held the knife 18 inches from his face. 'Another occupant said the defendant then attempted to move an injured American Bulldog from the household. 'Mr Higgins tried to get hold [of the dog] and he then saw a raised knife.' 'She turned around and lunged out at Mr Higgins' chest and he put up his hands to protect himself.' The court heard Mr Higgins suffered two cuts to his hands.. Mr Goldwater said: 'The injury was administered by the defendant wielding the knife. There were two cuts, one between the thumb and forefinger and one at the base of the palm near the wrist. He didn't attend hospital and didn't need medical treatment.' Maxine Tattersall pictured outside court - she threatened to 'chop' her father up before attacking him . Tattersall has four previous convictions - assault occasioning actual body harm, criminal damage and possession of a weapon. She had previously been given a suspended jail term. In mitigation defence barrister Paul McDonald said his client was changing her ways for the sake of her children, who live with relatives. The court heard Tattersall  is 'curbing her drinking' and is anxious to put the attack behind her . Paul Higgins (pictured outside court) was lucky to escape the attack by his daughter with just cuts to his hands . The row began when Tattersall demanded to see her Staffordshire Bull Terrier, similar to this one (pictured) Tattersall was given 30 weeks in prison suspended for two years and was placed under a supervision order . He said: 'It's clear that she had possession of the knife, clear that her father was injured. There is clearly animosity.' He said Tattersall was 'curbing her drinking' and was seeking counselling and was anxious to put the attack behind her. Recorder Peter Atherton, said: 'It seems that you have had an addiction or addictions to drugs and or alcohol which have undoubtedly influenced your behaviour. 'It's not clear whether you were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at this time. 'But in terms of your behaviour, drugs and alcohol had clearly been a factor to cause you to behave the way you have.' Despite admitting assault occasioning actual body harm, Tattersall has avoided a prison sentence. She was given 30 weeks in prison suspended for two years and was placed under a supervision order for 24 months. She must also pay a £100 victim surcharge.","Maxine Tattersall, 27,  started the argument over her missing bull terrier .

"A family plagued by thousands of maggots falling into their kitchen were horrified to discover that the source was a body which had been decomposing in the flat upstairs for a month. Karen Davy was baffled when the bugs began dropping from the ceiling of her home in East Dulwich, south London - and called in police who broke into the flat upstairs and found a decaying body. The housewife, who shares the flat . with her teacher husband Tayo, 40, and their children Naledi, 15, Caira, . 11, Micah, ten, and Ayanda, nine, said it has now become overrun with the . maggots and flies. Shocked: Mother-of-four Karen Davy, 37, with some of the maggots which fell into her kitchen in East Dulwich, south London, after a man's body began decomposing in the flat above . Problem: The pipes in her kitchen (left) where maggots (right) were getting in after a body began decomposing . Mother-of-four Mrs Davy, 37, said: ‘I can’t even sleep at night. I have been sitting up waiting for . them to appear, and then frantically cleaning with a bucket of bleach . when they do. ‘The kids are . traumatised. The younger ones are frightened to go into the kitchen. I’m . disgusted by the maggots, but more traumatised by what happened to my . neighbour. ‘The . housing group first said they would come round, but then said it was . nothing to do with them - it was only when I got the police involved we . found the problem. ‘And they . still haven’t sorted it. We’ve blocked the hole ourselves, but they are . still finding a way in. Now they are starting to turn into flies, and . the council still haven’t cleaned out his flat. It’s disgusting.’ The . family first noticed a few maggots on September 17 but returned from a . meal two days later to find hundreds in their kitchen. Mrs Davy called Southern Housing - one . of the country’s largest housing associations - and after days of . making calls, claimed they failed to take action. Maggot problem: Mrs Davy, 37, was baffled when the bugs began dropping from the ceiling in her flat . After several sleepless nights, she began . asking neighbours if they were suffering similar problems, and with the . help of a caretaker peered into the flat above. She said: ‘We looked through . the window, and I’ve never seen anything like it. There were flies . coming out of the window above my head, and then were was a breeze of . air from inside and the smell was horrendous. I almost threw up. I . called the police straight away.’ 'The . kids are traumatised. The younger ones are frightened to go into the . kitchen. I’m disgusted by the maggots, but more traumatised by what . happened to my neighbour' Karen Davy . Police broke into the property and discovered the body of ex-Gulf War soldier Richard Williams, 49, on September 22. And, a week after the body was found, Mrs Davy claims Southern Housing has still not . cleaned the upstairs property. Mr . and Mrs Davy tried to block the hole in the ceiling next to their water . pipe where the maggots had been entering - but they were still getting . in. She added: ‘It’s disgusting. They’ve . removed the body but the council haven’t cleared up. I don’t know how . much longer we can go on like this. I can’t even spray an insecticide . because of my daughter’s asthma and I’m fed up.’ A Southern Housing spokesman admitted . it had not been able to clean the flat above because of the police . probe. The firm has now carried out pest control treatment in Mrs Davy’s . flat. House: Mrs Davy's flat (with the yellow wall) and the home above it where her neighbour's body was found . Regional operations . manager Stephen Lee said: ‘Southern Housing Group would like to . apologise for any distress that has been caused to Ms Davy by the . maggots coming into her flat from upstairs. ‘We . have carried out a treatment for maggots in Ms Davy’s flat but . unfortunately, due to the ongoing police investigation in the flat . above, we have not been able to enter the premises above. 'We looked through the window, and I’ve never seen anything like it. There were flies coming out of the window above my head' Karen Davy . ‘As soon as we are given the all clear from the police we will be able to send in our pest control contractors to address the issue. We are continuing to work with the police to resolve this issue as soon as possible.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police were called to an address in SE22 at 11.44am on September 22 after concerns for the welfare of a man. ‘A body was found at the address which has not yet been formally identified, but which police believe it to be the registered occupant, a 49-year-old man. ‘A post-mortem was conducted at Greenwich Mortuary on September 26. No cause of death has been determined at this time and further tests are being conducted. ‘Whilst police do not have an exact time of death, the man had not been seen for a number of weeks.

"The father of a missing south London girl who is feared to have travelled to Syria has made a desperate plea for her to come home. Abdirashiid Dirie, from Stockwell, has urged his 17-year-old daughter Samya to return, saying 'nobody's against you'. The college student is believed to have flown out of Heathrow airport with 15-year-old Bristol girl Yusra Hussien nearly two weeks ago. Yusra Hussien, 15, (pictured above) is though to have fled to Syria with London teenager Samya Dirie, 17, whose father has now appealed for her to return home . Safiya Hussien (centre), Yusra's mother, spoke at a press conference with the girl's aunt's Sucdis Ali (left) and Ikram Mohamed, last week . Mr Dirie said: 'What I'm saying, as a dad, come back. Nobody's against you. It is not true, nobody's going to arrest you. 'You're a young girl and they know that. The police also know that, they've even said that in the newspaper. You haven't committed any crime. 'Come back safely. That place (Syria) is not good for you. You can carry on your education. I want you to come back, as a father. 'You are after paradise by going there, but you will achieve paradise by pleasing your parents.' He told BBC News he believes she met the Bristol teenager on the internet and must have been influenced by extremists online. The police say they want the teenagers to come home and this case is about missing young girls, not a crime. Miss Dirie, a student from south London, disappeared after telling her parents she was going on an early morning trip to a university with her college. They then discovered that her passport and money was missing and now believe that she is too scared to come home. Miss Dirie called a cousin a few days ago, possibly from Turkey, and said she is safe. Mr . Dirie said: 'She told her she is somewhere far away, and she did not . say where she is, she also said she was afraid of the police if she . comes back.' It is feared the teenage girls may have joined ISIS extremists in Syria (pictured) after being radicalised online . It is believed Samya Dirie and Yusra Hussien flew to Istanbul, Turkey (pictured) before going on to Syria . Her mother, Sahra, said: 'The police are doing all they can to find her. She's a lovely girl. We just hope they can find her.' A . family friend added: 'The whole family is very shaken up. She's an . educated girl and she didn't even go out much in Britain so they cannot . understand why she has gone to Syria. 'They had no idea she was interested in Syria or Jihad. She was happy to be in Britain and wants to be a lawyer.' The mother of fellow runaway Yusra broke down in tears in an emotional press conference last week as she begged her daughter - who has not been seen since she leaving her family home for school on September 24 - to come home. She said: 'Yusra, I am your mum, I love you. Please, please, please, we miss you, come back. 'I love you so much. All your brothers and your sister miss you so, so much. The house is not the same.' Family friends previously said they believed Yusra, who wears a hijab as part of her faith, had become radicalised on chat rooms and forums online. It is not yet clear how she met 17-year-old Miss Dirie. Yusra's parents have stressed that nothing has been proven about their daughter's beliefs.","17-year-old college student from South London disappeared two weeks ago .

"The Virgin Galactic spacecraft crash which killed one pilot and left another seriously injured was 'inevitable' as the rocket  was 'crude' and 'unreliable', Richard Branson's biographer has claimed. Tom Bower said the Virgin boss's bold plans for a space tourism company were always going to end in tragedy and claimed  engineers told him the project was 'very dangerous'. He said numerous engineers have walked out of the factory in recent months, with one reportedly saying he would never work there again. The writer, who penned Branson Behind The Mask, said the project has been plagued with problems since an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded in 2007, killing three workers. Scroll down for video . The Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo plane crash was 'inevitable', Richard Branson's biographer has claimed . Tom Bower said the Virgin boss's bold plans for a space tourism company were always going to end in tragedy as they were 'dangerous' Designed to run the first ever passenger flights into space, the SpaceShipTwo plane, split into pieces and fell to earth minutes after being launched from a carrier plane over California's Mojave Desert. Wreckage rained from the sky yesterday as one pilot was ejected from the cockpit using a parachute, while the other was reportedly left strapped to his seat as he plummeted to earth and died. It was the spacecraft's first test flight and was loaded with an experimental new rocket fuel. 'What happened yesterday was very sad for the pilot obviously but it was predictable and inevitable and has never been a secret,' Mr Bower told Radio 4's Today programme. Biographer Tom Bower (right) said Branson's bold plans for a space tourism company were always going to end in tragedy as they were 'dangerous' 'It's a very crude rocket. It uses a gas called nitrous oxide burning solid rubber and it has been formed out of a completely different craft. 'All the engineers in California working on the project I've spoken to said it was very dangerous, just a few weeks ago the last of many of the Virgin Galactic engineers walked out of the factory and said he'd never work there again.' The first disaster in the fuel history of Virgin Galactic came in 2007, when an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded, killing three employees. The blast, at an outdoor test facility belonging to partner company Scaled Composites, killed employees Todd Ivens, Eric Blackwell and Charles May, who were watching the test from behind a chain link fence. The rocket engine, using a new plastic-based polyamide fuel, can be seen starting to fire, right, as SpaceShipTwo streaks away from the carrier . Pilots: It is not known who is was killed today. Rick 'CJ' Struckow (far left) is fine, a family friend told MailOnline. Another, Todd Ericson (not pictured) was confirmed alive by a relative on social media. The conditions of Peter Siebold (center right, arms folded), Michael Masucci and chief pilot David Mackay are not known . Mr Bower said: 'The most important issue was in 2007 - three engineers were killed in an explosion when a rocket exploded on the ground rocket explosion on the ground. 'Ever since then it has become apparent that the science used to create this rocket is completely unreliable.' Mr Branson has pledged to keep up the drive for space travel, saying on the company's web site: 'Space is hard - but worth it. We will persevere and move forward together.' Virgin has not yet said who the pilots were - though only four men were cleared by the FAA to pilot the craft. Rick 'CJ' Sturckow was one of the pilots flying the WhiteKnightTwo launching craft, MailOnline can reveal - and so would have been with the killed pilot - still unnamed - minutes before the disaster. Mr Branson has pledged to keep up the drive for space travel, saying on the company's web site: 'Space is hard - but worth it' How the plane climbed tens of thousands of feet before exploding and plummeting to earth . Mr Branson's biographer said the businessman has placed so much of his commercial future on the space mission as it was such a great PR stunt. 'All over the world he appeared and brandished the Virgin label and used rocket as an example. Then he collected a load of celebrities to pay a quarter of £250,000 each for a ticket.' Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry all signed up for the two-and-a-half hour voyage with six minutes of weightlessness. In a press conference Friday afternoon, George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said; 'Our primary thoughts at the moment are with the crew and families and we are doing everything we can for them now.' 'Space is hard, and today was a tough day. The future rest on hard days like this.' Stuart Witt, who is in charge of the Mojave Air and Space Port, where SpaceShipTwo was launched today, also remained optimistic about the future of space travel. He said: 'Stay the course. This is not easy. If it was easy it would not be interesting to me and my colleagues standing next to me.' 'We are doing this for you and your generation. It is a cause far greater than any one of us singularly. I compare it to the Magellan expedition [the first circumnavigation of the Earth].' In January 2014, Mr Bower said 'Virgin Galactic is in danger of turning into a white elephant'. He added that Branson had so far only managed to 'fire a primitive rocket for 20 seconds in the Earth's atmosphere'. MailOnline has contacted Virgin Galactic for a comment and have not yet received a response.","Biographer said Branson's bold plans  were always going to end in tragedy .

"It would certainly be a test of even the most faithful's devotion. At 2,500 feet, Ethiopa's 'church in the sky' is arguably the most inaccessible place of worship on earth, perched on top of a vertical spire of rock, with sheer, 650 feet drops on all sides. To reach the extraordinary church on a clifftop in Tigray, one must scale a sheer 19 feet-high wall of rock without any climbing ropes or harnesses, inching along narrow ledges and crossing a rickety makeshift bridge. Scroll down for video . Church in the sky: A priest at Abuna Yemata Guh, a church 2,500 feet high on a clifftop in northern Ethiopia . Beautiful: The church was quarried from the rock on the mountain in 5th century AD by Egyptian priest Father Yemata . And people are willing to risk the ascent: Families have brought their newborn babies up here to be baptised, and corpses have been carried up to be buried on the mountain. It is said that in 5th century AD Egyptian priest Father Yemata walked to Ethiopia, climbed the mountains and quarried the church out of the rock. 'Father Yemata, it seems, liked a dose of extreme sports with his divinity,' writes Lonely Planet Traveller. The magazine features the church, Abuna Yemata Guh, in its new bookazine collating the best and most inspiring destinations visited by the publication. Devoted: Some priests have not left the mountaintop for 30 to 40 years . Test of faith: Families have made the ascent to have babies baptised or to bury the dead . Abuna Yemata Guh has survived for 15 centuries, and in that time 'nobody has fallen' on the way up, according to the current priest Kes Haile Silassie. It is not known what motivated Father Yemata to establish his church here. Theories suggest that he simply wished to pray alone in the clouds, while some say he needed to escape raiders. Photographer Philip Lee Harvey made the astonishing journey to Abuna Yemata Guh in summer 2014. Spectacular scenery: Lonely Planet Traveller writer Oliver Smith made the journey, and recalls views of 'vast, Old Testament landscapes' Ancient traditions: Ethiopia is home to some of the world's oldest strands of Christianity . In a video posted on YouTube, the 44-year-old can be seen bracing himself against the rock  as a fierce wind buffets him. 'It keeps you cool, but adds to my nervousness,' he says, gripping the toe-holds. Despite coming prepared with specialty rock-climbing footwear, Harvey's guide tells him the ascent is best made barefoot. 'It's easily the most inaccessible place I've ever been asked to photograph,' the photographer says. 'It was easier getting to Antarctica.' 'It's the most extraordinary place I've ever been.' Inside, frescoes on the roof and walls depict angels and apostles, while candle wax puddles on the floor. Some of the priests at the church have not been down the mountain in 30 or 40 years. Lonely Planet reporter Oliver Smith tells of his own experience climbing to the church in the sky in the bookazine.  'I begin the walk up to Yemata Guh, and views of vast, Old Testament landscapes unfurl to the horizon. 'Cloud shadows shift across the farmland, and shepherds guide flocks over the stony soil,' he writes. 'The adrenaline rush of the climb makes stepping inside the church all the more sublime, your pulse slowing and eyes adjusting to the darkness, watching angels and archangels emerging from the shadows. 'It is a place of the utmost sanctity and tranquillity. That is, but for one small consideration – taking just three paces outside that same timber door means certain death.' Ethiopia is home to some of the world's oldest strands of Christianity - a tradition that traces its origins to the time of the Old Testament.

"The United States has asked Australia to step up its efforts in the global fight to stop Ebola, which has so far claimed 5,000 lives. Washington has asked the Abbott government to build three field hospitals in West Africa and to send at least 100 doctors and support workers to staff them, reports Fairfax media. The Abbott government has been reluctant to send Australian medics to the region to date, citing a lack of appropriate treatment facilities and evacuation arrangements for Australians who might contract the virus. It is understood Washington has requested on Thursday that Australia also contribute an extra $30 million to the United Nations Ebola fund  and that it provide helicopters for evacuations, ground vehicles, emergency communications equipment and logistics support. Washington has asked Australia to build three field hospitals in West Africa and to send at least 100 doctors and support workers to staff them . Amidst criticism for being too slow to respond to the epidemic this week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament:  'I certainly do not rule out Australia doing more.' A spokesman for Mr Abbott said Friday that the government was 'continuing to discuss with our friends and partners, including the USA and the UK, our response to addressing the situation in West Africa.' Australia has contributed about $18 million towards the crisis so far. But the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, has this week hit out at nations that she says are not pulling their weight in the fight against Ebola. 'This is a crisis that is so vast, with needs so great, with potential consequences so dire that no country can afford to stand on the sidelines. A few are doing a lot. But a lot are doing very little, or nothing at all,' said Ms Power  after a tour of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea this week. The Abbott government has been reluctant to send Australian medics to the continent to date, citing a lack of appropriate treatment facilities and evacuation arrangements for Australians . The US-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has called the Ebola epidemic the 'largest in history': It has so far infected 14,000 people and killed about 5,000, with the number of cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone doubling every 20 days. Critics of the Abbott government's handling of the crisis say news that a new US-managed field hospital for international health staff in Liberia is just days from opening, means Australia has 'no more excuses.' 'Now we know there are treatment centres being built we should send people because many health workers are ready and willing to go,' says president of the Australian Medical Association, Brian Owler, who has been urging the government to ramp up its response for weeks. Deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek, who met with senior US government officials this week to discuss the global response to the outbreak, says Australia must act immediately. 'If the Abbott government is serious about helping to get this crisis under control, there isn't a moment to lose – it must immediately act on requests from our international partners to step up and do more,' said Ms Plibersek. Fairfax reports that Washington has also offered to train Australians at a US Defence facility in Monrovia, Liberia and through its health agency, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. Washington has reportedly offered to train Australians at a US Defence facility in Monrovia, Liberia . According to Labor health spokeswoman Catherine King, division within cabinet was the reason behind the government's inaction, despite public support. A Morgan Poll this week showed 70 per cent of Australians support the sending of health workers to West Africa. Last week, Ethiopia announced it will send 200 health professionals to West Africa and Nigeria has committed 600 health staff. Cuba has already deployed 256 doctors across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and China announced on Friday that it would send 480 medical staff and build a 100-bed treatment centre in Liberia.","Washington asks Australia to send 100 doctors and build hospitals in West Africa .

But since giving birth to baby North, the 33-year-old has been pictured increasingly in a range of outfits that barely cover her ample chest. This summer, Kim has made sure that all eyes were on her at a number of red carpet events. In August, she attended the MTV Music Video Awards in a mini dress that appeared to defy gravity, ensuring she attracted just as much attention from the photographers and TV cameramen as bona fide music stars like Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.

Three and a half months later she was out partying in Paris with a dress that exposed more than half of her post-pregnancy chest. On October 1, 2013, Kim wore a dress designed especially by Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci as she accompanied him to the premiere of Mademoiselle C on the Champs Elysees.

"The official start of the tourist season landed with a cold, wet thud across parts of Upstate New York and New England this weekend, thanks to a freak snowstorm and unseasonably cold temperatures. But, at least one business in the region is celebrating the bizarre weather. Whiteface Lake Placid ski resort in Wilmington, New York, reported nearly three feet of snow on Sunday. The ski resort posted remarkable pictures on its Twitter page showing employees in a heavy winter coats and four-wheel drive trucks frolicking in massive snow drifts. This is May?! Whiteface Mountain in Upstate New York reported 34 inches of snowfall on Sunday - a bizarre record . Four-wheel drive: Heavy trucks were needed to plow out roads and power through the massive drifts . Knee-deep: An employee stands up to his knees in snow that fell Sunday on Whiteface Mountain in Wilmington, New York . The resort sits atop Whiteface Mountain, one of the highest peaks in the Adirondack Mountains. Even given the elevation of the mountain, the 34 inches of snow in late May was a remarkable sight. Communities at higher elevations in Vermont, New Hampshire, Upstate New York and northwest Maine all reported snowfall on Sunday. Most of the snow was little more than a dusting of large wet flakes. Above 2,800 feet of elevation, though, the snow was more substantial. Confused residents took to Twitter to bemoan the wintry weather. Snowflakes were confined to the higher summits of northern New England but the chilly weather lingered all day as cloud cover and rain kept highs in the 40s and 50s from New England to northeastern New York. However, the long weekend will conclude with drier conditions and temperatures returning closer to average so those who like to kick-off the beach season on Memorial Day may still get the chance.

Herring, 50, who spent the day volunteering at a fitness contest at the . AT&T Center, said participants complained of three-hour drives . across town. Crazy weather: Radar estimates of up to 9 inches of rain were recorded in an area between downtown San Antonio and Leon Valley over to Hollywood Park, according to the NWS . Flash flooding: Massive flooding was reported on Saturday across South Texas as emergency crews scrambled to rescue residents in flood prone areas . In the city, even a municipal bus was swept away, but firefighters on a boat were able to pluck the three passengers and driver to safety, public transit spokeswoman Priscilla Ingle said. Nobody was injured. The San Antonio International Airport by Saturday afternoon had recorded 9.87 inches of rain since midnight, causing nearly all streams and rivers to experience extraordinary flooding. The highest amount of rainfall recorded since midnight was 15.5 inches at Olmos Creek at Dresden Drive. The San Antonio River about 20 miles southeast of the city, near Elmendorf, was expected to peak at 62 feet by Sunday morning, well above the flood stage of 35 feet, the National Weather Service said. The National Weather Service compared the flooding to the storm of October 1998, when 30 inches of rain fell in a two-day period. In that flood, the Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins overflowed, leaving more than 30 people dead, according to the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority.","Snow fall in Vermont, Upstate New York, New Hampshire and northwest Maine saw confused residents bemoan the wintry weather on Twitter .

"An ex-marine who endured 214 days in a Mexican prison after accidentally carrying loaded rifles across the U.S. border said he was treated 'like some kind of animal in a cage' and that his ordeal drove him to a suicide attempt. Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, described how spending nearly seven months in the Mexican jail  drove him to try to take his own life with a smashed lightbulb after an escape attempt failed. Speaking to Fox News in his first interview since being released last month, Tahmooressi said prison guards beat him when he was caught trying to break out. They then stripped him naked and left him strapped to the post of a bunk bed in the cold for eight or nine hours. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi was interviewed by Fox News after his October 31 release . He told On The Record host Greta Van Susteren: 'I felt like guards outside were having fun with the whole thing, like they were mocking me outside, making fun of me, so that was hard. So I'm like some kind of animal in a cage here … like I don't even have life in me.' Two or three days later Mr Tahmooressi said he tried to take his own life by breaking a lightbulb over the toilet and stabbing himself in the neck. 'I was looking at these light bulbs as my way out,' he said. But the guards heard  the bulb smash and took Mr Tahmooressi to the prison hospital, where he was given medical treatment and put on a drip. 'I got revived, I came back,' he said. Wrong way: Mr Tahmooressi said he took a wrong turn on a California freeway that funneled him into a Tijuana port of entry with no way to turn back . The retired serviceman spoke exclusively to On The Record host Greta Van Susteren about how his ordeal . Tahmooressi was jailed in March for crossing the border with loaded guns, in a case that led U.S. politicians to bring intense pressure on Mexico to release him. He said he made the decision to try to escape because he became 'extremely afraid' for his life in the prison. 'I was very afraid. I felt like it would be the last night of my life right there, that these guys were going to kill me,' he said. 'That these guys were going to brutally kill me, I was thinking. I built up strength to run away because I thought running away was my only hope to get away from a situation like that.' Tahmooressi described having his arms and legs handcuffed to a bed because he 'wasn't a (well) behaved prisoner'. Mr Tahmooressi (L) talks to U.S. immigration offices at the San Ysidro border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, October 31 . 'I believe they did it because they were afraid of me, afraid that I might do something again and really end up doing something like successfully killing myself or harming somebody and that they would get in trouble for it by not being able to control the situation,' he said. Mr Tahmooressi said  he mistakenly wound up at a border crossing point in Tijuana and accidentally traveled into Mexico . At the time, Tahmooressi had loaded firearms in his truck. The weapons were purchased legally in the U.S., but it is illegal to cross into Mexico with guns. He was initially taken to La Mesa jail where he was put in a cell with 20 other prisoners. Mr Tahmooressi said that as an American he was feeling particularly vulnerable. 'So they see my weakness and I think they started taking advantage of my weakness, just to maybe have fun with me', he added. 'Or maybe they feel threatened by me because I was this odd-out guy, you know, kind of keeping to himself over there.' He was finally freed on the night of October 31 and reunited with his mother, Jill, and then boarded a flight to Florida in San Diego. The retired Marine said that at one point during his captivity he felt a shift in the Mexican corrections officers' attitude toward him. Homecoming: This image taken from a video shows Mr Tahmooressi waving after arriving in Miami, Florida, after his release . Overjoyed: Mr Tahmooressi, 26, is reunited with his mother, Jill, after spending 214 days languishing in a Mexican jail . 'I was thinking, 'Hopefully these guys would be considerate and caring and understanding'… but I started feeling the things just… something shift there. 'They were very helpful and then it shifted, and then I knew this could be bad.' Mr Tahmooressi, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, also revealed that he had been subjected to beatings, but he was unfazed by the violence. 'It was actually joyful to take that beating. I was happy to take that beating. I knew the beating was coming,' he recalled. 'They [fellow inmates] were telling me stories about the guards, about how if someone acts up or does something wrong, they get beat, so already I knew it was going to happen to me, so I was glad as can be to take that beating. Mr Tahmooressi, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, had tried to kill himself while in jail . The former Marine (center) is pictured last week at the airport with his mother (far left) and former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson (second left) 'I was like, bring it, just bring it on.' When asked by Greta Van Susteren why he had the firearms in the vehicle when he crossed the border Mr Tahmooressi replied: 'Because I like guns,' 'I enjoy guns, he added. 'You know, I grew up liking guns [...] It's like, you're stressed out and some people go and smoke a cigarette but some people go to the gun range and go shoot their gun and relieve some stress.' Mr Tahmooressi's detention brought calls for his freedom from US politicians, veterans groups and social media campaigns. A US congressional committee held a hearing on the case. In Mexico, possession of weapons restricted for use by the Army is a federal crime, and the country has been tightening up its border checks to stop the flow of US weapons that have been used by drug cartels. Mr Tahmooressi said he was beaten in jail by the guards, but he was glad to take the beating . In his truck when he crossed the US-Mexico border in March, Mr Tahmooressi was carrying a rifle, shotgun, pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. His attorney, Fernando Benitez, argued that Mr Tahmooressi carries loaded guns with him because his weapons make him feel safer. He added that the veteran is often distracted, which could have contributed to him becoming lost. In his order, a Mexican judge did not make a determination on the illegal arms charges against Mr Tahmooressi but freed him because of his mental state, according to a statement from Mexico's embassy in the US.","Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, attempted suicide after a failed escape bid .

"Unfair: Richard Chapman was dismissed by Malvern Town Council in April this year for giving colleagues tomato plants . A former council clerk has won a compensation payout after he was unfairly sacked from his job - for giving colleagues tomato plants. Richard Chapman was dismissed by Malvern Town Council in April this year after it was claimed the fruity gifts showed favouritism towards some members of staff. But on Thursday an employment tribunal heard that only one worker at the authority had not received a plant. The female employee moaned to council chiefs that the town clerk was favouring other workers by dishing out the tomatoes to everyone but her. She complained to bosses that the plants - brought from Mr Chapman's greenhouse - had been doled out to every other member of staff. He was then accused of bullying, harassment and favouritism and was sacked following an internal investigation which found him guilty of gross misconduct. Mr Chapman launched legal action against the Worcestershire authority - claiming unfair dismissal. An employment tribunal has now ruled in his favour and agreed he was sacked after 12-years of 'unblemished service'. Employment judge Mary Cocks branded the council's investigation 'flawed' following a four day hearing in Birmingham. Mrs Cocks dismissed the authorities claims and revealed that even the town mayor had sabotaged his return to work. She said Cllr Julian Roskams had deliberately put obstacles in the way of Mr Chapman returning to his job following the investigation. She added: 'The council acted outside the bounds of reasonable responses in dismissing Mr Chapman. 'I have rarely heard a case where the unfairness of the dismissal was so apparent to me. 'The investigation by Angela Roberts mushroomed out of control, and the report was woefully inadequate. Complaint: A female employee moaned to council chiefs that the town clerk was favouring other workers by dishing out the tomatoes to everyone but her . 'Councillor Roskams was patently dissatisfied with the findings of the disciplinary panel and put obstacles in the way of Mr Chapman returning to work.' Giving evidence Mr Chapman said he made tomato plants from his garden available to all staff members. His solicitor Richard Hignett slammed the case against him as a 'witch hunt' and labelled the appeal panel that rejected his pleas to return to work a 'kangaroo court'. He said: 'This essentially turned into a witch hunt against my client, because the council failed to control the terms of the investigation.' During the mayor's evidence Mr Hignett told Cllr Roskams: 'You wanted this investigation to be as wide as it needed to be in order to see just how much dirt the investigation could stick on Mr Chapman.' The tribunal also heard the council investigated allegations Mr Chapman had shouted at two staff members. He was also accused of 'bellowing' at another individual in a car park after allegedly falling foul of a car park attendant. The council launched a full investigation into his conduct after a complaint from colleague Deborah Powell. The local authority, which opposed his unfair dismissal claim, alleged he had 'breached the council's bullying and harassment policy..' Mr Chapman was suspended, eventually allowed to return to work, but later dismissed in April. Giving evidence, Mr Chapman said he'd apologised to the two staff members he shouted at in October last year while suffering from stress. He said he was told an official warning would remain on his record for ever, which is in contravention of the ACAS code used by the council. The tribunal decided that dismissal was unfair and ordered the council to pay him an unspecified amount. Speaking after the hearing - which has cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds - Mr Chapman said he was 'relieved' by the ruling. He added: 'It's been a very stressful 12 months and I'm totally drained. 'I shouted at two people when I was wrong and that's all I did. 'I worked with most of the people at the council for 10 years and was very supportive of my staff.'","Richard Chapman dismissed by Malvern Council, Worcestershire, in April .

"It's not just the four inches he gives away in height that has Jason Denayer continually looking up to Vincent Kompany. For any aspiring Belgian centre-half, the Manchester City skipper has long been the industry standard. And, as a team-mate of the player at the Etihad, Denayer knows better than most how high the bar has been set. Yet, while imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Denayer intends to map out his own career mindful of Kompany’s achievements but not transfixed by them. Jason Denayer joins in a training exercise with Belgium team-mates Vincent Kompany and Kevin de Bruyne . Denayer tracks Chelsea forward Eden Hazard after he was called up to the Belgium squad for the first time . ‘Vincent is an inspiration to me but I don’t want to be the same as him,’ said the 19-year-old, who stands at 6ft. ‘He is someone I look to but it’s not that I want to be like him. I want to be myself. ‘I admire the way he plays but I don’t want to be a copy of Kompany. I want to be Jason - not Kompany.’ Denayer had plenty of scope to reacquaint himself with the City captain during the international break. Called into Marc Wilmots’ party for the first time for the game with Andorra, the on-loan Celt spent most of the week with his mouth closed and his ears open. ‘Going away with the Belgian national squad was a great experience for me,’ he added. ‘There are so many players from big clubs and it was great to train with them and learn from them. It was good for me. The 19-year-old speaks to the assembled media ahead of Thursday night's Europa League clash . Denayer was all smiles in training as Celtic prepare to face Astra in the Europa League . ‘I was surprised to get the call-up because it was a really big game. ‘A lot of players helped me when I met up with the squad - Adnan Januzaj, Divock Origi and Kompany were three of them. ‘Vincent spoke to me, made a few jokes with me and the team. It helps that I know the captain of the Belgian team so well. ‘Everybody listens to Vincent. He has the respect of everyone in the country. ‘He gives me a lot of advice but mainly, just to be myself and everything will be okay.’ If Kompany’s advice had included that Denayer targets a push for a first-team slot at City next season, then he was wasting his breath. For all the year’s loan to Celtic is proving invaluable in terms of exposure to first-team football, his heart remains with the English champions. ‘I watched Manchester City play in the Champions League on Tuesday night and I want to be back there next season,’ he stated. ‘But I don’t think about this too much. I prefer to think about the present at Celtic. I want to do well enough here to maybe play there. ‘The loan move has already helped me a lot. I have played first-team football and been called up to the national team. ‘Being at Celtic has given me what I didn’t have at City. Reserve-team football at Man City is good but it’s not the same as playing for a first-team. ‘In Under 21 football, you play against young opponents. At Celtic, I am playing against men. But I still want to go back to England after my loan and try to be a success. That is my priority.’ Before those Champions League ambitions can be realised with his parent club, the rather more mundane matter of the Europa League with Celtic comes into view tonight. Denayer is not alone when he states honestly that he could ink his knowledge of the Romanians on the back of a postage stamp. Yet he’s acutely aware of the significance of taking six points from them over the coming two matches. ‘I don’t know a lot about Astra. Just that they come from Romania,’ he said. ‘It’s very important to win this game. Salzburg are playing against Zagreb and we hope that will be a draw. ‘That would give us a better chance to finish first if we beat Astra. ‘I think we can beat them and give ourselves a chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the Europa League.’ A victory tonight wouldn’t just put Celtic in the box seat for qualification. It would be a much-needed endorsement of Ronny Deila’s regime. Denayer’s partnership with Virgil van Dijk has been one of the few certainties upon which the Norwegian has been able to hang his hit thus far and the Belgian foresees that developing further throughout his season in Glasgow. ‘Virgil is great to play beside,’ he added. ‘He is a very good player and he is relaxed when he speaks to you. ‘How good is he? He can be a very good player. I expect him to play at a high level in England one day. ‘How high? The highest. Playing beside Virgil and Vincent helps my game. They are very good players and speak to me. ‘If I make a mistake, Virgil is there for me. He is good.’","Denayer, 19, is at Celtic on loan from English champions Manchester City .

"A bicycle with wings and a Land Rover that transforms into a hovercraft are just two of the quirky vehicles pictured in a newly-discovered archive of bizarre British inventions. The designs - which seek to defy the laws of physics - are among an dizzying array of weird and wonderful products that have been cataloged by an amateur historian. Businessman Chris Hodge, from Chislehurst, south east London, came across the unusual objects as he trawled through a collection of images spanning the last 100 years. Scroll down for video . Best of British: A Land Rover - one of the hallmarks of the nation's motoring industry - is given an unexpected makeover with a platform that turns it into a hovercraft . Reinventing the bicycle: This bold couple venture out for a ride on a side-by-side tandem, left, while a team of inventors hope wings will lift their cycle into the skies, right . Eccentric: Two men glide over the waves on an unusual amphibious vehicle - just one of the many bizarre British inventions included in Mr Hodge's archive of innovation . Mr Hodge has curated more than 250,000 images and is having them all digitally scanned and archived. The eccentric inventions of years gone by also include what appears to be an early version of a videophone - with a static photograph of the recipient of the call - and an amphibious Lambretta scooter. Other photographs capture a not-so-portable hairdryer, a mini-submarine, a side-by-side tandem bicycle and a motorcyclist's daring back-facing sidecar. The collection, most of which has not been seen for several decades, also features photos of factories, military history, boats, motorsport, and rare trucks and cars. Easyart.com, a website for posters and art prints, has begun to sell a selection of the images from Mr Hodge's Stilltime Collection. Mr Hodge, 56, who has been collecting the images for over a decade, said: 'These images are a captivating snapshot of a bygone era. 'It's wonderful to be able to reveal the often hidden world of our past. Some of these shots are the only record of their kind, showing how even the most simple things were done completely differently.

Daring: In this black-and-white photograph taken from Mr Hodge's collection, a man looks on as a single-seat gyrocopter as it lifts off into the air above a field . 'It's a world of discovery and a unique insight into the way things were.' Gyr King, founding director of Easyart, said the collection is a 'hidden gem of British social history'. He added: 'The vast majority of these images have remained unseen for several decades and shine a light on the extraordinary inventions, machines, people, places and events in Britain's past.' The photos, taken from various British trade and business-to-business media titles including Motorcycle News, Speed & Power Magazine and Nursing Times, document Britons trying to invent the next 'big thing'. The 20 tonnes of original material is currently in a specially built, air-conditioned and atmospherically controlled containment unit in Greenwich, London. Going under?

"You cannot judge a book by its cover, the old saying goes. But you might be able to judge someone's personality from the shape of their face, scientists have realised. Men and women with wide faces tend to be more aggressive, dominant and angry, according to British research. Men and women with wide faces tend to be more aggressive, dominant and angry, according to British research. Those with broad features - Sylvester Stallone (left) or Sarah Palin (right) - are more likely to have bad tempers and display bouts of verbal or physical aggression . Those with broad features - like Wayne Rooney, Sylvester Stallone or Sarah Palin - are more likely to have bad tempers and display bouts of verbal or physical aggression. Psychologists think the trait is linked to the evolutionary benefit of having thick cheekbones. Those who had more robust facial bones could be more aggressive, because they could better withstand a punch, the scientists suggest. Lead researcher Dr Carmen Lefevre of Leeds University said: 'Those with a higher facial width-to-height ratio are more likely to be more aggressive than those with lower facial width-to-height ratio. Psychologists think the aggressive trait is linked to the evolutionary benefit of having thick cheekbones found in wider faces such as that of footballer Wayne Rooney (pictured). Those who had more robust facial bones could be more aggressive, because they could better withstand a punch, the scientists suggest . 'We are not saying that every single person with wider faces will be more aggressive, but if you take a sample of the two groups, those with wider faces will be slightly more aggressive.' Men with wide faces have been getting a bad reputation lately. Scientists had previously suggested large faces were prone to being more aggressive, untrustworthy and deceitful. But now there may be good news for the likes of Alan Sugar and Wayne Rooney. Researchers in the U.S. claim people with wide faces are more likely to get a bonus compared with their thin-faced rivals . Fuller faced workers earn £1,300 (£2,090) more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus, the study found. However, researchers said this comes with a compromise. Wide faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations. And men who are more attractive are better collaborators compared to less attractive men, they said. Previous research based on the 'facial width-to-height ratio' found individuals behave more selfishly when interacting with men with wider faces. This research claims that while men with wider faces are more likely to lie and cheat, they tend to lead more financially successful firms. 'We negotiate everyday whether we think about it or not,' said University of California's Professor Michael Haselhuhn. 'It’s not just the big things, like a car or a home. It’s what time your kid is going to go to bed or what you or your spouse are going to have for dinner. 'These studies show that being a man with a wider face can be both a blessing and a curse and awareness of this may be important for future business success.' The psychologist, whose work is published by the Royal Society journal Biology Letters today, said testosterone may be a factor. 'Testosterone tends to make faces wider and testosterone is also linked to aggression,' she said. 'We also speculate that there might be an evolutionary link. One speculation is that if someone with a wider face gets punched they won't be damaged as much. They can afford to be more aggressive.' Dr Lefevre and colleagues at Bristol University, Bath Spa University and Brunel University studied 49 women and 54 men aged 18 to 30. They measured the breadth from cheek to cheek and the vertical gap between their upper lip and highest point of their eyelids. They then asked them a series of questions to assess their dominance, aggression, anger and hostility. The psychologists found that those participants with broader features proportionate to the height of their faces were more likely to be aggressive, have bad tempers and be more dominant. And they found that the tendencies applied to both men and women. Not all scientists agree with the findings however. A separate piece of research published yesterday by American researchers, found that facial features trigger a 'face-ist' response which influence the way personalities are perceived by others. But the US team, whose work was published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, said the perceptions are misleading and do not reflect real personality traits. Christopher Olivola of Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania said: 'Although we would like to think our judgments and choices are rational, impartial, consistent, and solely based on relevant information, the truth is that they are often biased by superficial and irrelevant factors. 'This is a troubling human tendency that needs to be corrected, or at least mitigated, because faces are not valid predictors of a person's traits. A separate study found that on average, fuller faced workers such as Simon Cowell on the left earn £1,300 more than those with narrow faces (such as that of David Tennet on the right) when asking for a bonus .","Those with broad features, like Wayne Rooney, are more likely to get angry .

"Fierce fighting continued across swathes of Iraq today as Kurdish peshmerga and Iraqi forces beat back ISIS jihadists and advanced deeper into rebel-held territory. Today there were front line clashes between the groups as the violence spilled into Buyuk Yeniga village, a small township located between halfway Baghdad and Kirkuk. In recent weeks Iraqi forces, boosted by American airstrikes and a steady stream of armaments, have put ISIS on the back foot with victories in a series of key towns. Kurdish fighters stand over the body of an Islamic State militant after clashes near Buyuk Yeniga village . ISIS has lost a number of key towns in recent days, all of which are situated near to Kirkuk in northern Iraq. Pictured here is a Peshmerga battalion on the look out for ISIS militants .

ISIS now presides over a mass of land equivalent to the . size of the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq, and controls at least four . million people. Atmeh is close to the border with Turkey . Only two days ago Shiite militias and Kurdish Peshmerga imposed full control over the towns of Amerli, Enjana and Sulaiman Pek, all of which are located in between Baghdad and Kirkuk. All three towns were ISIS strongholds earlier this year and reason for alarm over the jihadists' growing proximity to Baghdad. Battles are now raging in and around Kirkuk, which is thought to remain fiercely contested despite a major Iraqi government offensive launched yesterday. Meanwhile, the ISIS atrocities have continued with militants kidnapping 40 men from a town in Iraq's northern province of Kirkuk today, dragging the men into cars before driving off, according to local residents. Residents of the Sunni Muslim town of Hawija said by telephone they did not know why the men had been taken from a district on the edge of the town. They added that Islamic State, which controls Hawija, had not faced any resistance from its inhabitants. Iraqi forces and Shiite militia fire rockets at ISIS jihadists in an operation near Amirli, 170km north of Baghdad . The fighting near the township of Buyuk Yeniga village (pictured) was fierce but rebels were beaten back . Islamic State has seized hundreds of Iraqi and Syrian soldiers as well as members of other insurgent groups, journalists and civilians. Some have been sold for ransom and others have been killed. Prime Minister David Cameron's government has announced it may arm Kurdish forces but he has ruled out authorising British airstrikes against Islamic State militants before a new Iraqi government is in place. Iraq's Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi said last week he was optimistic about forming a new government soon. Britain has so far carried out aid drops and surveillance and transported military supplies to Kurdish regional forces allied with the Baghdad central government. Other European countries, including Germany, France and Italy have already agreed to send Kurdish forces a quantity of light weapons to use against the militants who have swept into northern Iraq. Shiite militia carry the flag-draped coffin of a fellow soldier killed during clashes with ISIS . A lone Kurdish peshmerga carries an RPG as he advances deeper into ISIS territory . 'We're prepared to do more and we're considering actively whether to give them arms ourselves and whether we can do more directly to train Kurdish militia - we're already playing a role there but we can do more,' Mr Cameron told ITV. Mr Cameron, hosting a two-day NATO summit in Wales, said he was not ruling anything out in the effort to 'squeeze' the Islamic State (IS) 'out of existence', but signalled Britain would not join US airstrikes before a new Iraqi government is in place. He told the BBC: 'What is required is a strategy to help those on the ground and to have an Iraqi government there that can make a difference, Kurdish forces that can make a difference and then we ask what more we can do to help them. It needs to be that way round.'","Clashes between Kurdish peshmerga and ISIS continuing in northern Iraq .

"An empty bag of potato chips and the suspect's poor credit rating helped law enforcement rescue a nurse three days after she had been kidnapped. Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, 22, was abducted from a street in Philadelphia on Sunday night and found 120 miles away in Jessup, Maryland, on Wednesday. She was discovered alongside her suspected kidnapper Delvin Barnes who has been taken into custody and is facing multiple federal charges. Police have said she managed to stay alive because of her resistance and 'fighting spirit', but small pieces of evidence and tips from the public also led law enforcement to her location. A citizen found a receipt from an Acme, a broken key chain, smashed glass, a zip tie and an empty Herr's potato chip bag, and called police after hearing news reports of the abduction. Scroll down for video . Rescued: Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, 22, (left) was abducted from a street in Philadelphia on Sunday night and found 120 miles away in Jessup, Maryland, on Wednesday with her suspected kidnapper Delvin Barnes . Violent: She was abducted in what police say was a random attack. Authorities were able to track her down following tips from the public - including the discovery of an empty bag of potato chips and a receipt . Joy: The nurses mother Keisha Gather smiles, surrounded by family and friends, after a police press conference that revealed her daughter had been rescued . The receipt led officers to the Acme store Barnes had visited after allegedly kidnapping Freeland-Gather where they were able to obtain clearer CCTV images of the suspect. According to News One, after the nurse was captured, Barnes is said to have bought a bag of chips using her ATM card. He was also caught on camera taking money out using the same card. As the information authorities had on Barnes continued to grow, they were able to use the GPS tracker on his Ford Taurus to pick up his location. It was installed because he had such a poor credit history, according to NBC Philadelphia. Ed Hanko, the special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI field office, said the tips allowed authorities to 'identify this individual, identify his car and track it into Maryland'. Freeland-Gaither is now resting at home in Philadelphia after law enforcement agents rescued her Wednesday outside Baltimore and arrested suspect Delvin Barnes. He says detectives are giving her time to settle down before completing interviews. Assistance; A GPS tracker that had been installed in Barnes' car because of his poor credit rating also helped lead law enforcement to the abducted nurse . Visit: Friends and family of Carlesha Freeland-Gaither are escorted by police into Howard County General Hospital to meet her. Police say she sustained some minor injuries during the abduction . Police say Freeland-Gaither, who disappeared Sunday night, had some injuries but was generally doing OK. Barnes is being held on an unrelated Virginia warrant alleging attempted murder, assault and malicious injury with acid, explosives or fire. Carlesha's mother, Keisha Gaither, thanked the Philadelphia police, the FBI, the public, and her family and friends for helping find her daughter. 'Thank you so much for having us in your prayers. Thank you for keeping me up. Thanking for being there for us. I'm taking my baby home. Thank you. Thank you so much.' Gaither said. The mother added that she got a chance to speak to Carlesha over the phone, saying that she was very upset, crying and asking for her. Authorities were able to get a clearer CCTV image of Barnes after a member of the public called in, saying they had found a recepit from a store he had visited after allegedly kidnapping Freeland-Gaither . Commissioner Ramsey and Keisha Gaither made sure to single out Detective James Sloan for his role in Freeland-Gaither's rescue. 'He said in my kitchen in front of me, ""I'm bringing your daughter home,"" and he brought my daughter home,' Ms Gaither said and embraced the detective. Delvin Barnes has a lengthy criminal record, which includes a laundry-list of charges ranging from indecent exposure and false imprisonment to rape, burglary and terrorist threats. The 37-year-old is now expected to face federal charges in connection to the kidnapping.

"Stop: U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry in St. Louis ordered that the ' keep it moving' policy cease . A federal judge ordered Missouri law enforcement agencies to stop forcing protesters to 'keep moving' or face arrest deeming the practice unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry in St. Louis ordered that the practice cease following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri challenging the policy. In an effort to control angry crowds, authorities in Ferguson, Missouri have used the tactic on those demonstrating over the Aug. 9 murder of the unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown who was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a Ferguson Police Department officer. Since the murder, violent protests have taken place in the small Missouri town, many have been arrested, and many peaceful protesters have been threatened with arrest for failing to 'keep it moving.' But not anymore. Perry issued an injunction Monday, the Guardian reports, stating that the police tactic unjustly restricts protester's First Amendment rights. Scroll down for video . Keep it moving: U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry in St. Louis ordered that the ' keep it moving' policy cease following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri challenging the policy . Missouri State highway patrol and St. Louis County police are no longer permitted to 'arrest, threaten to arrest, or order to move' those standing on Ferguson public sidewalks not breaking the law, according to Perry. In the order, Perry described the tactic as a 'blanket rule' that is being used on those assembling peacefully. Five-second rule: Ferguson police began using the tactic in mid-August calling it the 'five-second rule' telling protesters that they must be moving at all times and couldn't stand still for more than five seconds without facing arrest. Justice: Michael Brown (right) was killed Aug. 9 by Darren Wilson (left) a Ferguson Police Department officer . Perry wrote in the order that she issued the injunction 'because it is likely that these agencies will again apply this unconstitutional policy.' Though this 'unconstitutional' policy has been halted, Perry reportedly warned that police may still enforce Missouri's failure-to-disperse law as well as other laws to control crowds and protect both people and property, USA Today reports. Protests and civil disorder began shortly after the 18-year-old was killed and the Washington Post reports that police began using the tactic in mid-August calling it the 'five-second rule' telling protesters that they must be moving at all times and couldn't stand still for more than five seconds without facing arrest. Unruly: St. Louis county police chief testified that the policy was only intended for use when crowds grew dangerous and unruly . Lawsuit: The lawsuit was filed by ACLU Missouri member Mustafa Abdullah (right) and ACLU officials say the injunction is a 'huge win for peaceful protesters and those who believe in the rule of law' The Guardian reports that St. Louis county police chief testified that the policy was only intended for use when crowds grew dangerous and unruly. However, Perry wrote in her order that officers were not given specific circumstances in which to use the tactic and that the policy was an 'ad hoc rule' used when ever the officers 'felt like it.'

"Teenagers are known for their ability to sleep for hours on end. But one young woman suffering from a rare condition gets up to 22 hours of shut-eye a night. Beth Goodier, 20, suffers from Kleine-Levin Syndrome, also known as 'Sleeping Beauty' syndrome, which dominates her life. The neurological condition - which began when she was 16 - means she sleeps, on average, for 18 hours a night. Scroll down for video . Beth Goodier, 20, suffers from Kleine-Levin Syndrome, also known as 'Sleeping Beauty' syndrome . Speaking on BBC Breakfast this morning, she described how the condition triggers episodes every five weeks. The condition is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of around 20 hours a day . When an episode strikes, typically every five weeks, she can sleep for anything between one and three weeks - and requires 24 hour care. Even when she wakes, she can be in a child-like state, confused and not able to tell the difference between reality and dreams. It's thought only around 1,000 people worldwide suffer from the disorder, 70 per cent of them male. It is not clear what causes it and there is no cure. Miss Goodier, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, appeared on BBC Breakfast this morning to discuss her situation, which triggers episodes every five weeks. Discussing her frustration at the situation, she said: 'I spend half of my life in bed. The onset for most people is adolescence, when you are at college, university, getting a job, finding out who you are. 'It [Kleine-Levin Syndrome] takes all that away from you at a crucial time. My life is on hold.' She added: 'I only remember snippets of an episode, so it's like half of my life disappears.' Miss Goodier was accompanied by her mother, Janine, who added: 'When she's up, all she does really is, she's either in bed or on the sofa and she'll watch telly, often the same things over and over again as she likes predictability.' Upon eventually waking, Miss Goodier can be in a child-like state, confused and not able to tell the difference between reality and dreams. It means she must be constantly supervised by her mother Janine (pictured) Mrs Goodier explained to Breakfast presenters Bill Turnbull and Louise Minchin how the family tries to make the most of the time between the Kleine-Levin episodes . Patients return to normal between episodes, however they may become depressed as a consequence of the condition. Mrs Goodier, who has been forced to give up work to care for her daughter, explained the family tries to make the most of the time between the episodes. Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence, and sometimes begins after an infection or illness. It is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 20 hours a day. Episodes can come on very quickly and last between a few days to a few weeks. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. Patients return to normal between episodes, however they may become depressed as a consequence of the condition. Around 1,000 people worldwide suffer from the disorder, which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. Two-thirds of sufferers are male. There is no known cure for the sleeping disorder, and the main treatment is watchful waiting at home by loved ones. Research suggests episodes decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of 8 to 12 weeks. 'On the odd time she's well we don't say any more, ""We'll do that next week"". 'We do it now when she's well because that might be the only time you get.' Kleine-Levin Syndrome has had a devastating effect on Miss Goodier's life, stopping her from moving out of home or attending university, the BBC website reports. Because the condition causes her to often be in a child-like state when awake, she must be supervised by her mother. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. The disease tends to strike at a key time of life - during adolescence - and sometimes begins after an infection or illness. Episodes can come on very quickly and last between a few days to a few weeks. There is no known cure for the sleeping disorder, and the main treatment is watchful waiting at home by loved ones. Eventually, the condition tends to 'burn out' after 10-15 years, doctors say. Miss Goodier added: 'I want to be able to do something productive in the time when I'm well.I want to productive for society,' she said on a programme aired tonight on BBC Inside Out North West. However she hopes by talking about her illness, she can raise awareness.  'There are Facebook groups, which have really helped.

"The fashion industry has always treated supermodel Twiggy well... or so she thought until she dug into her family's past. The 1960s beauty icon's great-great grandmother was killed at a clothes sale in 1897, she discovered on the final episode of the latest series of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? Trying to fight back laughter, Twiggy remarks: 'So the sales got her in the end. Bless her.' Scroll down for video . Twiggy appears on the final episode of the series of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are, and discovers that her great-great grandmother was killed in a 'crush' at a clothes shop . Twiggy, born Lesley Hornby, delved into her before-unknown family history, uncovering a tale of petty crime and poverty. Her great-great grandmother, Grace Meadows, was punished for counterfeiting coins, after which she decided to live a crime-free life under her maiden name, Gillies, the Telegraph reported. In the BBC One ancestry show, which will be broadcast on October 9, Twiggy gasps as she reads out a report of her ancestor's death. 'Oh my goodness, oh my gosh. 1897, killed at a bargain sale! Oh I shouldn't laugh,' she says. 'An inquest was held on Tuesday respecting the death of Grace Gillies, aged 69, who died during a great crush. 'It was the first day of a great clearance sale and the doors were to be opened at 8 o'clock. She appeared to be ill and on being assisted to a seat said, ""I have been beaten this time."" 'She went to a sale and she had a heart attack. They say your life flashes, you know, in front of you. She must have thought I got through all my criminal life, got through hard labour, became a respectable landlady, but the sales got her. Oh bless her heart.' The former supermodel was a beauty icon in the 1960s, appearing on the covers of Vogue and Tatler . The programme also shows Twiggy visiting the shop where Grace died. 333-339 Mare Street, in Hackney, east London, was once Messers McIlroys shop, but is now a supermarket. The Vogue and Tatler cover girl also learns that Grace's son, William, was sentenced to hard labour too after finding himself on the wrong side of the law. Despite the hardship and differing lives many of her ancestors endured, Twiggy finds similarities between herself and her long-gone relatives. 'I think what this has shown me is that the women in my family are very strong women. I feel akin to them when I'm learning about them,' she says.","1960s beauty icon traced her past on BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?

"A third woman is being questioned by police in Toronto. as part of the investigation into a CBC host who was fired amid sexual assault allegations. Radio veteran Jian Ghomeshi claims the network let him go after learning he practices BDSM and thought his sexual preferences were 'unbecoming' for a presenter. But nine potential victims have come forward saying the founder of radio show Q abused them, causing the sex crimes probe to widen. According to the Toronto Star, police are also investigating videos Ghomeshi showed his CBC bosses on October 23 containing 'graphic evidence that Jian had caused physical injury to a woman.' Second victim revealing idendtity: Reva Seth (pictured right) says she met Jian Ghomeshi (left) in 2002 as a 26-year-old after starting a new job in Toronto, Canada . The woman was being interviewed two days after second woman revealed her identity claiming she was abused by Ghomeshi. Author and lawyer Reva Seth says she met Ghomeshi in 2002 as a 26-year-old after starting a new job in Toronto, Canada. She claims the pair 'kissed' a few times before the 47-year-old became 'a different person, super angry, almost frenzied and disassociated'. The presenter was fired last week as a result of the accusations, which he claimed were started by a jilted ex-girlfriend looking for revenge. His lawyers have allegedly moved to sue the public-funded broadcasting company for $55million, claiming he was fired over a 'moral judgement' of his BDSM lifestyle. But Seth has gone public to describe her allegations against him - claiming he once 'had his hand around my throat' before abusing her. The mother-of-three, who wrote the book 'MomShift', wrote an account of her alleged abuse in a blog published by The Huffington Post Canada. So far, nine women have come forward to claim Ghomeshi slapped, choked and verbally assaulted them on dates and at work in the past 12 years. Actress Lucy DeCoutere, who stars on the television show Trailer Park Boys, was the first of those to identify herself. Others have decided to remain anonymous, fearing  online bullying. Actress Lucy DeCoutere (left), who appears on television show Trailer Park Boys, is one of nine women who have come forward with claims about fired-CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi (right) Seth described in the blog how Ghomeshi was 'funny and charming,' when the pair first started seeing each other casually. But one evening, she claims, his behaviour suddenly changed. She wrote: 'When it was over, I got up and it was clear I was really angry. My sexual interactions until then had always been consensual, enjoyable and fun. 'He gave me some weird lines about how he couldn't tell if I was actually attracted to him or not. And somehow this was meant to explain his behaviour.' Afterwards she decided not to involve the police and opted not to come forward fearing the impact of online trolls. But she eventually decided to reveal her identity after hearing Lucy DeCoutere speaking on CBC about her 'remarkably similar experience'. Yesterday, Ghomeshi issued a short statement thanking his Facebook followers for their support and saying he would not be discussing the matter further with the media. DeCoutere says she first met Ghomeshi at a barbecue in Banff, Canada, in 2003, and that they later met up in Toronto to have dinner. She says throughout the meal, Ghomeshi went on about how famous he was and 'how lucky you are to be with me'. After dinner, they went back to Ghomeshi's house where they began making out. But things soon turned violent when she claims Ghomeshi pushed her against a wall, choked her and slapped her three times. 'He did not ask if I was into it. It was never a question. It was shocking to me. The men I have spent time with are loving people,' said DeCoutere, who also works as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force when she is not acting. Fired: Ghomeshi was fired from his radio show Q on Sunday amid allegations of sexual assault. He says he was wrongly terminated after executives found out about his BDSM lifestyle. Nine women are saying their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi were not consensual . DeCoutere promptly left in a taxi. The Star goes on to detail each account from the other seven victims, which occurred as early as 2002 and as recently as 2013. Three of the women met Ghomeshi in 2012, when he was touring the country to support his autobiography, and two of the women are co-workers. One of the women says she was in a work meeting with Ghomeshi when they were left alone in a room and he leaned over to say: 'I want to hate f*** you'. While the woman claims to have reported Ghomeshi's inappropriate behavior, including a time when he grabbed her buttocks, to her union supervisor, she doesn't believe the host was ever punished. The CBC says it is now investigating the incident. Another CBC producer says she met Ghomeshi during his book tour and that she was attacked by him in a hotel room. She didn't report the incident because she 'felt like Jian was a CBC god'. Two of the women also told the story of Big Ears Teddy, a stuffed animal that played a role in their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi. One woman who was invited over to Ghomeshi's house says he turned the teddy bear to face away from the bed saying: 'Big Ears Teddy shouldn't see this'. On Sunday, the CBC announced that Ghomeshi would no longer be working for the network in a vague statement saying recently-revealed information 'precludes us from continuing our relationship'. Following that announcement, the Toronto Star published their first article with four accounts from alleged victims. The ninth anonymous woman met him at a Christmas media party more than a decade ago. She described the radio show host and musician as 'smitten' with her and she in turn said she was charmed by his charismatic personality. Their first date was to watch him tape his own show and they socialized with his colleagues and then went to a bar afterwards to talk. She said he was only charming and gave her no reason at all to worry. He drove her home and while in the car on the way to hers he came on to her and asked her if she would undo her blouse buttons, she claims. She said 'no' at which point, the woman alleges, Ghomeshi reached over and grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. He then allegedly said something like 'how do you like that?' The woman then said she asked him to stop and she got out of the car. The woman though, told CBC that she agreed to see him again, because she thought he 'might just have been too rough' - but nothing that couldn't be ironed out. On the second date, she brought a friend along but then at the end of the evening went back to his house. The two got friendly back at his and during a clinch she alleges that he pulled her hair again, this time only harder and then began to punch her on the ears till she cried. Two of the women also told the story of Big Ears Teddy, a stuffed animal that played a role in their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi . The anonymous woman then fled his home and went to a friends house and cried throughout the night. When asked why she didn't press charges or call the police, the woman said she only wanted to curl up in a corner. She said she was so shocked by the seemingly charming man's violence that it left her feeling only shock - but now she wishes she had gone to the police. Ghomeshi responded to his dismissal by writing a Facebook post claiming a spurned ex-girlfriend started spreading sexual assault rumors. In the post, Ghomeshi speaks about his sexual preferences saying: 'I have always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom but I only participate in sexual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners.' Ghomeshi goes on to say that he revealed all of this to his employers in an attempt to be transparent about the allegations, in case the story was ever published. He says last week he gave the network 'proof' that the sexual relationship was consensual, and that while his employers believed him they decided to terminate his contract, afraid that if his sexual life became public, it would cause a scandal. 'CBC execs confirmed that the information provided showed that there was consent. In fact, they later said to me and my team that there is no question in their minds that there has always been consent. They said they're not concerned about the legal side. 'But then they said that this type of sexual behavior was unbecoming of a prominent host on the CBC. They said that I was being dismissed for 'the risk of the perception that may come from a story that could come out.' To recap, I am being fired in my prime from the show I love and built and threw myself into for years because of what I do in my private life.' Ghomeshi has been at the CBC for 14 years, and has been the host of the popular radio show Q, which he founded, since 2007. Recent interviews include Lena Dunham, Jamie Oliver and Ethan Hawke.","Jian Ghomeshi fired from his CBC radio show Q amid sexual assault claims .

Under terms of the settlement, Herbalife would also make 'numerous changes' to its business model for at least three years after the settlement receives final approval, the court filing said. Short-sellers and other critics have accused companies such as Herbalife, NU Skin Enterprises Inc  and USANA Health Sciences Inc of running pyramid-type schemes, questioning their sales model under which distributors make money not only from their own sales but from people they recruit as distributors. Settling: Global nutrition company, Herbalife Ltd.  entered into a settlement agreement that, if approved by the court, will resolve a class action lawsuit against the company for $15 million. Pictured here is the company's offices in Los Angeles . Final court approval is still needed. Dana Bostick, a California housing inspector, filed the lawsuit in April last year, claiming that hundreds of thousands of other distributors have failed to make much money by trying to sell the products. 'The potential cost, as well as the distraction, disruption and burden of prolonged litigation on the company and its management team, led the company to decide that the terms set forth in the settlement agreement provided the best path for moving forward,' Herbalife said in a statement on Friday. The company said the settlement did not contain an admission of liability or wrongdoing. Herbalife gave Carl Icahn three additional seats on its board earlier this year, after the activist investor openly voiced his support for the company. Pitted against him is the company's most prominent critic, fellow activist William Ackman, who unveiled a $1.16 billion short position against Herbalife in December 2012. Under the agreement, Herbalife must make a number of changes to its corporate policies, including how it defines its distributors, paying shipping charges for products that are legitimately returned by members and making clarifications in its membership agreement to make them less confusing. The product return fund would be available to distributors who file valid claims for the return of unused and unopened products, according to Friday's settlement. The plaintiff lawyers expect to seek fees equal to 30 percent of the combined sum of the settlement amount, the court filing said. 'In return for the economic and corporate policy changes provided in the settlement agreement, the settlement class will agree to fully release Herbalife from all claims that were or could have been raised in the complaints in this action,' Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell said in the filing. Herbalife shares closed up about 3.7 percent at $52.46 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The stock has lost about a third of its value so far this year. A sharp sell-off was sparking over reports the FBI were probing Herbalife over the alleged pyramid scheme.","Civil rights groups alleged in 2013 Herbalife unfairly targets minorities .

"Passengers were asked to volunteer to get off an easyJet plane because it was too heavy, it has been claimed. The captain of the flight to Malaga from London Southend Airport in Essex said wind conditions meant the weight of the 156-passenger Airbus 319 made it dangerous to take off. Crew members asked for volunteers while the aircraft sat on the tarmac for more than an hour last week - and ten people selected to leave were offered £250 compensation each. Scroll down for video . On the ground: The captain of the easyJet flight from London Southend Airport reportedly said wind conditions meant the weight of the 156-passenger Airbus 319 made it dangerous to take off (file picture) One flyer told Nick Pisa in The Sun on Sunday: ‘The biggest mystery is the fact they asked exactly ten passengers to leave, but some were fat, some were thin, some had luggage and some didn't. ‘Quite a few people put their hands up and easyJet just selected a few at random. How can they be sure this brought the plane down to a safe weight? It's not very reassuring.’ An easyJet spokesman told MailOnline tonight: 'easyJet can confirm that some passengers on a recent flight from London Southend to Malaga were asked to take a later flight as weather conditions at Southend meant the aircraft would be too heavy to take off with all onboard. 'Like all airlines, we calculate weight using high average estimates for males and females, along with 20kg baggage. In line with EU rules, the passengers who did not travel on the flight were offered £250 compensation and a transfer on to an alternative flight to Malaga. Essex airport: Crew members reportedly asked for volunteers while the aircraft sat on the tarmac at Southend . 'easyJet would like to apologise to the passengers for the delay to their journey.' A similar incident occurred four years ago, when dozens of passengers were ordered off an easyJet plane and threatened with arrest by police if they refused - because it was too heavy to take off. MailOnline reported how the flight from Birmingham to Geneva in December 2010 was over-filled with 10 tonnes too much fuel, so the captain asked the last 37 customers to get off the plane. When some passengers refused to budge they were told three officers were waiting in the airport terminal and would arrest them if necessary. Easyjet later apologised to all passengers affected. EasyJet is offering up to four three-hour flights a week from Southend to Malaga this winter, while there will be up to seven on offer next summer - with one-way prices from £23.","Passengers at London Southend Airport had to volunteer to get off plane .

"Britain and America will  hold 'war games' next week to test their response to the collapse of a major bank on either side of the Atlantic. Chancellor George Osborne and Bank of England governor Mark Carney will join US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen in a Washington war room on Monday. The simulated exercise will look at two scenarios – a major US bank with UK operations at risk and a major UK bank with US operations about to go under. Britain and America will hold 'war games'  to test their response to the collapse of a major bank, like Lehman Brothers (pictured) Regulators are desperate to avoid a repeat of the financial crash when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a crisis around the world. This resulted in billions of pounds of taxpayers money being used to prop up stricken lenders including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. Mr Osborne said: 'We are going to make sure that we can handle an institution that previously would have been regarded as too big to fail. We're confident that we now have choices that did not exist in the past,' 'London is a global financial centre, and is both home and host to some of the world's biggest and most important banks. This brings with it many opportunities for jobs and growth, but we need to make sure that taxpayers are not on the hook for future bank failures. Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Bank of England governor Mark Carney will join US regulators in a Washington war room on Monday . 'That is why, in addition to the radical reforms to Britain's banking sector that we have already introduced, we also need to strengthen cross-border co-operation on this issue. The US is one of our most important partners, and I'm pleased to be taking part in this exercise in Washington next week.' Six years after the financial crisis, experts are keen to prove they have created rules that will allow them to let a large bank go under without spending billions of taxpayers' money. They have forced banks to ramp up equity and debt capital buffers to protect taxpayers against losses, and have told them to write plans that lay out how they can go through ordinary bankruptcy. Lehman Brothers staff outside their officers after news broke the bank had filed for bankruptcy in 2008 . Salvaging a bank with operations in several countries - which is the norm for most of the world's largest banks such as Deutsche Bank, Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan - has proven to be a particularly thorny issue. Two potential measures are expected to be announced this weekend, including banks having more long-term bonds that investors know can lose their value during a crisis, on top of their equity capital. This would double their so-called Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity. The second will through a change in derivative contracts, which in their current form protect investors, and complicate the winding down of a bank across borders.

"The trials of three of four members of Florida A&M University's marching band on charges of felony hazing and manslaughter have been postponed until April. But the trial of a fourth member began with jury selection today, nearly three years after drum major Robert Champion died from being beaten. Judge Renee Roche delayed the trial for defendants Benjamin McNamee, Aaron Golson and Darryl Cearnel after their attorneys said they did not have the opportunity to question witnesses about hazing charges that were added to the case. Dante Martin's trial is expected to last a week. Dante Martin, center, waits for jury selection today, as he stands trial in Orange County, Florida . All four have pleaded not guilty in the death of Champion, of Decatur, Georgia. He died from what authorities say was a hazing ritual in November 2011. His death has shone a spotlight on a hazing ritual at FAMU known as 'crossing Bus C,' and caused the band — which had played at the Super Bowl and before U.S. presidents — to be suspended for over a year. It also contributed to the resignation of the university's president. Hours after a football game in Orlando, band members boarded Bus C parked outside a hotel. They pummeled Champion, 26, and two other band members as they tried to wade their way through a pounding gauntlet of fists, drumsticks and mallets from the front to the back of the bus. After making it to the back, Champion vomited and complained of trouble breathing. He soon fell unconscious and couldn't be revived. He died from hemorrhagic shock and his autopsy showed extensive internal bleeding. Robert Champion (pictured), the Florida A&M University drum major who died in a Nov. 19 , 2011 hazing incident . Pam Champion, right, and Robert Champion, Sr., left, hold a photo of their son, Robert, a Florida A&M University drum major who died in a hazing incident . Fifteen former band members originally were charged with manslaughter and hazing in the death of Champion, of Decatur, Georgia. All but the four remaining defendants have had their cases settled, and several of them will be called as witnesses to describe what happened on the bus. State Attorney Jeff Ashton said he wants jurors to learn about the history of hazing in FAMU's marching band so they understand that what happened on the bus was a 'consistent pattern.' Besides 'crossing Bus C,' jurors likely will learn about other hazing rituals by band members. Those include 'the hot seat,' when band members sit in bus seats with heads between legs as other band members beat them, as well as 'prepping,' when a shirtless band member is slapped on the back and chest. Benjamin McNamee (pictured left) and Aaron Golson (pictured right) have had their trials postponed . 'They got on the bus for one thing, and that is to break the law,' Ashton said at a recent hearing. 'The jury has to understand this wasn't an isolated incident, that these four defendants knew what they were doing and that they were breaking the law.' Defense attorneys have challenged Florida's anti-hazing law, claiming that statute is so vague that what happened on the band bus can be considered a competition, not hazing. 'The hazing statute, the way it is written is crazy,' Dino Michaels, one of the attorneys for Martin, said at a recent hearing. Roche denied a defense motion asking that the hazing statute be ruled unconstitutional, but she reached a compromise with defense attorneys and Ashton on whether witnesses can say the word 'hazing' during the trial. The judge ruled witnesses could use the word 'hazing' if they had previously read the statute defining it, such as in the anti-hazing pledges FAMU band members had to sign even before Champion's death. Defense attorneys and prosecutors agreed no band members have said in depositions that Champion's sexual orientation played a role in the hazing, so the fact that he was gay won't be brought up during the trial. Defense attorneys say Champion's body may have been tampered with when it left the custody of the medical examiner's office so organs could be harvested. They also say the coroner uses analogies about how Champion died that could be misconstrued by jurors.","Dante Martin's trial is expected to last a week - for the death of Robert Champion in 2011 .

"An entrepreneur is hoping to make a tidy sum out of the tragedy of the Ebola outbreak by selling a domain using the virus' name for a six figure sum. Jon Schultz, who monitors a number of 'disease domains' from his home in Las Vegas, bought Ebola.com in 2008 and now believes he can sell it for $150,000. The businessman also owns birdflu.com and H1N1.com, as well a domain for the deadly mosquito-borne disease Chikungunya and another for the Ebola-like Marburg virus. He paid $13,500 for his Ebola domain four years ago and has been waiting for the moment to sell. Scroll down for video . The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa . 'Ebola.com would be a great domain for a pharmaceutical company working on a vaccine or cure, a company selling pandemic or disaster-preparedness supplies, or a medical company wishing to provide information and advertise services,' Mr Schultz told CNBC in an emailed statement. 'There could be many other applications as well. With so many people concerned about the disease, any advertisement referring people to Ebola.com should get an excellent response.' In an interview with the Washington Post, Mr Schultz said he felt that a six figure sum was more than reasonable for Ebola.com. 'According to our site meter, we're already doing 5,000 page views per day just by people typing in Ebola.com to see what's there,' he said. 'We're getting inquiries every day about the sale of it. I have a lot of experience in this sort of domain business, and my sense is that $150,000 is reasonable.' Mr Schultz, who also owns terror.com, PotassiumIodide.com and fukushima.com, appeared untroubled about the issue of making money from a human tragedy. The World Health Organization called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' 'But you could say the same thing about doctors,' Schultz told the Washington Post. 'They can become very well-off treating very sick patients. 'Besides we have sacrificed a couple of thousands in parking page income to put up links about Ebola on the site. And people can also donate to Doctors Without Borders at the site.' The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa since an outbreak that began in March. The World Health Organization  called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'. The risks of failing to contain Ebola in West Africa have come into sharp focus in the United States after the first patient diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil, Thomas Eric Duncan, died last week. Erica Ollman Saphire, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus using 'crowdfunding' on the internet . Mr Schultz told the Washington Post he wants to sell the domain soon because he is worried something may 'ameliorate' the outbreak, diminishing Ebola's news value and the value of the domain. 'Ebola is either something that could become more of a problem, or it's something that could ameliorate and not be a big news story for that much longer,' he said. But the entrepreneur still has other domain's to fall back on should Ebola.com lose its value. 'Our domain, birdflu.com, is worth way more than Ebola.com. We're definitely holding onto that one for the event,' he said, referring to an outbreak he believes could be far bigger than Ebola. ZMappwas used to treat aid worker Dr. Kent Brantly (pictured). An appeal is hoping to raise money to speed up the research into the drugs . 'That one's airborne and Ebola would never go airborne in the United States like bird flu can.' In California, a different individual has also turned to the internet to raise money. But rather than capitalizing on the outbreak immunologist Erica Ollman Saphire is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus. The professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping that Internet 'crowdfunding' will help provide the extra money needed to speed up the research. She is in charge of an international consortium developing the new anti-Ebola drugs that helped formulate the experimental ZMapp serum that used to treat two American aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia and recovered. Dr. Saphire posted an appeal on the Crowd Rise website  seeking at least $100,000 in contributions for purchasing equipment that will allow researchers to more quickly analyze blood samples of antibodies from survivors of the hemorrhagic fever. The appeal has so far raised nearly $17,500 in donations. The Scripps-led consortium was established with a $28 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, but the rapidly growing scope of its work has placed additional demands on limited resources. Specimens are being sent to Dr. Saphire's lab from around the world, 'but the number of samples outpaces the ability of her current equipment to process them', the website said in a message. ZMapp is a mix of three antibodies designed to bind to proteins of the Ebola virus, preventing it from replicating and triggering the immune response of infected cells. The compound was tested in monkeys, but there were no human trials of the serum before it was rushed to Atlanta to treat U.S. aid workers Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol after they became infected in Liberia in July. Both were ultimately cured, but doctors are unsure whether the ZMapp actually helped them.","Jon Schultz monitors several 'disease domains' from his home in Las Vegas .

"The Pentagon said on . Thursday it is too early to say that the U.S.-led coalition is . 'winning' against Islamic State, pointing to the group's . continued access to financing, volunteers and weapons even after . being bombed in Syria and Iraq. 'Your question gets at ... How do you know you're winning? And what I'm telling you is, it's going to take us a while to be . able to say that,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby . told reporters. 'Even after the hits they've taken and they have been hit . ... they still have financing at their fingertips. They still . have plenty of volunteers. They still have plenty of weapons and . vehicles and the ability to move around,' he said. Ready for the long haul: Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby (L) speaks during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington D.C. The United States and its allies are steeling themselves for what an American defense official described as a yearslong fight against the so-called Islamic State . U.S.-led airstrikes hit locations overnight in a remote area of eastern Syria where ISIS has been using mobile refineries to produce oil that brings in up to $2 million a day for the group . Earlier this week, U.S. aircraft, accompanied by planes from . Arab allies, began striking Islamic State targets in Syria, . marking an expansion of the U.S. air campaign against the . militant group that began last month in neighboring Iraq. On Wednesday, the U.S. military announced strikes on small . oil refineries in eastern Syria intended to undermine the . group's ability to finance itself through oil sales. Kirby said the United States had not seen movement of troops . loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who remains an . illegitimate leader in Western eyes, into areas of Syria where . Islamic State had been hit by U.S. and allied air strikes. 'We've also seen ... to be quite honest ... much in terms of . reaction by (Islamic State) inside Syria as a result of these . attacks. In other words, they're not seeing a lot of movement or . major muscle movement changes by them in just the last couple of . days.' For now, the United States is focused on the refineries, according to Kirby. But he acknowledged there are 'other economic levers the international community is going to have to pull' to cut off all funding to ISIS . Kirby said U.S. officials were working to establish whether . civilians had been killed or injured in the recent strikes. 'We are aware of some reporting out there that there may . have been civilian casualties, and we're taking a look at that,' he said. 'I would add, though, not as a caveat, but just to be . completely transparent, we don't have any credible operational . reporting through operational channels that would sustain those . allegations.' In a Pentagon briefing yesterday, Army Lieutenant General Bill Mayville called the cruise missiles and bombs flung at targets in Syria 'the beginning of a credible and sustainable persistent campaign.' How long will the campaign last? 'I would think of it in terms of years,' Mayville responded. Although the bombs exploded on Syrian soil, they didn't target Bashar al-Assad's battered, murderous regime. The bombs were addressed to Syria's enemy, the Islamic State, a nascent nation that has pledged to topple both Iraq and Syria, as well as Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Cyprus, and parts of southern Turkey, and erect a caliphate on the parcel. But in attacking Syria's enemy, the United States wasn't looking to make friends with Syria. President Barack Obama called for Assad to step down in 2011, and it was only last year that the United States was prepared to bomb Syria for having crossed the chemical-weapons 'red line' to kill its own citizens. Not that the United States is remarkably choosey about which nations it counts among its allies. U.S. President Barack Obama and senior advisers meet with representatives from the five Arab countries plus Iraq who have participated in air strikes against ISIS in Syria . In the latest round of strikes targeting ISIS refineries in Syria, fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft, hitting 12 locations . Among the Middle East nations joining with the United States to strike Syria is Qatar, which has allowed one of its sheikhs to raise funds for an Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. The United States is at war with Al Qaeda in all of its flavors, including the Syria-based Khorasan Group, upon which U.S. bombs fell this week. The Khorasan Group is said to be plotting attacks on the United States and Europe. Our perpetual war is complicated, however, by the fact that the Islamic State is the sworn enemy of Al Qaeda, from which it split earlier this year because it couldn't play nice with Al Qaeda's other affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, which is also fighting the Assad regime. Or, to look at it another way, the enemies of America's enemies are not automatically America's friends; and even America's friends, which can be permissive about the flow of money to Al Qaeda, aren't necessarily America's friends either. America has allies in Syria's civil war, of course, including Harakat Hazm, part of the Free Syrian Army. Harakat Hazm is fighting Assad, but it has also fought alongside America's enemy Jabhat al-Nusra, which has not disqualified it from receiving U.S. weapons and training. Harakat Hazm took exception to the American-led bombing of Syria in a statement, calling it an 'external intervention' and 'an attack on the revolution,' according to a Los Angeles Times report. So Harakat Hazm, America's friend, which fought with America's enemy against Syria-which is neither friend nor enemy-objects to the fact that America bombed Syria in pursuit of the Islamic State, which is also Harakat Hazm's enemy. Meanwhile, the militant Shiite group Hezbollah is drone-bombing Jabat al-Nusrat along the Lebanon-Syria border at the same time Israel is downing Syrian jets. As Mayville promised, this conflict will likely go on for years. The attacks are focused on the 'infrastructure around the refineries,' meaning the ability of ISIS to produce oil . There are questions about just how much impact the destruction of the refineries will have on ISIS, which analysts have said has access to billions of dollars . It's a wild card war in which allies and enemies seem arbitrary and ever-shifting. A war with a conclusion that its participants can't see or can't imagine is a war without end. None of the dig-in parties in Syria and Iraq look like pushovers, but neither do any of them look like sure bets. Without American intervention, the current war will likely rage on. With regard to American intervention, not even the Pentagon dares to predict an end. For Americans, at least so far, this war is rumbling on like background noise. The usual markers of military victory-body-counts tabulated, territories seized and banked, no-fly zones established, governments-in-waiting imposed, and elections supervised-don't apply to the Syria war. The borders, combatants, allegiances, and military objectives in the Syrian war are too fluid to conform to our usual expectations. Nor do the usual markers of peace seem to exist. There are no peace talks taking shape, no shuttle diplomacy, no evidence of a dominant power about to exert its might to create a lasting peace by flattening everybody. President Obama, who inherited this war, has made this war his war, the next president's war and for as far as the eye can see. Perpetual war for perpetual peace.","Airstrikes focus on oil refineries, a source of revenue for ISIS .

"A Missouri funeral director is sending his father out with a bang - by scattering his ashes with a fireworks display. Greenlawn Funeral Homes will hold its first Firework Memorial program on Saturday night, when fireworks packed with James Carver's cremated remains will be launched skyward as part of his family's goodbye. Carver's family is the first to try Greenlawn's new program. His son is funeral director Jim Carver, who says his father, who died in 2008, loved watching fireworks and would appreciate the unusual send off. Scroll down for video . Greenlawn Funeral Home (pictured) in Missouri has started holding Firework Memorial programs . The family will follow the eight-minute fireworks display with a cookout and memorial celebration. Some have said, 'this is the coolest thing I've ever seen,' Carver said, while others think it sounds weird. One other family has purchased a fireworks memorial for the one-year anniversary of a loved one's death. Greenlawn's Fireworks Memorials range from a $300 'Sensational Celebration' to the 'Ultimate Goodbye,' which costs $8,000 to $10,000, The Springfield News-Leader reported. 'We are always looking for something to help families memorialize their lives,' Carver said. 'To me, every family is different how they want to recognize their loved one or celebrate their life.' The funeral home is working with Aaron Mayfield, owner of AM Pyrotechnics, a fireworks manufacturing business north of Springfield. He said his company had already created fireworks memorials for some individual clients. The company packs the ashes into a large fireworks aerial shell, and it always treats the remains with respect, he said. 'And it explodes with a lot of beauty and covers a lot of the sky, the size of a football field. It spreads the cremated remains into the sky and the particles are taken into the wind,' he said. Missouri allows for the scattering of remains, and since Greenlawn is outside the Springfield city limits, the company can legally set off fireworks. Carver thinks the firework displays will be popular in the summer, when families can hold the events and explode ashes over a lake. 'I think we are learning that traditions are going out the window,' he said. 'Families are saying they want something different.'","Jim Carver's father James died in 2008 and loved watching fireworks .

"Perhaps it's her penchant for cavorting in a bikini on mega yachts during her holidays, or the potential for fantastic karaoke evenings. Whatever the reason, Britons have named Beyonce as the celebrity they'd most like to travel with, according to a new survey. The singer topped the fantasy travel partner wishlist compiled by holiday comparison site Icelolly, with 21 per cent of those polled choosing her above other celebrities. Scroll down for video . Fantasy travel partner: Britons has named Beyonce as the celebrity they'd most like to holiday with . Get the party started: DJ hitmaker Calvin Harris and popstar Rihanna were the second and third most popular fantasy travel partner, respectively, according to the survey by Icelolly . Just last week, the Single Ladies star shared her latest holiday snaps with fans - featuring mega yachts, picture perfect beaches and plenty of skimpy bikinis - so it's not hard to see why she was chosen as the ideal travel companion. Beyonce beat out other popstars including Rihanna (15 per cent), Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (12 per cent) and Lady Gaga (five per cent). DJ Calvin Harris was the second favourite with 17 per cent of the vote, eclipsing Brad Pitt and Harry Styles (seven per cent each). Despite being less of a household name, Harris' ability to throw the best party is undisputed, thanks to the number of hits under his belt. 1. Beyoncé – 21% . 2. Calvin Harris – 17% . 3. Rihanna – 15% . 4. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini – 12% . 5. Keith Lemon – 8% . 6. Harry Styles – 7% . - Brad Pitt – 7% . 7. Lady Gaga – 5% . 8. David Guetta – 4% . - Robbie Williams – 4% . 1.

Simon Cowell – 2% . - Kim Kardashian– 2% . Perhaps unsurprisingly, Justin Bieber was named as the celebrity holiday partner from hell. His recent restaurant bust-up with Orlando Bloom in Ibiza and brushes with the law earned 37 per cent of the vote for worst travel partner. Katie Price (15 per cent), Piers Morgan and Nick Clegg (12 per cent each), and Miley Cyrus (eight per cent) feature on the unflattering list. Not surprising: Justin Bieber is considered the holiday partner from hell . Unpopular: Katie Price (15%) and Piers Morgan 12%) both scored highly on the 'worst travel partner' survey . Suniel Makh, Brand Director at Icelolly, said: 'Celebrities obviously lead a very lavish lifestyle which we all dream of emulating whilst on holiday – attempting to escape reality in the pursuit of relaxation and that all-important star treatment. 'However, it seems money isn't always everything and Brits still very much value the experience and memories that a decent travel partner can provide.

Robert Cerqua, 32, was convicted yesterday of killing his brother Christopher, a carpenter, by a jury of nine men and three women at Winchester Crown Court after almost 16 hours of deliberations. The trial heard that Cerqua stabbed his twin in a “fit of temper” following an argument that took place in the kitchen of the family house in Hythe, Hampshire, on December 31 last year. Sentenced: Robert Cerqua (left) murdered his twin brother Christopher (right) with a kitchen knife in a New Year's Eve argument, then fled their parents' home barefoot and went to a party until 2.20am with his girlfriend . Force: When police found the knife in the kitchen sink its handle had been broken, the court heard . Sentencing Cerqua, who was wearing a shirt and tie, judge Mr Justice Teare said: “You have been found guilty by the jury of the murder of your twin brother Christopher on New Year’s Eve last year. “His death and its consequences have had, and will continue to have, a devastating effect on your parents and those close to you. “You grew up with your brother and from time to time worked with him in the building trade. When you were both sober, it seems you got on well. “But when each of you had too much alcohol, there was a risk an argument might break out leading to violence. That had happened before and it happened on New Year’s Eve. “On New Year’s Eve you and he were drinking in the kitchen of your parents’ home. It’s unlikely that violence was on your mind or your brother’s mind when you started drinking. “From 6pm to 8pm, it’s gathered from the record of text messages that all was well. “However, as soon as you both drank more, it seems that you feared a fight might break out. Distressing: The twins' parents Denise and Peter, pictured outside court, called 999 for help . “Then an argument and a fight broke out, quite why is not known, but it did. “Whether you picked up a kitchen knife from the worktop or your brother did is also not clear but what is clear is that you ended up with the knife in your hand and you stabbed your brother in the abdomen, causing a fatal wound.” The court heard that Cerqua had served previous prison sentences for offences of battery and affray relating to domestic incidents involving his former partners. He also had previous convictions for motoring offences and criminal damage. Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC told the trial that Cerqua, who had been drinking, got involved in an argument with his brother which then turned violent. He said the parents of the twins, Peter and Denise Cerqua, were present in the property, where both sons also lived, when the fight took place in the kitchen. Mr Haggan said Mrs Cerqua dialled 999 to ask for police assistance and during the call, which was played to the jury, her husband called out to his wife asking for an ambulance before he shouted: “He’s stabbed him.” The jury was shown photographs of the kitchen, which showed several crushed empty cans of Stella Artois lager alongside party food. Mr Haggan said the defendant fled the property barefoot and called his girlfriend, who took him to a friend’s party where he continued to get drunk. He said: “This is a tragic case. It involves the killing by this defendant, Robert Cerqua, of his identical twin brother, Christopher Cerqua. “The incident which led to Christopher’s death occurred in the kitchen of the family home in Hythe, where both their mother and father were present in the house. “In a nutshell, it was New Year’s Eve last year, both brothers had been drinking, shortly before 9pm an argument started between the two brothers. “That argument appears to have turned into a tussle, punches may have been exchanged, at some point this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother Christopher. Guilty: Robert (left) had denied killing Christopher (right) deliberately, insisting he was acting in self-defence . Argument: The row escalated and Christopher was left bleeding to death on the floor of the kitchen (pictured) “Having done so, the defendant fled the family home. He didn’t even stop to take the time to put on a pair of shoes before he left the house. “He telephoned his girlfriend, who picked him up in her car and took him to a friend’s house where a New Year’s Eve party was in full swing. “The defendant turned off his mobile phone which meant that he could not be contacted by the police. Fight: The pair chatted in a friendly way at this table but the talk became heated as the night wore on . “He stayed at that New Year’s Eve party until the police traced him to that address and he was arrested on suspicion of murder. By then he was very drunk.” Mr Haggan said that Cerqua inflicted a single stab wound to his brother’s lower stomach which was about seven inches deep. He said the defendant told police he had acted in self-defence. He explained that DNA found on this knife matched both the defendant and his brother because, as identical twins, they shared the same DNA profile. Mr Haggan said a blood test showed that Christopher had 230mg of alcohol in 80ml of blood - almost three times the drink-drive limit - and Robert told police he had drunk six cans of lager and two glasses of red wine before leaving the house. He also told police that he had a “fiery relationship” with his brother and drink could make him “nasty” and “short-tempered”. Robert Cerqua insisted he acted only in self-defence, but yesterday the jury of nine men and three women took 16 hours to find him guilty of murder. He showed no emotion in the dock at Winchester Crown Court, where the verdict was met with a cry from the public gallery. His murder trial heard an 'extremely drunk' Cerqua left barefoot after stabbing his brother with a kitchen knife, leaving a seven-inch wound in his stomach. He joined his girlfriend at a New Year's Eve party and turned off his phone so he could not be reached, while his father Peter was left trying to stem Christopher's bleeding with a tea towel. The professional carpenter had a cardiac arrest less than an hour later and was declared dead in hospital. Police found Robert at a party in nearby Totton at 2.20am and told him what he was being arrested for - to which he replied: 'Murder?' He then fell asleep in the back of a police car on the way to Southampton Central Police station, the court heard. When he woke up, he said: 'Is he dead? You are lying, he cannot be'. While being taken to his cell, he added: 'Was it me? Was it me? I cannot remember. Honestly, is my brother dead?' And when he was told the charge against him the next day, he allegedly said: 'I killed my f****** brother. I don’t want to be here any more. 'Nine times out of ten it would be all right. [That’s] just my luck, he had to die on me.' Robert earlier sent a string of texts to his girlfriend, Joelle Mansfield, which revealed how the mood deteriorated, the court heard. An earlier message from Cerqua read: 'I cannot wait to marry you!!! xxx', followed at 6.30pm by: 'Yes sexy. Chris wishes happy ‘New Year! xxx'. But at 7pm he wrote: 'Me and Chris are going at it. Talking about past. We got things to sort out but all good. Enjoy your night my lovely, I love you'. At 8:10pm he added: 'There might be a fight in a minute. This is my life!! Don’t want this but what can I do. Had enough. Sorry but this is what I have got to put up with and I hate it. This is my life. Sorry, but blokes. Want to f*** off anywhere but here'. Mr Haggan told the jury of nine men and three women: 'At some point, this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother. 'The defendant inflicted just one wound, but the tract of that wound was quite long, about 15 - 17 centimetres or approximately six or seven inches, and it punctured the aorta, the principle artery which runs down a person’s trunk. In interviews, Robert Cerqua said his brother had been threatening him with the knife and he had either taken it, or picked up another, in a bid to defend himself. The kitchen knife said to have been used - its handle broken and the blade bent - was discovered in the kitchen sink. DNA found on the knife matched both the defendant and his brother because, as identical twins, they shared the same DNA profile. In his first police interview on New Year's Day, Robert described his relationship with Christopher as 'fiery' and said drink could make him 'nasty' and 'short-tempered'. He added: 'We started arguing, I do not know about what... All I can remember is he picked a knife up and walked towards me and I sort of panicked. 'I do not remember much. I punched him - I had a knife in my hand. He yelped and I ran out of the door.' In a later interview he said he had not intended to kill his brother but had 'just reacted'. Christopher Cerqua was described in tributes as 'thoughtful and caring', and had recently got back together with girlfriend Lisa Harfield, 40, a receptionist. The couple had previously dated for six years and her son and three daughters described him as a ‘father figure’.","Robert and Christopher Cerqua were at parents' home in Hythe, Hampshire .

"Gwyneth Paltrow is known for her strict diet and rigorous exercise regime. But it seems that the famously controlled star is finally loosening up - and real women out there will breathe a sigh of relief after reading her latest Goop post. The mother-of-two, who recently split with husband Chris Martin, said: 'Those of you who have read goop for a long time know that we try to do well by our bodies, our kids, and the environment as much as possible but we make allowances for real life, too. Go Gwyneth! The A-lister, who swears by a strict vegan lifestyle, has opened up on her Goop blog about how pizza, a cigarette at a party, a perfect martini and a daily glass of red wine can make a week more pleasurable, or a night out with friends more fun . 'Not only is any concept of “perfection” untenable (and maddening), but it's not so enjoyable, either. 'Pizza, a cigarette at a party, a perfect martini, a daily glass of red…these aren’t “cheats” or “indulgences” - these are just moments that can make a week more pleasurable, a night out with friends more fun.' Tome: Gwyneth may  have written an entire book on her healthy lifestyle but proving she's a down-to-earth Hollywood star, she admits that she allows herself treats . Gwyneth was a trailblazer for the vegan lifestyle she - and now many of her Hollywood pals -advocate. After a gruelling schedule and lapse of overindulgence two years ago, Gwyneth was left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed that she was anaemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels were sky high. Her doctor prescribed an elimination diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed food to clear out her system and help her body heal - and she got everyone else on board, including her children and husband. So stringent is her approach to diet she once admitted that her whole family can at times feel hungry because she will not allow them to eat carbohydrates like bread, pasta or white rice. However, after ‘consciously uncoupling’ from his marriage to Hollywood actress Gwyneth, Chris Martin relinquished the vegetarian lifestyle that came with it and is now once again a carnivore. Feeling confident: Gwyneth was a host at the AmfAR gala in LA on Wednesday night where Chris Martin received a rousing introduction by his ex . The 37 year-old British star let slip about his change in diet during an interview with Steve Wright on Radio 2. ‘I am not really vegetarian. I eat meat. I was vegetarian for a long time but for various reasons I changed. 'My daughter [Apple, 10] has been a vegetarian since she was born. I keep getting tempted to go back but I don’t eat too much meat.’ The pair separated earlier this year and Chris was linked with Hunger Games actress, Jennifer Lawrence. They have, however, reportedly split already. Chris Martin made his first public appearance since his split from Jennifer  - with a little help from his estranged wife Gwyneth Paltrow. The Coldplay singer, 37, was a surprise performer at the AmfAR gala in LA on Wednesday night where he received a rousing introduction by his ex. Paltrow hosted the event and kicked off the night by bringing Martin and his band mate Jonny Buckland on stage to perform the band’s hit songs Paradise and Viva La Vida.

"A family have told how their car was surrounded by royal protection officers after they broke down near the Duchess of Cambridge's parents' home - before they went on to have a brush with Kate herself. Adam De Marco, 40, his partner Claire Lennon, 39, and their daughter Mia, seven, were on a family day out in Bucklebury, near Newbury, Berkshire, when their BMW sprung a puncture. Their stricken vehicle quickly attracted the attention of royal minders, who ordered them out of the car, they said. Adam De Marco, 40, his partner Claire Lennon, 39, and their daughter Mia, broke down near the Duchess of Cambridge's parents' house and attracted the attention of royal protection officers . The family later saw Kate, her mother and Prince George shopping at a nearby farm and took this photo of them . The family were heading for Bucklebury Farm Park, not far from the £7 million home of the Duchess of Cambridge's parents Michael and Carole Middleton. Kate, who is 14 weeks pregnant, is staying at the closely-guarded mansion with Prince William and baby Prince George while she battles severe morning sickness. Spotting Mr De Marco's car apparently parked so close to the house, armed royal protection officers were quick to intervene. But the specialist police officers put away their guns and offered to help the family after realising what had happened. The family later spotted Kate, her mother Carole and Prince George at the nearby farm. Mr De Marco, director of a print company in Andover, Hampshire, said: 'We got the flat tyre as we drove Mia to the farm park, where children can play on the swings and look at the animals.' The Duchess, pictured (left) at a charity event in London last week and (right) with Prince George, is currently staying with her parents as she battles severe morning sickness during her second pregnancy . The family broke down on their way to Bucklebury Farm, not far from the Middleton's home . He added: 'I went to put on the spare, but then realised I was missing the special screw-nut you need with a BMW to remove the wheel - it's meant to stop thieves. 'I was in a quandary, wondering what to do...then all of a sudden we found ourselves surrounded by policemen who were carrying guns. 'I didn't twig at first that they were connected with the royal family, but one of them mentioned Prince William and the Middletons' house nearby and we put two and two together. 'Once they realised we were not terrorists, they relaxed and offered to help. 'They even drove off to visit a couple of garages in the area to see if anyone had a spare screw-nut so we could change the flat tyre.' 'Unfortunately they came back empty-handed and said nobody had one, so we had to phone the RAC who arrived to changed the wheel.' He added: 'By that time it was too late to go to the park. Mia was a bit disappointed because she'd been looking forward to it, so we went back the next day. The village of Bucklebury has often seen royal guards move in when Kate and Wills visit her parents . 'And while we were there, we saw Kate, her mum and Prince George at the farm shop, where you can buy fresh meat and other food.

"DJ Ray Teret, pictured outside court today, raped a teenager who responded to his magazine advert looking for 'the next teenage pop sensation', a jury has heard . A DJ - accused of raping a 15-year-old girl with Jimmy Savile - attacked another teenager who responded to his magazine advert looking for 'the next teenage pop sensation', a jury has heard. Former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret, 72, raped the 17-year-old who was given a 'promise of the dream' of fame and fortune but ultimately the defendant did not find the budding singer 'a jot of work', Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court was told. Teret, then aged in his mid-50s, was said to have impressed the girl when he took her to his house in the mid-1990s and showed her a Porsche car, gold and platinum discs and lots of photographs on the walls of him with famous people. Tim Evans, prosecuting, said he went on to tell the youngster 'there were lots of things potentially happening career-wise' and she needed to be in the 'bright lights of Manchester'. It led to 'a big send-off' from her family as Teret collected her and drove her to his flat where he raped her after she had red wine for the first time and became drunk. The alleged victim was said to have gone 'into a bit of a lockdown' as she submitted rather than consented to sex, the court heard . Teret then gave her £40 to buy a new dress, said Mr Evans. Only 'the promise of the dream' persuaded her to stay as Teret continued his abuse, he added. Mr Evans said: 'She got to the stage where she protested and his answer to that was telling, you may think. He would say that she was too attractive, her fault then, and more significantly that he couldn't do things for her without it happening. 'Could he make it any clearer to this 17-year-old girl who had not got the fame promised, that sex was the price for the fame she wanted.' He went on: 'And the fame and fortune promised? Teret didn't find her a jot of work. Was providng her with work ever what he was truly interested in?' Teret, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, denies 18 rapes, two other serious sexual assaults, one attempted rape, 11 indecent assaults and two counts of indecency with a child. The historical offences dating back to 1962 are in relation to 17 different girls. Two other men are also on trial with Teret. Alan Ledger, 62, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child. William Harper, 65, of Stretford, denies one count of attempted rape. Mr Evans told the jury: 'All of the witnesses talk of the various ways in which they have been affected. Depression, anger, feelings of worthlessness, relationship problems, how it has affected their attitude to sex and the like. 'Some had counselling, some did not. But each was to a greater or lesser extent affected by what they say Mr Teret and these other defendants, and other men not on trial, did to them all those years ago.' Former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret is pictured, right, sitting next to Jimmy Savile . Yesterday, when opening his case, Mr Evans said Teret took a naive 15-year--old girl to a flat in the Manchester area in a bubble car in 1963 or 1964 and she 'couldn't believe it' when she found Savile was there. Savile then raped the girl, followed immediately by Teret, he said. Mr Evans said Teret then told her: 'You should be thanking us because we have made it easier for when the next person goes there.' He said Savile had put his hands up her skirt, pulled her knickers down, pushed her down on the bed and then raped her. Teret was said to have had a 'deal of celebrity' in the '60s and '70s, especially in the Manchester area. He said he worked at the pirate station Radio Caroline and Piccadilly Radio. The prosecutor said: 'The Crown's case, in a nutshell, is that he used the celebrity that he had to abuse young girls in various ways and that the other two defendants - Mr Ledger and Mr Harper, friends and associates of Teret - also became involved on occasions.' He told the jurors that they were not tasked with determining the scale of Savile's abuse and that the defendants should not be contaminated 'because of the spectre of Savile'. Today, outlining more of the allegations, Mr Evans said one complainant aged 12 or 13 was encouraged to introduce her friends, also complainants, to Teret. She said she first met Teret at a record shop he ran. The complainant said she went on to regularly meet him at his flat and was said to have 'frozen' as Teret took her virginity. Mr Evans said that on one occasion Teret committed a serious sexual assault on her while club DJ Ledger held down her hands. The prosecutor said Teret took a naive 15-year--old girl to a flat in the Manchester area in a bubble car in 1963 or 1964 and she 'couldn't believe it' when she found Jimmy Savile (pictured) was there . When interviewed, the complainant told police that she recalled there was a wall in Teret's flat with graffiti on it which contained names, messages and phone numbers. The prosecutor said the jury would hear that, years later, the police were able to find such a wall and photographs of it would be shown during the trial. She said Teret would ask her to take friends of her own age to the flat and that she regularly attended in school uniform. Mr Evans said she ended up having sex with Teret until she was 15 and said the defendant was capable of kindness and could be charming and funny. The prosecutor said: 'The evidence of (the alleged victim) paints a terrible picture of depraved conduct, does it not? This is someone who became locked into a world where all values were utterly distorted, where Teret's kindness to her was used to achieve sex, her loyalty to him and, you may think, her hero-worship of him was such that she would continue to be involved with him and, much worse, she would even ask her friends to get involved.' One of those friends went on to be abused at the age of 13 by Teret and Ledger, according to the Crown. Mr Evans said this complainant was another 'young, naive, vulnerable' girl who was 'to a greater or lesser extent starstruck and charmed'. William Harper (pictured outside court today) denies one count of attempted rape . Another friend introduced to Teret at the age of 14 would record jingles for one of his radio shows and would be given free records. 'All of this led her and her friends to feel privileged and important because after all Mr Ray Teret was famous,' the prosecutor said. It led to her calling regularly at his flat and she was said to have been asked to give 'a special knock on the door' when she went round. Teret raped her one night as she recalled trying to fight him off, the court heard. Mr Evans said: 'He told her not to be scared and told her he was doing her a favour.' The same woman said that Ledger also indecently assaulted her and Teret aided and abetted the rape of her by a man called Pete. The next complainant said she was raped aged 13 by Teret and that on a separate occasion Harper - a DJ and presenter who went by the stage name of Tony Grey - attempted to rape her. Mr Evans said the girl was sent by Teret on 'a false errand' to collect a book from the home of Harper who tried to have sex with her before it was thought his mother interrupted him, the Crown claims. Teret was said to have raped another 13-year-old girl whom he met when he compered a talent show, while another girl aged 13 or 14 was raped after she met him in a pub. She went on to tell the police that she had only kissed a boy before having sex with Teret. Mr Evans said: 'She had said nothing during sex with Teret 'because he was a man and I was a kid and I wouldn't, I just wouldn't have said anything, I would have just done as I was told but I would have felt wrong saying something to someone that much older than me'. Another complainant, aged 15 at the time, recalled being indecently assaulted by Teret in his car at a time when he was a DJ on Signal Radio in the Staffordshire area. Mr Evans told the jurors that they would also hear evidence from witnesses about the Manchester club scene in the 1960s and 1970s, properties where Teret lived, cars he drove and places he worked. When interviewed following his arrest, Teret said he had used a bubble car driven by Savile but did not pick up any girls in it, said Mr Evans. Teret said he had never taken a girl from a club as described by numerous complainants and would not even be allowed to kiss girls in Savile's clubs because he forbade it. The defendant went on to say that teenage girls did nothing for him, said the Crown. But Mr Evans told the jury: 'In light simply of the evidence you will hear in this case, the Crown say that young teenage girls, far from doing nothing for him, were consistently pursued by him through the '60s and '70s.' The trial continues tomorrow when the first of the complainants will begin to give evidence.

"It should have been a time to savour the pinnacle of her career, but instead Robyn Gardiner's glittering world has turned to dust. Just weeks ago, the celebrity agent was lovingly thanked by Cate Blanchett as the actress accepted an Academy Award for best actress at a glittering Oscars ceremony. Now Gardiner's life - as a successful businesswoman and partner to a successful actor - has come crashing down as her husband Robert Hughes faces years in prison as a reviled child sex offender. It has also been claimed that Gardiner was told about her husband's sexual approaches to children on the set of his sitcom Hey Dad! 20 years ago. Her refusal to believe the allegations ended one of her oldest friendships. Robyn Gardiner (left) is seen leaving a Sydney court last month with husband and former Hey Dad! actor Robert Hughes, who has been found guilty of sexual assault. They are pictured with daughter Jessica Hughes (right) When Cate Blanchett said in her Oscars speech last month, 'To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much,' few if any of the Hollywood royalty in the audience would have known the significance of the statement. Blanchett's public thanks to Ms Gardiner came in the second week of the very public trial of Gardiner's husband on 11 child sexual assault offences against young females including a cast member in his career flagship Australian sitcom, Hey Dad! Ms Gardiner had snapped up Blanchett back in 1992 upon the promising young actor's graduation from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art, and has represented her ever since, also acquiring Blanchett's husband, theatre director Andrew Upton, as a client. It has now emerged that Ms Gardiner's star acquisition came at around the same time when stories about Robert Hughes sexual advances to a child TV star were known among the Hey Dad! cast, and the show's casting agent Liz Mullinar claims she approached Ms Gardiner to inform her. Following a jury's conviction last week of Hughes on ten child sex offences, Ms Mullinar, herself a victim of sexual abuse as a child, has come forward. Actor Robert Hughes has been convicted on child sex charges, after he was accused by former Hey Dad! actors and and the daughters of family friends of sexual assault . Robert Hughes in character as the father, Martin Kelly, in the sitcom Hey Dad!, which ran on Channel Seven from 1987 until 1994 . Ms Mullinar told the Nine Network's Today Show she had been close friends with both Robyn Gardiner and Robert Hughes for years before she learned about Hughes' behaviour from members of the Hey Dad! production. She claims she approached Ms Gardiner back then and was rebuffed. 'My whole life’s work had been to help people find healing and help,' Ms Mullinar told the Today Show. 'That’s why I told his wife because I thought that’s my duty, everybody has to know. She denied it and that was the end of a very long friendship, that’s what happens people deny it.' Hughes is currently in Australia's largest maximum security remand prison, in western Sydney, and awaiting sentence on ten charges which include seven counts of indecently assaulting a person under the age of 16 years, and two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years. The utter destruction of his career ends a four saga of accusations - and denials by Hughes, who even after his conviction yelled out in court, 'I am innocent'. Clockwise from centre front: Robert Hughes, Simone Buchanan, Christopher Truswell, Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, and Sarah Monahan. Ms Monahan accused Hughes of touching her inappropriately while on the set of the show . Robert Hughes entered a plea of not guilty on 11 charges relating to the alleged indecent and sexual assault of five girls, which are said to have occurred between 1985 and 1990, and his trial began on February 24. Robyn Gardiner supported her husband through almost six weeks of often lurid testimony at the trial. Hughes, the trial heard, touched girls as young as seven, gave one victim a teddy bear and called her a 'good girl' after forcing her to perform a sex act. He also exposed himself on set and indecently assaulted some of his victims. Ms Gardiner gave evidence at the trial, saying she was shocked at the accusations against her husband, and rejected the testimony of a former woman friend of the couple . The woman said when her then seven-year-old daughter told her Hughes would molest her during sleepovers at his Artarmon house in the mid-1980s she refused to allow her to go back. Soon afterwards, the woman said, Hughes’ wife Robyn Gardiner asked her why the girl wasn’t sleeping over any more. 'I said words to the effect of 'ask your husband' or 'keep your husband away from my kids,' the woman told the jury. 'She said 'we will have to get him help'.' Challenged about these allegations in the witness box, Gardiner denied saying this and then. 'Absolutely not,' she said repeatedly and and denied lying to save her husband. I’m under oath here, she did not say those words,” Ms Gardiner told the court. She told the court the first allegation she was aware of - that Hughes had exposed himself to a young girl at their home in the 1980s - was 'bad enough'. 'I love you so very much': Cate Blanchett, who was represented by Robyn Gardiner, thanked the agent in her Oscars acceptance speech . She said police investigated and took no action. 'It's not as if I brushed it aside... I saw no evidence to suggest it was true,' she said. Liz  Mullinar claimed on Radio 3AW that she had acted 20 years ago to get Robert Hughes sacked from Hey Dad! after informing the show's producers about the abuse. 'We had to get him off the show because of these allegations,' she said. Asked if, at the time, she believed her 'dear friend' could have done the kind of things he was accused of, Ms Mullinar said: 'Yes I did believe them [the allegations], and I did know 20 years ago. 'And even then, as a survivor of child abuse myself, I was, and have been, very public about it. 'I think at the time I didn't realise that paedophiles are your friends. They are lovely, fantastic people. They are not greasy men in dirty coats. 'That it could be someone who I was so close and intimately involved with was terrible. I told his wife and it was a terrible, terrible shock to be surrounded by child abuse.' Robert Hughes will be sentenced on May 2.

"Maybe Floyd Mayweather is right. Perhaps people are so blinded by their irritation with his garish lifestyle outside the ring that they cannot see his genius when he knuckles down in sport’s hardest work-place. So eager are so many of the public – and some of the pundits – to see him lose that they cannot bear to watch how brilliantly he wins. Which, by the way, he has now done in all 47 of his professional fist-fights. Floyd Mayweather (TBE) is the centre of attention after his victory over Marcos Maidana . Mayweather reacts to Maidana's bite on Saturday night and (right) goads the dazed Argentine . There is something ludicrous about a grown man who is so obsessed with earning hundreds of millions dollars that he nicknames himself Money disposing of so much of that hard-earned cash on over-priced bling. But that should not affect judgement of his phenomenal boxing talent. By no means everyone at the Las Vegas ringside on Saturday night gave Mayweather credit for the brilliant way he snuffed out the wild, raging, often illegal and, yes, outrageously biting assault on his record and his world titles by Marcos Maidana. It was a masterful performance of bewildering elusive movement – which defied his 37 years – and explosive power, which frequently left his younger challenger not only pawing at thin air but gasping for the breath to survive. Lots of Money but no fun, complained some, presumably choosing to ignore how the humorous way he personally redirected the befuddled and frustrated Maidana when he kept wandering towards the wrong corner at the end of the round. Mayweather expresses indifference to such lack of admiration but there can be little doubt that it irks a man who is so preoccupied by his legacy that his cap bears the log TBE… The Best Ever. Yet he continues to prevaricate about meeting the one opponent he needs to defeat if he is even to be considered as great as the two Sugar Rays – Robinson and Leonard. Manny Pacquiao was the other name on everyone’s lips as future opponents for Mayweather were discussed. It has been for years now and unless they trade blows before one of them retires the public will be entitled to feel deprived. Even so Mayweather, having said initially ‘Let’s make it happen,’ immediately back-tracked into his tired and inappropriate demand that the PacMan’s promoter Bob Arum would have to be excluded from the $300million event. Mayweather must fight Manny Pacquiao (left, with next opponent Chris Algieri) to secure his legacy . That has given rise to optimism that our own Amir Khan will finally get his chance, next year, to prove that his speed can wreak the downfall of Mayweather, who he assesses as ‘looking older and slower.’ That expectation is fuelled further by Mr Money, grand master that he is, pondering a different end game. Having declared his intention to retire after two fights next year, he has shifted the ring posts again by hinting that he may not box again until September 2015. The excuse is that his body may need a year to fully recover from his physical effort against Maidana but the intention could well be to extend his career into 2016. By then the MGM Grand hotel and casino, the home for his mega-fights, will have constructed a new, state-of-the art indoor stadium significantly large than the 16,000-plus capacity Grand Garden they use at the moment. Amir Khan (left) may get another chance to fight Mayweather, whom he watched vs Maidana with Mike Tyson . Mayweather volunteered to take part in the ground-breaking for that project on the eve of his first fight with Maidana this May. So who better to inaugurate that glittering venue? What more glitzy way for Mayweather to climax his career? And who else to invite to participate in that spectacle other than Pacquiao, in the fight which would define them both. The man they love to hate appears to be planning to give everyone what they want. Boxing says a prayer for Wilson . Sheffield boxer Jerome Wilson is reported to be in ‘critical’ condition following a brain operation after he was knocked out in his home town on Friday night. The 29-year-old welterweight’s plight comes as a grim reminder of the risks which all fighters take, be it on a Mayweather mega-millions production in Las Vegas or for a modest purse in a local hall. Across that entire spectrum, the boxing fraternity will be praying for one of their number in distress.","Floyd Mayweather has won all his 47 professional fights .

"A Twitter-user signposted cyber-attacks which crippled the Home Office website by flooding it with huge amounts of internet traffic, a jury has heard. Mark Johnson, 44, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, is accused of encouraging the attack by the international hacking group Anonymous, which sent the Government sites into meltdown. The prosecution say Johnson encouraged a cyber-attack on websites run by the Home Office and Home Secretary Theresa May by posting links on his Twitter page. Mark Johnson (pictured) is accused of encouraging the attack by the international hacking group Anonymous . Johnson is alleged to have posted a link on his social media account which meant other web users could join in with the hacking attack launched by the cyber activist group Anonymous in 2012. A court heard the Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attack - where a website is flooded with traffic to make it crash - took place between June 15 and June 18, 2012. It began when hackers Anonymous posted a video on YouTube on June 12 which announced 'Operation Theresa May' - a two-day online assault on the Home Secretary. Home secretary Theresa May was targeted as part of a two-day online assault by hacking group Anonymous . Johnson is accused of posting a link to the code for the attack on the Home Office on his Twitter page @mlyjohn on June 15, 2012. The court heard his tweet has since been deleted and he told police somebody must have hacked into his account to post the link. But the jury of 10 women and two men were told computer experts had analysed his computer and found there was no evidence of anyone accessing his device. Johnson denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Timothy Devlin, opening the prosecution case on the first day of his trial at Birmingham Crown Court, said: 'What this really is a case about is computer hacking. 'The offence was what is called a Distributed Denial Of Service. What we accuse Mr Johnson of doing is helping others to crash the Home Office computers. 'DDOS is a situation where a large number of people simultaneously make requests of a website. The Crown alleges Johnson, of Josiah Wedgwood Street, assisted in the web attacks on both the Home Office website and the home secretary's constituency website by posting a 'malicious' weblink through his Twitter account which, when clicked, allowed a web-user to add their connection to the cyber assault. 'We say Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account,' said Mr Devlin. 'He was saying 'if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May's website, here's the link'.' He added: 'We say Mark Johnson published links on Twitter for people to get involved in these joint attacks.' Mr Devlin told the court the DDOS attack used a malicious webpage which opened connections to the Home Office page in large numbers. He said the Government website received a message saying 'we are legion' - which is a phrase from the Bible used by Anonymous - every time someone clicked on the link for the attack. The court heard in just under 30 minutes from 9.34pm on June 17, 2012, 8,347 connections were made to the Government site - rendering it unresponsive to users and causing it to be taken down. The sheer weight of connections meant that an alternative 'disaster recovery' version of the site had to be put online in place of the main site, Mr Devlin told the court. Mr Devlin added: 'It (the Home Office page) was being bombarded so quickly they had to take it down and a substitute was put on the internet with reduced functionality. 'It was there to replace the real website, normal service was resumed the following day (June 18, 2012). Johnson denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 . 'These connections, the 8,347, were made by a variety of originators of the same DDOS message being circulated. 'That means a large number of people were able to click on a connection which then sent a message to the Home Office website and that helped close it down. 'During the attack on the Home Office website, Theresa May's constituency website was also attack from links posted on Twitter. The website ceased to function. 'And what we are saying is that Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account. 'So what he was doing was saying if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May websites then here is the link and other people look at that and click that link. 'Mr Johnson says no I didn't, it must have been somebody else using my Twitter account. 'If Mr Johnson is saying this wasn't me that posted this on my Twitter account then it must have been someone else and how did they do it because they don't have his password. 'You're going to hear evidence that on the day he was arrested all his computers were taken and they've all been examined by an expert and no malware, no Trojans or no other performance email has gone in to that account which has enabled another person to steal his password. 'So the only person who had that password was Mark Johnson.' The court heard after police traced Mr Johnson to his home he deleted his tweet from June15 and changed his Twitter account from an open setting to a private one. His @mlyjohn account, has a header picture showing numerous images of the infamous Guy Fawkes white mask motif used by Anonymous. Mr Devlin explained to the trial jury at Birmingham Crown Court that Johnson does not deny supporting some of global hacking group Anonymous' campaigns. Johnson, who wore a white shirt with a dark suit jacket, sat in the dock listening intently to proceedings. Jurors also heard in August 2012, two months after the Home Office attack, Johnson posted a link to an Anonymous group YouTube video regarding another cyber attack, which this time targeted the San Francisco public transport system in the United States. The jury is next set to hear from a prosecution cyber expert, with the trial expected to last a week.

"There are no longer  four basic face shapes, with scientists identifying five new distinct shapes among Australian faces. Dr Kendra Schmid, a leading facial recognition scientist, analysed over 1000 faces from different states across Australia, unmasking five new face shapes. New face shapes that were discovered are kite, rectangle, teardrop, heptagon and oblong in research conducted by Dr Kendra Schmid. Before this research, more than half of Australians thought their face was oval, however, it has turned out that only 14 per cent actually have this shaped face. The most common face shape among Australia's is a new model, coined, 'Kite' (above). A study found 20.4 per cent of Australians have a kite shaped face . The research, commissioned by OPSM Opticians, found that around one-third of Australians are unsure of their face shape, prompting the company to better understand the different shapes of individuals. The most common face was a new  model, coined 'kite', which is found among 20.4 per cent of Australians. The second most common shape is the heart frame, which is a more traditional pre-existing shape among Australians. Australian super model Miranda Kerr has a square shaped face. People with square shaped faces have an angular shape, where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal . 'Rarer types such as teardrop, heptagon and oblong, although reflecting a relatively small percentage of Australians of only 5 per cent each, all have very distinct features that set them apart form more common groups,' Dr Schmid told Daily Mail Australia. She said that the most surprising discovery was the diversity in face shapes. 'I did not expect to find nine shapes that stood out so prominently,' she said. 'This was really the first study of its kind and so I was really surprised with the number of shapes.' Dr Schmid said that knowing your face shape is just as important as knowing your shoe size or clothing size. She said that this research helps Optometrists to 'better understand their customers and the type of frames that would suite them best'. 'You go shopping for shoes and dresses knowing your size, so knowing your shape face also makes you feel and look your best', Dr Schmid said. But Dr Schmid said a lot of people confuse their shape with existing models. 'An oval shape is very similar to a kite face but it has more even features like the forehead and jawline, which is more even in terms of length and curve,' she said. When asked whether there is one particular shape that is more attractive amongst others, Dr Schmid insisted that beauty was in the eye of the beholder. 'The measurements that we used for this research is just a small part to determine someone's attractiveness - any shape could be just as beautiful - the attractiveness is more about features and symmetry rather than the shape'. Australian actress Cate Blanchett (left) has a kite shaped face, one of the most popular shapes found among Australians. Singer, Kylie Minogue (right), has a heart shape face, the second most common shape among Australians . But when it comes to models, Dr Schmid admits they tend to have a square shaped face. 'They have a defined bone structure and everything is fairly in proportion'. Only 11 per cent of Australians have a square shaped face, among them is super model Miranda Kerr. OPMS describes their characteristics as 'an angular face shape, where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal'. Other Australian celebrities were put through a face analysis which found Kylie Minogue with a heart shaped face, Rose Byrne with an oval shaped face, and Cate Blanchett with a kite shaped face. Dr Schmid analysed 1000 Australian faces using image processing and point detection software. 'I took measurements with the points and used something called cluster analysis which grouped people in their category', she said. #1 KITE: 20% of Australians . Characteristics: Kite face shapes have prominent cheekbones, which are slightly wider than the mid and lower forehead. The kite face narrows at the jawline and the chin. #2 HEART: 20 % of Australians . Characteristics: Heart faces have a longer and wider forehead, with cheekbones a similar width to the lower forehead. Hearts have a slightly more prominent jaw than kite shapes and narrow at the chin. #3 RECTANGLE: 16% of Australians . Characteristics: Rectangle faces are recognisable by their defined jaw line, of similar width to the cheekbone and lower forehead. #4 OVAL: 14% of Australians . Characteristics: Ovals are typically smaller than average on all measures. Oval faces are widest at the cheekbone and narrow through the forehead and jaw. #5 ROUND: 11% of Australians . Characteristics: Round faces have soft, balanced features, typically with a shorter face length and narrower cheek and jawline. #6 SQUARE: 7% of Australians . Characteristics: An angular face shape, where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal. Square faces are angular with wider but equal forehead cheekbone and jaw width. #7 TEARDROp: 5% of Australians . Characteristics: Teardrops is a shorter face, with a narrow forehead and cheekbone. This is the only group for which the forehead length is shorter than the chin. #8 HEPTAGON: 4% of Australians . Characteristics: Heptagon faces are typically longer than average. Their most striking features are a wide forehead and prominent cheekbones. #9 OBLONG: 2% of Australians . Characteristics: While rare, the oblong differs from other groups being longer and wider through all measures.","One-third of Australians do not know their face shape .

"Stanley Chola, 10, from Whitley, Berkshire underwent a circumcision in Zimbabwe during the summer holidays . There were 'missed opportunities' to save a 10-year-old from an infection possibly caused by a circumcision carried out in Africa, an inquest heard today. Stanley Chola, 10, from Whitley, Berkshire underwent the procedure in Zimbabwe during the summer holidays. Nearly two months later on October 13, 2013 he went into septic shock and died in hospital. At the time it was thought the infection might have been caused by an injury to his knee, either from being hit with a hockey stick by another pupil or while playing football. However, a leading doctor said the two theories were 'very unlikely' to be the case. Today, a coroner delivered a narrative verdict of Stanley's death, and said that the fatal infection had not diagnosed because of a combination of 'unfortunate events and circumstances'. Stanley, a pupil at New Christ Church School in Reading, Berkshire, went with his family to Zimbabwe during the summer holidays last year and was circumcised on August 23. However, he was absent during the first week of the new term and his step-father, Malik Issa, told a member of school staff this was because he had developed an infection from the circumcision. On October 7 his mother, Ellen Gomes, took Stanley to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, with her son complaining about a knee problem caused while playing football. The inquest heard the injury may have been caused by another pupil hitting Stanley with a plastic hockey stick. The inquest heard Ms Gomes took Stanley to a GP again the following day, but there appeared to be no reason for major concern. On October 11 his mother spoke to a doctor over the phone and told them Stanley had developed a chesty cough, abdominal pains and was not eating. She also said he was suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea. Stanley was prescribed antibiotics and the doctor said the information his mother had given did not suggest he needed to be seen in person. At around 4.40am on October 12, 2013, paramedics were called to the family's home in Laburnum Gardens in Whitley, after a call to say Stanley was unable to walk because of his knee pain. Discussing the possibility that the circumcision was the cause of Stanley's death, the Coroner said: 'That evidence is, I think, at best confusing. It is certainly not definitive. That is the less likely explanation' The paramedics said he was able to walk but that his breathing and oxygen saturation level were unusual and that Stanley also had a slight temperature. An appointment was arranged for the boy to see a doctor at 8am the next morning, but he did not attend. Dr Lade said: 'This was a pivotal moment in Stanley's case because had he been seen by a doctor that Saturday morning and appropriate treatment and investigations taken place, he might have been saved.' When Stanley did not attend his appointment, the Westcall service would normally have contacted the family, but a systems failure that day and the fact they could not find a number for Ms Gomes, made this impossible. The next day a paramedic was scrambled to the family home at around 7.40pm after Stanley started having breathing difficulties. His right calf was described as very firm and swollen and the paramedic found marks on his thigh, which his mother said were healing boils. On arrival at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, doctors diagnosed Stanley with septic shock and said his chances of survival were slim. His condition rapidly deteriorated and doctors twice performed CPR before Stanley was declared dead at 11.35pm. Dr Lade told the inquest it was not uncommon for children with sepsis to die very quickly. The inquest heard that the boils on Stanley's thigh could have been caused by the circumcision infection and Dr Shabnam Iyer, a microbiologist who helped with the post-mortem examination, said the infection could have spread from the skin and into Stanley's leg. Coroner Peter Bedford said when Stanley's mother told an out-of-hours doctor over the phone that her son had developed vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, he should be been sent for a physical examination. However, Mr Bedford added that the nature of the infection would still have made diagnosis difficult. Pathologist Steven Gould told the inquest that the most likely source of the deadly infection was boils found on his upper thigh. The inquest was also told that there was no evidence of Stanley being attacked, with police investigating the matter after suggestions he was hit with a hockey stick prior to his death. Delivering a narrative verdict, Mr Bedford said that despite Stanley being seen by various healthcare professionals, they had not diagnosed his 'serious and developing' infection because of a combination of 'unfortunate events and circumstances'. Mr Bedford added: 'It is likely that the source of Stanley's fatal infection was boil-type lesions that developed in skin tissue and caused cellulitis in the right leg and then spread through the venous system into the lung. 'There were missed opportunities to admit Stanley to hospital earlier than October 13. 'However, the virulent nature of the fatal infection and the difficulty in diagnosis because of the gradual onset of symptoms makes it uncertain, in my view, that earlier diagnosis would have affected the outcome.' Discussing the possibility that the circumcision was the cause of Stanley's death, which is disputed by his mother, Mr Bedford said: 'That evidence is, I think, at best confusing. It is certainly not definitive. That is the less likely explanation.' Dr Gould said there remained unanswered questions about exactly where the infection came from. 'We believe that this particular organism spread from the boils and settled in this area in the knee,' Dr Gould told the inquest. 'I have never seen that before. It is highly unusual.' Speaking after the inquest, his family said they would wait until they had received the coroner's report and spoken with their lawyer before deciding what further action to take. Ms Gomes said: 'He was a lovely boy, a very happy boy. 'It is one year this month that Stanley has been away from his mother.' Mr Issa added: 'We will forever remember him, there is no way we can forget him.'","Inquest heard there were 'missed opportunities' to save Stanley Chola .

"Last year it was the enduring friendship of a hare and a bear that melted our hearts. Twelve months on, John Lewis hopes the bond between a boy and a penguin will similarly capture the public’s imagination. This year’s two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty. Scroll down for video . This year's John Lewis Christmas ad tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, left, and his penguin friend Monty . During the commercial, the boy eventually realises that Monty is longing for a penguin companion of his own . The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel. The soundtrack is John Lennon’s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell. The company has spent £1million creating the ad, while £7million will be spent on the marketing campaign. Ever since 2009, the chain’s commercials have proved to be the most popular of all those offered by retailers at Christmas. All have managed to deliver an emotional and powerful story, generating a buzz on social media with many viewers happy to admit they have been reduced to tears. More importantly, their popularity has been central to boosting sales growth at the retail giant which has been the envy of the high street. The ad concludes with Sam surprising Monty on Christmas morning with the gift of a new penguin friend called Mabel . The record of success means there is huge pressure on the company, its advertising agency and the commercial’s director to ensure John Lewis remains at number one. Last year, John Lewis relied on traditional Disney animation techniques to create the story of the bear and the hare. The success of the recent John Lewis Christmas commercials has been heavily founded on the soundtrack songs designed to pluck at the heart strings. In 2009, the soundtrack to images of children morphing into adults as they unwrapped their presents was a version of the Guns N’ Roses song Sweet Child O’ Mine, recorded by the Swedish folk band, Taken By Trees. John Lewis has spent £1million creating the ad, while £7million will be spent on the marketing campaign . Other successful choices included a version of The Smiths ‘Please, Please, Please let me get what I want’. Two years ago, the commercial featured a snowman’s determined trek to find his loved one a perfect gift to a version of The Power of Love by young English singer, Gabrielle Aplin. And last year, Lily Allen reached number one with her take on Keane’s hit ‘Somewhere Only We Know’. This year, the company is turning to John Lennon and the track Real Love, which will be performed by Tom Odell under the slogan ‘Give Someone The Christmas They’ve Been Dreaming Of’. The ad launches on the retailer’s social media channels today and will screen on television tomorrow during the first advert break in Gogglebox on Channel 4. John Lewis marketing director Craig Inglis said: ‘At John Lewis, this time of year is all about helping our customers create their dream Christmas. The soundtrack to the commercial is the John Lennon track Real People, which is performed by Tom Odell . ‘We hope this uplifting tale of Sam’s love for his friend Monty will remind people of the magic of Christmas through a child’s eyes and inspire them to think how they can make the festive season extra special for their friends and loved ones.’ John Lewis stores will selling themed merchandise around the marketing campaign and creating spaces in its stores called Monty’s Den, which feature ‘technology firsts’ such as Monty’s Magical Toy Machine and Monty’s Goggles that use Microsoft technology and Google Cardboard to allow children to enter a virtual world and interact with the characters. Merchandise includes a children’s book called Monty’s Christmas, where a proportion of the proceeds will go to Barnardo’s, plus stuffed toys, an umbrella and pyjamas.","New John Lewis Christmas advert is set to be launched online today .

"A Canberra public servant has argued for her right to longer breaks so she could travel to a cafe that served organic coffee with soy milk after her boss warned her about her absence at work. Following the warning, the Australian Taxation Office administrator fought back by issuing a complaint to the federal government's workplace authority but it was dismissed. After the case was thrown out, Pardeep Sidhu went on stress leave and claimed workers compensation for an 'adjustment disorder' which she said began once her supervisor approached her,The Sydney Morning Herald reports. A Canberra public servant told her boss she needed longer breaks because she had to go to a cafe that served organic coffee with soy milk . Ms Sidhu  issued an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that was rejected after finding the supervisor's correct in her dealings with the Executive Level 1 public servant. The tribunal found that the supervisor, Sky May, kept to workplace guidelines but Ms Sidhu argued that her boss tried to intimidate her after she applied for study leave that was rejected. 'The tribunal accepts this was a case in which there was a breakdown of the relationship between supervisor and employee, and this adversely affected the level of trust between the two and led to a considerable amount of hostile action by both,' tribunal member Robin Creyke said.

"An aspiring nurse who was out celebrating her birthday the day before she turned 22 has been killed by a drunk driver - just hours before her boyfriend was set to propose. Taylor McGonigle, from Baker, Louisiana, was with friends in the French Quarter of New Orleans at 5am on Sunday when Tevest Vance smashed into a balcony pole, which fell and struck her head. Vance, who has a lengthy criminal record and was  on probation for a 2011 felony drugs charge, tried to flee the scene but his car stalled and he was stopped by a passerby, police said. Officers noted he smelled of alcohol and recorded his blood-alcohol level of .214, which is more than twice the legal limit, the Times-Picayune reported. Torn apart: Taylor McGonigle, left, was killed in a freak accident when a car smashed into a balcony pole, which then fell on her head. Her boyfriend Kiara Brown, right, was going to propose to her the following day . Loved: 21-year-old Taylor, pictured with her mother Tina McGonigle, was an only child . McGonigle's friends, who were walking slightly ahead of her, heard the crash and turned around to see her on the ground, her mother said. An autopsy will determine her exact cause of death. Her boyfriend of three years, Kiara Brown, told the newspaper that he had planned to drive from his home in Lafayette to Baton Rouge the following day to surprise her and propose to her. The 24-year-old is now planning a funeral for his girlfriend, whom he was looking forward to moving in with next month, he wrote on Facebook. 'We were supposed to conquer the world together,' Brown told the Times-Picayune. 'I was going to propose to her tonight.' Heartbroken: Her mother, left, said she was furious that the driver who killed her daughter was on probation . Behind the wheel: Tevest Vance, pictured in a New Orleans Police photo, was allegedly drunk at the time . Driver: Vance was on probation for a 2011 drug conviction when he lost control of his car on Sunday morning and hit a pole. He tried to flee the scene but his car stalled and a passerby stopped him . The pair met in 2011 when they were both students at Job Corps, a free career-training program in Carville. where she was studying nursing assistant skills. McGonigle was an only child and cared for her grandmother, her mother Tina said. 'She had the kindest and most open personality,' her mother said. 'I'm so upset this man was out on (probation) ... and he was out drinking and driving and he murdered an innocent person.' Vance, 37, was out on probation for his sixth felony conviction at the time of the crash. Records show he has been arrested 13 times since 1995, including for marijuana distribution in 2009 and for selling crack cocaine in 2011, the Times-Picayune reported. Scene:  A television news camera man films a missing balcony pole after Vance crashed into it on Sunday . Wreck: A pedestrian passes broken sidewalk where the pole was attached before the crash . He was serving five years of probation for the 2011 arrest and was supposed to remain under supervision until July 2018.

"Stuart Lancaster insisted his England side is on track ahead of next year’s World Cup following a forward-dominated win over Australia at Twickenham. Ben Morgan and Courtney Lawes shone as England recorded their first win in seven attempts over the southern hemisphere’s big-three sides to leave Australia without a Test-match victory on their European tour. George Ford kicked 16 points while No 8 Morgan claimed the man-of-the-match award and afterwards Lancaster hailed his side’s powerful performance which went some way towards easing the pain of their opening QBE series defeats to New Zealand and South Africa.

Stuart Lancaster (second right), with coaches (from left) Mike Catt, Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell, believes the 'progression of key players' proves England are on the right track for next year's World Cup . Asked if he thought his injury-hit side were on course ahead of the World Cup, Lancaster said: . ‘Absolutely. It is always difficult going into an autumn series playing the world champions with limited preparation time. ‘We felt we competed well. We felt in the South Africa game we actually generated the opportunities for them rather than the other way round. ‘We have not got everything right by any stretch of the imagination, there’s still a lot of work to do. Ben Morgan gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score England's first try of the match . The England scrum will cause Michael Cheika many sleepless nights in the coming months . ‘But it feels better having won the last game. In certain areas the progression of key players has been a real bonus for us. We have got seven British Lions missing at the moment and they are all getting back fit now so progress up front, the scrum was very good. ‘Look at the quality of the players missing from the pack: (Joe) Launchbury, (Geoff) Parling, (Tom) Youngs, (Billy) Vunipola, (Alex) Corbisiero, (Dan) Cole, (Tom) Croft. What’s pleased me most is the emergence of the Kieran Brookes and the Matt Mullan and the contribution that George Kruis has made.’ A tribute is paid to Phillip Hughes on the big screen at Twickenham after the cricketer died on Thursday .

The packed Twickenham crowd paid a moving tribute to fallen Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes before the game but Australia were unable to deliver the victory their nation craved as England completely dominated the set-piece 10 months before the sides will meet again in the World Cup pool. ‘We wanted to make a statement in the final game of the campaign and I think we did that. It was a strong performance and we got the result,’ Morgan said. ‘It was important to sign off with a win and good performance. It will help us build into the Six Nations and gives everyone a positive feeling for the next few months. ‘The Six Nations is the last big tournament before the World Cup so it’s crucial we keep improving and moving forward.’ George Ford kicks a penalty against Australia at Twickenham during the November international on Saturday .","England beat Australia 26-17 at Twickenham on Saturday .

"Dave Attwood is happy for England to be branded 'the most boring team in the world' just as long as they win. The Bath lock proved central to England's set-piece pummelling of Australia that yielded a 26-17 victory in Saturday's final autumn Test at Twickenham. England salvaged some November series pride following damaging defeats to New Zealand and South Africa thanks to two Ben Morgan tries, both direct results of total scrum dominance. Bath lock Dave Attwood (left) has impressed for England throughout the November series . Attwood (left) rises hight to claim a lineout during his sides 26-17 victory over the Wallabies at Twickenham . Stuart Lancaster's side continue to struggle for fluency and continuity behind the scrum, but Attwood called on England to grind to victories through 10-man rugby whenever necessary. 'People can say we're the most boring team in the world if they want, but at the end of the day, winning is winning,' said Attwood. 'No one cares about style if you lose: no one is going to say, ""oh, you lost by three points, but you played so excitingly"". England's scrum was dominant throughout the contest with the Wallabies pack struggling to cope . 'People might talk about that for a day, but two months later, three months later, three years, six years later, nobody cares: people only care about results. 'We're in the business of producing results, so we're bitterly disappointed about the first two results, very pleased with the second two. 'So we'll build on that momentum and carry that into the Six Nations.' The England scrum will cause Michael Cheika many sleepless nights in the coming months . Boss Stuart Lancaster continued to claim that England will gain no psychological advantage through Saturday's victory at next year's World Cup. The importance cannot be underestimated however of avoiding not just a sixth defeat in seven matches but also a seventh consecutive loss to one of the three southern hemisphere superpowers. England will host Australia at Twickenham in a World Cup Pool A rematch next year: whatever Lancaster's protestations, the scale of this scrummage-based victory will still resonate come that Saturday, October 3 collision. Ben Morgan gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score England's first try . Head coach Lancaster is no nearer to unearthing his World Cup midfield combination, despite steady tactical work from fly-half George Ford. Billy Twelvetrees, restored after a four-Test exile, was overawed by Matt Toomua in the centre, with Brad Barritt as combative in defence and limited in attack as ever. Attwood underscored England's tight-five depth by excelling across the autumn in the absence of the injured Joe Launchbury. The former Gloucester and Bristol lock admitted England scented scrum blood almost from the start against the Wallabies. England's scrum demolished the Australian pack which allowed Morgan to drive over for his second try . 'That's the nature of international rugby: if you can pile pressure on the opposition eventually you will get your reward,' said Attwood. 'The first couple of scrums, to be fair they came at us; and it was a pretty stern contest. 'But in the third or fourth scrum, we got the ball in, we kept it in, and they decided ""right, let's start defending now"". 'That's the green light: think ""well, you can defend all you want, we're going to take a penalty here"". Chris Robshaw (centre) celebrates victory with props David Wilson (left) and Kieran Brookes . 'We've got some really credible threats up front; Davey Wilson and Joe Marler are in great form. 'Then there's Dylan Hartley going well and Rob Webber when he came on, so we've got some great players in the front row.' England achieved November pack potency without crocked front-line stars Alex Corbisiero, Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Launchbury, Geoff Parling and Tom Croft. Attwood expects an exciting Six Nations campaign should England report a cleaner bill of health, but still hopes to retain his place even amid sterner competition. Stuart Lancaster (second right), with coaches (from left) Mike Catt, Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell . 'It's been quite a long time in the wilderness for me, so to get back and have four starts in four very strong pack performances, I would like to say I was a key part of that,' he said. 'There's massive strength in my position: it's a bit unfortunate for me but great for England.

"Whiskey Element claims to make cheap alcohol taste like expensive whiskey by infusing it with a woody flavour when placed in a decanter (pictured) Rare, vintage bottles of whiskey can cost anywhere up to $1.4 million (£874,150) and can be aged in oak barrels stored in cellars for years. Now, there’s a wooden tool that saves time and money called ‘Whiskey Element,’ which claims to be able to make cheap liquor taste expensive in just 24 hours. The oak sticks are specially designed to ‘age’ the drink by filtering out impurities and infusing the whiskey with a more woody flavour similar to pricier tipples. The sticks have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall-surface area touching the liquid. They are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whiskey to replicate the taste of a more expensive tipple. They do this via ‘accelerated transpiration through capillary action,’ according to the Portland, Oregon-based company’s Kickstarter page, which means the liquid travels through tiny tubes in the wood. Time & Oak is raising money to the Whiskey Elements into production. The inventors say they got their idea while working in a liquor store when they asked themselves: ‘What’s the difference between top shelf and well, whiskey?’ ‘And then it hit us. If the goal is for the whiskey to filter in and out of the wood to remove toxins, get infused with flavour, and pull out those rich colours, what if the barrel isn’t the best design to achieve this process?,’ they wrote. Tony Peniche explained that wood barrels are used for containing whiskey because the wood is cut vertically so that capillaries are not exposed to the liquid, meaning that it doesn't slowly seep out of the sides of the wood. The sticks (pictured) have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall-surface area touching the liquid.They are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whiskey to replicate the taste of a more expensive bottle. The oak is cut horizontally to allow ‘accelerated transpiration through capillary action' The Elements are made from oak - like the barrels used for ageing expensive whiskey. The idea is that they mimic the ageing process to re-create the taste of pricey liquor after being placed in a bottle of cheap whisky for just 24 hours. They do this via transpiration through capillary action. The sticks are cut horizontally from a large piece of wood, so the grain runs down their length. This so there is a shorter distance for whiskey to travel through its capilaries, and 'age' the alcohol. It also has grooves to increase the surface area of wood touching liquid. The Whiskey Elements remove chemical compounds Methoxy-phenyl-Oxime and Acetaldehyde from cheap whiskey. The impurity found in pig faeces and chemical blamed for hangovers are not found in high-end whiskey. So once the sticks have been used, the expensive and cheap whiskey are more chemically similar and have a similar taste. The sticks are made by cutting the wood horizontally to provide a ‘shorter distance for whiskey to travel through its repetitive exposure to the capillaries, so it matures much faster and becomes of a much higher quality.’ To test the product, the inventors put their sticks through their paces in the lab, where they compared top shelf whiskey costing over $100 a bottle that had been aged for over 10 years, with cheaper versions treated with a Whiskey Element. They analysed the chemicals found in expensive and cheap whiskey. Researchers found that the cheap bottles contained high levels of Methoxy-phenyl-Oxime – found in pig and mouse faeces – and Acetaldehyde, a compound blamed for hangovers. In comparison, the expensive aged bottles contained almost none of either. The researchers then added the oak sticks to the cheap liquor and waited 24 hours before testing them again. Mr Peniche said: ‘The results were amazing. They showed characteristics found in top-shelf aged whiskeys with notably higher levels of the chemicals responsible for good flavours and smells, as well as a significant reduction in Methoxy-phenyl-Oxime and Acetaldehyde.’ Each stick can only be used once for maximum effectiveness and a two-pack is available to pre-order for $12 (£7.50) plus shipping. The company has also come up with natural flavoured sticks so that flavours including vanilla, cherry, maple, smokey and peaty can be infused into spirits.

"As Twickenham erupted and victory became reality, Stuart Lancaster punched the air and permitted himself a rare smile. He then acknowledged his debt to the principal architect of England’s triumph by reaching across to embrace the forwards coach Graham Rowntree. It was a generous gesture, and it told the tale of a revealing afternoon. To watch England On Saturday was to see the years roll away, back to those initial days of Martin Johnson’s stewardship, when success was frequently delivered through attrition. Back even to the Will Carling side of the early Nineties, when the pack called all the shots and the ball used to blink whenever it was exposed to daylight. The game has changed beyond recognition since those narrow-eyed eras, but Lancaster’s England are keeping their memory alive. Ben Morgan gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score England's first try of the match . Stuart Lancaster (second right) celebrates with coaches (from left) Mike Catt, Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell after England beat Australia to win the Cook Cup. Lancaster praised Rowntree's contribution to the win . England's scrum was thoroughly dominant in the victory over Australia on Saturday at Twickenham . Seeking World Cup indications at 10-months’ range is a foolish exercise; one might as well turn to tea-leaves or Tarot cards. But it seems as if Lancaster and his assistants have decided that pragmatism will rule and muscularity is the only way to go. You could sense as much in Lancaster’s slightly defensive demeanour on Saturday night whenever strategic issues were raised. He spoke of England playing ‘intelligently’, of playing a ‘smarter’ game. He paid tribute to the work Rowntree and the forwards had done, how they ‘created the platform’. He mentioned the way the team had played in ‘the right areas of the field’ and repeated three or four times his prepared statistics on the number of tries scored by England’s backs. He was wary, conscious that his methods would not meet universal approval. No matter; that appears to be the way that England have elected to play. All other options have been tentatively tried and regretfully ditched. And if purists are not enthralled by the performance, then Lancaster will lose no sleep. And yet... it seems a shame, an admission that England cannot compete with the world’s best on attractive terms. The number eight breaks an attempted Australian tackle to surge towards the line before the first of his tries . Chris Robshaw (centre) celebrates victory with props David Wilson (left) and Kieran Brookes . It is difficult to imagine England living with South Africa by placing all their faith in their pack. And as for New Zealand, they have already demonstrated in the opening autumn international that they can accommodate any approach England decide to take. They will not be intimidated at the front, nor outwitted at the back. Indeed, with a developing Wales and a rejuvenated Australia to be faced early on, blinkered intensity may not be sufficient to lift England out of the group. In fairness, England executed their narrow plan with stern efficiency. Courtney Lawes set a soaring standard of high technique and fervent commitment, Chris Robshaw performed quite brilliantly at the breakdown, while Ben Morgan, whether carrying the ball or laying his body on the defensive line, did a great deal more than his two bullocking tries and fully deserved his man-of-the-match award. Australia’s approach was quite different, but so too was their execution. Having chosen to run the ball on almost every occasion, they piled up handling errors with cavalier abandon. They will forever curse the genuinely crucial mistake, seven minutes from time, when the endlessly impressive Israel Folau strode on to a pass, drew the last white-shirted defender and flung a desperately reckless ball to Rob Horne. It should have sent the Australian wing stretching round beneath the posts. Instead, it flew into touch, and both the chance and the match were lost. England players celebrate Morgan's second try at Twickenham during the November international on Saturday . Northampton and England blindside Tom Wood feeds Ben Youngs after a clean take at lineout time . That single cameo said everything about Australia’s approach and their shortcomings. They spent 80 minutes intent on finding space, inventing opportunities, indulging their attacking instincts. With a touch more precision, they might have left England with an autumn to forget, instead, at the close of a long and arduous tour, they perished under a cluster of self-made errors. Lancaster will now contemplate the lessons of autumn. There will be spread sheets and video analysis and stats galore, since that is his way. And he will take great encouragement from the way in which certain young players have been tested and have emerged with credit. George Ford is now looking like the out-half who will shepherd England through the next few years, while the wings, Anthony Watson and Jonny May, have demonstrated a willingness to inflict all manner of damage on those rare occasions when they are in possession of the ball. England players jump for joy as their scrum crashes over the line to allow Morgan to score his second try . George Ford kicks a penalty against Australia at Twickenham during the November international on Saturday . The Twickenham crowd, who may have a part to play in events next year, showed every sign of getting behind their team in full-hearted fashion. One senses that they prize destinations far beyond mere journeys. And there are others who will be ready to come in. As Lancaster was eager to point out, England have seven Lions currently unavailable; players capable of making a real difference. And yet… there is little to lift the spirits, to enthuse the soul, to persuade anybody but the most ardent loyalists that England’s journey will culminate in the ultimate success. ‘We’re not getting carried away,’ said Lancaster. ‘There’s still a lot of work to do.’ Indeed, there is, and we should wish them well. And if they could go about that work with just a touch more flair, a shade more enterprise, and the merest dash of bright invention, how very much more confident England would feel.
