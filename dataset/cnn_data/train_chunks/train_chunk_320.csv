"(CNN) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo is in line to get billions of dollars in debt relief, World Bank officials said, cutting the amount the nation owes by more than 80 percent. International Monetary Fund and World Bank boards released a statement Thursday supporting $12.3 billion in debt relief for the central African nation. Congo received $11.1 billion in relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and $1.2 billion under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the organizations said in a statement. Congo qualifies for the relief because it has made efforts to strengthen its economy and resume good governance despite years of conflict, according to the Washington-based organizations. ""Progress in each of these areas also sets a solid foundation for advancing the country's development agenda going forward,"" said Brian Ames, the nation's mission chief for the International Monetary Fund. Congo marked 50 years of independence on Wednesday. The nation remains one of the world's poorest countries despite abundant natural resources such as copper and cobalt. Conflicts, mostly over natural resources, rage on in some regions. Violence, disease and famine have killed at least 5 million people in the past 12 years, leaving the country grappling with a humanitarian crisis.

"(CNN) -- A Rwandan rebel leader was arrested Monday in Paris, France, under an International Criminal Court warrant involving mass rape and other crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the court announced. Callixte Mbarushimana, a leader of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or FDLR in its French-language acronym, is charged with 11 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes including rape, gender-based persecution and property destruction by the FDLR in 2009, the ICC statement said. ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo thanked authorities in France, Germany, Congo and Rwanda for their help in the arrest of Mbarushimana, calling it a ""crucial step in efforts to prosecute the massive sexual crimes committed in the DRC,"" the statement said. The ICC statement called Mbarushimana the first senior leader arrested for the atrocities in North and South Kivu provinces of Congo. The FDLR comprises mainly Hutu extremists who fled to Congo after taking part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The statement blamed the group for instigating war in Congo as part of its efforts to topple the government in neighboring Rwanda, and of attacking civilians in North and South Kivu provinces in 2009. The ICC ""is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Mbarushimana, as Executive Secretary of the FDLR 'Steering Committee', has personally and intentionally contributed to a common plan of conducting attacks against the civilian population in order to create a 'humanitarian catastrophe' and to launch an international campaign to extort concessions of political power for the FDLR,"" said a separate ICC document issued Monday.

"Editor's note: Nima Elbagir is an international correspondent who has spent years investigating Africa's hidden stories from Somalia to Sudan and Congo. She has previously worked for ITN and Reuters. The one thing you're never prepared for every time you come back to Eastern Congo is how beautiful it is. At night the fishermen row home across Lake Kivu singing in Swahili, lanterns waving from the bows that arch across the top of their canoes. Even when you wind up through the hills, driving past Congolese army camps and watching for any signs that the militias are on the move, you still get distracted by the sugar cane sellers and the drooping red bell flowers growing wild by the roadside. It's only when you look closer that you start to notice the abandoned huts and half burned sheds hidden among the trees. It's kind of an analogy for the conflict itself. It seems to be hidden in plain sight from the eyes of the world. Every time I tell people I'm visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo, they tell me ""how awful."" But they also sound puzzled. It's almost like we've been hearing about this for so long that we've all kind of presumed that must mean that something is being done. The tragedy is that we haven't heard the half of it. Read how women are raped as a weapon of war . When the United Nations released a report stating it believed that over the last year 15,000 women had been raped in the eastern region of Congo, the consensus in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, was that there were many thousands more. Read about Congo's 'heartbreaking decade' Dr. Denis Mukwegi, the founder of the unit treating victims of sexual unit at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, said there are many more women in hard to reach areas who are going without treatment and help. Panzi has set up mobile clinics to try to get to these women in remote communities but as long as the violence continues to block roads and isolate communities, there will be many more women here, just out of reach and beyond protection. Panzi receives outside funding from non-governmental organizations and the United Nations Children's Fund but it is fundamentally a Congolese run initiative and that's another thing about Congo that you are unprepared for; in the midst of the most extreme horror and cruelty Congolese are trying to help themselves and each other. Trauma centers have been set up in both North and South Kivu by local communities and there are also local organizations working to reunite and rehabilitate abandoned children and child soldiers. Read about the child soldiers finding new hope . They haven't succeeded in bringing peace but they're taking steps towards healing.

"(CNN)  -- The only two baby mountain gorillas in captivity -- orphaned two years ago after their mothers were slain in massacres -- will soon be getting a lush, new playpen, Congo's wildlife authority announced Friday. Ndeze and Ndakasi will be romping in a special sanctuary, the Senkwekwe Center now under construction in Virunga National Park, where about 200 of the world's remaining 700 mountain gorillas live. ""This is paradise for them,"" said Samantha Newport, the park's communications director. ""They will be able to play around, climb trees and eat forest food."" Authorities began building the center in July 2007 but had to stop work after rebels invaded the park during the long-running civil war that raged in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Work resumed in September as hostilities subsided. The center is expected to be ready for occupancy by March. The babies were found in 2007 when they were 2 months old, one on her slain mother and the other on the back of her brother, who was alive when the baby was found. Authorities don't know who killed the mothers, but they suspect that the perpetrators were those engaging in the park's illegal charcoal industry, in which people cut down trees for fuel so they can cook and boil water. Newport said park rangers who found the babies hustled them out of the park to the city of Goma, where they have been living on a site with a house and trees. ""If they had not been taken out of the wild, they would have died,"" she said. Newport doesn't know whether the two will be moved out of the center and into the wild when they get older. The Senkwekwe Center is a 2.5-acre plot of forest three miles from the mountain gorilla habitat in Virunga. Emmanuel de Merode, director of Virunga National Park, said that along with sheltering the baby gorillas, the center offers ""a unique opportunity to enable the local population to see gorillas, and provides a launch pad for the veterinary activities that are conducted throughout Virunga."" The center will have a 40-by-40-meter interior holding facility, visitation platforms, an education center and veterinary facilities. The wildlife authority is raising $100,000 for the completion of the center, and donations will be matched by the United Nations Foundation. Gorillas have been caught in the middle of the civil warfare in recent years, and fighters had occupied large swaths of the 8,000--square-kilometer park. The gorilla section is in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda.","Ndeze and Ndakasi will move to the Senkwekwe Center in Virunga National Park .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- The family of a teenager shot to death last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer -- a case that has sparked national debate and concerns about racial profiling -- will address a Sanford, Florida, city meeting on Monday, officials said. Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed February 26 as he walked back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford after a trip to a convenience store. Police say he was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea; he was shot by George Zimmerman, who claims he was acting in self defense, according to authorities. The city of Sanford appealed Sunday for ""civility and calm"" during the ""City Commission/Town Hall Meeting for Trayvon Martin."" Worshippers in cities nationwide wore hoodies to church services Sunday to honor Martin, who was wearing a hoodie when he was killed. Zimmerman has not been charged in the case. Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and Middle Collegiate Church in New York were among the churches honoring the teen. ""All of us have a stake in this, not just black people,"" said the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, of Ebenezer, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. ""We are Americans, and we expect the system to work."" Warnock preached Sunday wearing in a maroon Morehouse College hoodie, the network reported. In Sanford, a ""prayer for peace"" and a candlelight vigil will take place Sunday evening. Another candlelight vigil will take place at the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama. ""The public has had enough of the police and prosecutors operating in secrecy when it comes to people of color, especially African-Americans,"" said J. Willie David III, president of the Florida Civil Rights Association, the group planning the Sanford vigil. The case has sparked a national debate over the Florida law and concerns about racial profiling. Martin was black and Zimmerman is white Hispanic. The attorney for Martin's family, meanwhile, said bringing a federal hate crime charge against Zimmerman will be ""a challenge, to put it lightly."" Family of Martin to pursue civil case . Daryl Parks told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) on Saturday that prosecution on the state level stands a better chance. ""Most state laws tend to be better for the prosecution of state crimes. And that's why we see the federal authorities expressing, although gently, in their statements that they can only do so much if there's some type of race statements involved. The state officials don't have that problem,"" Parks said. ""I think the focus is not necessarily a federal arrest over a state arrest. We want an arrest, period. And I think that the state aspect of that is the one that's most feasible, most attainable in this matter."" Parks said there is evidence that the Twin Lakes homeowners' association told residents who saw suspicious activity to call Zimmerman if they could not contact the police, according to an NABJ statement. The Martin family plans to pursue a civil case against the homeowners' association, Parks said. Demonstrations have taken place nationwide over Martin's death. ""We as a nation have become much too violent,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Sunday. ""...If it's black on white, it's jail time. If it's white on black, it's revolt time. If it's black on black, or white on white, or brown on brown, it's Miller time."" In response to an Orlando Sentinel report that Zimmerman worked at the Maitland, Florida, office of Digital Risk, a spokeswoman for the the risk mitigation and surveillance company said Sunday she could not comment on Zimmerman's current or future employment status, but ""we can confirm he is not at the building, nor has he been since the incident."" ""Our utmost concern is for the safety of our employees, specifically based on the potential turmoil that could arise from the recent announcement of a bounty for his capture,"" spokeswoman Brandie Young said in a statement. Zimmerman's attorney said Sunday that after reviewing Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, he believes it applies to the situation and that his client is innocent. Initially, lawyer Craig Sonner said last week the law was ""not really applicable to this case. The statute on 'stand your ground' is primarily when you're in your house."" ""This is self-defense, and that's been around for forever -- that you have a right to defend yourself,"" Sonner said earlier. ""So the next issue (that) is going to come up is, was he justified in using the amount of force he did?"" The 2005 law allows people to use deadly force anywhere they have a right to be if they have reasonable fear an assailant could seriously harm them or someone else. It also eliminated a long-standing ""duty to retreat"" in the face of imminent harm, asserting that would-be crime victims have the right to ""stand their ground"" and ""meet force with force"" when attacked. Noting that 23 states have some version of the ""stand your ground"" law on their books, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called Sunday for the Justice Department to investigate ""whether these laws are creating more violence than they are preventing"" and whether some deaths go unprosecuted ""because the laws place unintended additional burdens on local police and prosecutors that encourage dismissals of otherwise problematic cases."" ""These laws seem to be encouraging vigilantism by allowing individuals to use deadly force as a first resort,"" Schumer wrote in a Sunday letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. The Sanford Police Department said officers were prohibited from arresting Zimmerman the night of the shooting because physical evidence and testimony supported his claim that he acted in self-defense in accordance with Florida law. The police department gave the explanation to City Manager Norton Bonaparte, who included it in a letter to the community about the case, posted on the city's website. Zimmerman said he was driving in his gated community when he saw Martin walking and called 911 to report a suspicious person. Zimmerman told the dispatcher he was following the boy, but the dispatcher told him that wasn't necessary. Moments later, several neighbors called 911 to report a commotion outside, and police arrived to find Martin dead of a gunshot wound. Sonner says his client was injured that night and went to the hospital with a broken nose and a serious cut on the back of his head. Sanford police said Zimmerman did not indicate a chase, telling them instead that ""he had lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by Trayvon,"" the police said in the letter posted by Bonaparte. Florida Gov. Rick Scott has formed a task force to review the law in the wake of the shooting. Scott told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he met with Martin's parents Thursday to ""let them know that I appointed a new state attorney and introduced them to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents that are working on the case."" ""Your heart goes out to them because...no family ever imagines this could happen to their child,"" the governor said.

"(CNN) -- The Democratic Republic of the Congo declared two days of mourning Monday and Tuesday for the victims of the massive oil tanker explosion that killed more than 230 people over the weekend. The toll from the explosion in the central African nation rose to 232 on Sunday, up two from earlier reports, government spokesman Mende Omalanga said. President Joseph Kabila's declaration of a day of mourning requires flags to be lowered around the country and at Congo's embassies worldwide, Omalanga said. The oil tanker blew up Saturday in the southern city of Sange, near the country's border with Burundi, after it overturned while passing a bus, Omalanga said. Most of the victims had been sitting in a bar near the accident site watching the World Cup match between the Netherlands and Brazil, he said. When fuel began to spill from the overturned tanker, local residents attempted to collect it -- but one was smoking a cigarette, causing the tanker to explode. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","At least 232 killed by tanker explosion in Democratic Republic of the Congo .

"(CNN) -- It's been hailed for its succinctness and blamed for everything from sore thumbs to the decline of conversation. Love it or hate it, the text message is 20 years old. The first-ever text message was sent December 3, 1992, by software engineer Neil Papworth, to Vodafone director Richard Jarvis, who received the message on his husky Orbitel 901 cell phone. It read simply, ""Merry Christmas."" As of Monday, the text is no longer in its teens -- the age group it's probably most associated with. In fact, it's more of a senior citizen in technology years. At just 190 bytes and 160 characters, the modest text message isn't the most glamorous or elaborate form of communication, and that's a major reason it's become so pervasive. Texting is popular around the world, across age groups and cultures, because it is simple, concise, and compatible with every mobile device, whether it's a $500 smartphone or a disposable flip phone. Six billion SMS (short message service) messages are sent every day in the United States, according to Forrester Research, and over 2.2 trillion are sent a year. Globally, 8.6 trillion text messages are sent each year, according to Portio Research. It seems tacky to bring this up on its birthday, but this may also be the year the text message peaks. After two decades of constant growth, text messaging is finally slowing down as people move to smartphones and use third-party messaging tools to circumvent wireless carriers' costly per-text charges. SMS messaging is expected to be a $150 billion-a-year industry in 2013, with carriers charging set monthly fees for unlimited texting, or as much as 20 cents per text. The actual cost to carriers for sending a text message is about 0.03 cents. By using popular apps and services, including Apple's iMessage, Facebook messages, GroupMe and WhatsApp, smartphone users can send all the texts they want over Wi-Fi or cellular networks without paying per message. But smartphones still only account for 50% of all cell phones, so text messaging is likely to be around for years to come. Since a birthday is a day of celebration, LOLs and HBDs, let's take a look at some fascinating text messaging trivia. • In the United States, 75% of teenagers text, sending an average of 60 texts a day. According to Pew Internet research, texting is teens' most common form of communication, beating out phone conversations, social networks and old-fashioned face-to-face conversations. • Women are twice as likely to use emoticons in text messages, but men use a wider variety of emoticons, according to a recent study by Rice University. :-) • The practice of exchanging sexual messages or photos (yes, ""sexting"") isn't just for single people and politicians. It's also popular among committed couples. According to a study by psychology professor Michelle Drouin, 80% of young adults in relationships sent or received naughty texts, and 60% upped the ante by exchanging photos or videos. • Some emergency response call centers are beginning to accept text messages sent to 911. There are still lingering concerns about the practice, including lack of location information, confirmation that the message was received, and timeliness of messages. Verizon plans to launch limited SMS-to-911 services in early 2013. • The world of competitive texting can be lucrative for the fastest thumbs. At this year's fifth annual National Texting Championship in New York City, 17-year-old Austin Wierschke was crowned the winner for the second year in a row, taking home $50,000 in prize money. • According to Guinness World Records, Melissa Thompson set the record for fastest text. In 2010, she took 25.94 seconds to type and send, ""The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human."" • Text messages have a dangerous side. Texting while driving is a risky activity, and sending or reading a single text can distract a driver for approximately 4.6 seconds, according to the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. Thirty-nine states have banned text messaging while driving. Distracted texters have also been injured or killed while biking and walking. • Text messaging technology has popped up in some fascinating places over the years, including cows' reproductive organs. Swiss dairy farmers have implanted sensors in cows to detect when the cows are in heat. A second sensor with a SIM card in the cow's neck sends a text message to the farmer, who can then inseminate the animal, according to The New York Times. • Text messaging has been used in medical fields to improve treatment for malaria, depression, diabetes and addiction.","The first text message was sent on December 3, 1992, and read ""Merry Christmas""

"Washington (CNN) -- The marketer of a popular children's vitamin is refunding nearly $2.1 million to customers after acknowledging its pills contained only a fraction of a nutritional substance the packaging claimed. The vitamins' packaging featured Disney princesses, Winnie the Pooh, Nemo and Spider-Man. Manufacturer NBTY and two of its subsidiaries, Rexall Sundown and NatureSmart, claimed in product advertising and on packaging that the vitamins contained a dose of DHA that would satisfy 100% of a child's daily requirement. But in some cases the vitamins contained only minuscule amounts of DHA, the Federal Trade Commission said. Vitamin D in pregnancy may protect infants from virus . The amount of DHA -- an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish -- in Disney and Marvel Complete Tablets equaled only one-thousandth of what the marketers claimed per serving for children age 4 and older. For smaller children, the discrepancy was even more significant. Only five-10-thousandths of what the company claimed the pills contained on the packaging was in a serving of Disney and Marvel Complete tablets for children ages 2 to 4, court documents filed by the FTC alleged. The packaging claimed the DHA the vitamins contained would help vision and brain development in children. The FTC said those claims were unsupported. Sold at CVS Pharmacy, Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, Kroger, Kmart, Meijer and Rite Aid, as well as online, the boxes were priced at between $4 and $8 each. The refunds announced Tuesday stem from a case originally filed in 2010 against NBTY for making false and deceptive advertising claims about their nutritional supplements. Parents who believe they may have purchased the vitamins dating back to between May 1, 2008, and September 30, 2010, can file a claim through the FTC's website. In Tuesday's statement announcing the refunds, the FTC said customers have until October 12 to file a claim.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Nicolas Cage's son is scheduled to be released from a Los Angeles hospital this weekend where he was treated while on a psychiatric hold after a violent incident outside a Hollywood restaurant Tuesday. But Weston Cage's mother, Christina Fulton, is asking his doctor to recommend her 20-year-old son be kept at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for another two weeks, she told CNN Friday. ""I do not want him with Nicolas Cage,"" Fulton said. ""I do not want him in that care. That is not the care my son needs."" Fulton is suing Nicolas Cage over unpaid taxes and the Hollywood home where she raised their son, who court documents say suffers from ""a number of mental, psychological and physical ailments."" Weston Cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer Friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care. ""I am an adult,"" Weston Cage said. ""I don't want to have anything to do with my mother. Any problems that I have ever had is because of the relationship that I had with my mother."" When Fulton heard the quote, she called it ""an absolute disgrace"" that the lawyer would solicit such a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold, deemed legally incompetent. ""My son is under a spell, he's under a trance,"" Fulton said. ""Weston would say whatever his dad wants him to say."" Fulton blames Nicolas Cage for what she said is her son's downward spiral since he turned 18 and was no longer under her legal guardianship. ""It's his dad's fault that he's in the hospital,"" Fulton said. ""He had his chance. He had his chance to make it right. My son had a healthy environment here. He had a system that was fantastic. I built that with myself and my team."" A member of that team of caregivers was Kevin Villegas, whom Fulton hired as her son's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school. She said she fired Villegas three years ago, but Nicolas Cage rehired him. Villegas is now under investigation for the brutal and public beating of Weston Cage on a Hollywood sidewalk Tuesday afternoon. Los Angeles detectives will present their findings to a prosecutor who will decide if Kevin Villegas, who was employed as Cage's trainer, will be charged, a police spokesman told CNN. CNN has been unable to contact Villegas for comment. Cell phone videos, which have been posted online, indicated that the violence started when Cage attempted to kick Villegas when the trainer objected to the food he wanted to order at a restaurant. The video showed Cage being repeatedly hit as he was pinned down on the sidewalk. Nicolas Cage, in a statement given CNN by his spokeswoman Friday, called Fulton's comments blaming him for his son's psychiatric troubles ""unfortunate and inappropriate."" ""This is a time to focus only on giving love and full support to Weston, not an opportunity to lay blame on his father, a man who loves his son very deeply,"" Cage said. Fulton, who separated from Cage after their son was born, said the father was rarely around for her son growing up, while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues. ""For 18 years, I raised Weston so Nicolas could go be Nicolas Cage, and go be a superstar, and he did,"" she said. ""So I raised this boy, 24-7 we were glued to the hip."" After Weston's 18th birthday, his father ""orchestrated"" his son's removal from her care by convincing the employees she hired to work for him and giving him his own home and money, Fulton said. ""They all go work with Nicolas Cage because he has the money and he has the bank account and he has the fame, and I don't,"" she said. Weston's special needs were not being met without her, she said. ""My son right now has been under the care of Nicolas,"" she said. ""That didn't work. It's very obvious it didn't work. It failed miserably, failed miserably."" Cage's lawyer, Martin Singer, said Fulton's lawsuit against Cage is her motivation for attacking her son's father. ""Ms. Fulton comments about Mr. Cage are absurd and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her,"" Singer said. ""This is clearly all about money for Ms. Fulton."" Fulton's lawyer told CNN she would file for conservatorship of her son next week so she could ensure he will get the care he needs when he is eventually released from the psychiatric hold. ""I'd like my son to be with his mom, where it worked,"" Fulton said. ""I'd like my son to be in an environment where it worked. You know, 18 years of being successful, 18 years of watching my son respond to all the medical intervention that I have given him and all the support. Why would you mess with that? Why would you interfere with that? My son needs to be home.""","Christina Fulton to seek conservatorship for 20-year-old son with Nicolas Cage .

"Washington (CNN) -- The surprise disclosure of an intelligence assessment about North Korea's nuclear capabilities this week raised further questions over what the United States believes the communist nation is capable of, and has kept the U.S., the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world on edge, worried about the possibility of an imminent missile launch. At a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday, Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado, read from a declassified version of a document in which the Defense Intelligence Agency expresses ""moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles, however, the reliability will be low."" But James R. Clapper, director of U.S. national intelligence, quickly shot that assessment down. ""North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear-armed missile."" Still, many issues about North Korea's nuclear capabilities remain unclear as U.S. officials prepare for a potential missile launch by Pyongyang that they say could come at any time. Here is a look at a few of those questions: . ------ . 1. Does North Korea have nuclear weapons? Likely. North Korea conducted its first underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006, as well as two other tests, with the most recent coming in February of this year. Others believe the communist nation is assumed to have already separated enough plutonium for up to 10 warheads. It is unclear, however, if they have developed a way to weaponize or effectively deliver them. A U.S. official who briefed reporters in Seoul said that North Korea ""has demonstrated at least three times now that they can detonate a nuclear weapon."" Still, with fewer than 10 functional nuclear devices -- compared to the more than 7,650 warheads in the U.S. arsenal -- the tiny nation is at the dangerous infancy of becoming a nuclear state. 2. Has the nuclear device been miniaturized enough to fit atop a missile? Unclear. Taking a basic nuclear weapon and shrinking it down so it can fit on top of a missile is quite difficult. Many experts have suspected the North Koreans have been working feverishly to do just that, but their success has not been confirmed. Said the same U.S. official: ""miniaturizing a weapon is a very, very difficult task."" Secretary of State John Kerry, responding to the initial DIA assessment, said that ""it is inaccurate to suggest that the DPRK has fully tested, developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report."" 3. Do they have missiles sophisticated enough to deliver a nuclear warhead? Possibly. The North Koreans are believed to have a host of rockets or missiles, either deployed or in development, that many believe capable of carrying a potential conventional, chemical or nuclear warhead. Their long-range and unconfirmed UNHA 3 rocket has never been tested as a missile, but, with a suspected range of 6,200 miles (10,000 km), it could possibly reach parts of the western United States. Their intermediate-range TAEPODONG 1 and TAEPODONG X rocket could cover Japan, parts of Russia and Central Asia and some U.S. bases in the Pacific. And their short-range SCUD-D, with a range of about 435 miles (700 km), would be a threat to South Korea, Japan and China. However, experts say their guidance systems are primitive and their propulsion systems are unstable. But the U.S. official said they have capabilities. ""They have demonstrated that they can launch a three-stage missile. We believe they are continuing to develop putting a nuclear warhead on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile or intermediate-range ballistic missile,"" the official said. ""I think it's premature to say they've been able to put everything together, from development of a warhead, launching it, getting it to re-enter and actually target something. I think that's a little premature to say right now."" 4. If North Korea launches a missile, how will we know if it is carrying a nuclear warhead? Basically, we won't. While U.S. officials said there is ""nothing to indicate"" that North Korea can or will place a nuclear warhead atop a missile right now, most experts say it is very difficult to know the warhead and payload of a missile test in advance. That raises the heightened concern that, despite public U.S. proclamations that they would be hesitant to shoot down a North Korean missile launched over the ocean unless it appeared to be heading toward a known land-based target, such a shoot-down is still possible. 5. Why is it so hard to know full details of North Korea's nuclear program? The highly secretive nation -- led by the young, reclusive Kim Jung Un -- has been largely isolated from much of the rest of the world. Subject to strict United Nations sanctions, the country's primary supporter has been China, to its north and west. Entry into the country is strictly limited and communications -- TV, radio, Internet and even cell phones -- have been tightly controlled by the communist government. And even North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear. Months after North Korea's latest underground detonation, U.S. intelligence is still unable to determine what material actually exploded -- uranium or other radioactive materials. Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent who has visited North Korea 15 times, said the current confusion about Pyongyang's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998, when U.S. spy satellites discovered an underground complex at Kumchangri, not far from North Korea's main nuclear facility at Yongbyon. A debate raged inside intelligence communities about whether what the satellites saw was evidence of a burgeoning nuclear reactor, a secret, underground nuclear weapons facility or something else. In the end, the underground complex turned out to be empty, Chinoy noted. CNN's Tom Cohen, Jethro Mullen, Barbara Starr, Michael Pearson, K.J. Kwon, Tim Schwarz, Kyung Lah, Deirdre Walsh, Judy Kwon, Joe Sterling, Kevin Bohn, Chris Lawrence, Elise Labott, Jill Dougherty, Adam Levine and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","With North Korea on the verge of a possible missile launch, questions remain about its capabilities .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish investigators are trying to figure out how a 5-month-old baby died on a baggage carousel at an airport in Alicante. A spokeswoman for Spain's airport authority, AENA, said Thursday it's not clear how the baby ended up on the baggage belt for oversized luggage. ""The baby was on the baggage carousel, but could not have gotten there alone. Someone had to put the baby there. I don't know how the baby got there,"" said the airport spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. The infant's mother, an American woman, arrived at the airport late Wednesday on a flight from London's Gatwick airport with her baby and another young child, the spokeswoman said. The father, who is Canadian, was already there waiting at the Alicante airport, she added. The baggage carousel is a flat, black rubber-type belt that moves only in one direction and is only activated when oversized bags are sent out on it for pickup. It's several feet long and passengers can stand on either side of it or at the receiving end, the spokeswoman said. She said it was not immediately known if the infant was placed on the belt while it was stopped, or once it had started moving. An unidentified security officer at the airport told CNN affiliate Atlas she didn't see the incident, but was told that ""the mother apparently put (the baby) down on the conveyer belt when she went to reach for something. He was crushed by the conveyer belt and it killed him."" Airport medical personnel rushed to the scene but were unable to revive the infant, the spokeswoman said. The Spanish Civil Guard said the baby's death appears to be an accident, but an investigation is under way. At a loss: Comforting grieving parents . After the baby was pronounced dead, the family had to wait for a judge to arrive, by Spanish law, so that the body could be moved. Civil Guards took statements from the parents at the airport, the airport spokeswoman said. The baggage belt for oversized luggage -- which includes infant car seats and baby strollers -- is at one end of a large baggage claims hall at the Alicante airport, which handles 9 million passengers a year, the spokeswoman said. The baggage carousel is in a secure area, and passengers go through it to claim their bags before they exit into the public arrivals hall. The father of the baby would not have had access to that area, the airport spokeswoman said. Civil Guard and National Police spokesmen confirmed the nationalities of the mother and father as American and Canadian, respectively. A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Madrid said that U.S. Consular officials are aware of the incident and are providing assistance. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Embassy in Madrid said she could not comment and referred inquiries to the Canadian government's Department of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa. Spanish newspaper El Pais reported the family had come to the Alicante area, on Spain's Mediterranean coast, for vacation, but authorities would not immediately confirm that.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A mandatory grounding of Air Force F-15s has been expanded to cover those flying combat missions over Afghanistan after a crash in Missouri last week, Air Force officials said Monday. The Air Force grounded models of its F-15 fleet after the crash of an older model F-15C Friday. The F-15Es in Afghanistan can fly only in emergency situations to protect U.S. and coalition troops in a battle, according to Maj. John Elolf, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force Central Command. Maj. Cristin Marposon, an Air Force spokeswoman, told The Associated Press the country's fleet of 676 F-15s, including mission critical jets, was grounded on November 3 for ""airworthiness concerns"" after the crash of an older model F-15C on Friday. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but Air Force officials said it was a structural failure and the plane broke apart in flight. A spokeswoman for Boeing, the aircraft's manufacturer, told AP the company was cooperating with the Air Force but could not provide additional comment because of the pending investigation. Col. Robert Leeker, commander of the 131st Fighter Wing, said Friday the plane had been among four planes split into pairs and were engaging in one-on-one training flights in which speeds of 400 to 450 mph are typical, according to AP. A pilot, a 10-year veteran of the guard whose name and rank were not released, safely ejected from the aircraft when it crashed in Dent County, Missouri, AP reported. The pilot suffered a dislocated shoulder, a broken arm and minor cuts and bruises. Now only ""mission critical"" F-15s will fly. Pentagon officials said the U.S. Navy has had to move the only aircraft carrier in the region from the Persian Gulf to the North Arabian Sea to fill mission gaps for the F-15s. Several dozen F/A-18 fighters from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise will fly missions with other Air Force aircraft to fill mission gaps. The F-15E Strike Eagle is an air-to-ground and air-to-air fighter, making it more versatile than other F-15 models, which are used for only air-to-air missions. The Strike Eagle is used in Afghanistan in its air to ground role, dropping bombs on targets with its advanced sensors. ""The U.S. Air Force maintains assigned F-15E Strike Eagles on ground alert and will accomplish all assigned missions with a variety of fighter, attack and bomber aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles, under my command and control during this period,"" Lt. Gen. Gary L. North, commander of the U.S. Central Command's Combined Forces Air Component, said in a statement Monday. The single-seat F-15C is one of the older models in the Air Force's fleet of 700 F-15s which entered service in 1979. The Air Force's top aircraft, the stealthy F-22 Raptor, is newly operational for the air service and has not yet been deployed in combat. The expensive F-22 will eventually be the main fighter jet for the Air Force, but budgetary restrictions on the plane have forced the Air Force to cut the number of planes it will have in the fleet.

"(CNN) -- The eyes of a child see things differently than an adult. It's an idea that intrigued four young women in college. ""If you could give a child a camera, they could tell a reality in a way that a foreigner, or even an adult, could not,"" co-founder Angela Francine Bullock says. Several years later, they turned that idea into a way to help children around the world and founded the nonprofit 100cameras. The concept is simple. 100cameras staff members travel to countries armed with cameras. They partner with a local organization serving children in the community. For the next few weeks, they teach the children how to take photographs. Then they set those children free to capture their world and post the photos online. For the kids, sharing their life with the rest of the world is a reward in itself, but 100cameras goes one step further. The photographs are available for sale, and 100% of the profits go back to the children's organizations. Dramatic pictures show power of photography . It's about ""addressing poverty from the inside out, instead of the outside in,"" says Bullock, who is now the company's Public Relations Director. ""We partner with a local organization that is on the ground. They know the local needs ... and they know the best ways to serve these children and their families."" The group's first mission was to an orphanage in Sudan. The photographs were so powerful, they decided to turn their New York apartment into an art gallery, moving furniture into bedrooms, and invited anyone they knew. ""From there we said we have to do more, and that's been our mindset ever since. We always just need to do more."" says Bullock. View our photo galleries on CNN Photos . Since that 2008 trip to Sudan, they have brought their cameras to Cuba and taught kids in New York. In October, they are making the journey to India. What was once a side project for a group of friends now has almost 20 members and recently hired its first full-time employee. Photographs from these trips have brought thousands of dollars to the children's organizations. Bullock says they have a lot of freedom as a small group to address each community's needs individually. ""That's the great part of our model. We get to have the conversation with the organization and ask, 'What do you need?'"" In Sudan it was lifelines, like food and medicine. In New York it was educational needs, after-school learning and computers. Cuba's greatest need was humanitarian aid like food and medicine, but the community also needed a center where the children's parents could be taught business classes. More from Impact Your World . 100cameras raised $17,000 for the Sudanese orphanage. It was used for critical maintenance to get a truck running that brings in food and medicine. The money was also used to build a fence that keeps them protected from violence of rebel forces in the region. The staff says they are overjoyed by the fact that these kids are creating their own success. Bullock says, ""It's really exciting for kids there to see these changes and to feel an ownership in that."" The goal is to have their cameras stretch around the globe, and for the impact to continue to be both economic and personal. ""We want as many kids as possible empowered with the idea and concept that their perspective matters. To know it's their work that can create change in their own communities.""

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- What is most shocking about Gabby Giffords now is how much she looks like her old self. Her golden locks are back; so is the sparkle in her eyes and her broad smile. Gone is the short hair and thin frame we saw at the beginning of her recovery. Yet she knows she will never be the same. ""Stronger. Stronger, better, tougher. Stronger, better, tougher."" That's how Giffords describes herself. The former Arizona congresswoman makes that declaration with determination and gusto. But it still takes a considerable amount of energy and concentration to articulate that, or anything else. Being with Giffords, who was shot in the head two years ago during an appearance in front of an Arizona supermarket, it is obvious that she understands and absorbs everything around her. She follows conversation, reacts, engages and offers unsolicited ideas -- usually in the form of a single word or gesture that makes clear what she means. Exclusive: Gabby Giffords still appreciates gun culture . But at times, even simple words are a struggle, like when she tries to explain how she spends her days. ""Occupational therapy, yogurt,"" said Giffords. Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, patiently and quietly corrects her, saying ""yoga."" ""Yoga, yoga,"" Giffords repeats, offering a playful smile to signal she gets how funny it was that she said ""yogurt"" instead of ""yoga."" Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . She has go-to phrases that indicate how she feels, often saying ""good stuff"" to express encouragement and ""whoa"" to show something excites her or makes her happy. The right-handed Giffords still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed. She generally wears a sling to keep it from flopping around. Her right leg is also paralyzed. She wears a large brace and literally drags her right leg with her good, left leg to walk. Still, she walks remarkably well. Giffords has a service dog -- Nelson, a golden lab -- with her at all times. She is also still aided by nurses, who come to her home, and by speech therapists, who constantly work with her to help improve her ability to communicate. She also doesn't see very well. 'Yes, it's tough': For Giffords, a wounded life has a new purpose . ""Not great at all,"" is how she described her vision. Giffords has limited sight in both eyes, no peripheral vision to the right. Kelly jokes that when he wants to sneak up on her he will come around the right so she can't see him coming. That makes Giffords giggle. It is clear watching the couple interact that humor helps keep her spirits up and eases the pressure of their intense daily struggle. For Kelly and Giffords, this is the new normal -- a life together that neither could have ever imagined when they first got together. She was a bright young political rising star and he was an astronaut. Kelly said it is ""different in a lot of good ways."" The biggest difference? For the first time, they actually live in the same house, in the same city, in the same state. Before Giffords was shot, she jetted between her home in Tucson and work in Washington, while Kelly lived and worked in Texas, home of Johnson Space Center. They had a commuter marriage, which didn't allow them much time together. Now, they are together all the time, living in a ranch-style home they bought last summer. And since January, the two have worked together as well. They started Americans for Responsible Solutions, an organization and super PAC dedicated to pushing Giffords' former colleagues in Congress to support new restrictions to help curb gun violence. Giffords and Kelly own guns, and CNN filmed Kelly taking target practice with the same kind of gun Jared Loughner used to wound Giffords and kill six other people. Giffords says she would like to learn to shoot again, but it's not a high priority. When asked about the National Rifle Association's argument that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" Giffords becomes animated. ""It doesn't work!"" she says. ""It doesn't work."" She says if she were still in Congress, she would have supported new gun-control legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Giffords' work and her recovery are not unrelated. Those around her said she has noticeably made more progress with her speech and physical challenges over the past few months since she re-engaged in the world of politics and public policy. Kelly said Giffords does have moments of frustration, but both insist she is mostly optimistic and not resentful. ""No. Move ahead,"" said Giffords. ""Move ahead."" CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords says 'good guy with a gun' doesn't work .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Police have arrested one man and identified others in the alleged gang rape of a 23-year-old female photographer in the Indian financial hub of Mumbai, police said Friday. The incident is the latest shocking report of sexual assault to make headlines in the South Asian nation. ""We have made one arrest so far, but all the accused have been identified,"" according to the city's police commissioner, Satyapal Singh, who earlier said five men took part. The attack took place Thursday evening in a deserted area of the Shakti Mills district in Mumbai, Singh said. The unidentified female victim and a male colleague were on assignment in the area for a print publication when some of the men approached them and asked whether they had permission to take photographs, Singh said. The attack unfolded from there, he said, without providing a full account of events. The victim is in a stable condition in Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, hospital authorities said. Singh said police have a ""strong lead"" in the case without giving further details. They released sketches of five men they said were suspects in the case. Keeping chivalry alive in India: Men respond to rape crisis . The attack has shocked and disappointed many Mumbai residents, who consider their city to be a safer place for women than the capital, New Delhi. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 221 rape cases were reported in Mumbai in 2012. But figures provided by the government show that there has been a rape reported to police every day in Mumbai between January and March this year. The average number of reported rapes in a month in 2013 in the city rose dramatically to 30.33, from 19.25 in 2012. Delhi Police said the number of reported rapes in the capital had jumped from 179 for the first 3Â½ months of last year to 463 for the same period this year. A rise in the number of rapes reported does not necessarily mean that more are being committed. It may be that recent high-profile cases have encouraged women to come forward with complaints. The gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a bus in New Delhi in December sparked debate and introspection in India about sexual crimes against women. The victim of the New Delhi attack later died in a Singapore hospital. An outcry quickly grew over her case and expanded to include widespread concerns about women's safety and inequalities, triggering demonstrations in various cities. In response, the nation's lawmakers have introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment. Despite such action, frequent episodes of sexual violence are reported in India. Across India, 24,923 cases of rape were reported last year, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Some cases receive heavy coverage in the news media. Earlier this month, police said a 7-year-old girl was raped in a train's toilet compartment in central India. CNN's Mallika Kapur in Mumbai contributed to this report.","Police arrest a suspect in the alleged gang rape of a female photographer .

"(CNN) -- Days ahead of another anniversary of the bloody Tibetan uprising -- and six decades after Communists took over the region -- Chinese government officials stressed the need for ""stability"" in the disputed territory while promising ""reform"" and infrastructure upgrades. President Hu Jintao focused on spurring economic growth and increasing Beijing's investment in the region Sunday during a speech to Tibet's delegation to the Chinese national legislature. ""Meticulous efforts must be paid to the tasks of reform, development and stability to (bolster) development and maintain perennial stability in Tibet,"" Hu said, according to a report in the state-run Xinhua news agency. These remarks were among a host of Tibet-centric announcements Sunday -- four days before March 10, which will mark 52 years since the start of the largest, and deadliest, clashes between independence-minded Tibetans and forces aligned with the central Communist government in Beijing. That day in 1959, about 300,000 people surrounded Norbulinka palace, according to the advocacy group Free Tibet, fearful the Dalai Lama would be forcibly taken to Beijing. Tensions ratcheted up further and eventually exploded into violence, with Free Tibet estimating more than 85,000 Tibetans were killed by Chinese armed forces in a few days. The Dalai Lama, then 23, escaped on horseback to India. Establishing a home in the hill town of Dharamsala, he also has travelled the world giving speeches, attended meditation conferences and met people from CEOs to Hollywood stars to heads of state -- all while remaining head of Tibet's government-in-exile. In 2009, 20 years after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, he said the Chinese government has made life ""hell on Earth"" for Tibetans ever since that foiled rebellion. Yet, even as the Dalai Lama has said Tibet desires autonomy and cultural continuity but not necessarily full independence from Beijing, China's central government has viewed him as a troublemaker intent on destroying the nation's sovereignty. Combating ""anything that could sabotage stability"" was a key theme Sunday for Zhang Qinli, the Beijing-backed Communist party chief of the Tibetan region, according to another Xinhua report. Zhang said there were ""very grave challenges"" from separatists in Tibet, 60 years after what he called the ""peaceful liberation"" of Tibet by Communist forces led by Mao Zedong. He warned that Tibet ""will not develop"" economically without stability. ""The majority of the Tibetan people are unwilling to suffer from social unrest,"" Zhang said. Hu and Zhang both touted a desire to jump-start development in the remote area, and several other officials offered specific proposals to that end. Among them, China's transportation minister Li Shenglin said Sunday that all counties in Tibet would have paved roadways by 2015. While not giving a currency amount for the project's cost, he said Beijing would double its current investment -- so that almost all villages would be accessible via highways by adding 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) of blacktop, over the next five years. A network of ""expressways,"" too, should soon link the Tibetan cities of Lhasa, Xigaze, Nagqu, Shannan and Nyingchi, Li said in the Xinhua report. Another official told the news agency that a new train line -- also to be built by 2015 -- would drastically cut travel time between the capitals of the provinces of ethnic Tibet and Xinjiang. The creation of a new railway between Golmud in northwestern Qinghai province and Korla in Xinjiang would mean travelers between Lhasa, Tibet, and Urumqi, Xinjiang, would have to traverse 1,000 fewer kilometers (621 miles) in track than they now do. ""The new railway line will play a significant role in boosting the economic development in the country's western regions and promoting exchanges among different ethnic groups,"" said Luo Yulin, vice governor of Qinghai.","Thursday is the anniversary of the Tibetan uprising, after which the Dalai Lama fled .

"(CNN) -- ""Love everybody and be good to everybody. That's the main thing."" Those are the all-caps words that greet visitors to Grandma Betty's website. And you can expect an uptick in the number of visitors, after the inspirational Instagram celebrity (real name: Betty Jo Simpson) from Jeffersonville, Indiana, succumbed to lung cancer Saturday, eight months after she was diagnosed. Appropriately, word of the beloved 80-year-old great-grandmother's death was posted first on Instagram, attached to a photo of her beloved dog Harley, alone, in the rocking chair she sat in so often in her Instagram snapshots. ""After a much needed night of rest , Grandma has come to peace with her battle of Lung Cancer. Although Grandma Betty is no longer physically with us, she will forever be in the hearts of the millions of people she touches every single day. Grandma Betty did not lose her battle to cancer, because her legacy she has left behind will inspire millions of people to #Smile, #BeHappy, and #StayHappy no matter what. The fight has ended. The battle is won,"" the online epitaph read. As of Saturday evening, Simpson had more than 682,000 Instagram followers, drawn by her amusing videos, positive messages and fighting spirit. To the general public, the legend of Grandma Betty began around the time of her cancer diagnosis, when her 18-year-old great-grandson, Zach Belden, decided to document the remainder of her life. ""Before grade school, I didn't have a babysitter. I had my grandma,"" Belden told CNN's Jarrett Bellini in March. ""Many of my friends knew Grandma. And it was a neat way to connect her to them."" Apparently This Matters: Instagram's favorite grandma . Despite her advanced age, and the cancer, Betty grew quite savvy about social media, even learning to take selfies, though Belden admitted that process was ""harder than it probably seems."" Now, the woman who defined herself on Instagram as a ""Cancer Fighter"" and ""Follower of Jesus"" is no longer with us. But she'll live on in the pictures, words, and spirit that made the social media generation fall in love with the octogenarian.","Betty Jo Simpson, 80, of Jeffersonville, Indiana, dies from lung cancer .

"(CNN) -- The former president of Shell Oil USA didn't candy-coat it: America's political fund-raising system, he said, amounts to legalized extortion. ""I feel extorted,"" John Hofmeister told CNN's Drew Griffin. ""Every time I wrote a check I felt that it was a form of extortion, the price of entry, because of the reception that you got when you contributed versus the reception when you did not contribute."" Hofmeister, who ran Shell Oil USA from 2005 through 2008, said he was constantly being asked for political donations, by members of both parties. It's against Shell Oil policy, he said, for corporate contributions to be made. So any donations came out of his own pocket -- something, he said, he felt forced to do. Hofmeister said he and other oil executives were summoned to more than a dozen Capitol Hill hearings in 2008 when the retail price of gasoline began to skyrocket. In one hearing, a member of Congress suggested that nationalizing U.S. oil companies might be a way to tamp down prices at the pump. Not long after one of those hearings, Hofmeister told CNN, several members of Congress pressed him for political contributions. And it's all perfectly legal. The influence of politics and money has become a legal game of extortion, critics say, made all the more insidious because the so-called extortionists are politicians who write the laws and legally manipulate the system for their own gain. ""It is a feeding frenzy that's going on,"" said Peter Schweizer of the Government Accountability Institute, a nonprofit research group. He's written a book called ""Extortion,"" describing America's political system as one where lawmakers learn how to transform power into cash. ""I think we need to somehow break the back of the ability of politicians to leverage their position to extract donations,"" Schweizer said. ""Most fund-raisers will tell you the place that you start raising money is from people who can't say no,"" said Schweizer. ""So if you're a government contractor or you're somebody that's doing business with the state or federal government, you're going to be put in a position where you're going to be expected to raise funds, because if you don't, the fear might be that you're going to lose the contract."" Hofmeister, the former Shell executive, told CNN he realized he would have to cough up several thousand dollars of his own money each year, ""if I am going to do my job."" He said the system is ""pay to play"" and he agrees that the word ""extortion"" is accurate, ""as harsh as a word that is."" ""We talk about corruption in Third World countries. In this case, the corrupters have written a law to make it legal to the corruptees. And I consider that atrocious in the name of democracy,"" Hofmeister said. Schweizer didn't seem surprised by Hofmeister's story. ""You hear that from businessmen all the time -- that they come to Washington, they appear before a congressional committee, they are grilled on a matter and it is made pretty clear after the fact that, 'If you make donations or if you do fund-raising for me, I might understand issues a little bit better as far as you are concerned,'"" Schweizer told CNN. It's just business, said Hofmeister. But he said it's also a process that includes a healthy dose of political theater. ""The political theater of the hearing matters to them. And that's exactly the mindset which I used to go into the hearing,"" Hofmeister said. To please the powerful politicians, he found himself asking himself questions like ""What role shall I play?"" ""If you're testifying, you're in the subordinate role because the members are always up in a dais looking down at you,"" said Hofmeister. ""So you know you are subordinate to them. This is their town, their home, you're an invited guest. But when the hearing is over ... the curtains close on the theater. It's back to business. And business is raising money."" Now, more than five years after leaving Shell, Hofmeister chairs the National Urban League and serves on an advisory committee for the U.S. Department of Energy. CNN took a look around Capitol Hill during a single day last November. Our goal: to track the daily fund-raising parade. We found 13 political fund-raisers which took place between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m. We were able to videotape at least eight of them.

"Norfolk, Virginia (CNN) -- The United States Navy has 323,000 active duty service members, many of them housed in close quarters -- yet it is able to avoid major outbreaks of contagious diseases like those seen on commercial cruise ships. Nearly 700 crew and passengers onboard Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas were sickened by norovirus in January before the ship returned to its port in Bayonne, New Jersey. In addition, the Caribbean Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, cut a seven-day itinerary short the same week because of a norovirus outbreak that affected 178 passengers and 11 crew members. In the Navy, such an outbreak would cripple a ship. ""If we had a norovirus that took out 700 sailors, we obviously would be operationally ineffective, combat ineffective -- but even a smaller number, a smaller outbreak of, say, 100 would devastate our operational capability,"" Capt. Jim McGovern, commanding officer on the USS Iwo Jima, said aboard his ship docked in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Serious outbreaks of 10 or 20 individuals being sick are taken very seriously."" Some 3,200 sailors and marines fill the amphibious assault ship when it deploys, and each of them are medically screened and inoculated before being allowed to embark. ""The idea is to prevent somebody from getting ill. Once you do become ill from one of these highly contagious organisms, you are really chasing it then,"" Vice Adm. Matthew Nathan, Surgeon General of the Navy, told CNN. ""One person touches something, then three people touch that and they become infected, then three people from them, and pretty soon you've gone from 1 to 3 to 9 to 27 and that is how a cruise ship, in short order, has 700 people come down."" What is norovirus? Onboard a warship like the Iwo Jima, sailors are required to report to sickbay if they feel unwell. ""They come to us for sick call, and if they are particularly stoic and don't want to come to us for whatever reason, their supervisor will make them come,"" said Sean Sullivan, the vessel's senior medical officer. If a sailor does become ill with a contagious disease, he or she will be isolated so the infection does not spread. ""You monitor the movements of everybody who is ill. You make sure they are staying away from the general population on the ship. They are not to go to their work station, they are not to go to the food places,"" Nathan said. Keeping vessels extraordinarily clean is part of the daily routine for everyone onboard U.S. Navy ships. ""Every day at 0730 we basically do a cleaning station of the ship. Every department has their own space,"" sailor John Canevari said, clearly showing pride in his section of the passageway. ""We live here. If we want to go out on deployment for eight or nine months, we need to make sure it's clean."" In the kitchens, cleaning is constant to prevent foodborne illnesses. ""It's important to keep it clean because cross-contamination is a big factor for illnesses,"" said Jakeila Owens, Iwo Jima culinary specialist. Just in case crews in the galleys miss something, preventive medicine technicians like Aaron Ferguson inspect multiple times every day. They are ""making sure their hands are clean, uniforms are clean, they have hairnets on properly, making sure their lines are clean, so there is not dirt buildup or anything like that which could get people sick,"" he said. Is your cruise safe? The rigorous discipline and devotion to cleaning is aided by simply not having certain creature comforts, such as those cruise ship passengers expect. ""If you have a ship whose main center of gravity is social gatherings, food places, dancing areas places for libations, and gating on decks and swimming pools -- all of those things that sailors wish they had, but don't have on our Navy ships -- then I think it is a much more challenging environment to control the spread of a highly contagious virus,"" Nathan said. McGovern experienced an outbreak firsthand, years before taking command of the Iwo Jima. Half of the 30 people onboard his small ship fell ill. ""Somebody didn't have clean hands, (didn't) wash their hands properly and stuck their hand in an ice dispenser and anybody who got ice from that dispenser got sick,"" he said. That's why he, and sailors across the Navy, swab, inspect, scrub and scour every day. What you need to know about kids and norovirus . CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.

"Washington (CNN) -- The full Senate formally kicks off debate Tuesday on the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" immigration reform bill -- a plan which, if enacted, will create a 13-year path to citizenship for most of America's 11 million undocumented immigrants. Among other things, the measure aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high-skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low-skilled workers on America's farms and elsewhere. ""This week, the Senate will consider a commonsense, bipartisan bill that is the best chance we've had in years to fix our broken immigration system,"" President Barack Obama said Tuesday. ""If you genuinely believe we need to fix our broken immigration system, there's no good reason to stand in the way of this bill."" Needless to say, a lot of folks on Capitol Hill disagree with the president. ""This bill has serious flaws,"" warned Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""There will need to be major changes to this bill if it's going to become law."" Here are five key things to know about the state of play on this controversial issue: . 1) The 'Gang of Eight' remains unified . Eight men put the bipartisan Senate bill together -- South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, Florida Republican Marco Rubio, Arizona Republican John McCain, New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez, Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet, and New York Democrat Chuck Schumer. Each of the eight has promised to oppose any major changes to the bill. During Senate Judiciary Committee's consideration of roughly 300 proposed amendments, Flake and Graham repeatedly sided with the panel's Democrats in opposing significant changes offered by their fellow conservatives. Schumer and Durbin voted against some amendments proposed by more liberal members, even though the pair said they supported the ideas. Rubio was disappointed that the committee rejected an amendment requiring the use of biometrics -- such as fingerprints -- for visa holders at all of the country's entry and exit points. But he hasn't dropped his support for the overall bill. ""Everybody needs to know it -- who's calling the shots,"" conservative Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions said at one of the committee's meetings on the bill. The answer, at least so far, remains the ""Gang of Eight."" 2) Reform advocates have momentum, but there's a long way to go . Advocates for comprehensive immigration reform won their first major legislative victory last month when the Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 to approve the ""Gang of Eight"" plan. The committee's tally was significant in part because three Republicans -- Flake, Graham, and Utah's Orrin Hatch -- joined the panel's Democrats in backing the measure. Assuming every member of the Democratic caucus backs the bill on the Senate floor, five Republicans will be needed to ensure it receives the 60 votes needed to pass the 100-member chamber. he bill's backers have been hoping for as many as 70 votes, in order to give the proposal significant bipartisan momentum heading into the tougher GOP-controlled House. The Senate voted 82-15 to open debate, an important tally but in no way a predictor of how the issue will play out. Make no mistake -- serious momentum will be needed in the House, where conservatives remain deeply skeptical about border security and any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally. A lot of conservatives consider the current proposed path to be a form of amnesty, which may as well be a four-letter word in this debate. Any measure that passes the House will almost certainly have to be reconciled with the Senate plan in a conference committee. And assuming that can be done, both chambers would then have to pass the compromise legislation. 3) It's not clear anything can pass the House . A bipartisan working group in the House -- similar to the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" -- has been on the verge of unveiling legislation for months, according to multiple sources. But it hasn't been able to seal the deal, and one of the Republicans in the group recently dropped out. Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador said he was frustrated he couldn't get support for a provision ensuring undocumented workers are barred from any taxpayer-funded health care benefits. For his part, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has repeatedly said he supports the work of the House bipartisan group. He won't, however, weigh in on any policy details. A number of congressional observers believe that after experiencing a backlash from many of his rank and file members for cutting ""backroom deals"" on other issues, Boehner wants time to educate his caucus on immigration reform and gain some buy-in for any bill or set of bills. Boehner could antagonize many of his members if he decides to move forward with a bill requiring a majority of Democratic votes to pass. ""If the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in the passage despite a majority of the Republican conference voting against it, then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election,"" Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks recently told CNN. 4) Immigration is Obama's best shot for big second-term legislative win . Why? Democrats are basically unified on the issue, while Republicans are divided. On Sunday, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte became the first GOP senator outside of the ""Gang of Eight"" to publicly endorse the group's plan. ""This is a thoughtful, bipartisan solution to a tough problem,"" she said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" Nothing focuses a politician's attention like an election loss, and Republicans were thumped last year by the country's growing Hispanic population. Latinos backed Obama over Mitt Romney by a 44-point margin. GOP strategists are concerned about the party's long term viability in national elections if that trend is not reversed. Some congressional conservatives have already said opposing the ""Gang of Eight's"" plan is a matter of principle and they won't bend. But others might. This is a rare moment when the two political parties' priorities may overlap enough to make Capitol Hill a productive place. 5) Polls -- what does the public think? Most national polling conducted over the past few months indicate majority support for an eventual pathway to citizenship, as long as undocumented workers clear a series of hurdles such as paying back taxes and fines. Support for a pathway ranges from nearly 60% to almost 80% of Americans, depending on the poll. CNN Poll: Most see pathway to citizenship . 65% of Americans back a pathway to citizenship as long as it requires payment of back taxes and fines, according to a May 30-June 2 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. 77% of Democrats support a pathway under such circumstances, compared to 58% of Republicans and 54% of independents. People are skeptical, however, about the ability of Congress to get the job done, according to a May 22-28 Quinnipiac University survey. Only 24% of the Quinnipiac poll's respondents believe congressional Democrats and Republicans can work together to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill. 71% of Americans don't expect enough bipartisan cooperation to pass such legislation, according to the survey. CNN's Halimah Abdullah, Paul Steinhauser, and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","Backers of ""Gang of Eight"" plan have momentum, but there's a long way to go .

"(CNN) -- Bothered by gadgets like Google Glass that can, theoretically, be used to snoop on you in public? Then why not get your own gadget that can knock them all offline? That's what the creators of Cyborg Unplug promise. Billed as a ""wireless anti-surveillance system,"" Unplug is, essentially, a portable router that can detect drones, surveillance cameras and mobile tech like Glass trying to access your Wi-Fi signal and boot them off of it. ""Whether business office, restaurant, school or nightclub: it's your territory and your rules, so make it harder for those that seek to abuse it,"" Cyborg's website reads. That's Unplug's stated purpose, anyway. But, as its creators freely note, it also has an ""All Out Mode"" that would let you knock devices off of any wireless network, not just yours. The company says it doesn't recommend doing that because ... you know ... it's probably really, really illegal. ""We take no responsibility for the trouble you get yourself into if you choose to deploy your Cyborg Unplug in this mode,"" the company says on its site. The company notes that the device is not a jammer, which blocks all digital signals in a particular area. Instead, it targets certain devices the user has identified. So, for example, you could tell Unplug that Glass is no bother, but drones and microphones need to be shut down. It uses the unique hardware signature that all Wi-Fi devices have to recognize what it's seeing before sending a ""deauthentication packet"" blocking access. To be clear, Cyborg Unplug can't stop anyone from using mobile devices to record or photograph you. It only keeps that data from being streamed afterward. Cyborg Unplug was developed by Julian Oliver, an engineer and artist from New Zealand living in Berlin . This spring, Oliver made headlines in the tech press by writing glasshole.sh, a Web script that can be used to find and kick Glass, specifically, off local computer networks. He said positive response to the program led him to pursue making Cyborg Unplug. Two versions will be available for $50 and $100, available for pre-order starting September 30. Although Glass has no more capabilities to record video or take photos than most smartphones, the wearable gadget from Google, still officially in its testing phase, has been targeted by privacy advocates who say technology has made it too easy to violate privacy rights. Cyborg says Unplug was created ""in shared spirit with"" Stop the Cyborgs, a campaign that urges restaurants and other public spaces to ban Glass and other surveillance devices. Google did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.","Cyborg Unplug can remove Google Glass from Wi-Fi networks .

"New York (CNN) -- New York Police Department officials say they can't explain why a fearful woman's domestic-abuse report -- written in the woman's native language of Spanish -- was never translated into English for review, and for possible action. The woman and her two daughters subsequently were stabbed to death. The woman's husband, arrested as he tried to flee to Mexico, now faces charges of first-degree murder. And a group that has a lawsuit pending against the city on behalf of six other Latina women says the case of Deisy Garcia and her young daughters is far from unique in New York. The paper trail that ends with the January deaths of Garcia and daughters Daniela, 2, and Yoselin, 1, stretches back to last May. On May 30, Garcia filed a police report saying she feared her husband would kill her and their two daughters. Garcia spoke Spanish, and it was in Spanish that she filed the report. According to the NYPD, that report was never translated into English for further review. On January 18, according to authorities, Garcia and her daughters were stabbed to death in their Queens apartment, allegedly by Garcia's ex-husband and the girls' father, Miguel Mejia-Ramos. Police say officers at the murder scene filed their own report, but the department has no explanation for what happened to Garcia's report from months earlier or to another report from Garcia, again written in Spanish, after a November incident. ""I knew about the police report, and I knew about the police showing up at the house previously on one of the times where Deisy had called the police because she had been the victim of domestic violence,"" says Roger Asmar, an attorney hired by Garcia's family. ""But we did not know that every time Deisy filled out a report -- every time she went to the precinct or the cops came to the house -- no one actually translated the text into English, so, apparently no one looked into it. ""No one translated it and they just put it away or placed it into the system ... three complaints were filed by Deisy, and none of the times she filed a complaint did police actually arrest Mr. Mejia, her ex-husband."" Police have confirmed the May 30 report, and CNN has obtained copies of reports dated November 27 and 28 from Garcia's family, who found them among Deisy Garcia's belongings after she died. On November 27, cops responded to a call from Garcia. ""She said when her husband came home, he threatened to kill her. She was crying so she called the police and told them that her husband had threatened to kill her,"" said Sara Alvarado, Garcia's aunt, who was present during the police visit that time. As she had in May, Garcia once again filed a domestic incident report and wrote in Spanish, ""at about 2:40 am my husband came home and assaulted me, he pulled my hair and kicked me twice, then grabbed my phone. After he did that, I called the police, but he changed and ran out taking a phone that is not mine with him. Today in the morning, he was threatening me that he would take away my daughters."" Police are unable to say whether that report was ever translated, either. On November 28, Garcia made a follow-up visit to the precinct, filling out another complaint, but her claims did not lead to an arrest. In statements to police following the slayings, Mejia-Ramos allegedly said he'd been drinking when he got home on the night of January 18, according to the Queens district attorney's office. He went through his wife's phone and Facebook account and saw a photo of her with another man, he told prosecutors. According to the Queens district attorney's office, Mejia-Ramos said he grabbed a knife and stood over Garcia and allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times before entering his daughters' bedroom where he gave each of them a hug and a kiss, and stabbed them as he asked for their forgiveness. The three bodies were discovered by Garcia's uncle and a 12-year-old cousin the next day. Afterward, Mejia-Ramos tried to flee to Mexico, according to police, but was arrested January 21 in Schulenburg, Texas -- a town near the Mexican border -- and brought back to New York. He was indicted on February 14 and will be arraigned in early March, the Queens district attorney's office said. He is charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon. Mejia-Ramos faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted on the murder charge, the district attorney's office said. Garcia's family believes that had the police taken action, she may still be alive. ""If they would have given it more importance, would have translated it to English, then maybe they (police) would have figured out what to do, they would have investigated him, been more on top of the case, what was happening with them,"" said Luzmina Alvarado, Garcia's mother. ""If the police had done something, this tragedy could have been avoided -- my daughter would be alive."" Some two months before Garcia filed her written-in-Spanish domestic-abuse report in May, an organization that serves ""limited English proficient"" domestic-violence victims filed a lawsuit against the city on behalf of six other Latina women, alleging the NYPD denies interpreters to limited-English speakers, depriving ""them of access to NYPD services."" That lawsuit filed by the Violence Intervention Program is still pending. The group says Garcia is but one of many women who are ignored by police because they cannot file complaints in English. The group alleges that the NYPD's denial of interpreter services has deprived limited-English-proficient women of their right to report crimes, to protect themselves from dangerous abusers, and to communicate effectively with the police in a wide range of circumstances. ""Not only does the NYPD fail to provide language assistance, it also degrades, ridicules and otherwise mistreats limited English proficient individuals who request interpreter services, actively demeaning them for their lack of English proficiency,"" according to the lawsuit. The NYPD directed all inquiries on the lawsuit to the New York City Law Department, which handles legal issues for the city. ""The NYPD has more foreign-language-speaking officers than any police department in the country, including thousands of Spanish-speaking officers,"" said Nicholas Paolucci, spokesman for the New York City Law Department. ""Also, the NYPD has a corps of 19,000 members of the service who can provide interpretation services in over 70 languages."" But the Garcia family, the Violence Intervention Program and the women the group represents say that it doesn't matter how many officers can speak multiple languages if non-English statements provided by complaint victims are ignored. As a result of an internal review into the failure of officers to translate domestic incident reports, the NYPD is verbally instructing officers on how to translate and store domestic incident reports that are prepared in texts other than the English language, according to NYPD Detective Cheryl Crispin. ""A memo will be transmitted to all commands informing domestic violence officers to immediately locate a member of the command who possesses the necessary language skills to translate a victim's written statement to English,"" she said in a prepared statement. For Garcia's family, that may be too little, and it is definitely too late. ""We're thinking maybe we sue the police because this wasn't just his (Mejia-Ramos') fault, the authorities are also at fault,"" said Garcia's mother. ""My daughter may be dead and can't do anything in this case, but I want justice.""","Deisy Garcia and her two small daughters were stabbed to death in January .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations issued a report Friday detailing human rights violations such as killings and rapes over a 10-year period in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- a massive document that a Congolese diplomat calls ""detailed,"" ""credible"" and ""heartbreaking."" The draft report, titled ""Mapping Exercise,"" documents crimes against humanity throughout the Congo between 1993 and 2003. ""Tens of thousands of people were killed, and numerous others were raped, mutilated or otherwise victimized during the decade,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said. The report, which had been previously leaked, accuses Rwandan forces of committing atrocities. It notes the involvement of at least 21 armed Congolese groups in serious human rights violations and the military operations of eight other states inside Congo. Along with detailing the atrocities, the report is designed to find ways ""to deal with the legacy of these violations, including truth, justice, reparation and reform. ""The period covered by this report is probably one of the most tragic chapters in the recent history of the DRC,"" the report says. ""Indeed, this decade was marked by a string of major political crises, wars and multiple ethnic and regional conflicts that brought about the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people."" The report devotes attention to violence against women and children. ""Violence in the DRC was, in fact, accompanied by the apparent systematic use of rape and sexual assault allegedly by all combatant forces,"" it says. ""This report highlights the apparently recurrent, widespread and systematic nature of these phenomena and concludes that the majority of the incidents of sexual violence reported, could if judicially proven, constitute offences and violations under domestic law, international human rights law,and international humanitarian law."" The report says at least 30,000 children were recruited by armed forces or groups and that ""children have been subjected to indescribable violence."" ""If this situation is allowed to continue, there is a risk that a new generation will be created that has known nothing but violence, and violence as a means of conflict resolution, thus compromising the country's chances of achieving lasting peace,"" the report says. Rwandan forces and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic Hutus in the country, the report says. ""Tens of thousands"" of Hutu civilians were slaughtered with knives, bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the Rwandan army and the Allied Democratic Liberation Forces swept across Congo -- then called Zaire -- leading to the toppling of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. More than 1 million Rwandans fled to neighboring Congo when the Rwandan genocide ended in 1994 -- most of them Hutu. In 1996, Rwanda invaded Congo in pursuit of the genocide orchestrators, who were living amid hundreds of . thousands of other refugees. Saying the report is flawed, Rwanda said it ""reserves the right to review"" its ""various engagements"" with the United Nations. The country has participated in U.N. peacekeeping missions, such as Sudan's Darfur region. ""We note that the U.N. also recognizes that the report omits crucial historical context, uses problematic methodology and sourcing, and the standard of proof used to justify the allegations in it is woefully inadequate,"" said Louise Mushikiwabo, foreign minister and government spokeswoman. ""It seems clear that no amount of tinkering can resuscitate the credibility of this fundamentally misguided process. This report is yet another attempt to distort Rwanda's history and prolong instability in the Great Lakes Region."" Ileka Atoko, Congo's ambassador to the United Nations, welcomed the publication of the report and called it ""detailed,"" ""credible,"" and ""heartbreaking."" ""The Congolese government, and I personally, are appalled at the horrific nature and scope of crimes documented in this report that the people of the Congo have suffered,"" Atoko said. ""Sadly, this information is not new to us. Millions of Congolese men, women and children have borne the brunt of the Congo's conflicts over the past 15 years. Far too many have died. Like nearly all Congolese, I too lost loved ones in the war. Atoko said justice must be meted out for the crimes. ""Far too often, Congolese voices go unheeded. I truly hope that this time it is going to be different.""","NEW: Rwanda criticizes the report .

"(CNN) -- These aren't your typical Southern escapes. An African safari-style tent in the middle of Texas Hill Country. Skeet shooting from a former Coast Guard station 34 miles offshore. Remote treehouses in the middle of a blackwater river. Heck, they're not your average vacations anywhere in the world. Here are five unusual summer getaway ideas for travelers headed to the U.S. South, also featured in the summer issue of Garden & Gun magazine hitting newsstands May 16. The Southern lifestyle magazine doesn't feature that many gardens or guns, although there's usually some kind of sport and garden in every issue. Borrowed from a 1970s Charleston disco called the Garden & Gun Club, the title is more a metaphor for the Southern lifestyle, heritage and land. ""People who remember it (the club) still speak of it with a dreamy look in their eyes,"" says editor in chief David DiBenedetto. Just like you might after one of these unusual trips: . Frying Pan Shoals Light Station, Southport, North Carolina . Once a light station that marked the shoals off the coast of Southport, North Carolina, for ships, the two-story Frying Pan Shoals Light Station now houses a bed-and-breakfast perched on a platform 32 miles off the coast of Cape Fear. The main level is 85 feet high, the helipad is at 95 feet and the top of the lighthouse is 130 feet high. Built in 1964 for the U.S. Coast Guard and auctioned to new owner Richard Neal for $85,000 in 2010, the light station was typical of those stations built in the mid-1900s to replace light ships. The use of GPS in shipping made the stations obsolete. Gatsby glam: 8 grand estates . Now the 5,000-square-foot space can host up to 14 guests in eight bedrooms. It's equipped with Wi-Fi, hot water, a driving range (with ocean-friendly biodegradable golf balls), a skeet range, spectacular fishing and incredible views. It's a labor of love for Neal, who is still restoring the platform and raising funds to do more. That means some parts will be off-limits, and you'll sign a waiver before setting foot on the platform. Book your own transportation via helicopter, chartered boat or take your own boat to the station or pay for an all-inclusive package that includes transportation via boat. ""You're living and sleeping on top of a wild coral reef,"" says DiBenedetto. ""Dolphin, tuna and whales come by. There is water as far as you can see. It's pretty wild and different."" 6 hot resorts for adults only . Edisto River Treehouses, Canadys, South Carolina . For an experience truly detached from the modern world, consider a stay at the Edisto River Tree Houses. Built on an island in the middle of a private wildlife refuge along a free-flowing blackwater river, the treehouses are a 13-mile paddle downriver. The color of a blackwater river is because of the tannic acid in the water, which is leached from the leaves of fallen trees along the river's edge. South Carolina's blackwater rivers start at springs in the Sandhills area of the state and meander until they empty into the Atlantic Ocean. ""It's like paddling back in time, and the river is slow moving, so it's an easy paddle,"" DiBenedetto says. Keep your eye out for alligators. Some canoeing experience is helpful to navigate fallen trees, which are often but not always cleared by volunteers taking care of the river. This is a truly rustic stay: You have to bring your own sleeping bag, towels, food and water in the canoe. While the treehouses have cooking equipment and sleeping lofts, there's no electricity. Guests can cook on an outside grill and can use candles and torches at night. Serenbe, Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia . A 1,000-acre community in Georgia's Chattahoochee Hill Country, Serenbe is dedicated to sustainable principles. The land, southwest of Atlanta, is protected from urban sprawl and its 170 residents embrace walkability, preservation and community living. Serenbe offers visitors access to a working farm, wonderful restaurants, a farmers and artists market and for overnight visitors, The Inn at Serenbe. Enjoy hikes, hayrides and horseback rides there. ""You can enjoy all the benefits of being a farmer without having to do the backbreaking labor,"" says DiBenedetto. ""It's a great escape, especially for the family."" Sinya on Lone Man Creek, near Wimberley, Texas . If you want to go on an African safari but can't make the trip all the way to Africa, the safari-style tent at Sinya on Lone Man Creek may be for you and your beloved. Located on a ridge overlooking Lone Man Creek in the Hill Country of Texas, Sinya is the spot for luxurious relaxation after a day of bird watching, hiking or fishing. Treasure hunters can poke around at the artists' booths at the nearby First Saturday Market or make the 40-minute drive to the big city lights of Austin. Dine out at restaurants in the nearby town of Wimberley or pick up provisions at the local market to cook your own dinner at Sinya. Whatever your day, you can sit back on your veranda as the sun sets and enjoy a glass of local wine. You two will be all alone (no other tents or guests to distract you) to fall asleep in the king-size bed with goose down pillows and comforter. Wake up to the sounds of nature just outside your tent. The Moorings Village & Spa, Islamorada, Florida . Set aside thoughts of a stereotypical Florida Keys vacation, crowded and overly touristy. A coconut plantation in its former life, The Moorings Village & Spa is for guests who want an Old Florida experience in the Keys. The resort has 18 cottages, a private beach open only to guests, dockage, a heated lap pool, spa services and yoga classes, kayaks and bicycles. You can also book a fishing, diving and snorkeling trip. ""You're at a first-rate resort with first-rate amenities, and the architecture of the cottages is beautiful,"" says DiBenedetto.

"(CNN) -- I write today on behalf of countless V-Day activists worldwide, and in solidarity with my many Congolese sisters and brothers who demand justice and an end to rape and war. It is my hope that these words and those of others will break the silence and break open a sea of action to move Congolese women toward peace, safety and freedom. My play, ""The Vagina Monologues,"" opened my eyes to the world inside this world. Everywhere I traveled with it scores of women lined up to tell me of their rapes, incest, beatings, mutilations. It was because of this that over 11 years ago we launched V-Day, a worldwide movement to end violence against women and girls. The movement has spread like wildfire to 130 countries, raising $70 million. I have visited and revisited the rape mines of the world, from defined war zones like Bosnia, Afghanistan and Haiti to the domestic battlegrounds in colleges and communities throughout North America, Europe and the world. My in-box -- and heart -- have been jammed with stories every hour of every day for over a decade. Nothing I have heard or seen compares with what is going on in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where corporate greed, fueled by capitalist consumption, and the rape of women have merged into a single nightmare. Femicide, the systematic and planned destruction of the female population, is being used as a tactic of war to clear villages, pillage mines and destroy the fabric of Congolese society. In 12 years, there have been 6 million dead men and women in Congo and 1.4 million people displaced. Hundreds and thousands of women and girls have been raped and tortured. Babies as young as 6 months, women as old as 80, their insides torn apart. What I witnessed in Congo has shattered and changed me forever. I will never be the same. None of us should ever be the same. I think of Beatrice, shot in her vagina, who now has tubes instead of organs. Honorata, raped by gangs as she was tied upside down to a wheel. Noella, who is my heart -- an 8-year-old girl who was held for 2 weeks as groups of grown men raped her over and over. Now she has a fistula, causing her to urinate and defecate on herself. Now she lives in humiliation. I was in Bosnia during the war in 1994 when it was discovered there were rape camps where white women were being raped. Within two years there was adequate intervention. Yet, in Congo, femicide has continued for 12 years. Why? Is it that coltan, the mineral that keeps our cell phones and computers in play, is more important than Congolese girls? Is it flat-out racism, the world's utter indifference and disregard for black people and black women in particular? Is it simply that the UN and most governments are run by men who have never known what it feels like to be raped? What is happening in Congo is the most brutal and rampant violence toward women in the world. If it continues to go unchecked, if there continues to be complete impunity, it sets a precedent, it expands the boundaries of what is permissible to do to women's bodies in the name of exploitation and greed everywhere. It's cheap warfare. The women in Congo are some of the most resilient women in the world. They need our protection and support. Western governments, like the United States, should fund a training program for female Congolese police officers. They should address our role in plundering minerals and demand that companies trace the routes of these minerals. Make sure they are making and selling rape-free-products. Supply funds for women's medical and psychological care and seed their economic empowerment. Put pressure on Rwanda, Congo, Uganda and other countries in the Great Lakes region to sit down with all the militias involved in this conflict to find a political solution. Military solutions are no longer an option and will only bring about more rape. Most of all, we must support the women. Because women are at the center of this horror, they must be at the center of the solutions and peace negotiations. Women are the future of Congo. They are its greatest resource. Sadly, we are not the first to testify about these atrocities in Congo. I stand in a line of many who have described this horror. Still, in Eastern Congo, 1,100 women a month are raped, according to the United Nations' most recent report. What will the United States government, what will all of you reading this, do to stop it? Let Congo be the place where we ended femicide, the trend that is madly eviscerating this planet -- from the floggings in Pakistan, the new rape laws in Afghanistan, the ongoing rapes in Haiti, Darfur, Zimbabwe, the daily battering, incest, harassing, trafficking, enslaving, genital cutting and honor killing. Let Congo be the place where women were finally cherished and life affirmed, where the humiliation and subjugation ended, where women took their rightful agency over their bodies and land.

"(CNN) -- Some alcohol, an argument, a flight diversion, a court appearance and a fine -- just another day in the world of celebrity air travel. Jennifer Lauren, niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of ""being intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable (possibility) that you might endanger yourself or other persons on board"" an aircraft, said Susan Dermody from the Ennis Court Office in Ireland. The 41-year old was arrested Monday at Shannon Airport in western Ireland after a Delta Air Lines flight from Barcelona to New York was diverted, according to Irish state broadcaster RTE. It's not the first time, and doubtless won't be the last, a celeb has been the cause of an in-air disturbance. Indeed, these days some might say you're nobody until you've been kicked off a plane. Whether by dressing inappropriately, taking up too much space or simply being themselves, plenty of irritable celebs have made flying a little more interesting for the rest of us. Alec Baldwin: Volcanic PR coup . Alec Baldwin versus American Airlines: let's face it, the only winner here was Words With Friends. The Scrabble-like online game increased its daily active user count by 100,000 within one day after Baldwin's December 2011 drama, from 5.4 million players to 5.5 million players, according to AppData. The 30 Rock star touched off the game's explosion with an explosion of his own -- leaving an American Airlines plane in a huff after a run-in with flight crew over powering down his electronic device. In an e-mail to CNN, Baldwin spokesman Matthew Hiltzik said, ""He loves WWF so much that he was willing to leave a plane for it."" Zynga reacted by launching the #letAlecPlay Twitter campaign. ""That was the most brilliant PR move I've seen this year,"" said John Vlautin, who runs SpinLab in Los Angeles to the Los Angeles Times. A week earlier, Josh Duhamel was booted off a flight from New York to Kentucky when he refused to turn off his BlackBerry, but in the wake of the Mt. Alec eruption, everyone pretty much forgot about that. Kevin Smith: Fat fury . Hell hath no fury like a plus-sized celebrity scorned. On February 13, 2010, noted director Kevin Smith boarded a Southwest Airlines flight in Oakland bound for Burbank when he was asked to get off the plane because his weight and size were a ""safety concern."" Bad move. Smith went on a Twitter tirade. ""I'm way fat ... But I'm not THERE just yet. But if I am, why wait til my bag is up, and I'm seated WITH ARM RESTS DOWN. In front of a packed plane with a bunch of folks who'd already I.d.ed me as 'Silent Bob.'"" Southwest later apologized to Smith and offered him a US$100 voucher, which Smith promptly scoffed at on Twitter while vowing to post anti-Southwest Twitter messages daily. He also devoted an entire episode of SModcast to a play-by-play of the incident and released 24 video statements about it on YouTube. We'd like to note that a year later, Smith lost 65 pounds by eating less and exercising. Billie Joe Armstrong: Fashion police now on board . Passenger suitability appears directly proportional to pant sag when flying on, again, Southwest Airlines. Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong was kicked off a plane in 2011 for wearing pants that hung too low on his hips. Armstrong tweeted on September 1, ""Just got kicked off a southwest flight because my pants sagged too low!"" The musician was on a Southwest Airlines flight from Oakland to Burbank -- is this the same flight that Silent Bob was kicked off of? Southwest apologized to Armstrong, who really should be thankful he wasn't arrested. University of New Mexico football player Deshon Marman was cuffed on June 15 after failing to pull up his sagging pants on a US Airways flight out of San Francisco. The college student faced charges of trespassing and resisting arrest after he refused to obey a pilot and female flight crew member, who claims she saw the outline of what was under his exposed boxer shorts. We'd look, too. Leisha Hailey: No aerosol cans or tonguing . Grope your girlfriend on Southwest Airlines and you might get booted off, as ""The L Word"" actress Leisha Hailey found out in September 2011. Hailey said she and her girlfriend shared ""one, modest kiss."" But a purported eyewitness and TMZ comment leaver later said, ""There was major breast groping going on."" The couple deny the gropage accusation. In a statement aimed at clarifying the incident, they said, ""We were not making out or creating any kind of spectacle of ourselves ... We are responsible adult women who walk through the world with dignity."" Hailey has since called for a boycott of Southwest by gay people. GLAAD are looking into the incident. Gerard Depardieu: 50 ways to reuse a bottle . Celebrity survival test: You're on a plane. The seat belt sign is on. You feel an urge to pee. What do you do in this desperate situation? According to Gerard Depardieu -- France's biggest actor, both figuratively and literally -- the only logical and mature thing to do is pee into a trusty plastic bottle. In August 2011, the Frenchman was stuck on a delayed flight from Paris to Dublin when nature called ... or rather began screaming with terrifying insistence. Unsympathetic flight attendants wouldn't allow the actor to use the bathrooms, which were locked until takeoff. Fellow actor Edouard Baer offered Depardieu an empty bottle to pee into. The bladder-challenged 62-year-old went ahead and did what he had to do. Depardieu probably would have gotten away with it if his aim was better. But some urine got onto the floor. Depardieu offered to clean it up himself. The crew offered to escort him off the plane. One of the passengers said Depardieu had obviously been drinking. Depardieu's anonymous friend said the actor claimed he was absolutely not drunk. Depardieu was once known to drink five or six bottles of wine a day. Liam Gallagher: Most epic and absolutely reasonable in-flight meltdown . A lesson in true rock star behavior: in 1998, Cathay Pacific banned Oasis croaker Liam Gallagher for life from the airline, after the hard-to-please front man allegedly kicked up a fuss over a scone. During a flight from Hong Kong to Perth, Gallagher began his scone rage. Some reports said it was the shape of the scone that upset the testy Oasis vocalist. Others claimed that the snarly 1990s icon and Q Magazine obsession became anti-social after he was refused a flaky treat. Many reports had him threatening the pilot with his baked good, possibly after he buttered it. Passengers complained that Oasis band members refused to stop smoking, threw objects at people and swore at flight attendants. The captain considered diverting the flight and forcing the band and their 30-member entourage to get off the plane. After the ban, the unhappy snarler said that he'd rather walk to Australia than fly on Cathay Pacific.

"(CNN) -- We first thought about starting this piece with the story of Saleha Begum, a survivor of Bangladesh's 1971 war in which, some reports say, as many as 400,000 women were raped. Begum had been tied to a banana tree and repeatedly gang raped and burned with cigarettes for months until she was shot and left for dead in a pile of women. She didn't die, though, and was able to return home, ravaged and five months pregnant. When she got home she was branded a ""slut."" We also thought of starting with the story of Ester Abeja, a woman in Uganda who was forcibly held as a ""bush wife"" by the Lord's Resistance Army. Repeated rape with objects destroyed her insides. Her captors also made her kill her 1-year-old daughter by smashing the baby's head into a tree. We ran through a dozen other stories of women like Begum and Abeja, and finally realized that it would be too difficult to find the right one -- the tale that would express exactly how and in what ways sexualized violence is being used as a weapon of war to devastate women and tear apart communities around the world, conflict by conflict, from Libya to the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is because of this complexity that we must understand how sexualized violence is being used. We must understand in order to stop it -- just as, when seeking to defuse a bomb, it is crucial to know its components. Both the World Health Organization and the U.N. Security Council have recognized that there is a lack of research on the nature and extent of sexualized violence in conflict, even as there is increasing demand from U.N. bodies, donors, and others for better analysis to work toward prevention and healing. All of this is why we have begun a new project at the Women's Media Center that breaks down the specifics of sexualized violence into areas such as its motives and patterns, its fallout, and the gender and cultural attitudes that may have led to it. We're calling our project Women Under Siege, because with four women being raped every five minutes in Congo alone, we can say it is nothing less than that -- an ongoing siege. And it's time we began to put an end to it. Sexualized violence may be the only form of violence in which the victim is blamed or is even said to have invited it. In war, rape shames women, men, children, entire societies. The stigma imposed on all who are touched by this violence makes this weapon incredibly effective as a means of destroying the enemy. But it is crucial to remember that it wasn't always like this, nor does it have to be. Sexualized violence isn't a ""natural"" part of conflict. For the first 90% or more of human history, females and males had roles that were balanced and porous. Our societal positions weren't based on the domination of females by males. Humans and nature, women and men, were linked rather than ranked. The circle, not the hierarchy, was the organizing principle of our thinking. By analyzing how sexualized violence was used to ethnically cleanse, as it was in Bosnia; to force pregnancies that would literally change the face of the next generation; or, as in Egypt, to stop dissent, we can look to future wars and possibly prevent a reoccurrence. For generations, we have ignored or been denied knowledge of the mass sexualized violence inflicted on Jewish women in the Holocaust. Women who survived brutal attacks have even been accused of collaborating in order to survive, just as, say, a raped woman in the Congo may never be accepted back into her village or family because she is considered culpable. Last year, a book called ""Sexual Violence Against Jewish Women During the Holocaust"" brought to light how the Nazis perpetrated rape and sexual humiliation on a tremendous scale. Yet none of this had been revealed or tried at Nuremburg. If we'd known about this earlier, might it have helped prevent rape camps in the former Yugoslavia? Or rape as a weapon of genocide in the Congo? Naming sexualized violence as a weapon of war makes it visible -- and once visible, prosecutable. What happened to men in the past was political, but what happened to women was cultural. The political was public and could be changed; the other was private -- even sacred -- and could not or even should not be changed. Making clear that sexualized violence is political and public breaks down that wall. It acknowledges that sexualized violence does not need to happen. When masculinity is no longer defined by the possession and domination of women, when femininity is no longer about the absence of sexual experience or being owned, then we will have begun. But first, we have to stop saying sexualized violence is inevitable, or allowing its victims to be blamed. We have to imagine change before we can create it. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- A South Korean left-wing activist was arrested Thursday for an unauthorized visit to North Korea, a South Korean national police official said. Roh Su-hui, a leader with an organization close to North Korea, was taken into custody as he crossed back into South Korea after three months, the official said. Roh visited Pyongyang to commemorate the 100th day since the death of the country's late leader, Kim Jong Il, according to KCNA, North Korea's official news agency. KCNA called his visit ""a righteous deed in view of traditional beautiful manners"" and urged the South not to arrest him. Nevertheless, he was immediately arrested for illegal entry and glorifying his country's political rival. He walked across the two countries' heavily guarded border in the demilitarized zone and was brought in for questioning, according to an official from the South's National Police Agency who refused to be named in line with Korean policy. So far, he has refused to speak about his visit, the official said. Authorities will be interrogating him and will likely charge him under the National Security Law (NSL) within two days, the official told CNN. The NSL was designed to protect the state against North Korean propaganda and to prosecute spies. It was used widely during the years of military dictatorship in the 1970s and '80s. ""Roh Su-hui's illegal entry to North Korea and his slandering of the South's government and praising of the North is an illegal act. Upon Roh Su-hui's return, he will be investigated on the purpose of his visit and his whereabouts in the North and will be strictly dealt with in according to relevant law,"" Unification Ministry spokeswoman Park Soo-jin said in a regular briefing Wednesday. North Korea claims that ""the South is using Roh's return as a pretext for eliminating the progressive pro-reform forces."" South Korea did not send any representatives to the North after Kim's death. Tension between the two countries remains high since North Korea's shelling attack on a South Korean island in 2010 and the sinking of a South Korean warship in a torpedo attack blamed on the North.","Roh Su-hui went to North Korea to mark the 100-day anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death .

"(CNN) -- S. Truett Cathy, who grew his boneless chicken sandwich business from one store in Georgia to the Chick-fil-A chain -- a $5 billion company with more than 1,800 locations -- died early Monday morning. He was 93. He had been ailing for some time. ""He died peacefully at home, surrounded by loved ones,"" Chick-fil-A said in a statement posted on its website. Deeply religious, Cathy made the decision when he opened his first store in Hapeville, Georgia, that it would stay closed on Sundays. Sixty-eight years later, that policy still stands at all Chick-fil-A stores. Dreaming up the sandwich . Cathy first dreamed up his concept for a chicken sandwich after a poultry distributor wondered if there was a way to use leftover chicken from meals prepared for plane passengers. He tried it on his customers at his Hapeville store, the Dwarf Grill. The first Chick-fil-A opened at a mall in Atlanta in 1967. Today, Chick-fil-A has surpassed KFC in U.S. sales. But the company Cathy founded remains privately held and family-owned. Share your memories . Wading into controversy . In recent years, Cathy handed over the reins of the company to his son, Dan, and assumed the title of chairman emeritus. Chick-fil-A's leadership shares Cathy's religious beliefs, openly espousing biblical values not only in its operating principles but in its conservative definition of family as well. Gay and lesbian rights groups have had a longstanding beef with Chick-fil-A over what they claim is the company's opposition to gay marriage. In 2012, the company was forced to weather a firestorm of criticism when Dan Cathy weighed in on the issue in an interview with The Baptist Press. ""We are very much supportive of the family -- the biblical definition of the family unit,"" Cathy said. ""We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.""","His stores remain closed on Sundays .

"(CNN) -- No doubt, it is difficult to design operating systems for computers that simultaneously run numerous applications, while managing interactions between multiple types of hardware and responding to a multitude of commands from users. Now imagine trying to design a similar operating system not for a laptop, a PC or even a smartphone, but rather for something much, much tinier -- a living biological cell. This is exactly what a group of scientists at the University of Nottingham, in England, will attempt to do as part of a five-year, $1.58 million research project that has been aptly named AudACiOus -- which, according to researchers is derived from ""towArds a Universal BiologicAl-Cell Operating System"" with an extraneous ""D"" and ""U"" thrown in. It is undoubtedly an audacious and ambitious initiative, but if the researchers are successful it could result in a major breakthrough for synthetic biology -- a relatively new and somewhat controversial interdisciplinary field. It combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science and engineering to program genetic components of a cell to perform new biological functions -- such as bacteria that could produce biofuel or vaccines. Researchers say the project could lead to the creation of completely new cellular life forms that could do anything from cleaning up pollutants in the environment to detecting and treating viruses before they enter the human body. ""It would have a large impact on many of the key issues that are facing humanity right now,"" said Natalio Krasnogor, a computer science professor at the University of Nottingham who is leading the AudACiOus project. ""This includes carbon sequestration, bioremediation of polluted environments, personalized health care, sustainable energy."" There have already been remarkable achievements in the field. Last year, Jay Keasling, a professor of bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley published a paper in Nature describing how his lab engineered E. coli to produce diesel fuel. But manipulating parts of a cell remains an overall vastly laborious and expensive endeavor, according to Krasnogor. ""For each single application you have in mind, you have to start from scratch, and you have to start all of the design of the biological roots from scratch,"" he said. ""The analogy in the computer industry would be that each time you write a computer program you have to write the entire operating system."" That's why Krasnogor hopes his team will be able to create a line of cells running a generic ""cellular operating system"" that could be re-programmed with different applications. Or, in other words, it would be similar to computers running an operating system that could then be tweaked with different software to meet the needs of its users. He says they aim to build a biological interface between the minimal components a cell requires to stay alive and other components that can be programmed to execute specific jobs. Or, in essence, it would be like identifying the minimal hardware components required for a computer to turn on as well as the circuitry that enables that hardware to be programmed to carry out new tasks. ""If we change the operating system, then whatever modification we want to do later on will be easier,"" Krasnogor said. ""The truth is there is no guarantee we will succeed,"" he added. ""This is a high risk, high return project."" Scientists not involved with the project agree it will be difficult. J Christopher Anderson, a synthetic biologist at the University of California Berkeley, said he is taking a ""wait and see"" view towards the project. ""As much as I'd love to see someone find the theory or practice that simplifies genetic engineering down to something easy, I'm skeptical as to whether any one technical effort could provide that simplification,"" he said. ""It's hard to imagine there would be one thing that would be truly revolutionary,"" he added.""There are so many complications at play, so many little pieces that have to be found and put together. ""There are theory gaps. There are tools gaps. There are so many other bottlenecks. But it could be an important and difficult piece of the puzzle.""","Researchers hope to create an ""operating system"" for living cells .

"(CNN) -- The United States and Afghanistan have reached a deal on the final language of a bilateral security agreement, guiding the role of American troops in that south Asian nation for years to come, America's top diplomat said Wednesday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the accord was reached during conversations Wednesday between himself and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Afghan leaders will hold a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- starting on Thursday to decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year. ""They have to pass it,"" Kerry said. ""... It's up to the people of Afghanistan."" If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last ""until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated"" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic. Rice: Reports of a U.S. apology to Afghanistan are false . The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting ""Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" and adds U.S. forces ""shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes."" But this agreement does not address past transgressions. In fact, Kerry strongly rejected a U.S. apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back-and-forth, as some published reports suggested, insisting ""it's just not even on the table."" ""I don't know where the idea of an apology started,"" Kerry said. ""President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever."" The agreement does state that U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan, while at the same time ceding that ""U.S. military operations to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism."" ""U.S. military counterterrorism operations are intended to complement and support (the Afghan military's) counterterrorism operations, with the goal of maintaining (the Afghan military's) lead and with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes,"" the tentative deal states. Mine blast kills seven -- and they were all children . The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The U.S. military ""shall have the exclusive right"" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country. U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation. Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that. Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that any U.S. forces would have ""a very limited mission"" and would not be ""patrolling cities or mountains."" ""The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised,"" Carney said. ""The combat mission will be over."" Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan ""very limited,"" adding ""it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist"" Afghan forces. The language in the proposed security agreement, in fact, speaks to that point: ""Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan.""

"(CNN) -- Weeks after muting his public criticisms, Ai Weiwei has broken his silence. In an editorial about China's capital city, published on Newsweek's website on August 29, the country's most prominent contemporary artist and dissident describes Beijing as ""a city of violence"" and ""a constant nightmare."" He complained that ""the worst thing about Beijing is that you can never trust the judicial system."" ""Beijing is two cities,"" he opines. ""One is of power and of money. The other city is one of desperation. I see people on public buses, and I see their eyes, and I see they hold no hope."" Ai, 54, was part of a team that helped design the Bird's Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympics. Later, however, he called for a boycott of the 2008 Summer Games because he said China was using them as propaganda. Ai Weiwei joins Google+ . In his essay Ai remains critical. ""None of my art represents Beijing,"" he writes. ""The Bird's Nest -- I never think about it. After the Olympics, the common folks don't talk about it because the Olympics did not bring joy to the people."" Ai's new comments could further strain his relations with the Chinese officialS. On April 3 Ai was detained at the Beijing airport while en route to Hong Kong. He was held for 81 days. Chinese authorities accused him of tax evasion, although he was never formally charged. His family maintains that the detention was politically motivated. The maverick artist had offended Chinese authorities with his use of avant garde art and the Internet to criticize government policies and behavior. He used social networking sites like Twitter and its Chinese version ""weibo"" to influence public opinion and lobby against official abuse. Months after the massive 2008 earthquake, for example, he mobilized hundreds of volunteers to investigate the deaths of schoolchildren in school buildings that collapsed in the Sichuan quake. Ai later published their names on this Twitter account to demand accountability. He has also accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents. In the past several months, rights groups say China has rounded up lawyers, human rights activists and bloggers following online calls for anti-government protests-a ""Jasmine Revolution"" -- similar to those that have swept the Middle East. Government censors also have apparently blocked internet links to phrases like ""jasmine revolution"" and names such as ""Ai Weiwei"" to cut the flow of information, activists say. When Ai was released from detention in June, Beijing reportedly imposed conditions on him, including a gag order, forbidding him from talking to the press. But Ai is now again speaking out publicly. In his Newsweek editorial, the artist writes, ""there are positives to beijing,"" pointing out that there are a few nice parks. He writes about walking in a park in Beijing and notes that a few people came up to him and gave him a thumbs-up or a pat on the shoulder. Ai asks: ""Why do they have to do that in such a secretive way? No one is willing to speak out. What are they waiting for?""","Ai Weiwei describes Beijing as ""a city of violence"" in a recent Newsweek article .

"(CNN) -- The rollout of the Affordable Care Act has been filled with problems and controversy. Facing entrenched opposition from a Republican Party that has been determined to subvert the program from the moment it passed, President Barack Obama has frustrated supporters by continuing to offer the GOP plenty of ammunition for their attacks. The website for purchasing health care has been an embarrassment. The contradictions between Obama's promises about everyone being able to keep their existing coverage and the reality that millions of Americans would not be able to do so has raised memories of President George H.W. Bush's famous ""Read My Lips"" pledge. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has admitted that the enrollment numbers will fall well short of what was expected. While it is true that the challenges facing the program have received much more attention than the successes, the problems are impossible to ignore. There are many reasons for Obamacare's troubles, ranging from the failure of White House officials to adequately prepare for the launch of the website to the successful Republican efforts to undermine its operations, including the refusal of many governors to establish exchanges in their own states. But a large part of the problem was the underlying ideological outlook that shaped the original proposal. The ACA was a product of a kind of half-baked liberalism that has been popular among many Democrats for several decades. Since the 1990s, many Democrats have settled for jerry-built proposals that shy away from direct and aggressive federal intervention. Many Democrats have concluded that in the current era, the only domestic programs that stand a chance of passing Congress are those that rely on the participation of market-based actors, limited federal funding and heavy federal-state collaboration in the administrative process. Conservatives have been very effective at defining the national agenda throughout these years, defending the argument that government is the problem, as Ronald Reagan famously said, and nurturing a political coalition that has continually pushed liberals into the corner. In response, many Democrats concluded that the best strategy was to veer toward the center. They have pushed programs that create incentives for Americans to do certain things within the private market, rather than just offering those services themselves directly through the government. While many domestic programs in the United States included this kind of mix throughout the 20th century, in recent decades Democrats have embraced this approach even more aggressively for fear that anything more sweeping would die in Congress. While there are good political reasons behind this approach, it has also come at a huge long-term cost to the strength of the programs, and Obama is now paying the price. Foremost, these mixed public-private programs have trouble building strong public support. Their complexity makes it difficult for politicians to excite the public and explain the benefits to constituents. Often the benefits are hard to discern for most Americans who see a patchwork of regulatory policies. The complexity allows opponents to characterize the programs in unfavorable terms, even spreading false information without strong pushback. President Bill Clinton learned this in 1993 when his market-based proposal for health care was turned by Republicans into a state-centered monstrosity and went down to defeat. The contrast with Social Security is striking. Under President Franklin Roosevelt's program, created in 1935, the federal government directly sends paychecks to the elderly. Americans have always understood the benefits they receive. The clarity of the funding, with a payroll tax paying for benefits, has also been important in creating a sense of ownership among workers that has pushed them to support the program for decades. The other problem with half-baked liberalism is that it provides many points for opponents to weaken measures after they have passed. The implementation process becomes a nightmare. We have seen this with the Dodd-Frank legislation that established a relatively weak regulatory infrastructure filled with loopholes that has allowed the financial services sector to continue to engage in highly risky behavior. Another example is the fact that Obama's economic stimulus program in 2009 did not include the kinds of public works jobs that defined the success of the New Deal for many Americans. Mixed public-private programs often fail to address the underlying forces causing a problem, while giving private industry a chance to reap profits off the policy. This is what critics said of the Empowerment Zones of the 1990s, a style of urban policy that had limited effect on revitalizing impoverished urban areas. The ACA has been no different. The legislation required states to set up federal exchanges and mandated that the federal government would create an exchange of its own for individuals living in states that lacked their own system. This design allowed Republican governors to block the creation of state exchanges and intensify the pressure on the federal government to handle the program. Congress didn't devote to ACA the funding that was needed to handle this task. ACA also relies on the expansion of Medicaid to provide coverage to the uninsured. But the legislation left itself open to legal challenge and the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of this expansion. The result is that in many states, the future of the uninsured remains up for grabs. Rather than providing insurance directly through a public option, the legislation instead relied on a mandate to force qualified individuals to purchase private coverage through exchanges. The risk is that premiums continue to stay high and that access to the programs continues to remain problematic, all of which will make ACA look like less of an improvement than many hoped for. The design of the program will also likely strengthen the government-health care complex that has grown since the creation of Medicare. The president has been notably quiet in criticizing the insurance companies in recent weeks. As Politico reported, one White House official said, ""Their interests are aligned with our interests in terms of wanting to enroll targeted populations. It is not that we will agree with everything now either, but I would say for some time now there has been a collaboration because of that mutual interest."" The government also tied its own hands in regulating costs by backing down from original proposals to regulate drug prices. In a recent article in National Affairs, Johns Hopkins University political scientist Steven Teles writes about ""Kludgeocracy in America,"" which he defines as the nation's tendency to offer complex and byzantine policy solutions to the most pressing policy problems. The solutions we offer are temporary and short-term fixes to long-term problems that leave no one satisfied and often intensify distrust of government. According to Teles, if the government chose cleaner solutions to big challenges such as health care and education, ""government would be bigger and more energetic where it clearly chose to act . . . but smaller and less intrusive outside of that sphere."" The stakes of fixing the health care mess are enormous for the President as well as for liberals who want to prove that government is capable of handling big problems. But the policy problems should also be a wake up call for liberals that it might be worth fighting for something bigger next time around. It was not inevitable that Obama chose the path that he did. Despite the conventional wisdom, there is plenty of evidence that liberalism remains quite strong in the body politic -- based on ongoing support for specific programs like Social Security, strong electoral performance of Democrats in 2008 and 2012 on campaigns that emphasized progressive themes and the miserable approval ratings of the GOP. While it is true that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good in American politics, it is also true that sometimes a fight for the perfect is one worth having and could produce results that only strengthen the case for more.

"(CNN) -- An exiled Rwandan rebel leader is being transferred to the International Criminal Court to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, the Paris prosecutor's office said Tuesday. Callixte Mbarushimana was arrested in Paris in October under an ICC warrant involving allegations of mass rape and other crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mbarushimana, a leader of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), is charged with 11 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes including rape, gender-based persecution and property destruction by his group in 2009, an ICC statement said in October. At the time of the arrest, ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo thanked authorities in France, Germany, Congo and Rwanda for their help, calling it a ""crucial step in efforts to prosecute the massive sexual crimes committed in the DRC."" The ICC statement said Mbarushimana was the first senior leader arrested for the atrocities in North and South Kivu provinces of Congo. The FDLR comprises mainly Hutu extremists who fled to Congo after taking part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The ICC statement blamed the group for instigating war in Congo as part of its efforts to topple the government in neighboring Rwanda. Mbarushimana left Rwanda in the aftermath of the war and worked for the United Nations until he was dismissed in 2001 when it was revealed that he was the subject of an investigation by the United Nations' own criminal tribunal for Rwanda. In 2005, CNN spoke with Mbarushimana in France, where he had refugee status. He maintained his innocence. ""I am not afraid of justice. What I am afraid of is injustice, like what is taking place in Rwanda for instance, where people are not really tried properly,"" he aid at the time. The ICC said Mbarushimana ""has held senior positions in the political leadership of the FDLR"" since 2004. The ICC, seated at The Hague in the the Netherlands, describes itself on its website as ""the first permanent, treaty based, international criminal court established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community.""","Callixte Mbarushimana was arrested in Paris in October .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's youthful leader, Kim Jong Un, has married a woman named Ri Sol Ju, according to a report by state news agency KCNA Wednesday. The couple appeared together at the opening of the Rungna People's Pleasure Ground in the capital, Pyongyang, the news agency said. Kim and his wife toured the park in the company of local and international officials and watched dolphins perform stunts to music, KCNA said. The park, on the Taedong River, includes a dolphinarium, wading pool, fun fair and mini golf course, it said. No details were given of when Kim and Ri were married, but she is referred to several times by the news agency as his wife. Little is known about Kim, who became the third generation of his family to lead his reclusive country when he assumed power following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December. Kim Jong Il, known as ""Dear Leader,"" had ruled for 17 years after inheriting power from the country's founding father, Kim Il Sung, the eternal president and ""Great Leader."" North Korea's cult of personality surrounds Kim . Kim Jong Un was granted the title of ""Supreme Leader."" His age is still a source of speculation, though it's thought that he's in his late 20s. This month, there was much speculation about the identity of a young woman who was by his side during more than one official engagement. On one occasion, she accompanied the young leader to a Pyongyang theater on a Friday night to watch a performance of North Korea's Moranbong band. The display included a cast of Disney characters, although The Walt Disney Co. said their use was not authorized. The same woman was seen on state TV two days later, walking a few paces behind Kim as he toured Kumsusan Palace in Pyongyang, and then she was shown standing to attention at Kim's side as they and top military officials paid tribute to his grandfather. Her appearance was a sufficiently unusual event to prompt newspaper headlines in neighboring South Korea. What Kim's 'mystery woman' says about North Korea . Analysts have watched North Korea closely for clues to any shift in direction since Kim Jong Un assumed power. ""He is the youngest head of state in the world,"" analyst Patrick Chovanec said. ""There's still a lot of debate about how much power he has, whether other family members are in control or the military."" In April, Kim gave his first televised speech since assuming the country's leadership, when he addressed hundreds of troops and others in Pyongyang as part of a massive, orchestrated celebration marking 100 years since the birth of his grandfather. He gave his second public speech in June, before tens of thousands of children in Pyongyang on the 66th anniversary of the Korean Children's Union. His father is believed to have made only one brief broadcast while in charge. According to what little has been revealed about him, Kim Jong Un was educated partly in Switzerland, loves music and Western movies, and is a huge basketball fan.

"(CNN) -- Although a fierce critic of Barack Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney does not support calls from some on the far right of his party to impeach him, saying it would simply create a distraction. ""I'm not prepared at this point to call for the impeachment of the President,"" Cheney said in an interview with CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" Cheney believes Obama is ""the worst president of my lifetime"" and that ""Jimmy Carter might have been a better President,"" but impeaching him is not going to accomplish much. Both Obama and Carter are Democrats, while Cheney is a conservative Republican who served two terms under George W. Bush. Calls for the Republican-led House to impeach Obama are coming from Sarah Palin and other harsh conservative critics at the height of midterm campaigning. His administration's handling of the immigration crisis on the southern border has amplified the small chorus. However, such a step is considered far-fetched, especially after House Speaker John Boehner expressed disagreement with the premise in this case. Obama has clashed repeatedly and sharply with Republicans during his presidency. Cheney, however, did offer limited support for House Republican efforts to sue Obama over their claims he has abused his authority on a number of occasions by unlawfully going around Congress to carry out policy. They're focusing their unusual legal action on a piece of Obamacare, a major political flashpoint between the GOP and the President and his supporters. ""I'm glad to see the House Republicans are challenging him at least legally at this point. But I think that gets to be a bit of a distraction just like the impeachment of Bill Clinton did,"" Cheney said. Clinton was impeached over the Monica Lewinsky affair, but not convicted by the Senate. Defiant Cheney accepts no blame for Iraq . Cheney also said that the Bush administration left Iraq in reasonably good shape after years of war, and blamed Obama for not getting a security agreement from Iraqi leader Nouri al-Maliki to keep some U.S. troops there after combat operations ended to help ensure stability. Resurgent Sunni extremists have swept through parts of northern and central Iraq in recent weeks, exposing serious shortcomings in Iraqi security and governance. Obama has sent military advisers to assess the situation, but pledges no new ground troops. The debacle has opened another front for Republicans in criticizing the administration's foreign policy. ""Obama's failure to provide for a stay-behind force is what created the havoc we see in Iraq today,"" Cheney said. ""When we left Iraq was a relatively stable place. We defeated al Qaeda, we had a coalition government in place,"" he added. Asked whether some of the decisions made by him and Bush are responsible for the upheaval in Iraq now, Cheney deflected blame. ""I think it's primarily Maliki, and Obama. That's what I believe, and that's what the history books will show,"" Cheney said. Opinion: Cheney's amazing chutzpah on Iraq . CNN's Edward Meagher contributed to this report.

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney's campaign can now point to at least one thing it has in common with Ronald Reagan's -- a musical act is asking it to stop using its music at campaign stops. The rock band Silversun Pickups this week served Romney's campaign with a cease-and-desist order after it says Romney's campaign used its song ""Panic Switch"" at an event earlier this month. ""Seems as if the GOP is once again whimsically ignoring our great nation's laws to do whatever it wants to do, and shooting itself in the foot in the process,"" band representative Ken Weinstein said in a statement. Ryan Rages Against the Machine . The band's lead singer and guitarist Brian Aubert couldn't resist making a political point: ""We were very close to just letting this go, because the irony was too good. While he is inadvertently playing a song that describes his whole campaign, we doubt that 'Panic Switch' really sends the message he intends."" A Romney spokeswoman, Amanda Henneberg, responded to the request, saying, ""The song was inadvertently played during event setup before Gov. Romney arrived at the location."" ""As anyone who attends Gov. Romney's events knows, this is not a song we would have played intentionally. That said, it was covered under the campaign's regular blanket license, but we will not play it again,"" said Henneberg. Squabbles between artists and campaigns over artistic sensibilities, political compatibility, and rights issues have become as much a political tradition as campaign buttons. Among the most famous of these is the clash between Reagan and Bruce Springsteen. During the 1984 campaign, Reagan told a New Jersey crowd, ""America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside our hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire: New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen."" But Reagan apparently hadn't heard the lyrics. ""Born in the U.S.A.,"" the song he referred to, wasn't a message of hope and pride but of ""how this country is going to pot, essentially, and do something about it,"" said Lorraine Ali, pop music editor at the Los Angeles Times. Springsteen wasn't amused. Springsteen later told Rolling Stone magazine, ""I think people have a need to feel good about the country they live in. But what's happening, I think, is that that need -- which is a good thing -- is getting manipulated and exploited. You see in the Reagan election ads on TV, you know, 'It's morning in America,' and you say, 'Well, it's not morning in Pittsburgh.'"" ICP on FBI lawsuit . Springsteen so much wanted to convey the actual message of his song that he ""took to playing 'Born in the U.S.A.' on an acoustic guitar so it wouldn't sound so rousing anymore,"" said Joe Levy, editor of Billboard Magazine . Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign also came under fire for using music from artists who did not support it. In 2008, the band Heart asked the campaign to stop playing its song ""Barracuda"" in honor of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's nickname on her high school basketball team, ""Sarah Barracuda."" The band even went on national television to express its outrage. ""Sarah Palin's views and values in no way represent us as American women,"" Ann and Nancy Wilson told Entertainment Weekly. ""We ask that our song 'Barracuda' no longer be used to promote her image."" McCain also settled out of court with Jackson Browne for using his 1977 hit ""Running on Empty"" in a campaign ad without the artist's permission. Foo Fighters, John Mellencamp and Boston asked McCain and other candidates to stop using their music. And Tom Petty didn't find Michele Bachmann his type of ""American Girl."" The rocker's manager asked the Bachmann campaign to stop using his 1977 hit ""American Girl"" after it was played during the kickoff event for the Minnesota representative's presidential bid. Petty also asked President George W. Bush not to use his music during his campaign, The Washington Post reported. But those artists were alive to protect their music. Ludwig von Beethoven's Ninth Symphony has been co-opted by everyone from dictators to revolutionaries. Esteban Buch's book ""Beethoven's Ninth: A Political History"" chronicles the symphony's use in clashing political contexts from Hitler's birthday, to the deadly protests in China's Tiananmen Square, to the fall of the Berlin Wall.

"(CNN) -- When Andrew Bynum walks into a room, people step aside. At 7 feet tall and 285 pounds, Bynum is the starting center for the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers. He hurls his Mack-Truck-like shoulders against some of the biggest and baddest men on the planet every game night. Bynum recently came across a book that was as ruthless as anyone he's encountered in the NBA. ""At first, I was shocked,"" he says. ""I thought it was cutthroat."" Bynum started reading ""The 48 Laws of Power."" The best-selling book offers a collection of 48 laws that show people how to gain power, preserve it, and defend themselves against those powerful people who make their lives miserable. Unlike most self-help books, ""The 48 Laws"" offers advice that the author freely admits is, at times, cunning and amoral. It includes lessons like ""Law 1: Never outshine the master"" and ""Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy."" The lessons are distilled from colorful anecdotes lifted from 4,000 years of history. They include insights into the scheming of powerful people such as Al Capone, P.T. Barnum and Henry Kissinger. The book has proved to be so popular that it has spawned several sequels, one recently co-authored by the popular rapper 50 Cent, called ""The 50th Law."" Meet the man behind the laws of power . Robert Greene, author of ""The 48 Laws,"" says our fascination with power is rooted in our DNA. ""We want to believe we're descended from angels when we're descended from primates,"" Greene says. ""This is part of our nature and there's nothing to be ashamed of."" Greene says the struggle for power affects even the most benign human relationships. Think of how babies threaten, badger and scheme to get their way, he says. ""Children can be incredibly manipulative,"" Greene says. Greene, whose laid-back, soft-spoken demeanor seems at odds with his books, has long been fascinated with power. At first, his interest was restricted to sports. Then he earned a degree in classical studies and saw how power shaped history. Greene says he received his next lesson in power when he began working as a writer in Hollywood. Every transaction -- business or personal -- revolved around someone grasping for more power, he says. Greene realized that Hollywood's power elite didn't act all that differently from the ancient Athenians and Chinese emperors he encountered in his classical studies. He decided to share his insights in a book. ""I wanted to show that what was going on was not new,"" Greene says. ""No one wanted to talk about how these incredible manipulative games had been going on for thousands of years."" One of Greene's central claims is that everyone must learn the rules of power. He describes the world as a ""giant scheming court,"" and says we're all courtiers, whether we like it or not. ""There is no use in trying to opt out of the game,"" he writes in the introduction to the book. ""... Instead of struggling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty, it is far better to excel at power."" Practicing the laws of power . That's the lesson that Bynum, the Los Angeles Lakers' center, says he's learned. Bynum likes Law 18: ""Do not build fortresses to protect yourself -- isolation is dangerous."" It tells the story of Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor of China. The emperor was so paranoid about his enemies that he slept in a different room each night and never let any of his subjects see him. The result: He lost power because he lost touch. Greene's lesson: Isolation exposes you more than it protects you. Circulate among people, build allies and learn to spot your enemies. ""That was cool,"" says Bynum, who says he has to be leery of people who try to take advantage of his celebrity. ""It's good to be out there, to visit and to see your enemies and even be in the same room with them."" Adam Ishaeik made Greene's book required reading for a business management class he taught at Michigan State University. His students loved it, he says, because it was more practical than most business or self-help books. Ishaeik's favorite law: Law 10: ""Avoid the unhappy and unlucky."" That law says that one should avoid people who always attract misfortune. They can ""infect"" others with their pathology. The law's solution for dealing with a master of misfortune: Don't help or argue with an ""infector"" or you will become ""enmeshed"" in their problems. Flee them. Don't return the call. Ishaeik says he once became involved with some ""infector"" relationships that resulted in his living out of his car for five months while becoming deeply depressed. When he cut those people out of his life, he says, his life took off. He is now the CEO of  a company that secures government contracts for small businesses. ""If someone is always unlucky and things are always happening to them, deep down inside, there's something that's attracting it,"" Ishaeik says. ""You don't want to be around them."" Dov Charney, founder and CEO of American Apparel, is also a fan of Greene's laws of power. He calls them laws of nature. ""Every single human interaction involves this power exchange,"" he says. ""But it doesn't mean that power can't be generous or philanthropic."" The book, though, has its critics. Jeffrey Pfeffer is a Stanford University professor and management guru. People like lists, he says, but 48 laws are too much. ""If you give people a list of 48 things, they're certainly not going to remember them in a situation when they need to use them,"" says Pfeffer, author of the forthcoming book ""Power: Why Some People Have it and Others Don't."" Pfeffer says Greene's laws are flawed because they are based on isolated historical examples. Why not build laws around solid research, like a study or experiments? ""If you go to a doctor and the doctor says you have a disease, and we know the treatment because we tried it on one person and it worked -- wouldn't you love to have the treatment based on a long-term study?"" Pfeffer asks. Criticism doesn't seem to rattle Greene. He says he had some tough times in his early career when he violated the first law of power in his book (""Never outshine the master""). But learning the laws of power has given him tranquility. ""It just brings a sense of calmness and detachment because things don't bother me,"" he says. ""I observe everyone else's power games. It's a beautiful position to be in.""","Book's ruthless guide to power has won fans .

"(CNN) -- The Pledge of Allegiance is recited in classrooms across the country every morning -- and because of the words ""under God,"" it is heard in courtrooms across the country seemingly just as often these days. Every attempt to eliminate the mention of God has thus far failed, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts will hear arguments on Wednesday seeking removal of the two words for a new reason: discrimination. ""This is the first challenge of its kind"" said Roy Speckhardt, the executive director of the American Humanist Association, an atheist group arguing for the plaintiffs. ""We feel very confident that we have a strong case."" That case, which was brought by an unidentified family of a student at a school in suburban Boston, will be argued on the premise that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution. It is the first such case to be tried on the state level: All previous attempts have been argued in federal court on the grounds that 'under God' was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of church and state. ""They're grasping at straws"" said Eric Rassbach of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the attorney arguing to leave the pledge as it is. ""They know they would lose again if they tried it under the First Amendment, so now they are trying a new tack."" Rassbach dismissed the discrimination claim because he said everyone has the right to opt out of saying the pledge. ""This would be very different if they were forced to recite the pledge,"" he said. But that makes little difference in the eyes of Speckhardt. ""The opt-out itself is exclusionary and unpleasant"" he said. ""Children are left with a bad choice: either stand up and recite something against your beliefs, or opt out and be ostracized."" The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has previous high-profile and precedent-setting experience deciding cases hinging on the Equal Rights Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution. In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage with the Supreme Judicial Court's landmark Goodridge decision. ""I think there is a reason why they chose this court"" Rassbach said. ""But the law is the law, and I think the court will decide that this is not discrimination, but a disagreement."" Rassbach said he fears a loss in Massachusetts would inspire ""copycat"" lawsuits in the handful of other states that have similar clauses in their constitutions -- a fear Speckhardt certainly didn't assuage.

"(CNN) -- Patrick Reed became the youngest player to win a World Golf Championship event Sunday as the 23-year-old Texan held on for a one-shot victory in the Cadillac Championship in Florida. Dressed in the trademark red of the previous record holder Tiger Woods, Reed carded a level par 72 at Doral to total four-under 284. Welshman Jamie Donaldson and Bubba Watson tied for second, while Woods re-aggravated his back injury as he limped home with a six-over 78 to leave him tied for 25th. The world number one had started the day only three back of Reed after a brilliant third round 66, but did not make a birdie for only the eighth time in his career. With the first major of the season looming at Augusta, Woods will be hoping to make a quick recovery and be able to play in the Arnold Palmer Invitational in two weeks time. Reed is the latest young gun to challenge the established order and it was his third victory on the PGA Tour in the last 14 starts although by far the biggest with a winning check of $1,530,000. He was not short on confidence either in his victory television interview: ""I have three wins on the PGA Tour,"" he said. ""You don't see a lot of guys that have done that. I feel I'm one of the top five players in the world."" A bold statement, but Reed's wire to wire victory was certainly impressive and he opened up a four-shot lead around the turn on the Blue Monster. But as Donaldson and former Masters winner Watson began to make up ground, Reed started to struggle, bogeying the 15th to give his rivals hope. A brilliant par save on 17th gave him breathing space, with Donaldson bogeying the last to go back into a tie in the clubhouse with Watson on three under. Reed could afford to bogey the last as he completed another memorable victory on only his second year on the PGA Tour. Other big names as well as Woods also struggled and former number one Rory McIlroy, who challenged at halfway, finished with a 74 to leave himself on the five over mark. ""On the greens I didn't get anything going with the putter and anytime I missed the green I didn't really get anything going,"" McIlroy moaned. World number two Adam Scott also finished tied 25th at five over, having gone into the $9 million event with hopes of leap frogging Woods.","Patrick Reed claims WGC-Cadillac Championship .

"(CNN) -- Dueling theories of how the universe was created got a split decision Friday night from the Texas Board of Education, which required examination of ""all sides of scientific evidence"" in new science standards, but rejected language requiring teachers to teach the ""strengths and weaknesses"" of scientific theories. A woman stands in front of a mural depicting the development from ape to computer user. The debate pitted proponents of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution against supporters of religion-based theories of intelligent design, or creationism. ""Science loses. Texas loses, and the kids lose because of this,"" board chairman Don McLeroy, a creationist, told the Dallas Morning News. A final 13-2 vote approved language that will be printed in textbooks beginning in 2011 and remain there for 10 years, CNN affiliate KPRC-TV in Houston reported: . ""In all fields of science, analyze, evaluate, and critique scientific explanations by using empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental observation and testing, including examining all sides of scientific evidence of those explanations so as to encourage critical thinking by the students."" Earlier, the board rejected two sections written by McLeroy on identical 8-7 votes, the Dallas Morning News said. One section required teachers to ""analyze, review, and critique scientific explanations, including hypotheses and theories, as to their strengths and weaknesses using scientific evidence and information,"" and the other required high school students to study the ""sufficiency or insufficiency"" of key principles of evolution. Opponents were pleased with the board's action on McLeroy's sections, but unsatisfied with the final result. ""The phrase has been an open door to religious indoctrination in public schools,"" Mark Finkelstein, a lawyer with the Anti-Defamation League, told KPRC, referring to the ""strengths and weaknesses"" phrase in the material voted down. ""This document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms,"" Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, told the Dallas Morning News. She predicted battles over textbooks in the coming years, a prediction McLeroy bolstered. Publishers, he said, will ""have to get their textbooks approved by us in a few years."" The size of the textbook market in Texas gives it influence nationwide, as publishers adapt their material to its standards. Darwin's theory of evolution proposes that humans evolved over millions of years from animal species -- including, most famously, early primates that also are the ancestors of modern-day apes. Such thinking, which challenged religious accounts of a deity creating humans, was considered radical, even blasphemous, when Darwin published it in 1859. Central to Darwin's thesis was his scientific explanation of life's diversity: that natural selection is enough to explain the evolution of all species. The scientific community has overwhelmingly scorned creationism and its latest incarnation, intelligent design, as a pretext for biblical explanations of how the world came to be, and asserts that there is no weakness or doubt in the scientific community about evolution. Last year, the National Academy of Sciences called for the public to be better informed about the importance of understanding and teaching evolution. The academy released a booklet titled ""Science, Evolution, and Creationism"" -- the third explanation of evolution put out since 1984 by one of the nation's leading scientific organizations. However, those who take issue with evolution believe it should be treated with healthy skepticism and argue that having high school students question a scientific theory overwhelmingly accepted by scientists teaches them critical thinking. ""This debate will impact whether students are taught to think critically and scientifically when you learn about evolution. It's important for students to learn how to think like scientists and not be forced to treat these controversial topics like a dogma,"" Casey Luskin, a policy analyst with the Discovery Institute, a group that questions the theory of evolution, said in an article in the San Antonio Express-News. Proponents of evolution say the dogma is on the other side, with the Discovery Institute and others purposely distorting and ignoring scientific evidence to reach their desired conclusion. For decades, the teaching of evolution in public schools has been a flash point in some states, with proponents of ideas such as creationism and intelligent design trying to gain a place in science classes. The issue has been before school officials, legislators and courts in Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Virginia. The controversy over the teaching of intelligent design came to a head in Pennsylvania, where the Dover School Board voted that ninth-grade students must be read a statement encouraging them to read about intelligent design. A federal judge said the board violated the Constitution in doing so because intelligent design is religious creationism in disguise and injecting it into the curriculum violates the constitutional separation of church and state. ""Academic freedom"" bills have emerged but failed in various state legislatures, the National Center for Science Education said. An ""academic freedom"" act has been adopted as law in Louisiana, and there is legislation in Florida calling for an ""academic freedom"" bill that would mandate a ""thorough presentation and critical analysis of the scientific theory of evolution."" The center says such bills are strategies by creationists to appeal to the American sense of balance, and give the false sense that there are different sides to scientific issues such as evolution. ""Two plus 2 is not 5,"" said the group's spokesman, Robert Luhn.","Texas Board of Education votes on science curriculum amendments .

"New York (CNN) -- In a scathing ruling, a federal judge has denied a request by Osama bin Laden's son-in-law to have alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed testify in his defense at trial, either by teleconference from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp or via deposition. In a motion to the court over the weekend, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith's defense team said Mohammed can provide evidence that their client had no knowledge of planned terror attacks and asked that portions of an unsworn, written statement by Mohammed be allowed before the jury even if his testimony was not. Mohammed, the admitted mastermind of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, issued a rambling defense of Abu Gaith, who is on trial in New York. Abu Gaith is accused of being al Qaeda's propagandist in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The rare statement by Mohammed was in response to questions from Abu Gaith's attorney and was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Sunday night. At a hearing on the matter Tuesday morning, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan called the defense motion ""entirely baseless"" and said nothing Mohammed may testify to is relevant to Abu Ghaith's case. ""There isn't a shred of evidence that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ever met Sulaiman Abu Ghaith at all,"" Kaplan said. Abu Ghaith was captured last year after years of being among a group of alleged al Qaeda operatives sheltered in Iran. He was arrested in Turkey and deported to Kuwait via Jordan, which helped U.S. agents capture him. In his statement, Mohammed said Abu Gaith was a ""pious man"" and among many scholars drawn to Afghanistan when the Taliban took control of the country in the mid-1990s. He said he doesn't recall meeting Abu Ghaith and that, as a scholar and preacher, Abu Ghaith wouldn't have known about military operations, in part because al Qaeda was careful to restrict access to such information. ""He did not play any military role, and to the best of my knowledge, he did not receive any military training at any of the training camps for the mujahedeen in Afghanistan,"" Mohammed said. Prosecutors had objected to Mohammed's testimony, saying the issue is causing unnecessary delays and is inconsequential because Mohammed has said he will not agree to testify. ""This is a motion for what? They have no witness, judge,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin at the hearing. Abu Ghaith's defense attorney Stanley Cohen said the defense team has worked as quickly as possible since last summer to secure Mohammed's testimony, but stalling and administrative roadblocks by the Department of Defense made their efforts futile. ""At the end of the day, the DoD was never going to let Khalid Sheikh Mohammed appear in a courtroom,"" said Cohen in court. A clearly aggravated Kaplan dismissed Cohen's claim and instead said the defense team ""sat on their hands"" as the case headed for trial. Kaplan also noted that the attorneys were offered the opportunity last month to conduct an in-person interview with Mohammed at Guantanamo Bay, but for some reason changed their minds and submitted written questions only. When Cohen rose to respond, he was told to sit back down. Cohen and co-counsel Zoe Dolan told CNN after the hearing that they abandoned the plan to interview Mohammed when they were told representatives for the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice would be present. Also Tuesday, Kaplan told Dolan she may face sanctions for improperly bringing another motion alleging the prosecution has not turned over exhibits to the defense as required. As the attorney began to respond, Kaplan adjourned the session and left the bench. The jury returns Wednesday morning for testimony by an audio expert for the defense about the authenticity of an audio recording allegedly featuring the defendant and a character witness who is traveling from Kuwait to testify.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, is accused of being al Qaeda's propagandist .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- As Bus No. 37 pulled up at the Wangfujing stop near his office, Chris Tsao watched the line of waiting passengers quickly dissipate into a familiar scene of mild chaos as they pressed their way onto the standing-room-only bus. It's a squeeze: Commuters on the subway in Beijing pack into a busy train. ""This isn't too bad -- actually much better than the subway,"" observed the 35-year-old graphic designer one recent evening as he boarded the bus for home, some 6 kilometers away but easily a 40-minute trip in the capital's choking traffic. As far as the preferred mode of public transportation goes, however, Tsao belongs to a growing number of Beijing residents who are opting for the slower bus to the supposedly far more efficient subway. The Beijing Subway system, the country's oldest, is undergoing an unprecedented expansion ahead of the Summer Olympics. Three new lines will begin whisking passengers to and fro before the Games start in August and, by 2020, the route map will comprise 19 lines and 561 kilometers of tracks, making the network one of the world's largest. Once a loyal subway rider, Tsao has given up on the train since last autumn. That was when the city authorities, in a bid to attract drivers of private cars off the road, slashed the ticket prices on the subway -- by more than half in some cases -- and introduced a flat fare of 2 Yuan (30 U.S. cents) with unlimited transfers. The result has been undesirable: Surface roads remain congested and now so are subway stations. ""Almost overnight the trains became so jam-packed that it was just mission impossible during rush hours,"" Tsao recalled. ""I always had to wait for four or five trains, and then got shoved into the train by the crowd behind me without having to lift my foot."" Other awkward moments ensued inside the sardine can-like carriages. ""As people typed on their phones right under my eyes, I was often forced to read their messages -- including a woman confessing to her husband about an affair,"" Tsao reminisced with some amusement. After a few weeks of endurance, Tsao switched to the bus for a more dependable daily ride. ""On paper the subway is a lot faster, but buses are less crowded and have dedicated lanes on many streets -- I end up spending about the same amount of time on the road,"" he explained. Tsao's sentiment echoes those of many others, prompting media coverage and online debates on the city's increasingly strained subway system whose average daily users exceed 3.5 million. Busy stations not only deploy ""door pushers"" to help commuters squeeze into the carriages during peak times but also limit the number of passengers on the platforms out of safety concerns. Amid mounting complaints about the system's glaring inadequacy, officials have reassured the public the problems are growing pains. They promise a much more enjoyable journey when improved signals system and state-of-the-art trains are in place in the coming months. Tsao has decided to stick to the bus for now, having learned about new airport-like security checks at major subways stations ahead of the Olympics. Although the mostly non-air conditioned buses offer a rather unpleasant passenger experience during Beijing's long hot summer days, Tsao unfortunately doesn't have the one fallback option most of his fellow countrymen do. ""I can't bike,"" he admitted, blaming his mountainous hometown. ""Many of us from Chongqing have never learned how to bike because it's just impractical to pedal in the hilly terrain."" Steven Jiang is a Beijing-based freelance writer and former CNN producer.","More Beijing commuters shunning overcrowded subway in favor of city's buses .

"London (CNN) -- UK newspaper and magazine publishers lost a High Court bid Wednesday to block the progress of a government-backed royal charter on press regulation. The royal charter, which has cross-party backing, was due to go before the Privy Council on Wednesday for approval after the High Court ruling. The industry groups that brought the unsuccessful legal challenge said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision and would try to overturn it on appeal. ""This is a vital constitutional issue and we will be taking our case for judicial review -- of the Privy Council's decisions on both the industry Charter and the cross-party Charter -- to the Court of Appeal,"" they said. The legal challenge was brought to the High Court by the Press Standards Board of Finance (Pressbof), which is the industry body that funds the current press watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission. It sought permission to seek a judicial review of the politician-backed royal charter on the grounds that the industry's own proposed royal charter was not properly considered and that the process was ""startlingly unfair."" The industry's draft royal charter was rejected by the Privy Council, a body made up of government ministers, earlier this year. But the High Court ruled against the legal challenge. The cross-party royal charter follows months of talks between the industry and lawmakers on how to establish a system of independent press self-regulation, following an inquiry last year into press ethics led by Lord Justice Leveson. The inquiry was set up after outrage over claims of widespread phone hacking and other abuses by elements of the UK press. A number of criminal prosecutions are being brought in relation to those claims. Critics say the government-backed royal charter risks weakening the freedom of the press by allowing political interference, while supporters argue that the newspaper industry has failed to regulate itself effectively so far. 'Proper complaints system' The Department for Culture, Media and Sport earlier welcomed the High Court ruling. ""Both the industry and the government agree self-regulation of the press is the way forward and we both agree that a Royal Charter is the best framework for that,"" it said in a statement. ""We are clear the process for considering the industry royal charter was robust and fair and the courts have agreed. We can now get on with implementing the cross-party charter. ""A royal charter will protect freedom of the press whilst offering real redress when mistakes are made. Importantly, it is the best way of resisting full statutory regulation that others have tried to impose."" Labour Party deputy leader Harriet Harman also voiced her support for the ruling. ""Now is the time for a proper complaints system which is effective and independent of press and politicians which does not infringe the freedom of the press,"" she said. ""We need a press which is robust and free, which holds those in power to account, but which does not abuse its own power by wreaking havoc on the lives of innocent people."" 'Good for journalism' Campaign group Hacked Off, which has called for tougher regulation of the press, has backed the royal charter opposed by the newspaper industry. ""The big newspaper companies like the Mail and the Murdoch press have been in denial ever since the Leveson inquiry report condemned the way they treated ordinary people and said they needed to change,"" executive director Brian Cathcart said in a statement. ""The inquiry judge has told them this. Their own readers -- the public -- have told them. Their past victims have told them. Every single party in Parliament has told them. Now the courts have thrown out their latest manoeuvre."" Cathcart said the royal charter was ""good for journalism, good for freedom of speech, and -- vitally -- good for the public."" Government interference? The Pressbof challenge was made ""in the context of a wholly unfair and irrational process leading to a recommendation and decision that has the potential profoundly to affect the nature of press regulation in this country,"" according to a statement filed with the court. The newspaper publishers argued that they were not properly consulted about the rival royal charter, which has cross-party political support. They also argued that the government-backed royal charter does not guarantee freedom of the press from political interference, since it can be amended with the agreement of a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Both versions of the royal charter envisage the establishment of a ""recognition panel"" to oversee a self-regulatory committee that would consider complaints against the press and would have the power to impose fines of up to 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) against newspapers for wrongdoing. Their differences hinge on how that panel is made up and on how changes can be made to the charter. The rejected Pressbof charter proposed that it be amended after agreement by the industry itself, while the government-backed version would be subject to a vote in Parliament. Protecting a free press . The Privy Council rejected the industry's draft charter on the grounds that under its terms, the recognition panel would not be sufficiently independent and that it would not have sufficient powers to ensure proper redress. But Pressbof argues that its version of the royal charter is more likely to meet Leveson's aim of ""a genuinely independent and effective system of self-regulation,"" free from government interference. Culture Secretary Maria Miller told lawmakers this month that the government ""must protect our free press whilst striking the right balance between independence and redress for individuals."" The independent Leveson inquiry was set up by Prime Minister David Cameron to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians.","NEW: UK newspapers to appeal after losing legal challenge to a government-backed plan .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. House on Wednesday took the opposite action on tax cuts as the Senate, rejecting a Democratic proposal championed by President Barack Obama to extend lower tax rates for middle-income Americans, and then passing a Republican plan to maintain the lower rates for everyone for a year. In separate votes that amounted to political posturing in an election year, House Republicans joined by more than a dozen Democrats passed the GOP measure by a 256-171 margin. Minutes earlier, a similar tally defeated the Democratic alternative that would maintain the lower rates for income up to $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals for a year. Wednesday's votes extended a congressional stalemate over the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 that has come to symbolize legislative inaction in Washington. Why House tax vote is really about drawing battle lines for the fall . Last week, the Senate passed the Democratic version in a sharply polarized 51-48 vote, while the Republican plan was defeated 45-54. Normally, a congressional conference committee would negotiate a compromise between the measures passed by each chamber, but the volatile tax issue has little chance of receiving further consideration before the November election. Republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose any higher taxes and argue the Democratic plan of allowing rates to increase on higher-income Americans will stunt economic growth. GOP leaders say anything short of renewing all the current tax rates amounts to a massive tax increase on small businesses whose owners report their income through personal rather than corporate returns. Democrats contend Republicans are holding hostage tax breaks for the middle class -- including 97% of small business owners -- in order to keep lower tax rates for 2% of American taxpayers earning in excess of the $250,000 threshold. Both sides agree on extending the lower rates for middle-income Americans, Democrats argue, but they say Republicans are preventing that from happening out of allegiance to a dogmatic opposition to any kind of tax increase on even the wealthiest Americans. Opinion: Why are tax hikes politically radioactive? Democrats also point to polling that shows a majority of Americans support their approach. Wednesday's votes completed each party's opening bid in what is sure to be a frenzied legislative negotiating session after the November vote. The economy is approaching a so-called ""fiscal cliff"" brought on by the looming expiration of several tax cuts as well as the approach of a series of mandatory spending cuts.

"(Mental Floss) -- They say that truth is stranger than fiction. And while we're not exactly sure when that phrase was coined, we're guessing it was after reading about these guys and gals. Charles Dickens reportedly gave Edgar Allan Poe ""the bird"" idea for famous poem. 1. Thomas Hardy . When British poet and novelist Thomas Hardy died on January 11, 1928, his literary contemporaries decided he was too important to be buried in his hometown's simple churchyard. But the good people of Dorset, where Hardy had spent nearly all of his 88 years, vehemently disagreed. So the two groups reached a grisly compromise. The author's body was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the Poet's Corner of Westminster Abbey. Hardy's heart, on the other hand, was placed inside a small casket and buried beside the grave of his first wife in a Dorset churchyard. To this day, a rumor persists that the author's heart was accidentally devoured by his housekeeper's cat, and that the heart of a pig was buried in its place. 2. Horatio Alger, Jr. Apparently, the author of more than 120 ""rags-to-riches"" books featuring hard-working, highly moral young heroes was also an admitted pederast. Before finding success as an author, Alger was a minister at a Unitarian Church in Brewster, Massachusetts, where he was accused of sexually assaulting two young boys. Alger admitted his guilt, but left town before the news hit the street. Later, he wound up in New York City, where he penned hundreds of best-selling books for and about young boys, which went on to grace the shelves of homes, schools and church libraries across America. 3. Sherwood Anderson . Best known for his collection of short stories, Winesburg, Ohio, and for mentoring such literary heavyweights as Hemingway, Faulkner and Steinbeck, Anderson had a knack for unexpected exits. One day in November 1912, while serving as president of the successful Anderson Manufacturing Co., he simply got up and walked out of his office to pursue a career in writing. Years later, he made another sudden departure, this time during the middle of a South American voyage. At his farewell cocktail party, Anderson unknowingly swallowed a toothpick hidden within an hors d'oeuvre. The author sailed on, but the toothpick didn't, penetrating his intestines and causing peritonitis. Anderson became ill aboard ship and later died in a Panama hospital. 4. Charles Dickens . A number of pets graced the Dickens household over the years, including all manner of dogs, cats and ponies. But Charles' favorite pets were his two ravens, both known as Grip. Dickens was particularly devoted to Grip I, going so far as to write the bird into his 1841 mystery novel, Barnaby Rudge. This same talkative bird reportedly was the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem, ""The Raven,"" published four years later. Upon Grip I's demise, Dickens had his beloved bird stuffed. These days, Grip can be seen at the Free Library of Philadelphia's Rare Books Department, where he stands guard over the Poe and Dickens collections. 5. Flannery O'Connor . Dickens apparently wasn't the only well-known writer who had a fetish for fowl. Flannery O'Connor, author of 32 short stories including ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"" and ""Everything That Rises Must Converge,"" developed a love for birds at a very young age. Growing up on her family's estate in Georgia, O'Connor enjoyed playing with the chickens they raised there and reportedly taught one of them to walk backward, making the chicken somewhat of a local celebrity. But O'Connor had a special fondness for peacocks, which she often used in her fiction to represent Christ. When she returned to live on the family farm as an adult, she raised an unusually large flock of peacocks, which she tended to until her death in 1964. Afterward, they were donated to various parks and monasteries around Georgia, but all were eventually killed by predators. 6. O. Henry . O. Henry (born William Sydney Porter) may have been the master of the popular short story form, but he was far less skilled when it came to money. While working as a bank teller in Houston, the fledgling author was accused of embezzling a few thousand dollars, prompting his rather sudden move to Honduras. But a few years later, when he came back to visit his dying wife, he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison. It was here that convict Porter assumed the pen name O. Henry. His incarceration offered him the time to write as well as a chance to mix with a slew of seedy characters, perfect fodder for his fiction. A model inmate, Porter was released in 1901, after serving just three years. He passed away in 1910 with 600 stories, but reportedly only 33 cents, to his name. 7. Langston Hughes . Poet, playwright, novelist, essayist and all-around literary luminary, Langston Hughes achieved fame during the Harlem Renaissance. But before that, Hughes was a struggling young writer, working menial jobs to support his burgeoning poetry habit. In 1925, while working at a restaurant in Washington D.C., Hughes tucked a few of his poems under the dinner plate of then-reigning poet Vachel Lindsay. Lindsay shared the poems during his reading that night, and in the morning, Hughes was crowned Lindsay's new discovery, the ""busboy poet."" Hughes went on to become one of America's most prolific authors. Lindsay, however, died six years later after drinking a bottle of Lysol. 8. Edith Wharton . Edith Wharton, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for her 1920 novel The Age of Innocence, is famous for her vivid stories and novels about upper-class society in the late 19th century. It was a setting she knew well, coming from a wealthy and distinguished New England family. But the high society author had a lesser-known career as a humanitarian. During World War I, Wharton traveled to the Western Front in France, both to write about the battlefields for American publications and to help the Red Cross create hostels and schools for those displaced by war. In 1916, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest civilian appointment, years before the height of her literary career. 9. Charlotte Bronte . Charlotte Bronte may have been the author of the romantic classic Jane Eyre, but she was not well served by love herself. In fact, it more or less killed her. In June of 1854, a starry-eyed Bronte married her father's curate and soon became pregnant. During her pregnancy, she fell ill, and according to her earliest biographer, Elizabeth Gaskell, she was attacked by ""sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness."" The elder Bronte sister's nausea was so overwhelming, in fact, that the author couldn't eat or even smell food without becoming violently ill. On March 31, 1855, a dehydrated, malnourished and severely exhausted Charlotte Bronte died at the age of 38. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of Commerce John Bryson stepped down Thursday, telling President Barack Obama in a letter of resignation that a recent seizure could be a distraction from doing his job. ""I have concluded that the seizure I suffered on June 9th could be a distraction from my performance as secretary and that our country would be better served by a change of leadership of the department,"" Bryson's letter said. Bryson, 68, had been on a medical leave of absence since his involvement in two auto accidents in California that his office indicated were linked to the seizure. The White House said Obama will meet with Bryson in the Oval Office later Thursday to thank him for his service as commerce secretary. A statement by Obama praised Bryson's efforts to boost U.S. exports as commerce secretary and said Bryson has agreed to serve as a member of the president's Export Council. Bryson's deputy, Rebecca Blank, will continue to serve as acting secretary, Obama's statement said. Police said Bryson was found unconscious at the wheel of his car after the two accidents this month. Commerce secretary takes medical leave following weekend accidents . Bryson was issued a citation at an area hospital where he received treatment, said Lt. Ariel Duran of the San Gabriel Police Department. Authorities must still decide whether to formally file charges. Bryson voluntarily took a breathalyzer test that detected no alcohol use, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department confirmed. According to a Commerce official, Bryson was on personal time with no security detail when the accidents occurred and was driving his own vehicle. The official, who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified, said Bryson was given medication to treat the seizure. Bryson, who was driving a Lexus, rear-ended a Buick occupied by three men that was stopped at a railroad crossing in San Gabriel, said a police statement. ""Bryson spoke with the males, then left the scene, hitting the same car again as he left,"" the statement said. The men in the Buick followed Bryson while calling 911 to report the accident, it said. Bryson drove to the neighboring city of Rosemead, where he hit a second car, according to authorities. Police then found him unconscious in his vehicle. Two of the three men in the Buick were treated for minor injuries, according to police. Obama nominated Bryson to succeed Gary Locke as commerce secretary in May 2011. Bryson's Senate confirmation was delayed by Republican opposition. It came in October, and he became the 37th secretary of commerce. A graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School, Bryson served as chairman of the California utility company Edison International from 1990 until 2008. Before that, he was a co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group that strongly endorsed Bryson's nomination last year.

"Cannes, France (CNN) -- Movie-makers in Cannes have announced they're making a thriller based on the disappearance of Malaysian flight MH370. The film, being produced by Indian company Rupesh Paul Productions, is to be entitled ""The Vanishing Act: The Untold Story of the Missing Malaysian Plane."" Paul told CNN: ""The movie is based on an investigative report by a journalist which was rejected by the media so it is definitely controversial. The movie will answer two questions: one is what went wrong with MH370 and where is MH370 on this earth?"" An eight-page pamphlet promoting the movie at Cannes' Marchee du Film (film market) says the ""The Vanishing Act tells the story of five people who seek revenge for the death of their loved ones. They hijack a plane. (sic) but things aren't as they appear. The FBI too makes an appearance and things get murkier."" Paul denied making such a film now could be considered offensive to the families of the 239 men, women and children aboard the airliner, which disappeared on March 8. ""There are a lot of coincidental similarities between the actual passengers who were travelling in that thing but I think they will not be hurt at all. Definitely not. If we're totally wrong we will be in trouble. I know it is a risk we are taking."" The publicity material goes on to claim the film ""will have an international cast with actors from film industries across the world"" including ""France, Russia, the UK and Korea.""and will be ""a movie beyond man-made boundaries"" and boasts that it will become a ""trendsetter."" The movie-makers claim they have recruited a number of leading Hollywood technicians who will bring their experience to the mid-air flight sequences. CNN has seen a trailer for the movie, comprised of stock footage of Malaysian Airlines planes cut together with scenes of love, jealousy and unrest in the cabin, accompanied by graphics charting a timeline to disaster. In what appears to be the only hint of sensitivity to the feelings of the missing passengers and their families, a single page of the promo pack is devoted to a picture of a woman writing on a wall covered with messages, under the banner ""Pray of MH370."" Paul says investors from India, China and Malaysia itself are on board and will sign contracts at the weekend. 5 most controversial film festival moments .

"(CNN) -- Believing that celebrity and success -- even attractiveness -- guarantee immunity from domestic violence is like believing famous people are magically protected from the dangers of other drivers on the road, airborne pathogens from a stranger's sneeze, or the path of a wild fire. Domestic violence knows no boundaries, affecting women â€” and some men â€” who meet every descriptor of race, age, socioeconomic or educational status, sexual orientation, demography, geography, ideology, disability or theology. Domestic violence is more common than breast cancer and left-handedness. Famous or anonymous, one in four women in this country will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Each year in the United States, 5.3 million women experience domestic violence, at an annual cost to the American economy of $5.8 billion. According to the U.N. Women's 2011-2012 annual report, ""This pervasive human rights violation affects all countries and communities."" The World Health Organization reports that 15% to 71% of women ages 15 to 49 in a multicountry study had experienced intimate partner violence. Notably, nowhere on this planet is there 0% violence against intimate partners. Nowhere on this planet is there a society immune to domestic violence. And no upscale neighborhood or celebrity-frequented restaurant is off limits. So why should the recent public altercation between TV chef Nigella Lawson and her handsome, successful husband, Charles Saatchi, surprise anyone? In light of tabloid photographs that show Saatchi holding a tearful Lawson by the neck, it should be clear that intimate partner violence is a universal scourge. Why does the myth that intimate partner violence exists only in lower socioeconomic communities persist? Saatchi has not been charged in connection with the incident and has denied his actions were abusive, calling the encounter a ""playful tiff."" Horrified observers reportedly had a different take. Certainly no one wishes the suffering of violence on anyone regardless of who they are. But this alleged incident provides a painful reminder that it is time to permanently dissolve the mythology that domestic violence only happens to low-income women. And it is time to take such an outrageous public display of apparent violence seriously. Shortly after the publication of the photos, Britain's Nick Griffin of the National Party tweeted: ""If I had the opportunity to squeeze Nigella Lawson, her throat wouldn't be my first choice."" Next, he followed up with this: ""To feminist cranks whining re my 'objectifying' Nigella, she was happy to use her curves to sell books. Her chorizo & potato soup v good btw."" That's about as funny as referring to a sleeveless tank top as a ""wife beater"" and thinking that's OK. Saatchi's downplaying of the incident as ""playful"" to the media is also no surprise. As a survivor of domestic violence myself, and an advocate and spokesperson for nonviolence for the past 18 years, I know that sentiment is on par with the common rationalizations for domestic violence I have heard: ""She asked for it. She likes it. She made me mad. She provoked me. It was her fault."" Saatchi's comment does not match in scope the most outrageous response I once heard from a police officer about a man who shot his wife: ""She ran in front of the bullet."" But Saatchi's flippant dismissal matches our universal misunderstanding that domestic violence is not about us. It is always about other people somewhere else. Unfortunately, the sorority of successful and powerful women who have reportedly been victims of domestic violence includes Halle Berry, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Pamela Anderson,  Mariah Carey, Tina Turner, Meredith Baxter and Rihanna. Sometimes a batterer is the most charismatic man in the room; they are lawyers, doctors, politicians, business titans, actors, celebrities, singers and professional athletes. I understand; domestic violence was not something I ever thought would happen to me. I married a man I knew my whole life; he was smart, handsome, kind and ambitious. We dated for three years with no hint of violence. That changed four months into our marriage. At the time, I thought I was powerful and successful enough to change him; I was not. We have been divorced 18 years. What I learned is a partner's behavior is not something you can control, no matter how educated you are, no matter how idyllic your life was growing up, no matter how much you dreamed your life would go well. And no matter if you are a vibrant, internationally successful best-selling author and chef. Though she and her children have moved out of their family home, Lawson has yet to publicly comment on the situation. We don't know whether she views herself as a victim of domestic violence, but those photographs tell a story we need to keep repeating. So many of us who believe the myths of domestic violence don't tell because we are ashamed to tell. We believe as successful women we are immune, that it happens to others. Millions of women around the globe in all manner of circumstances think they cannot say the truth about the violence in their lives because they will die of embarrassment. But we all need to remember, in the most severe cases, it is never embarrassment that kills them.","Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson was photographed with her husband's hands at her throat .

"(CNN) -- The family of a 2-year-old boy who was mauled to death after falling into an exhibit of African painted dogs has reached a settlement in a lawsuit against the Pittsburgh Zoo. ""Details of the settlement will remain confidential,"" attorneys for the boy's parents said in a joint statement released Monday with the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium. Maddox Derkosh slipped over a railing, bounced into a safety net, bounced again, and tumbled into the exhibit in November 2012. ""The Derkosh family and the Zoo request that the privacy of all parties involved be respected,"" the statement said. At the time, zoo officials said there was little anyone could do after the boy fell. ""There were 11 dogs in the exhibit,"" zoo President Barbara Baker, a veterinarian, said after the tragic death. Although there were zoo employees within feet of the exhibit, and others rushed to the scene, it was too late -- it was clear the child was dead, Baker said. ""There was no reason to send our staff into harm's way,"" she said. The medical examiner found that the little boy did not die from the fall, Baker said. Railings throughout the zoo are designed to make it difficult to place children on them, Baker said. They're at a 45-degree angle so that if a child is placed on one and falls, he or she would hopefully fall backward, away from the animal enclosure, she said. Pittsburgh police said the child was with his 34-year-old mother when he fell from the top of a platform railing and ""was immediately attacked by eleven dogs inside the pen."" Zoo spokeswoman Tracy Gray said they had no comment beyond the brief joint statement. The parents' attorney, Robert Mongeluzzi, also declined further comment. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Parents of 2-year-old boy reach settlement with Pittsburgh Zoo after child's death .

"(CNN) -- As ""True Blood"" has developed over the past five seasons, the series has expanded from the story of the people -- and vampires -- living in the small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, to a sprawling, multinarrative saga about how supernatural beings can exist in the modern world. Season six premieres on June 16 with the show's first episodes since the departure of creator and showrunner Alan Ball. New showrunner Brian Buckner will immediately bring fans back into the action from season five's tumultuous finale and, eventually, back to where the series all began. ""There's a real energy and excitement, and I think that came this year from the top down,"" said Joe Manganiello, who stars as werewolf Alcide. ""The show got really big in its scope during seasons three, four and five, and it became more about the world and these creatures with so many plot lines. In season six, there's a concerted effort to make this show return to what made it great in season one and two. It was about these people who lived in a town. It was about the town versus the rest of the world. I think (the show) really returns to that at the end of this season. The way that it's pulled is really smart, and I think it's going to be really fun for the audience."" When last season came to a close, the governing Vampire Authority was under attack, the TruBlood factories had been destroyed, and vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer) had transformed into all-powerful god figure by drinking the blood of Lilith. Meanwhile, Alcide had become the werewolves' packmaster, and Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) was being pursued by an ancient and mysterious vampire named Warlow. The season's premiere episode, ""Who Are You, Really?"" quickly draws the action forward to reveal just how much is at stake for the vampires, the humans and everyone in between. ""The tone is pretty dark this season,"" said Rutina Wesley, whose character, Tara, became a vampire last season and left viewers with a glimpse of a possible relationship between her and her maker, Pam (Kristin Bauer van Straten), in the finale. ""I think the ads that they're putting out right now say it best: No one is safe this season. There's definitely a war going on. The vampires have to fight that war, (and) the humans have to fight that war -- so it's like survival of the fittest."" Various new characters emerge in the picture as it becomes clear that a conflict is brewing against the vampires -- and possibly the werewolves and shape-shifters as well. Louisiana Gov. Truman Burrell, played by new cast member Arliss Howard, leads the crusade against the supernatural while Nicole, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, appears as a pro-vampire activist. Meanwhile, Sookie's faerie grandfather Niall (Rutger Hauer) materializes to help his granddaughter seek out Warlow. ""We always have these amazing new characters played by unbelievable actors,"" van Straten said. ""We have guest stars like Rutger Hauer. That, for us, is really lovely. I just remember being in scenes with Denis O'Hare (in past seasons) and thinking, 'This must be what it's like to play tennis with (Roger) Federer.' You just rise to the occasion. You just want to bring your best game when you're with someone like Rutger Hauer."" ""How Warlow is going to be introduced is rather amazing,"" Wesley added. ""You're not gonna see it coming, I think. It takes a minute to figure out who Warlow is, because he is introduced, but he's not introduced as Warlow. The guy who's playing him is an amazing actor, so it's going to be really nice."" On the relationship front, Sookie has seemingly exhausted her obsession with vampires Bill and Eric Northman (Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd) and will meet a new love interest played by Rob Kazinsky, who may also be supernatural. Alcide, who Manganiello says is learning that the benefits of being packmaster include his choice of women, may not totally be out of the picture, though. ""It was about to go down, and she threw up on his shoes, so I think there's a lot left on the table still,"" Manganiello said of Sookie's relationship with his character. ""They haven't even gone there yet, come on! I think the door is definitely still open."" For van Straten, the possibility of a romance between Pam and Tara is compelling, mostly because the two characters have hated each other over the course of the past few seasons. Although the actress won't confirm whether the two vampires will end up in a relationship, van Straten is interested in how these two characters interact on the show. ""What's fascinating to me is that after six years, it starts to seem normal and make sense,"" van Straten said. ""They're both very strong women who have been through some very hard times, and they're not victims, they're survivors. So we have this interesting chemistry. I just started wondering as the season was being filmed last year when it would happen."" But the biggest mystery awaiting fans of the series this season is the question ""Who will die?"" Rumors that season six will feature the death of a major character have flown for months, leading to extensive online speculation and a looming sense of dread. According to the actors, there is truth to the rumors. ""That's true,"" Manganiello confirmed. ""But I'm not going to say who. I can say that that's true, but that's about it."" On a less morbid note, the show is still replete with nudity and sex scenes, some involving several characters. Manganiello, who regularly bares all for the series and appeared as a stripper in last year's ""Magic Mike,"" just sees it as part of job after several seasons. ""I'm as naked as I ever am (this season),"" Manganiello admitted. ""There's always all these questions before your first nude scene, but even my first nude scene on 'True Blood' wasn't my first nude scene ever. I did a play during college in an off-Broadway theater where I was full-frontal, and I did another show in college where I emerged onstage naked as well, so I think once you get over it in front of a crowd of live, paying customers or your classmates, it's like, whatever. It's not that big of a deal. I think it's probably a lot of the motivation behind why I work out so hard. It's at least a part of it!""","""True Blood"" returns for its sixth season on June 16 .

"(CNN) -- Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel looks set to join Ferrari after announcing his shock exit from Red Bull on Saturday. The German, who has spent the past six seasons with Red Bull, is being hotly tipped to join the Italian racing marque from the start of 2015. Vettel broke the news of his departure in Suzuka ahead of Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix, but has so far remained tight-lipped on his plans. But F1 racing legend Niki Lauda believes all roads now point to Maranello for the German. ""My logic tells me that Sebastian will now go to Ferrari,"" Lauda said, AFP reported. ""Why? Because Fernando Alonso has fallen out of favor there. There is new management (at Ferrari), they need some new motivation in the team and, of course, Sebastian is the world champion, German and in the same style as (Michael) Schumacher,"" added Lauda, who won two of his three F1 world titles with Ferrari. Alonso wouldn't be drawn on the issue when interviewed by journalists following Saturday's qualifying session saying his priority was to help Ferrari. Last month, he said there was ""no problem"" with him seeing out the remaining two years of his contract with the Italian team. But Lauda thinks otherwise and says that the Prancing Horse would be well served by ""some German thoroughness"" that Vettel could bring. Ferrari has yet to comment on the status of either driver while Vettel himself says an announcement on his future can be expected ""very soon."" Vettel's news shocked the F1 paddock and will bring to an end a long relationship with the UK-based team, first as a junior racer then Toro Rosso before moving to Red Bull in 2009. In his second season Vettel clinched the first of his four world titles but the 27-year-old has struggled this year and currently lies fifth in the standings and trailing his new teammate Daniel Ricciardo. The Australian is third in the drivers championship, taking the fight to the Mercedes duo of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg who have dominated this year. It was with this backdrop that Vettel made his move. ""After 15 very enjoyable and successful years with Red Bull, I have decided to leave Red Bull at the end of this year,"" Vettel said in a statement. ""Of course it is a big step and hard to make such a decision. The chance to drive in F1, the first win with Scuderia Toro Rosso, the four Championship wins with Infiniti Red Bull Racing and many other great memories have bound Red Bull and myself together into a kind of family. No one can take these times away from us."" Musical chairs . No sooner had Vettel announced his impending departure was Red Bull filling the empty cockpit with Daniil Kvyat graduating from the Toro Rosso team after just a single season in F1. ""It's been our philosophy for several years now to back youth and grow our own talent and that's what we did with Sebastian Vettel,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. ""Daniil's an exciting talent and prospect and it's an exciting new dawn for Infiniti Red Bull Racing."" Horner noted that it had been ""one hell of a journey"" with Vettel referencing both his and the team's achievements which amount to four constructors' titles and 38 grand prix victories. ""He joined us as a young man and now he's matured and he's decided it's time to move on, it's his decision, we're not going to hold him back and it's an exciting time for us,"" Horner added. ""I think he reached a stage in his career where he fancied a new challenge, so that's his prerogative and like in any relationship, if someone's heart is not in it, then it's time to move on."" If Vettel does replace Alonso at Ferrari then the Spaniard could be on his way back to McLaren. Alonso spent one season with the UK-based team in 2007 before moving on Renault then to Ferrari in 2010. Should he return then either Jenson Button or Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen would have to make way with the smart money on the 34-year-old Briton who is out of contract come the end of the season. Mercedes lockout front row . Meanwhile out on the track, Nico Rosberg pipped teammate Lewis Hamilton to pole in qualifying for Sunday's race at Suzuka. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas was third quickest with his teammate Felipe Massa directly behind him in fourth. Vettel scraped into the top ten and will start in ninth place while teammate Ricciardo is three places ahead in sixth with Fernando Alonso steering his Ferrari to fifth. Hamilton currently leads Rosberg by three points in the drivers' championship with five races remaining.

"(Mashable) -- Ford is installing a feature in its new vehicles -- and many of its older ones -- that can read text messages out loud. The feature, which is intended to reduce texting while driving, is part of Ford's voice-activated technology, Sync, and is already installed on all model 2012 Ford vehicles with the exception of the Ranger. Using a Bluetooth connection, it syncs with phones and alerts users when they receive text messages, reads them out loud and allows users to respond with a selection of standard pre-written messages without taking their hands off the wheel. On Tuesday, it will be made available as an upgrade to Sync vehicles that are model 2010 or later. In order to install the capability, owners can download the upgrade from the Ford Sync site onto a USB drive along with print-out instructions. Older Ford vehicles that have Sync will soon be able to make the update as well, says supervisor of Sync product development Mark Porter. We shouldn't need data to convince us that texting and driving at the same time is a bad idea. But we have tons of it. A 2009 study from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that texting while driving increased the risk of a truck getting into an accident by more than 23 times. A 2007 Clemson University study found that text messaging and iPods caused drivers to leave their lane 10% more often during driving simulations. And if you have doubts that texting is detrimental to driving performance, you can prove it to yourself with an interactive game that The New York Times has created to make the point. So in an age when most car companies have a Bluetooth integration features, why isn't text-to-voice already a standard option? Several apps such as DriveSafe.ly and SMS Replier have created popular solutions, but only a few vehicle manufacturers such as Ford and BMW have integrated the feature into vehicles themselves. One factor in the slow adoption is that not many phones integrate with text-to-speech features like Ford's. So far BlackBerry phones are the most notable devices compatible with the technology required. Some Android phones also support the technology. iPhones do not. Porter says that he thinks more phone and vehicle manufacturers will soon start to add it. ""It's very similar to a couple of years ago when Bluetooth devices were just coming out and had a hands-free profile [for integrating with vehicles] and few phones supported it,"" he says. ""Now it's almost standard."" See the original article on Mashable.com . © 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","Feature is part of voice-activated technology, Sync, installed on 2012 models .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. intelligence community has found no evidence to suggest North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is dead, a senior U.S. official said Friday following posts on China's version of Twitter that claimed Kim had been assassinated while in Beijing. U.S. intelligence officials have been looking into such rumors for more than a week, according to the official, who has direct knowledge of the latest U.S. analysis. ""With that society you can never be 100% sure, but we just don't see any evidence of it,"" the official told CNN. ""It's a closed society, but at this point we do not believe it's true."" The preliminary analysis of the rumor suggests it is part of a ""calculated effort to disrupt the economy of South Korea at a fragile time by suggesting things are going haywire up north,"" the official said. Meanwhile, the official added, ""there is no evidence of movement of North Korean forces or activity that you would associate with the turmoil of a calculated assassination."" Kim, who is believed to be in his late 20s, assumed the title of ""supreme leader"" after his father Kim Jong Il's death in December at the age of 69. Kim Jong Il had ruled the reclusive nation since 1994. The official pointed out that even during the recent peaceful transition of power, there were signs of troops being put on a higher state of alert. Neither Chinese state media nor South Korea's Yonhap news agency addressed the rumor in their reporting.","Posts on China's version of Twitter claim Kim Jong Un was assassinated .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The United Nations' anti-drugs chief has denounced celebrities such as pop star Amy Winehouse and supermodel Kate Moss, saying that their alleged drug use was helping devastate West Africa. Amy Winehouse's battles with her addiction are well-documented. ""Coke-snorting fashionistas are not only damaging their noses and brains -- they are contributing to state failure on the other side of the world,"" wrote Antonio Maria Costa, the executive director of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime. The comments, published in an opinion piece in the British newspaper The Observer, was the second time in two weeks that the United Nations has criticized celebrity drug use. A report last week by the International Narcotics Control Board said that drug laws should not be disproportionately applied. And letting celebrities get away with drug use creates a perception among youth that those offenders are treated leniently. Read about the earlier warning from the United Nations drug control agency . Costa, in his piece, said the cocaine used in Europe passes through impoverished countries in west Africa where governments haven't been able to mount an effective fight against the drug traders. ""In the 19th century, Europe's hunger for slaves devastated west Africa,"" he said. ""Two hundred years later, its growing appetite for cocaine could do the same."" The drug trade, Costa said, has corrupted the governments of some countries, and created addicts in a continent where treatment facilities are rare. ""Amy Winehouse might adopt a defiant pose and slur her way through 'Rehab' (her Grammy Award-winning hit) but does she realize the message she sends to others who are vulnerable to addiction and who cannot afford expensive treatment?"" he said. Winehouse's battles with her addiction are well-documented. The singer -- whose song ""Rehab"" describes her reluctance to enter a rehabilitation center -- checked herself into one on January 24 after the leak of a home video that showed her smoking something in a glass pipe. What was in the pipe was unknown. Scotland Yard has said it is looking into the video. Winehouse scooped up five statues at the Grammy Awards last month, including the best record and song of the year for ""Rehab."" Winehouse's spokesman, Chris Goodman, called Costa a ""ludicrous man."" ""Amy has never given a quote about drugs or flaunted it in any way,"" Goodman told the newspaper. ""She's had some problems and is trying to get better. The U.N. should get its own house in order."" Costa also took model Kate Moss to task, contrasting her alleged actions to those of singers Bob Geldof and Bono who have campaigned against poverty in Africa. Bob Geldof is best known for organizing a series of benefit concerts, including Live Aid. Bono, the frontman for U2, has taken on a campaign to get Western nations to write off the debt they are owed by some African countries. ""For every rebel with a cause, there are 10 others without a clue,"" Costa wrote. ""While some well-meaning pop idols and film stars might rage against suffering in Africa, their work is being undermined by the drug habits of careless peer such as Kate Moss."" Three years ago, London's Daily Mirror newspaper printed photos it said showed the Moss using cocaine. She later issued a statement where she apologized to ""all the people I have let down"" and said she took ""full responsibility"" for her actions.

"(CNN) -- The semi-automatic rifle used in the Colorado theater killings jammed during the rampage, apparently because of a problem with the 100-shot magazine feeding it, a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation said Sunday. The military-style AR-15 had a separately purchased drum magazine, which can have trouble feeding bullets into the firing chamber if the gun is fired rapidly, the source told CNN. ""These after-market extended magazines have a tendency to jam,"" the source said. Obama flies to Colorado . One of the survivors of the early Friday assault, Josh Nowlan, said Saturday that he would not have been alive if the suspect's gun had not jammed. Investigators say the rifle was one of three guns used by Colorado massacre suspect James Holmes in the early Friday killings, along with a shotgun and a .40-caliber pistol. The handgun also had an extended magazine that held 40 rounds, the source said. Suspect spooked gun range manager . Police say Holmes opened fire during a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" In addition to turning guns on the crowd, witnesses say they saw the attacker throw two canisters -- possibly containing tear gas -- before opening fire. He also rigged his suburban Denver apartment with a wide array of explosives and flammable materials, forcing investigators to evacuate nearby residents and pick gingerly through his home in a two-day effort to remove all the hazards. Authorities have since recovered a Batman poster, a Batman mask and a computer from the apartment, the source said. Victims remembered with poignant stories . Investigators are talking to victims to try to determine in what order the guns were fired, the source said. The suspect may have begun with the shotgun, which can be ""devastating when fired at close range,"" according to the source. They believe the next weapon fired may have been the high-capacity assault rifle, with Holmes turning to the Glock semi-automatic pistol to ""re-engage his targets,"" according to the source. That squares with what some witnesses have told CNN -- that the gunman began to open fire with a shotgun, then turned to other weapons. The source said the extensive body armor Holmes had on when he was arrested gives ""no doubt he intended to do battle with law enforcement,"" and not people watching a movie, according to the source. But he was arrested unarmed while going back out to his car, possibly to retrieve another gun, the source said. CNN's Ross Levitt and Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","Witnesses had said one of the suspect's guns appeared to jam during the rampage .

"(CNN) -- The first images are emerging of an adult Jaycee Dugard, the woman who was kidnapped when she was 11 and allegedly held captive for 18 years by a couple in an elaborate compound hidden in the backyard. Jaycee Dugard, shown here in 1991, breaks her silence in the new issue of People magazine. Dugard is featured on the cover of the new issue of People magazine, smiling brightly in the photo, her face framed by long brown hair. ""I'm so happy to be back with my family,"" Dugard told the magazine. She lives in seclusion with her mother Terry Probyn and her two daughters, who police say were fathered by her captor Phillip Garrido. ""They live a surprisingly normal life, considering the circumstances,"" said Terry Probyn's stepmother, Joan Curry, according to the magazine. Read the story on People.com . Dugard spends her time riding horses and cooking and is considering collaborating on a book, People reported.  Watch a senior editor with People magazine explain why the photos are appearing now » . Garrido and his wife are accused of abducting Dugard in 1991 from a bus stop near her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, and keeping her in the compound behind their home in Antioch, California. They were arrested in August and have been charged with a combined 29 felony counts in connection with the kidnapping and rape of Dugard. Both Garridos pleaded not guilty to the charges. Last month, an attorney for Dugard's family said it has been a difficult transition for her and her two daughters, who are now 11 and 15, given her captivity spanned more than half her life and was the only world she knew for so long. ""But there is no question that she knows that terrible and wrong things were done to her and that those people must be held accountable,"" McGregor Scott said. Dugard will testify against the Garridos, he said. Scott acknowledged Dugard would have to relive the ""trauma"" in court by sharing the ""very, very sordid tale.""","Jaycee Dugard is featured on the cover of the new issue of People magazine .

"(CNN) -- The Olympic Games have always featured an awkward mix of high ideals and crass, even brutal, political calculation. The Games have provided countless moments of inspiration, not only about personal achievement but, more importantly, about breaking down the barriers that push apart countries and individuals. The Olympics, however, have also reminded us how far human beings can stray from those ideals. The most chilling, frightening and heartbreaking moment at any Olympics came 40 years ago, at the 1972 Munich Olympics, when nearly a dozen Israeli athletes were taken hostage and killed in what was a terrorist attack by any definition of the term. In addition to the athletes and trainers, a German policeman and five Palestinian kidnappers died that September day. Now, that tragedy has become the source of more disheartening behavior, this time by officials of the International Olympic Committee, who adamantly refuse to mark the anniversary of that dark day with a simple moment of silence. The Munich Massacre was an open assault on the most fundamental principles the Olympics purport to embrace: ""the harmonious development of humankind ... a peaceful society [and] the preservation of human dignity."" The attack was carried out by members of the Palestinian group Black September, and their targets were obviously the Israelis. But honoring the victims should have nothing to do with Israel. In a letter to IOC President Jacques Rogge, Canada's Ministers of Foreign Affairs John Baird and Sports Minister Bal Gosal explained it best when they wrote, ""The terrorist attack targeted not only Israel, but the spirit and goals of the Olympic movement ... it should be marked publicly as part of the official ceremony. ..."" For more than three decades, the families of those killed in the attack have tried to have the Olympics honor their loved ones during the opening ceremonies. Incredibly, the IOC has steadfastly refused that very simple request. Olympic officials claim -- quite falsely -- that they would never mix politics with the games. But that is clearly not the real reason. The real reason is cowardice. Politics have always been part of the games, and very deliberately. In 1908, Finland was banned from displaying its own flag, for fear of offending Russia. The losers of both WW I and WWII were kept out of the games. We know that Hitler used the 1936 Olympics to promote his ideas of Aryan superiority, and we know the United States and the Soviet Union boycotted the games for political reasons. In 2008, the IOC disgracefully agreed to let China block access to Internet sites in the Beijing games. Examples of politicization of the Olympics abound. But now, somehow the murder of Israelis has become unmentionable, under the flimsy excuse that it would inject politics into the pristine Olympics. The real reason is simple: Olympic officials are afraid to upset countries with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian sentiment. That is misguided and shameful. Standing against the slaying of Olympic athletes has nothing to do with the politics of the Middle East. Olympic officials have admitted they are afraid to trigger a walkout of Arab countries. This is worse than giving in to blackmail. It is particularly egregious behavior since it comes from those claiming to stand for high humanistic ideals. Ironically, an Israeli member of the IOC revealed the concern when he said he, too, opposed the moment of silence, saying that ""it could cause some countries to boycott the games."" This year, the campaign to honor the victims has mustered more support than ever, with several countries and tens of thousands of people around the world joining in the effort. The energy for the campaign originated with Ankie Spitzer, whose husband, Andrei, was the fencing coach of the Israeli Olympic delegation in 1972. He left home with nothing but excitement to participate in the international celebration. He returned home in a coffin. Spitzer, who said, ""Hatred and revenge are not a part of me,"" insisted she fervently believes in the Olympic ideal. In a heartfelt video she requested support for what has become her life's mission. Already more than 90,000 people have signed the petition. But the IOC refuses to listen. Spitzer's daughter, Anouk, who was just 2 months old when her father was killed in Munich, tried to have the moment marked at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. But IOC's director general Francois Carrard declared at the start of the games that the IOC does not ""organize events that commemorate dramas that are long gone."" Anouk said of Munich 1972: ""We just want one word from the IOC that this wasn't just a regular Olympics, that our fathers were killed there."" Her request, like all the others, was denied. The ongoing petition for a moment of silence clearly states that this should not be a political moment. Spitzer and her supporters said all they want is silence. ""Silence is a fitting tribute for athletes who lost their lives on the Olympic stage. Silence contains no statements, assumptions or beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret."" They want recognition that what occurred took place ""within the Olympic family,"" a sharing of their sorrow that will help ensure this never happens again. But the IOC apparently sees this as a purely Israeli problem. Rogge has attended memorial ceremonies, but usually they are organized by the Israeli government. That's not enough. Rogge has been hearing from all corners of the world. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle supports the moment of silence. The parliaments of Canada and Australia voted unanimously to ask the IOC to agree to the request. Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillard wrote to Rogge, officially asking for the moment of silence. Flemish Sport Minister Philippe Muyters also backs a moment of silence, saying, ""One does not need to take a stand on the Israeli-Palestinian question to find the events of September 1972 heinous."" In Italy, 125 MPs also signed a letter to the IOC in support of the moment of silence. The IOC still refuses. With the growing pressure, the chairman of the London 2012 Organizing Committee, Sebastian Coe, has reportedly said he will hold a personal memorial for the Israeli athletes. Nobody knows exactly what that means. Perhaps the London committee will give the families of the Israeli victims the recognition they want for their loved ones. Even if they do, that will not remove the stain of cowardice now on display at the International Olympic Committee, which remains visibly splashed across those Olympic ideals they hypocritically claim to promote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Most chilling moment at an Olympics occurred in the 1972 Munich Games .

"London (CNN) -- A golden cape woven from the silk of 1.2 million Golden Orb spiders has gone on display at London's Victoria and Albert Museum. The richly-embroidered garment -- its bright yellow hue is the natural color of the spider silk -- is the result of a seven-year project on the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar. Using long poles, a team of 80 people worked to collect the spiders from their webs each day and harvest their silk before returning them to the wild. The project was the brainchild of American fashion designer Nicholas Godley and British art historian and textile expert Simon Peers, who have both lived in Madagascar for many years. ""The idea of using spider silk to create garments goes back 300 years,"" Godley told CNN. ""The last significant attempt to succeed was at the turn of the century, when a French Jesuit priest based in Madagascar, Jacob Paul Camboue, experimented with 'milking' spiders for their silk."" Peers had long been intrigued by the idea, and on a visit to his office, Godley's imagination was sparked when he spotted an unusual-looking tool which Peers explained was for collecting silk from spiders. ""The idea never died, we kept revisiting it over the years, and eventually I shut my handbag factory so we could build a proper 'spidery' and experiment with harnessing spiders and harvesting their silk. We found that it worked. ""We were amazed -- you stand there watching it happen and you start to question your sanity. Is this really happening, or have I lost my bananas? ""We had 24 spiders harnessed up, the spindle was going, and silk was coming out. That was our eureka moment. We were over the moon, but it was just the beginning."" Scaling the project up proved a huge challenge -- only female Golden Orb spiders make silk. Hundreds of thousands of them were needed, and their cannibalistic nature meant the creatures had to be separated to prevent them from eating their neighbors. Godley admits that the properties of spider silk -- and the practicalities and costs involved -- mean that industrial-scale production for use in textiles is unlikely ever to succeed. ""From a fashion perspective, it's impractical,"" he told CNN. ""It's a natural fiber, and it shrinks, so you can't wash or dry clean it, and obviously it is hugely expensive to produce, so how would you begin to price it?"" Instead, they simply wanted to prove that it could be done, and to create two items which could help revive traditional Malagasy weaving techniques and embroidery skills, and to showcase the talents of people working on the island. The four-meter-long brocade scarf, which was first shown at New York's Natural History Museum in 2009, was created using old Malagasy patterns, but as Godley explained, the inspiration for the cape, which made its debut at London's V&A Museum today, came from the spiders themselves. ""After we finished the scarf, we wondered what to make next, and I really liked the idea of a cape, because of the fact that spiders cocoon their prey, wrapping them up, and I was intrigued by the thought of being cocooned in spider silk."" The cape is covered in images of spiders, plants and flowers, which took 6,000 hours to embroider, and those lucky enough to get up close have discovered that it is virtually weightless. ""We do a party trick where we get people to close their eyes and we put the tassels from the cape in one of their hands and ask them to guess which hand it is in. Half of them have no clue, and the other half get it wrong -- only a few guess, but only because of the warmth. ""The cape itself is like an invisibility cloak, you almost wouldn't know you were wearing it, and it has this mystical, ephemeral quality, just like a spider's web, but also a permanence. ""A spiderweb is here today and gone tomorrow, but we have found a way to harness that and turn it into something lasting."" But despite working so closely with them for so many years, Godley admits he is still afraid of spiders. ""I am fascinated by them, but still frightened of them: Spiders are poisonous, and they bite people,"" he said. ""I am slowly trying to overcome it, but it hasn't stopped."" The Golden Spider Silk exhibition at London's V&A Museum opens on January 25, and runs until June 5.","Cape and scarf made of spider silk on display at London's V&A Museum .

"HANCOCK, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Imagine climbing 276 steps to change a light bulb. That's all in a day's work for Rian Harford. The Zephyr wind turbine towers over Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort in Massachusetts. He's a mountain operations mechanic at Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort. And that light bulb isn't just a regular light bulb. It belongs inside an air-traffic warning light that sits 253 feet high upon a wind turbine. Jiminy Peak, in Hancock, Massachusetts, touts itself as the first ski resort in North America to feature such a structure. The idea to build the turbine came to company president and CEO Brian Fairbank after years of struggling with the astronomical cost of making snow. ""Somebody suggested we take advantage of the wind. You use the energy the most in the winter,"" Fairbank said. ""That's when the wind blows the most."" But such a simple concept wasn't so easy to execute. It took more than three years to take the idea from conception to fruition.  Watch what it's like on top of the giant turbine » . Before even placing an order for a turbine, the resort had to study everything from Federal Aviation Administration regulations to the structure's effect on airplanes, birds and endangered species. Once everything fell into place, Jiminy Peak was tasked to get 500 tons of parts and equipment up the mountain, via a two-mile-long gravel road. ""Once we got everything to the top of mountain, putting it together only took a couple days, but getting it up there was the biggest challenge,"" Fairbank said. In fall 2007, the $4 million project was complete. The turbine is nicknamed Zephyr, after the Greek god of the west wind. And Zephyr isn't afraid to make its presence known. The tower is more than 250 feet tall. The hub adds 10 feet, and the blades extend an additional 123 feet, creating a 386-foot green machine. Zephyr works its magic to produce about a third of Jiminy Peak's electric needs, shaving $450,000 a year from the resort's energy bill. To put that in perspective, the energy from the turbine is enough to power more than 600 homes. And Zephyr's power doesn't stop there. It has also drawn the interest of many visitors. Louise Pinho did her homework to find out how effective the wind turbine really is. ""When you read about what it's able to do for the resort, that it can take up to 33 percent off of their bills, then you realize that there is more of a need for this,"" Pinho said. ""With what's going on right now, we have to have some alternatives to our energy sources that we have available to us."" But Pinho isn't blind to Zephyr's visual and environmental drawbacks. Studies show that wind turbines destroy the habitat that many animals live in. Bats, which play a large role in consuming insects and pests, are an example of a species that's most affected. According to Thomas Kunz, a biology professor at Boston University, these bats aren't necessarily being struck by the blades of a wind turbine. Their bodies are affected by a low-pressure system caused when the blades move through the air. ""They die from hemorrhaging,"" Kunz says. In areas close to wind turbines, ""80 percent of the bats that we know about today are killed in that fashion."" Kunz says that specifically, migrating bats seem to be more affected, mainly during their fall migration, which lasts from late summer to early autumn. At Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort, the turbine produces electricity year round, but more than 60 percent of its output takes place in the winter months. Regardless, Fairbank is no stranger to negative feedback. Some people in the community didn't want the turbine to obstruct their view of the mountains. But he says that only a small part of the community complains. In fact, some neighbors reap Zephyr's benefit. In the summer, when the resort's demands are lower, Zephyr's electricity trickles downhill to power local homes and businesses. ""So all those communities become green when we're not using the power,"" Fairbank said. And when it comes to being green, this Massachusetts resort isn't new to the game. Since 1985, the company has implemented various environmentally friendly practices. From recycling motor oil to heat lodges to installing waterless urinals, Fairbank says, the business is always looking for ways to conserve. And that may be paying off. In a time when many businesses are closing their doors, Fairbank said, ""we're 12 percent ahead of our best year ever.""","Jiminy Peak bills itself as first North American ski resort with wind turbine .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican authorities moved Saturday to tighten their communication about Friday's shooting of two U.S. Embassy personnel by federal police as the Americans drove in their SUV south of the capital with a Mexican Navy captain. Federal police spokesman Ramon Salinas told CNN that he has been asked not to comment or release any new information about the investigation. He said all information would come from Los Pinos, the official residence of President Felipe Calderon. But the president's office did not respond to a request for comment. The incident occurred at 8 a.m. Friday, when the two embassy employees and the Mexican were en route through the mountainous area to a navy facility in the municipality of Xalatlaco, according to a statement issued Friday by the Mexican Navy, which gave the following account: . The black SUV bearing a diplomatic license plate had just left the main highway that connects Mexico City with Cuernavaca and were driving on a dirt road that connects the small towns of Tres Marias and Huitzilac when a vehicle approached. When the occupants brandished firearms, the driver of the diplomatic vehicle tried to evade them and return to the main highway. At that point, the occupants sprayed bullets into the black SUV with diplomatic plates. Moments later, another three vehicles joined the chase and fired shots at the embassy vehicle. The Mexican in the SUV called for help from the Mexican Navy personnel in nearby El Capulin who arrived after the shooting had ended and cordoned off the area. Federal police, who were in the area working on a criminal investigation, participated in these acts, the statement said, but did not specify which vehicle or vehicles they were in. Both embassy employees were taken -- under federal police guard -- to a hospital. Photographs of the SUV showed the embassy vehicle pockmarked with more than a dozen holes and at least three of its tires flat. The federal police officers involved were being questioned by authorities to establish what happened. In a statement issued late Friday, the U.S. Embassy described the Mexican as a Navy captain and said the three individuals were en route to a training facility when they were ambushed. ""The vehicle attempted to escape, was pursued and sustained heavy damage,"" the statement said. ""They called for assistance from the Mexican armed forces, who responded. The two U.S. wounded personnel were taken from the scene, given medical treatment and are in stable condition. The Mexican Navy captain sustained no serious injuries."" The Mexican government said those members of the federal police who fired on the vehicle have been detained, the U.S. Embassy statement said. It added that the Mexican government ""has stated it will conduct a full and thorough investigation of this incident."" Also Friday, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, ""We are working with Mexican authorities to investigate an incident this morning in which two employees of our embassy in Mexico City came under attack by unknown assailants. They are receiving appropriate medical care and are in stable condition. We have no further information to share at this time."" At Drug Enforcement Administration headquarters in Washington, a spokeswoman said the agency was not involved in the case. The long-term impact of the shooting will depend on how aggressively the Mexican government pursues the investigation, said Sylvia Longmire, a drug war cartel analyst and author of ""Cartel: the Coming Invasion of Mexico's Drug Wars."" ""I'm somewhat skeptical that anyone will be brought to justice in this attack,"" she told CNN Saturday. ""Remember, nobody knows who shot the Americans. They're still going to have to do ballistic reports."" Though federal police have a reputation for being among the least corrupt of Mexico's security forces, ""I'm concerned that there is a potential for this to get swept under the rug,"" she said. CNN's Tom Watkins, Nick Valencia, Jill Dougherty, Rafael Romo and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","A Federal Police spokesman says he's been asked not to comment .

"(CNN) -- The emergence of Kickstarter, the leader in the newish field of online crowd-funding, has been a paradigm-shifting boon for artists and other creators looking for a new way to bankroll projects that might otherwise never have happened. But as the popularity of the site, and others like Indiegogo, increases, users have been asking: What happens when I donate to a project but then the recipient never follows through? This week, the site said that while that rarely happens, there's not much they can do about it when it does. ""Kickstarter does not investigate a creator's ability to complete their project,"" a team of Kickstarter's top officers said in a blog post. ""Backers ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it."" The Tuesday post came in response to an NPR piece that highlighted the site's inability to guarantee that users will deliver on their promises. The site does review projects before publishing them online, but only to insure that they meet Kickstarter's guidelines. Kickstarter says more than 2 million donors have funded nearly 30,000 projects since 2009. The site requires projects have a clear goal (a specific product as opposed to, say, starting a business), fit into one of the site's mainly arts-related categories and not fall into its broadly defined ""prohibited content"" clause. (This being the Internet, we're presuming they're mostly taking about porn). The bottom line, Kickstarter says, is that the donor needs to weigh the reliability and honesty of the person they are pledging money to, as well as their ability to deliver what's promised. The site began as a haven for independent artists seeking help to make a dream a reality -- be it an independent film, CD release, book, play or video game. But as its popularity grew, many Kickstarter campaigns began to resemble business transactions more than creators looking for a helping hand. In August, a project to build an open-source gaming console raised $8.6 million. Penny Arcade, an already successful webcomic, raised more than a half-million dollars to make its site ad-free. The Pebble, a watch that works with Apple and Android operating systems, was pledged more than $10.2 million. While projects like those do fall under Kickstarter's guidelines, they've helped create situations in which donors think of themselves more as customers than helpers, and the ""gifts"" they get for donating as merchandise they're owed. David Barnett was featured in the NPR piece. His project, the PopSockets iPhone case, was successfully funded in February. Nearly seven months later, no cases have been shipped after a string of complications. He says he's given refunds to several backers who asked for them, but still plans to complete production. Barnett, to his credit, has actively worked to explain what's going on. The responses he's gotten from backers on the campaign's page shows the split in the mindset of those who gave. ""I think this should be a lesson for any other Kickstarter project you do ...,"" wrote backer Aseem Kishore on his project's page. ""I've backed a lot of Kickstarter projects and every one of them has delivered except this one. Not happy."" Others, however, were taking the delay in stride, saying they know that's sometimes the nature of backing startups. ""Though my financial backing was minimal, my personal support was, and is strong,"" a backer named Kayte Fulton wrote in the same thread. ""I believe I speak for many of your supporters when I say, keep us in the loop, your product is cool and versatile, and who knows what opportunities await!"" That's the attitude Kickstarter wants to encourage, even as it warns users to carefully consider before donating. ""The number of creative projects that have been funded and produced on Kickstarter in the past three years is enormous. Many could not exist otherwise,"" reads the blog post. ""But of course not every project goes perfectly. Delays do occur, especially with more complicated projects. Some creators get in over their heads dealing with processes that are new to them. ""Most backers support projects because they want to see something happen and they'd like to be a part of it. Creators who are honest and transparent will usually find backers to be understanding.""","Kickstarter urges users to choose wisely .

"New York (CNN) -- A man is in critical condition at a hospital after jumping out of a monorail car into the Bronx Zoo's tiger pit, the zoo's director said. The man -- believed to be about 25 -- was riding on the zoo's Wild Asia monorail around 3 p.m. Friday when he jumped out of his car, ""clearing the exhibit's perimeter fence,"" according to statement from Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny. The facility emergency response staff arrived and used a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher to move a tiger away from the man, Breheny said. But they did not get there before the man had suffered multiple puncture wounds after being bitten by a tiger, CNN affiliates WABC and WCBS reported, citing police. Heeding instructions, the man then rolled ""under a hot wire to safety,"" the zoo director said. The zoo uses hot wires as training tools to keep animals away from such areas as plant beds. If the animal comes into contact with the wire, it feels a small electric shock. Because the man followed instructions to roll under the wire, ""that probably saved his life,"" Breheny told reporters. He was ""conscious and talking"" as he was taken, by ambulance, to nearby Jacobi Medical Center. The man was in critical condition at the hospital, according to a New York fire department spokesman, who was not named per department policy. ""I think it's safe to say that if the tiger really wanted to do harm to this individual he certainly had the time to do it,"" Breheny said. Breheny said the tiger will not be put down as it ""did nothing wrong."" ""This is just an extraordinary occurrence that happened because ... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves,"" he said. According to the Bronx Zoo's website, the exhibit called Tiger Mountain houses Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, as well as Malayan tigers. Three cubs of each subspecies are part of the exhibit. Situated north of Manhattan, the Bronx Zoo is the flagship park run by the Wildlife Conservation Society, a group whose mission is to ""save wildlife and wild places across the globe."" CNN's Rob Frehse and Brittany Brady contributed to this report.","A man jumped from a monorail car into the Tiger Mountain exhibit, the zoo's director says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The opening scenes to a massive highway project dubbed ""Carmageddon II"" have so far been free of traffic jams, officials said Saturday. The construction project is shutting down this weekend a mountainous 10-mile section of a Los Angeles highway that's one of the nation's busiest freeways. Motorists have been told to stay home to avoid massive gridlock. ""So far, 'Carmageddon II' is an excellent sequel,"" Los Angeles Fire Capt. Alicia Mathis said. ""Carmageddon II"" repeats last year's closure of the same section of Interstate 405, which had been expected to be so apocalyptic that Los Angeles residents labeled the weekend shutdown ""Carmageddon."" The theatrical play on words captures Los Angeles' love affair with the automobile -- and its dread of common traffic jams -- but last year's evacuation of the highway went smoothly, causing no paralysis. The drama is heightened by how the closed portion of the 405 overlaps the Sepulveda Pass of the Santa Monica Mountains -- one of only two major highways over the range. No major traffic jams had been reported by Saturday evening. A mile-long backup near the south end of the project had been cleared by midday. Lauren Wonder, spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, said residents so far had heeded warnings to stay home or in their communities. Officials continued to advocate the use of public transportation. Because last year's closure went well, officials were concerned this year about ultra-gridlock out of a fear that motorists may get behind the wheel this weekend out of excessive confidence and complacency. ""The risk factors that caused transportation, law enforcement and emergency response agencies heartburn during last year's I-405 freeway closure have not changed,"" said Murthy. The 405, as it's locally called, connects suburban San Fernando Valley with Los Angeles International Airport. It also stretches into the well-to-do neighborhoods of west Los Angeles, such as Bel Air and Brentwood. Specifically, the 405 was closed between Interstate 10 and U.S. 101. Crews were taking down a portion of the Mulholland Drive bridge to make room for a wider roadway. The bridge is being reconstructed. Road crews will continue this weekend's shutdown of the 405 until Monday morning, and the reconstruction is expected to finish on time, said K.N. Murthy, an executive director of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The highway construction project this weekend will complete a carpool lane system over the mountain pass to create a continuous carpool lane of almost 73 miles in each direction between Orange County and Los Angeles County's San Fernando Valley -- the longest in the world, officials said. Highway reconstruction will continue until 2013, when the overall $1.34 billion project is scheduled for completion, officials said. Improvements include new bridges and ramps, officials said. Caltrans maintenance crews were taking advantage of the closure to pack in extensive maintenance, according to Wonder. The list included cleaned culverts, removal of debris, tree trimming, striping and the application of rubber sealant on the roadway. CNN's Kyung Lah and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Residents appear to be heeding warnings .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A massive typhoon crossed over Okinawa on Sunday, bringing winds more ferocious than even the typhoon-weary Japanese island has seen in decades. Typhoon Bolaven, with wind gusts that reached as high as 259 kilometers per hour (161 mph), is the strongest to strike the region in nearly 50 years. And with a cloud field of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), it is 20 times larger than Okinawa's length. ""It's been very, very severe,"" said storm chaser James Reynolds, who was on the northwestern coast of the island during the worst of the storm. Tree branches were flying through the air amid torrential rain, he said. Speaking to CNN early Monday morning on Okinawa, Reynolds said, ""It's been a long and rough night."" ""The eye of the typhoon actually crashed ashore just after dark. ... Like the rest of the population we all just kind of holed up in the strong and sturdy buildings which make up Okinawa,"" he said. The infrastructure on Okinawa is designed to withstand violent storms. ""Everything's made of solid concrete,"" said Reynolds. The last storm of this scale was Typhoon Naha in 1956. At 3 a.m. Monday local time (2 p.m. ET Sunday), Bolaven had winds of 194 kilometers per hour, with gusts at 240 kilometers per hour, CNN International meteorologist Jennifer Delgado reported. Bolaven could make landfall at the Korean peninsula on Tuesday morning, or potentially in South Korea on Monday night, Delgado said. Isaac near hurricane strength; watch extends to Louisiana .

The storm is moving away and unfortunately it's the people in the Korean peninsula who look like they've got to prepare for the incoming storm."" Taiwan, meanwhile, could be in for a pounding due to something called the Fujiwhara effect. Typhoon Tembin made landfall in southern Taiwan a few days ago, and was expected to work its way toward Hong Kong. But Bolaven, which is much stronger, has stopped Tembin's movement toward Hong Kong and has been spinning it around. Tembin is likely to make a second landfall in southern Taiwan, also on Tuesday morning. ""As Typhoon Bolaven moves northward towards the Yellow Sea, it will drag Tembin toward the China coast very near Shanghai,"" said Sater. ""That's an amazing change in direction."" Are you there?

"New York (CNN) -- The most prized possessions of Bonnie and Clyde, the notorious lovebird bandits killed nearly 80 years ago, were sold for a price that the couple could only imagine getting after one of their infamous bank jobs. One of the featured items of the auction was Bonnie Parker's personal Colt .38 snub-nosed revolver, which sold for $264,000. Clyde Barrow's Colt .45 sold for $240,000. Parker's revolver was found taped to her inner thigh and Barrow's on his waistband the day they were ambushed and fatally shot by a police posse in Louisiana in 1934. Barrow and Parker were known for kidnapping, auto theft, robbery, burglary and 13 murders, including the killings of two police officers, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ""These amazing and historic weapons were found on the couple the morning of their deaths and gifted to Capt. (Frank) Hamer, along with other items from that ill-fated day, on May 23, 1934. The guns, along with other items, were taken by authorities at the time as part of his compensation package for the ambush,"" said Bobby Livingston, vice president at RR Auction, in a news release. Hamer was one of the officers who killed the gangster duo. RR Auction held the sale Sunday in Nashua, New Hampshire. The pistols are a small part of the arsenal that was found in Barrow and Parker's stolen car. Livingston said the posse officers were allowed to keep firearms and other possessions from the bullet-riddled vehicle, including the Colt that Barrow may have stolen from a federal armory in Texas. A 1921 Morgan Silver Dollar, later owned by Mafia boss ""Big Paulie"" Castellano, sold for $32,400. Livingston said Castellano considered it his lucky coin, but gave it away before he was shot dead in front of Sparks Steak House in New York in 1985. Barrow's pocket watch, given to his father, Henry Barrow, after he retrieved his son's body, sold for $36,000. Other items included five original items collected off the floor of Bonnie and Clyde's car: A woman's silk stocking, an unused .45 caliber bullet and casing, a side temple from a pair of eyeglasses, a wood-handled screwdriver and an empty Bayer Aspirin tin, which sold for $11,400.

As with my Palm Vx of yesterday, breaking up with a beloved gadget is hard to do, especially when you have history. My BlackBerry and I go back over 10 years. We met at a telecom conference in Hong Kong. I will never forget the wonder of our first wireless e-mail. Look, I'm no softie when it comes to loving and leaving my electronics. I've thrown out old Macs. I've recycled expired Sony Ericsson handsets. I've even trashed now-antique digital cameras. But this is the longest and saddest gadget breakup I've ever gone through.

I started to dabble in social media and mobile photography. The tools on offer from other devices were far better in functionality, speed and resolution.

"(CNN) -- There's more to Election Day than just the presidential campaign. The polarization of the parties has led directly to the divided and dysfunctional Congress we've seen over the past two years, leading to the lowest congressional approval ratings in recent history. No matter who wins the presidency, we need to see more principled problem-solving centrists elected from both parties. That's why I'm continuing my pre-election CNN.com column tradition of listing some of the most standout centrist Senate and House candidates on the ballot this year. Centrism is one of most misunderstood and maligned political identities in our polarized hyper-partisan environment. Its advocates have been hunted into near-extinction on Capitol Hill by party-first conformists, angry ideologues and special interests. Politics: Key races to watch -- Senate, House and Governor . But a look over this list shows a deeper philosophic consistency beyond party labels -- a commitment to generational responsibility and individual liberty that can be fairly described as fiscally conservative but socially liberal. Most of all, there is a common commitment to working together across party lines to solve problems rather than holding out for ideologically pure solutions. For a more detailed defense of the legitimacy of this political perspective, David Brooks gave a typically eloquent explanation of the centrist political leader as a craftsman in a must-read column. The 10 standout centrist candidates on this list are independents, Republicans and Democrats who all recognize that hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from solving the serious problems we face. That's why we need them in the next Congress -- to break the fever of division and dysfunction, define the common ground that exists on the urgent issues we face and then build on them. Their success in the 2012 election would be a healthy step forward for the nation. 2012 ballot initiatives: Voter-run or special interest-hijacked? Angus King . This independent's Senate campaign in Maine is the biggest nonpresidential race in the nation for many independent voters -- a gutsy challenge to the two parties that looks like it will prove successful. King has described himself as ""too fiscally conservative for the Democrats and too socially liberal for the Republicans -- like 75% of the American people."" He proved his effectiveness in two terms as a popular independent governor of Maine in the 1990s. Now he is the odds-on favorite to succeed retiring centrist Republican Olympia Snowe in the Senate. If the Senate is closely divided, he could be the deciding vote. King has told me about his vision to bring together a coalition of senators in the vital center to break gridlock. ""What if two or three other people like me around the country were elected who said: 'I don't care about the parties -- I just want to solve the problems ... We're going start talking to each other in a grown-up and civil way."" Here's hoping. Bob Kerrey . The Medal of Honor winner, Nebraska governor, senator, presidential candidate and college president would return to Washington as an elder statesman committed to building bipartisan coalitions. He is one of the most respected and best liked political leaders of recent decades. His opponent, social conservative state senator Deb Fischer, rode to victory in the Republican primary thanks to endorsements by the likes of Sarah Palin and Jim DeMint. ""Somebody has to go back there and change Congress. Somebody has to stand the middle ground,"" Kerrey says. ""I want to be the person that makes that change happen."" This election is close in a center-right state, and former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel's endorsement of Democrat Kerrey on Thursday provided another boost. Having Kerrey back in the senate would be a win not just for the people of Nebraska, but for the entire country. Heather Wilson . A former congresswoman, Air Force officer and Rhodes Scholar, the New Mexico Republican would be an excellent addition to the U.S. Senate and the Republican conference. She won more than 40% of the Hispanic vote in each of her six congressional races. But with the polarization of the Hispanic population over neighboring Arizona's immigration laws, New Mexico has moved from bellwether swing state to the Democratic column. So, Wilson is flying against stiff headwinds. But she's a big-tent, pro-life Republican -- fiscally conservative, centrist on social issues and strong on defense -- with a demonstrated ability to win over independent voters. Her biggest problem is the rightward drift of the GOP and the consequent alienation of the Hispanic vote in a presidential year. But she would make a great senator that New Mexico would be proud of for decades to come. Joe Donnelly . The Indiana Democrat is running to replace centrist Republican statesman Dick Lugar in the Senate against the tea party-backed Republican nominee Richard Mourdock. A three-term Congressman with a decidedly centrist record, Donnelly has been arguing that Mourdock is too extreme for Indiana -- with plenty of help from Mourdock himself. From Mourdock's saying that bipartisanship ""ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view,"" to slamming centrists in the Senate by arguing that ""the time for collegiality is past ... it's time for confrontation,"" to his now infamous comments that pregnancies that result from rape are ""God's will,"" Mourdock has managed to find himself losing a Senate race in a state that Mitt Romney is winning easily. Hoosiers don't seem to want an embarrassing advocate of extremism in the Senate. They'd do better with Donnelly. Linda Lingle . It takes an impressive person to win Hawaii's governorship as a Republican, but former Maui Mayor Linda Lingle managed to distinguish herself as a successful and popular leader during her two terms, while breaking down barriers as the first woman and first Jewish governor of the Aloha State. Running in a presidential election cycle with Hawaii-born Barack Obama on the ballot is no picnic for a Republican, but Lingle has overcome long odds before -- she won reelection as governor by the largest margin in Hawaii's history. She's developed an impressive record as a decisive leader, combining fiscal responsibility with a big-tent approach on social issues. She would be a refreshing centrist Republican voice in the U.S. Senate. Tim Kaine . It's a tight Senate race between two former Virginia governors -- centrist Democrat Tim Kaine and conservative Republican George Allen -- to see who will succeed Jim Webb in the Senate. Kaine is the kind of solid Third Way Democrat who has proven he can win statewide in the Old Dominion state, like his predecessor Mark Warner, who currently serves in the Senate and has been a leader of the Gang of Six negotiations to find a bipartisan deal on the deficit and the debt. Kaine -- a former DNC Chair - is not as nonpartisan as many centrists, but he is a classic DLC Blue Dog of the kind we have seen almost hunted into extinction on Capital Hill. His election would send a welcome signal about that tradition's persistence and further commitment to the kind of thoughtful bipartisan cooperation we need to see in the Senate. Scott Brown . When Scott Brown won the special election to succeed Ted Kennedy in the Senate, it was seen as a tea party victory predicated upon his opposition to Obama's health care reform. But as senator, Brown has developed a decidedly centrist voting record -- being recognized by the National Journal voting records as having a 55% conservative and 45% liberal composite record, placing him squarely in the center of the Senate. He has tried to rekindle the Ed Brooke Massachusetts moderate tradition and is locked in a tough race against Elizabeth Warren, who has developed a strong following for her fearless work in the wake of the fiscal crisis. But Brown's record cannot and should not be ignored -- and if he loses this Senate seat in the headwinds of the likely Obama landslide in his home state of Massachusetts, we could see Brown back in the Senate or serve as governor sometime in the future. Jim Graves . To many moderates, Michele Bachmann is the symbol of everything that's wrong with our divided and dysfunctional congress. She's quick to call opponents anti-American and weave unhinged conspiracy theories into policy debates. But she's never had a serious candidate campaign against her until now. Jim Graves is a 58-year-old, self-made Minnesota businessman and grandfather of seven, still married to his high-school sweetheart. And he's got Bachmann on defense in her reelection effort. ""My policy approach transcends political lines,"" Graves told me in an interview for DailyBeast, ""I'm a centrist, a libertarian when it comes to social issues. I don't think government should be involved with personal lives. I really believe in separation of church and state. Bachmann wants to blur those lines -- she would (replace) our democracy with a theocracy,"" he says. ""She epitomizes everything that's wrong with Congress and this country -- a lack of civility, a lack of bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to problem solving."" Richard Tisei . A Republican running for Congress in Massachusetts this year might be dismissed as a political suicide mission, but Richard Tisei is an exception in every sense. He's running a strong race against an uninspiring and ineffective liberal incumbent John Tierney in a state where registered independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans. Tisei is popular state legislator and a self-described ""live and let live' Republican -- who applies the principles of individual liberty and individual responsibility consistently in his political philosophy -- get government out of the bedroom and out of the boardroom. He is also, perhaps not incidentally, openly gay. But Tisei's constituents have come to see him as a strong advocate of fiscal responsibility and limited government, a libertarian New England Republican in the mold of Bill Weld rather than Mitt Romney. Richard Hanna . This upstate New York Republican congressman is an independent thinker who does not let party loyalty get in the way of his common sense approach to solving problems. The longtime businessman and community leader does not mince words or shy away from condemning impractical extremes on both sides. He told the Syracuse Post-Standard, ""I'm frustrated by how much we -- I mean the Republican Party -- are willing to give deferential treatment to our extremes in this moment in history. ... If all people do is go down there and join a team, and the team is invested in winning and you have something that looks very similar to the shirts and the skins, there's not a lot of value there."" That's the kind of principled independence, and commitment to governing in the national interest, that we need to see more of in the next Congress. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: We need to see more principled centrists elected to Congress .

"(CNN) -- Most people are yet to learn about the progress most countries have made in recent decades. The reason media and schools have failed to communicate a fact-based world view is probably due to the continuous use of the outdated concept of a ""Developing World."" A mindset upgrade with a division of countries into more than two groups is long overdue. In the 1960s it was very relevant to divide the countries of the world into two distinct groups. These two groups of countries were labeled ""developed"" and ""developing,"" or the two were just referred to as ""the Western World"" and ""the Developing World"". The two groups of countries differed in almost every way. Western countries were rich and people had long education, long lives and small families. Developing countries were poor and the people had meager or no education, short lives and large families. The population in the West was stable whereas the population in the developing world was growing fast. Almost the whole world economy was in the West. The poor developing countries were expected to gradually get out of misery with the help of development aid and family planning. And no major countries were found in the middle -- in the wide gap between the West and the rest. The only exceptions were a few small island nation states like Singapore, Hong Kong and also Cuba. Well there was of course a third group, the Soviet dominated ""Communist Countries""; but they lived separate and enclosed lives outside the world economy. They were, however, included in one alternative division of countries, in which the West was called the First, the Communist the Second and the rest of the countries the Third World. Read more: Take Gapminder's 'ignorance test' and see how up-to-date your knowledge is . More than two decades after the disappearance of the Soviet group, we are in urgent need of a new system to group and label countries. Two groups are not enough. The World Bank did a promising attempt by creating four country groups by using cut-offs in Gross National Income per capita at $1,000, $4,000 and $12,000. The cut-offs defined low-income, lower middle income, upper middle income and high income countries. However, this division into four groups did not change many mindsets. The concept of a developing world ranging from Turkey and Brazil all the way to Somalia and Afghanistan still forms the mindset used by most people to sort information about the world. The world keeps changing, while mindsets remain surprisingly intact. Now the countries of the world defy all attempts to sort in only two groups. Most of the formerly ""developing"" countries fill the once empty middle, and form socioeconomic and demographic continuum. On the top of the health and wealth league, Norway and Singapore, at the bottom the poorest nations torn by civil war, like Congo and Somalia. So the disparity between the richest and the poorest is as wide as ever, yet the big change is that the gap in the middle has been filled. Most countries and most people now live in the middle of the new socioeconomic continuum, in middle-income countries like Brazil, Mexico, China, Turkey and Indonesia. Half of the world's economy -- and most of the economic growth -- now lies in these middle income countries, outside the old West, Western Europe and North America. Future population growth . In spite of dramatic economic shifts, the change in demography is even more pronounced. Fifty years ago the women in the world on average had five babies, an average composed by six in the developing world and 2.5 in the developed world. Now the world average has dropped to 2.5 babies born per woman, an unprecedented shift. This has happened across religions and cultures, and especially in Asia the fall in fertility took place at a lower economic level than ever before in human history. In most Asian countries the fertility drop happened before the economic growth took off. In the world as a whole the main reason for future population growth is that the young generations grow up causing an inevitable fill-up of the adult population. The consequences are amazing. In the last decade the total number of children aged 0-14 in the world has started to level off at around two billion. The U.N. population experts predict that it most probably is going to stay that way throughout this century. Age of 'Peak Child' That's right: the amount of children in the world today is probably the most there will be! We are entering into the age of Peak Child! This is in spite of the increase of the number of children in Africa, where women in many countries still have five babies and are in desperate need of access to contraceptives. Yet the increase of children in Africa is foreseen to match the decrease in the number of children in Asia and Europe. A decrease caused by women in more and more countries having on average less than two babies. So almost 80% of mankind now lives in societies where the two child families are most common and 80% of adults in the world can read and write, and 80% of the one-year-olds have been vaccinated and the life expectancy of the world population as a whole is 70 years. The percentage living in extreme poverty fell to half in the last 20 years, from 40% to 20%. So yet in this new and better world 1-2 billion still live in extreme poverty, cannot send all children to primary school, and are not sure to have enough food to eat. They live in rural areas in low income and lower middle income countries. That means mainly in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia with less than $4000 in Gross National Income per capita. So in short, the world is better than ever, yet very far from good! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hans Rosling.","In the 1960s, the world was divided into ""developed -- or Western"" and ""developing""

"(CNN) -- The wait is over for Ho Chi Minh City residents and travelers in need of a Chicken McNugget fix. Vietnam's first McDonald's restaurant officially opened for business this weekend. Located in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam's commercial center, the McDonald's branch has a 24-hour drive-through service and will feature the usual menu classics, plus some items to cater to local tastes (McPork, anyone?), according to Vietnamese media. The chain joins other Western fast food chains already present in the country such as Subway, Burger King and KFC, catering to an increasingly brand conscious local middle class. Menu items at the McDonald's are priced at an average VND40,000-VND60,000 ($1.90-2.84). With the addition of Vietnam, McDonald's now operates in 119 countries. Last year, McDonald's announced that Nguyen Bao Hoang -- or Henry Nguyen as he's known in the West -- would be the developmental licensee for Vietnam to build the brand. A businessman and son-in-law of Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dun, Nguyen has experience in the trenches of the famed fast food chain. ""I have been a big fan of McDonald's my whole life and have had so many wonderful experiences there, including one of my first jobs when I was a teenager,"" Nguyen said in a statement released by McDonald's announcing the deal. ""I have dreamed of one day opening a McDonald's restaurant in my native country ever since my return to Vietnam more than a decade ago."" Second branch to come . Although Nguyen has not unveiled detailed expansion plans, a second branch is soon to follow in HCMC (referred to as ""Saigon"" until 1975), reports Voice of Vietnam. Global reaction to the opening is predictable, with media skeptical over whether Vietnamese will be keen to replace culinary classics like pho and banh mi with Big Macs and Fillet-O-Fish. Though many on social media have lamented the introduction to Vietnam of a brand that many in the West equate with unhealthy lifestyles, the country already has its fair share of fast food chains. These include Burger King, Subway, Domino's Pizza, Starbucks, Dairy Queen and KFC.","Vietnam's first McDonald's restaurant opened in Ho Chi Minh City on February 8 .

"(CNN) -- Timothy Jones Jr. allegedly went on a 700-mile journey that began in South Carolina with the bodies of his five young children wrapped in garbage bags in the back of his SUV, authorities said Wednesday. Jones, a 32-year-old computer tech and Mississippi State University graduate, told neighbors last week that he was moving his children from their home near Lexington to another state. The father of five was being held Wednesday in a Mississippi jail in connection with the deaths of his children, ages 1 to 8, whose bodies were dumped in Alabama. It's still unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV. It is believed he killed the children at the same time, and that the crime happened in Lexington County, McCarty said. ""I don't understand why he did it but, yes, these children were in the car, deceased, in garbage bags for some period of time,"" McCarty said. When Jones was picked up Saturday at a police checkpoint in Mississippi, he seemed ""very strange, maybe somewhat disoriented, a little bit on the violent side,"" McCarty said. In the car, police later found ""cleaning material, they saw blood, they saw children's clothing but no children."" McCarty said Jones, who allegedly was in possession of synthetic marijuana and a drug called ""bath salts,"" faces five counts of murder when he's returned to South Carolina. The sheriff said Jones led investigators in Alabama to the remains believed to be those of his children. The remains have been returned to South Carolina, where autopsies will be performed. ""I'm a father and I'm a grandfather and in all of my years of law enforcement I have never seen a case like this,"" McCarty said. ""We all see things in our careers that have an impact. This case has impacted every person ... who had anything at all to do with it."" Late Tuesday, Albert Santa Cruz, Mississippi's public safety commissioner, called the crime ""unconscionable."" In a statement, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley called the deaths of the five children and Monday's shooting of two Charleston County deputies, one fatally, in an unrelated incident ""moments that truly shock our conscience."" ""These events bring a sadness like no other,"" she said. ""We grieve together for our lost ones, and we pray together for those touched by these horrific tragedies."" Parents speak out . Standing before television cameras with his wife sobbing by his side, Jones' father spoke to reporters Wednesday. ""We know that the angels are with us, but your prayers are helping us cope,"" Tim Jones said. ""We do not have all the answers and we may never have all of them, but anyone who knows little Tim will agree that he is not the animal that he will be portrayed through the media."" He described his son as ""a very loving father, brother and son"" and said the family was heartbroken. ""At this time, we need to use all our strength to say goodbye to our grandchildren and be allowed privacy to grieve,"" he said. Child welfare investigation . Child welfare authorities said they had received an abuse complaint involving at least one of the children on August 7 but interviews with Jones, the children and neighbors determined there was no imminent danger, said Jackie Swindler, a representative of the South Carolina Department of Social Services. ""DSS did not see any visible signs of abuse,"" he said, adding that the agency planned to follow up within 45 days. ""At the time, there was nothing to alarm them."" Authorities said Jones picked up the children at school and day care on August 28. According to an affidavit for the child endangerment charges against him, he admitted that he forced the five children out of his car that day near a Wal-Mart store in Lexington County. Parts of the affidavit are blacked out. The children's mother, who shared custody of the children with her ex-husband, reported them missing on September 3 after not being able to contact Jones. He was supposed to bring the children to stay with her the day before. ""We feel that the deaths took place early on,"" McCarty said. Jones was being held in Smith County, Mississippi, on drug and child endangerment charges and is awaiting extradition to South Carolina for prosecution. A grisly discovery . The children's remains were discovered off a dirt road in Wilcox County, not far from Camden, said Sgt. Steve Jarrett of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. A multistate search for the children and their father involved the FBI and state law enforcement agencies. When Jones was arrested Saturday in Mississippi, a check of the National Criminal Information Center found he was wanted in South Carolina. Missing nursing student's remains found in Tennessee .

Sure, there's a synthesized quality to the music -- which sweeps from orchestral to experimental rock -- but what band doesn't get a little help from computers these days? Open your eyes and you'll find something very different indeed. For starters, the guitarist is a humanoid looming two-meters-tall, with 78 fingers sweeping across the glowing instrument strapped to its torso. The rocking robot -- called March -- bangs its impressive mane of multi-colored cables in time to the music, albeit a little jerkily. Seated a little behind is Ashura, the drummer with 22 arms extending like a futuristic octopus and playing four times faster than any human ever could. And then there's Cosmo, perhaps the most alien band member of all, a keyboardist with green lasers hitting each key with pinpoint accuracy. ""The footage of the robot performer is almost like watching a broken human, with a skeleton of steel, and oil for blood,"" said Tom Jenkinson, better known as British recording artist Squarepusher, who composed the music for the mechanical band's new EP. ""Using robots has this eerie narrative associated with it -- the twilight area between human and machine. It's just a box of tricks, but it still haunts us because we see it as an impression of ourselves."" Big in Japan . Created by engineers at the University of Tokyo, the robot band uses around 300 kilowatts of electricity, which designer Kenjiro Matsuo admitted: ""Is a big amount of power."" ""We just bought a power board which has a switch -- many people can try to make this kind of robot in their house now."" The machine musicians made their stage debut at a ""Future Party"" in Tokyo last year, performing an electro-rock mash-up for the screaming crowd. Girls in space-age outfits gyrated around guitarist March, whose screen face flashed slogans like ""Party!"" Each time the audience raised their drinks in the air, the band would play faster, in an event sponsored by the drinks company. Soul music? Now the machine musicians are set to release a five-track album, with the first single ""Sad Robot Goes Funny,"" a more melancholy tune than you might expect from a band without hearts. ""Can these robots play music that is emotionally engaging?' asked Jenkinson, who composed the song and has experimented with electronic music in a career spanning two decades. ""It's a fascinating question, and one that I've tried to explore in this project. I'll let people make up their own minds."" So how do you create music for a machine with 78 fingers, which can hit a note every eight milliseconds? ""It's just another way of making sound, but in this case what's interesting is the aesthetics of the instrument,"" said Jenkinson. ""Just like when you're writing music for a human, there are certain possibilities and certain limits. The robot guitarist for example, can play much faster than a human ever could, but there is no amplification control."" Electronic evolution . If you imagine that this is the start of a robot revolution, never fear, we've still got a fair way to go before people tire of flesh and blood performers, said Jenkins. ""Is the performance going to be less compelling because it's robots?"" he asked. ""For me, part of the appeal has to do with hearing a familiar instrument being 'played' in an unfamiliar fashion."" And behind every robot musician, is a human being bringing it to life.","Futuristic robot band created by engineers in Tokyo, Japan .

"(CNN) -- African-Americans deserve reparations. Discuss. The idea of reparations -- that the descendants of slaves should be compensated by the national government for the wrongs and the legacy of slavery -- has always been controversial. When Ta-Nehisi Coates of The Atlantic wrote the June cover story, ""The Case for Reparations,"" he set a traffic record for the magazine's website. He provoked responses from across the political and ethnic spectrum. Some of his critics did him the courtesy of reading the entire 16,000-word piece. Others, particularly in the Twittersphere, reacted viscerally to the headline and to reactions to the headline. Through many of these responses, whether thoughtful or tossed-off, there's been a certain thread of uneasiness; a reflexive move to find reasons why reparation couldn't be done or why it wouldn't be workable or fair. To me, this reflex is as interesting as the original argument. And it suggests that before America could ever actually do reparations, America would have to first be able to imagine the necessity of reparations. The greatest obstacle to considering reparation isn't practicality; it's a dearth of moral imagination. Coates makes a powerful and persuasive case. He describes not just the obvious injury that demands redress -- namely, slavery -- but also the way in which whites after emancipation systematically and over most of the ensuing 150 years built a nation premised on second-class status for blacks and on supremacy for whites. The obvious example is the latticework of code and custom that we call Jim Crow. But as Coates reminds us, white supremacy was not just about measures of outright racial subjugation; it was also baked into measures intended to create wealth and opportunity, like parts of the New Deal, which contained many devil's bargains with conservative Southern Democrats to exempt African-Americans. And it plays out in today's criminal justice and incarceration regimes. What Coates recounts in painstaking detail is an un-whitewashed history of African-American citizenship. It comes as revelation only if you really didn't want to know the truth. Anyone black, by telling their family history, could have told you this history and anyone not black could have read about it. But his article is in some ways mistitled. Coates is not quite making a case for reparations. He's making a case for a discussion of reparations. He doesn't pretend to spell out all the operational policy choices that would have to be made to put reparations into effect. The closest he comes to a legislative recommendation is to tout a perennially neglected bill that Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, introduces every session of Congress, which calls simply for a public study of the possibility of reparations. This isn't a shortcoming of Coates' argument; it is its purpose. What we need to do is to study the issue in earnest. To have a hearing, in the deepest sense. To listen to the difference between Americanness and whiteness, and to notice the manifold ways that whiteness was (and is) an identity fabricated from the myth of blackness. To be sure, every ethnic group that's not called white has experienced suffering in American life. But the experience of African-Americans is exceptional in its systematic, multigenerational, reverberating effects. And it's exceptional in its centrality to the founding and building of our nation. No experience reveals more than the African-American experience both the hypocrisy and the possibility of our national creed. Does any of this answer the question everyone wants to rush to, the question of implementation and how reparations would actually work? How to decide which people are called ""black"" or ""black enough"" to get compensation? How to allocate reparations? How to decide how much? How to decide who decides? How to begin the process without it leading to the unraveling of every aspect of institutional wealth, privilege and power in our country? No, Coates doesn't answer these questions. He asks for a hearing. And the point of a hearing on reparations -- and making it a civic experience as profound and prismatic as the Watergate hearing -- is not to get the American public to ""how."" It's to get us to ""why."" For only when we understand why reparations are justified, even if in good faith we cannot yet figure out how or even whether they could be feasible, will we have a shot at being ""beyond race."" Maimonides said, ""Teach thy tongue to say 'I do not know' and thou shalt progress."" On a topic as charged as race, and as woven into the warp and woof of American identity as whiteness, the temptation is always to speak emphatically from fear or pain. But if more of us in reaction to reparations simply say, ""I do not know -- but I wish to understand,"" then we will be making true progress.","The Atlantic's June cover story about reparations generated strong reactions .

"(CNN) -- If you have ever tried to grab a bargain that appears online, you'll know you have to be quick. The business of high frequency trading -- using algorithms and superfast computers to conduct trades in a fraction of a second -- is a supercharged version of this, with the potential to execute millions of buy and sell orders electronically each day through the myriad exchanges currently in existence. Advocates argue that high frequency trading reduces market volatility and lowers transaction costs for small investors, but others claim it is unfair on slower traders, and can lead to instability -- trading algorithms and high frequency trading were behind the ""Flash Crash"" of May 6 2010, when the Dow Jones briefly plummeted almost 1,000 points. Irrespective of how the popularity of high frequency trading changes in the future, this need for speed will continue to drive a technological arms race where the weapons of choice include new types of computer circuits hard-wired with dedicated trading algorithms; new tunnels blasted through mountains to ensure more direct optic fiber connections; new cables being laid in straighter paths across the Atlantic seabed; and even new networks of microwave towers to profit from the speed of electromagnetic signals through air. And as the search for an evolutionary edge continues, ""genetic"" trading programs will be created that develop specific mutant offspring in response to real-time changes in market conditions. Even long-term pension funds play the high frequency game, hence it involves us all -- whether we like it or not. There is one factor that limits speed: According to Einstein, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. However this leaves ample opportunity for future increases in trading speed. Light can travel approximately one foot in a nanosecond (a billionth of a second) in free space, meaning that current processers, routers and switching devices have plenty of room for improvement. And just as faster predators in the animal kingdom catch more prey and will be less vulnerable to other predators, faster trading companies will emerge at the expense of slower ones. In parallel, a new form of ultrafast options market may emerge with second-scale contract times in order to hedge high frequency risk. However, there are two problems that make the future of high frequency trading of unique global concern, irrespective of how popular it becomes. The first is a scientific one: Financial markets represent the largest-ever sociotechnical system in existence, with a mix of state-of-the-art communications and computational power operating at speeds approaching the natural speed limit of light. Yet nobody, including Einstein, has ever produced a theory that predicts what might go wrong in an ultrafast global network of interconnected machines that carry out millions of operations in the blink of an eye -- or what can be done to prevent or manage it. This leads to the second problem. How can regulators and governments possibly decide how to manage this emerging ultrafast financial jungle if nobody yet fully understands it? My fellow researchers and I recently uncovered glimpses of what is already going wrong in the form of escalating patterns of ""sub-second tsunamis."" These tsunamis are huge spikes and dips in the price of an individual stock. Although the Flash Crash was fast, lasting only a few minutes, these sub-second tsunamis are over in the blink of an eye -- and there are thousands of them. A 10% daily change in a major stock would guarantee breaking news coverage, but these tsunamis typically send the price plummeting to almost zero. However they go unnoticed since the price quickly recovers as other algorithms jump in for the kill. Their existence reveals a remarkable difference between the human trading world above the typical human response time of one second, and the all-machine ecology of trading algorithms below one second. Just like cracks propagating in a structure prior to mechanical failure, these sub-second tsunamis escalated in the lead up to the 2008 financial meltdown. Most importantly, the stock showing highest proliferation are the banks that are now associated with the crisis. Yet nobody knew at the time. Indeed our research predicts a growing zoo of such tsunamis in the future, with each species having its own characteristic twist and turns. Governments need the financial equivalent of an air traffic control system in order to know how to manage this brave new world, and hence what rules (if any) to impose. This in turn will require a joint research program between trading houses, regulators and academics. However, instead of using conventional economics, the methodological approach should be built around complex adaptive systems and dynamical networks. Generative market models must be tested in real-time against high resolution data, to see if they can reproduce the observed price exchange dynamics down to the sub-second scale. Our own research predicts that these sub-second market movements will be neither completely unpredictable nor predictable, but will instead have pockets of predictability that come and go in particular ways. Estimates of the market share of different trading algorithms will enable real-time system management, while ensuring that the secrecy of individual trading entities remains intact. Without such a financial Manhattan Project, regulatory bodies will effectively be flying blind and may end up doing more harm than good. Read this: How to start your own currency .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats are increasingly worried that an avalanche of outside spending by GOP groups will bury them this fall, putting more of their members at risk of losing, and jeopardizing their goal of winning back control of the House in 2016. Virtually no Democrat believes the party has a chance to pick up the 17 seats they need to regain control of the House after the 2014 midterms. But the House Democrats' campaign arm has been focused on a strategy to bolster Democrats in competitive districts and try to knock off some GOP members in districts won by Obama in 2012. The thinking is that keeping losses to a minimum this fall better positions Democrats for the next national election in 2016, especially if former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is at the top of the ticket and drives up party turnout. But Democrats are facing an unexpected money problem. Their allies -- outside labor and environmental groups -- aren't spending the kind of cash on candidates that the party expected. Meanwhile, outside groups associated with Republicans are flooding airwaves with ads in the final weeks of campaign season. Just in the last few days several outside groups - American Action Network, the Congressional Leadership Fund, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- rolled out television ad buys worth $3.7 million against four House Democrats in Illinois, Texas, Arizona and California. ""We thought our friends would come in a way that they're not,"" a Democratic strategist focused on House races told CNN. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has consistently outraised its GOP counterpart over the course of this election cycle, anticipating it would need resources this fall to counter Republican affiliated outside groups. But those efforts may not be enough to counter the GOP groups. House Democrats are watching their fundraising advantage erode as Republican outside groups begin moving more aggressively into blue territory in the hopes of defeating Democratic incumbents. ""There has certainly been a drop off in funding from outside groups which is creating a funding gap,"" Matt Thornton, the communications director for House Majority PAC, the one super PAC dedicated to raising money on behalf of House Democratic candidates. So far the House Majority PAC has reserved $21.5 million for television time this cycle. But without more outside spending help from others, that money needs to be used to defend incumbents instead of going on offense. One labor union, the Service Employees International Union, spent close to $6.5 million in the 2012 election to help House Democratic candidates, but so far, according to an analysis of campaign contributions posted by the Center for Responsive Politics, the SEIU is spending roughly ten times less - $665,000 - on House races this year. In the last midterm election, 2010, when control of the House was up for grabs the group spent over $6 million to help House Democratic candidates. CNN reached out to SEIU but has not received a response. House Democrats are having trouble in part because many of their traditional friends are laser focused on the Senate, where Republicans seem are poised to take control for the first time in nearly a decade. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV), a key Democratic ally focused on climate change and health issues, is on track to spent a record $25 million this cycle but almost all of that money is earmarked for the Senate. The group isn't making any excuses for keeping its primary focus on Senate races. ""We made a decision a long time ago,"" Jeff Gohringer, press secretary for LCV told CNN. He emphasized that the group is working to protect the Senate Democratic majority, which it believes was key to stopping a series of environmental measures passed by the GOP-led House from making it to the President's desk. LCV has sponsored ads supporting House Democratic Reps Gary Peters and Bruce Braley, who are running for open Senate seats in Michigan and Iowa. WATCH: DSCC ad: Tillis in Koch brothers' pocket . Gohringer notes that LCV did contribute to House Democratic candidates in a couple of House races in Maine and in California where climate change has been a key issue, and that they plan to spend $100,000 on a voter turnout effort to help Democratic candidate Emily Cain in Maine's second congressional district. But with a bad political environment getting worse for House Democrats in 2014 there is concern that being outspent by even more than they anticipated could put any hopes of retaking the House in 2016 out of reach. ""It's important that we go into 2016 cycle with a manageable gap that we can overcome in a good year for Democrats,"" the House Democratic strategist told CNN. Just last week when CNN asked House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi about her earlier prediction that Democrats would pick up enough seats to win back the House this November, Pelosi replied her party would do ""OK"" but then she skipped ahead two years, saying, ""I know that in two years, there will be a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president."" While House Republicans are feeling good about the midterms, they admit they could be doing better. They got a slow start and were never able to catch up with the DCCC's fundraising edge. But they have similar worries that the outside groups who are helping their candidates aren't on track to spend at the same level as House Majority PAC. And they acknowledge that while outside groups are investing heavily, the attention on the Senate has limited the amount of money they could use to pick up even more Democratic-held seats.","Outside Democratic groups aren't spending the kind of cash the party expected .

"(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer overcame adverse weather and fading light to secure his first tour triumph since 2011 at The Players Championship at TCP Sawgrass. The 29-year-old German was on the 14th green and three shots ahead of second-placed Jim Furyk at 15-under-par when play was suspended due to heavy rain and thunder late on Sunday. A double bogey on the 15th when play resumed 90 minutes later, however, made for a tense finish. But Kaymer held par and his nerve with a monster putt on the 17th, a score he matched at the 18th as darkness descended to secure a 13-under-par one shot victory. ""It was difficult to come back after a little break,"" he told Sky Sports as he reached the clubhouse. ""You are really disappointed when they call it ... and then you're a little cold."" ""I made a couple of wrong decisions on 15 and 16 but what a putt on 17."" Kaymer had golf's led ""fifth major"" all week having carded a record equaling round of 63 on Thursday. But he was clawed back by the young American, Jordan Spieth, on Saturday and the pair started level on Sunday at 13-under-par. Spieth, who lit up the Masters where he finished in a tie for second earlier this year, had not dropped a shot all week on the challenging TPC Sawgrass course but came unstuck at the fifth hole Sunday where he carded his first bogey. The 20-year-old Texan then dropped two further shots on the eighth and the tenth and appeared to grow frustrated as the day wore on, falling away to finish in a tie for fourth with England's Justin Rose. Furyk was coolness personified by comparison, shooting six birdies in a round of 66 to move into second place give himself a chance at 12-under-par as Kaymer headed back out onto the course. Alas, it was not to be as Kaymer held his nerve to take the TCP glass trophy and $1.8 million first prize. Spieth's disappointing final round meant Spain's Sergio Garcia was able to sneak into third position with a birdie at the last. Elsewhere, Adam Scott failed to overtake Tiger Woods atop the world rankings after a final round of 73 ensured he finished outside the top 30. The Australian required at least a top 16 finish to become world No. 1 this week but will now likely claim the top spot next week without playing due to the way the rankings are calculated.","Martin Kaymer wins at TCP Sawgrass after dramatic final days play .

"London (CNN) -- For the second year in row, Apple has topped Google as the world's most valuable brand. The two are the only brands to be valued at more than $100 billion, according to the annual Best Global Brands report. The ranking, compiled by Interbrand consultancy, considers three main criteria. Besides the financial performance of branded products, it also looks at how the brand influences customer choice, and whether it can push up the price of a product. Valued at $118.9 billion, Apple increased its value by 21% year-on-year, while Google's brand value of $107.43 billion jumped 15% compared to last year. ""Apple and Google's meteoric rise to more than $100 billion is truly a testament to the power of brand building,"" according to Jez Frampton, Interbrand's CEO. Tech companies are heavily represented in the ranking with IBM (4), Microsoft (5) and Samsung (8) in the top 10. The ranking is also a good news for the car industry, as four automobile companies -- Toyota (8), Mercedes-Benz (10), BMW (11), and Honda (20) -- all made in into the top 20. Three other carmakers were among the top rising brands. Audi's brand value increased 27%, while Volkswagen and Nissan both saw a boost of 23%. But Facebook was the ranking's top riser, gaining 86% in brand value and jumping 33 spots to number 29. Facebook has grown again last year, with the number of monthly active users at 1.32 billion, up 14% year-over-year. It's $2.91 billion revenues in second quarter smashed expectations, growing 61% compared to last year. Among the ranking's newbies are DHL (81), Land Rover (91), FedEx (92), Hugo Boss (97), and Huawei (94). By joining the elite club, the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei became the first company to represent China in the ranking. The third largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, behind Samsung and Apple, reported a 34.4% net profit increase to $3.38 billion in 2013.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- There is a long and growing laundry list in recent months of China butting heads with the rest of the world and, analysts say, the rest of the world had better get used to it. Beijing barely flinched when Google threatened to leave China, claiming to have been the victim of cyber attacks. Additionally, the government here doesn't seem troubled by being the lone holdout blocking U.N. sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program -- China has the political muscle that comes with a booming economy and a political leadership which appears to be very self-assured. ""Well, China is certainly very self-confident,"" said Jonathan Fenby with Trusted Sources, a research group which specializes in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) economies. ""China suffered from the world downturn... but it's pulled itself out of that... and the Chinese are feeling pretty good and pretty sure of themselves,"" Fenby said. ""It's a bit like, say, Britain at the height of the Victorian era or perhaps the United States after the Second World War ... they feel they're on a roll. Many analysts seem to point to the November visit here by U.S. President Barack Obama as some sort of turning point: despite two days of meetings with the highest levels of the Chinese government, Obama walked away with very little. One of the big issues for the U.S. is China's currency -- considered undervalued by 20 to 40 percent, giving Chinese exporters a competitive edge. The currency issue has also been raised by the Europeans and the International Monetary Fund -- and the Chinese government has stared them all down, declaring the currency a sovereign issue. ""In the past, China could say, for instance of its exchange rate: that is a sovereign issue, that's something only we can decide, it only affects us. But today that's much more difficult of an argument to make, because China's decisions affect the rest of the world and everyone else in the world has an opinion about what China should be doing,"" said Patrick Chovanec from Tsinghua University. Obama's visit to China was followed by December's U.N. Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen, seen by many as a disappointment. China came under criticism for the summit's failures, especially from Britain. It was the British again who were involved in a very open diplomatic spat with the Chinese a few days later, when Beijing executed British citizen Akmal Shaikh; his family claimed he was bipolar and tricked into being a drug mule, while the Chinese said he was smuggler and executed after being caught with about four kilograms of heroin, despite a direct appeal from the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. ""I don't think that China's relations with the rest of the world suddenly turned ugly,"" Chovanec said. ""Any time you have a rise of a new power, this is going to upset the existing balance of things, there is going to be a big adjustment."" Get ready for a few difficult months ahead when the U.S. delivers the latest Patriot missiles to Taiwan, and the Dalai Lama makes his first official visit to the Obama White House. And from an economic point of view, sometime this year, China may overtake Japan to be the world's second biggest economy and looks set to continue to boom. ""I think there is a real difficulty here for the West,"" said Jonathan Fenby. ""One feels the United States hasn't really worked out what its China policy is.""","Analysts say China is increasingly influential in global affairs .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court is set to decide whether to take the same-sex marriage cases on September 29, a mere 15 months since they overturned the Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional. That decision has created a deluge of cases, all of which (save one in Louisiana) have found that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional. The pace at which this country has addressed marriage equality has been breathtaking. It was only 10 years ago that Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriage. It makes some wonder -- is this happening too quickly? The Supreme Court eventually will decide the issue, and likely the future of marriage equality rests squarely on the shoulders of one man -- Justice Anthony Kennedy. He will be the deciding vote, so he needs to feel comfortable taking the next step. Commentators have suggested that there is hesitancy at the Court on the part of Justice Kennedy and possibly Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The concern is not with same-sex marriage, though. It is the long shadow of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's 1973 decision that found state bans on abortion unconstitutional. Because of the social upheaval following Roe, the justices may fear a similar backlash if they move too quickly on marriage equality. Fortunately, the public's view of same-sex marriage has kept pace with legal advances for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. A May 2014 Gallup poll shows that 55% of Americans support same-sex marriage, up from 42% a mere 10 years ago. For those 18 to 29, support sky rockets to 78%, showing the generational nature of this issue. Moreover, 19 states and the District of Columbia now allow same-sex marriage. Even if there wasn't clear support, the issues in marriage equality differ significantly from those in the abortion debate. With marriage, the answer is binary -- either same-sex couples can marry or they can't. Legislatures have very few policy levers available to undermine marriage rights. This contrasts sharply with the complicated legal issues surrounding abortion. As even Roe itself noted, there are a number of competing interests involved: ""We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman ... and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life."" Abortion is a medical procedure, which means the state has an interest in its regulation. Each of these concerns provides legislatures opposed to a woman's right to choose with a potential lever to attempt to inject the state's interest, leading to various legal battles over the constitutionality of such efforts. Same-sex marriage does not present these complications. Even if society has yet to achieve a certain level of acceptance of same-sex marriage (although it appears it has), there is little risk of ongoing social battles over marriage. Indeed, the justifications for banning same-sex marriages are groundless. The Supreme Court has made it clear that religious-based objections cannot justify such discrimination against LGBT persons. Legislation that discriminates against certain groups only because the majority disfavors them, for religious or even secular reasons, are not legitimate. Moreover, the argument that allowing same-sex marriage undermines efforts to channel procreation into marriage is nonsensical. We allow infertile couples to marry, so procreation cannot be a necessary requirement for marriages. Even if such ""channeling"" is a legitimate interest, it would only support the creation of opposite-sex marriage, not a ban on same-sex marriage. No state has advanced a reason why same-sex marriage bans would have any impact on the procreation of straight persons. As Judge Richard Posner on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit explained (with great rhetorical flourish): ""Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure."" The ""shotgun wedding"" defense of same-sex marriage bans is meritless. Same-sex marriage doesn't undermine marriage. Instead, it serves to enhance and confirm the importance of marriage in today's society. Thousands of gay couples are fighting for the right to enter an institution that has been waning within the heterosexual community, with divorce on the rise and couples choosing to cohabitate instead of getting married. Those in favor of marriage should be happy that gays and lesbians are fighting for inclusion, breathing fresh life into marriage's faltering lungs.

"(EW.com) -- Our wait for details on the Magic Mike sequel set to hit theaters in July 2015 is over, ladies and (gay) gentlemen. Thanks to GQ's July 2014 cover story on Channing Tatum (read it here in its entirety) we now know the plot will revolve around our favorite male exotic dancers going to a strippers' convention. According to GQ, that's the first memory of his stripper days Tatum shared with his producing partner Reid Carolin when pitching the first film: ""I want to do the story of when I'm in a dark U-Haul with a bunch of these guys and we're doing drugs driving up to the stripper convention."" Magic Mike director Steven Soderbergh told them the idea wasn't a scene in the movie -- it was a movie in itself. So the sequel will now be inspired by two conventions Tatum attended when he was 19. ""The women would come from miles and miles around,"" Tatum says, recalling one audience numbering 3,000. ""Then you lock the doors and you say all bets are off. It gets zany and crazy, and it's a wild ride. It's an incubator for insanity. It doesn't matter almost what you do onstage. I don't want to put anything in black and white on a page, but if you've been to one, you know how crazy it gets, and now pour kerosene on that. You've seen 'Magic Mike' -- now multiply that. Mob mentality. It's just exponentially crazier. I thought it was absolutely insane."" The article also reveals that while Soderbergh's producing partner Greg Jacobs will direct the ""on-the-road adventure,"" the retired director will still be the director of photography and camera operator, as well as the film editor. ""I want to be a part of it. I want to be in the band, but I just don't want to be the frontman this time,"" Soderbergh says. EW: 'Magic Mike XXL' set to take it off in theaters July 2015 . First thought: Imagine 3,000 extras. They should encourage women to bring their own singles and whatever money the cast earns goes to a charity of Tatum's choice. Second thought: This plot seems to remedy the three tiny complaints about the first film — that we didn't get to know the other strippers well (looking at you, Big D**k Richie and whatever Matt Bomer's character was named), that there wasn't enough dancing, and that Tatum's love interest was wooden (presumably all significant others stay at home). Below are other fun tidbits from the GQ cover story, which again, is worth reading in its entirety: . • There's a reason Chan (or Chanimal, to his mother) was believable in ""She's the Man:"" ""Soccer was the first sport that my parents put me in, and ultimately all the parents kind of came over to my mom and were, 'We think Channing would be better at football.... We love him, he's really great, but he's kind of hurting our children.' I was just a little wild."" • You've seen him reenact the ""Dirty Dancing"" lift with his dog. Well, he can probably do the pottery wheel scene, too: In what is my favorite GQ cover story interview location since Taylor Lautner took a writer to an Olive Garden, Tatum suggested that he and his crutches-bound profiler go to the paint-your-own-pottery store Color Me Mine because he got into sculpting when he was filming ""Haywire"" in Santa Fe and has ""always wanted to paint my own bowls and dishes and s--t."" (If you're dying to know what Tatum painted, jump to the final page of the piece.) • You're going to hear a lot about his claim that he's a ""high-functioning alcoholic"": I've already received an email from one addiction specialist who is ""available for comment."" Perhaps it's a ""cry for help,"" as that person suggests, but if you read the quote in context, you could argue it's hyperbolic. EW: Matthew McConaughey HAS to return for 'Magic Mike' sequel . He likes to sculpt at night, with a bottle of wine or a glass of bourbon. ""I probably drink too much, you know,"" he says. ""My wife, that's what she bought into.... I'm probably a pretty high-functioning, I guess, you know, I would say, alcoholic, I guess."" He likes how it slows down his mind. ""There's probably a tendency to escape. I equate it to creativity, and I definitely equate it to having a good time."" Still, he says, nothing makes you cut back like having a baby, and he'll not drink for four months when they make the Magic Mike sequel. ""Then, at the end of that movie,"" he says, ""it's go time."" • On a lighter note, he and your 5-year-old niece have something in common: ""I just love cake,"" he explains. ""Confetti cake, to be specific. It has little colored candies inside the cake, and then you get the confetti icing, which is really hard to find sometimes.... It's really hard to explain to people, because it's not icing with sprinkles on top. It's icing that actually has candies inside of it. It's Funfetti icing.... The icing, coupled with the actual confetti cake. It's a beautiful mix. It is an angel sent from heaven."" • You'll be left wondering what bet Tatum and Jonah Hill have made about how much ""22 Jump Street"" will earn its opening weekend: Hill has yet to pay up on their bet for the first film's: ""I will kiss your tip! I will kiss the tip of your d— through your underwear if we make $35 million."" See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Taliban insurgents have killed 14 Afghan National Security forces, including two policemen, in northern Afghanistan, government officials said. About 180 Afghan security forces were traveling in a convoy Sunday when more than 200 Taliban fighters attacked them in a very remote part of Sar-e-Pul province, Gov. Abdul Jabar Haqbeen told CNN. The Taliban captured six soldiers, 17 others were injured, and 23 Taliban insurgents were killed in the fighting, Haqbeen said. Also on Sunday, a suicide attack in Wardak province killed 14 people, including nine civilians, a province spokesman said. A car full of explosives blew up near an Afghan National Army vehicle, according to Wardak officials. Two other vehicles with civilians were also destroyed in the blast, and six people were injured, officials said. Drone strikes kill 8 in Afghanistan, Pakistan .

"Delhi (CNN) -- On Sunday, about 100,000 Indian spectators -- including a bevy of India's top celebrities and corporate bigwigs -- will pack into a stadium to watch two teams go at each other with everything they've got. No, it's not cricket. It's not even hockey. It's football and the all-new, swish, Indian Super League. The 10-week tournament features mostly Indian players, but also a number of ""marquee"" European soccer stars, admittedly out of their prime but still huge draws: former Juventus strikers Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet, and former Arsenal attackers Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg. The stated aim of the league is to promote the beautiful game in India, a country of 1.2 billion people that has long languished in football's global rankings --158th in the world on FIFA's latest list. Similar to Major League Soccer (MLS) in the U.S., eight franchise teams from across India will face off against each other twice each before heading to a set of play-offs in December. As a mandatory requirement, each team must consist of 14 Indian domestic players and four local players from the same state. The teams have entered alliances with several high profile European clubs including AtlÃ©tico Madrid, Feyenoord, and Fiorentina. Ljungberg, a member of Arsenal's famous 2004 ""Invincibles"" squad is now the public face for Mumbai City FC. When CNN caught up with him in Mumbai, he said: ""I went to the U.S. to promote the game there, and it worked really well. I want do the same thing here. ""I feel like I can give something back to football,"" says Ljungberg. However, competing with cricket as the numero uno sport will be an uphill challenge. India's cricket craze . India has always been a cricket-crazy nation. While the few football stadiums in the country remain empty, Indians rarely miss an opportunity to see their cricket team play, flocking in the tens of thousands to cheer the ""Men in Blue."" Their team has performed well in recent years, a major highlight being the 2011 World Cup triumph on home soil. The Indian team was also ranked number one in the world at one stage, at both Test cricket and One Day International cricket -- the sport's two most popular versions. The country's cricket governing body, the BCCI, is the richest and most influential in the sport, capitalizing on India's appetite through multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals and broadcasting rights. Indian football, on the other hand, is its indigent cousin. India lacks even basic infrastructure for the sport to grow and prosper. There are only six stadiums that meet the current FIFA guidelines; maintaining them to international standards has been a regular concern. The latest FIFA World Rankings places India at a humbling 158th place, eight down from the previous month. India is set to slip further after losing to Palestine last week. The national team has failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup since 1950 and the last time it tasted success at an international sporting event was more than five decades ago, when it managed to beat South Korea to win the 1962 Asian Games. A football revival? The Indian Super League aspires to become the premier football league in India, providing a platform to unearth domestic talent. The hope is that a cocktail of big corporate money, Bollywood's glitz, and some of Europe's former superstars will help local players further develop their skills, and boost interest. Indian broadcasters are betting on a big response. Sanjay Gupta, the chief operating officer of Star India, told CNN the games will be available on an unprecedented number of platforms. ""We are broadcasting the games in five different languages. Hindi and English is the norm. But for the first time, we're also broadcasting in Bengali, Malayalam, and Kannada."" There are more than 80 million Bengali speakers in India, and more than 30 million each of Malayalam and Kannada. Ljungberg thinks the Super League can transform the sport in India. ""If I can help inspire the kids, then that's the future of Indian football,"" he said. As top European soccer clubs look to capture more fans in Asia, perhaps they will face competition for Indian viewers from an unexpected source: Indian clubs.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is giving people whiplash. In the last month, he has shifted, flip-flopped and pandered so strikingly on a range of positions and statements that it makes you wonder whether he has suddenly developed a deep disregard for his own convictions, or never had any to begin with. At the Urban League's National Convention in Cincinnati in July, Paul expressed support for the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act and talked about the necessity of protecting the rights of minorities. Kudos to him for even showing up, not a usual move for Republicans. But we must hold him accountable for his past statements that private businesses had the right to deny service to anyone they wanted, something the Civil Rights Act specifically forbids. Last year when the Supreme Court struck down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Paul seemed to suggest it wasn't necessary, since we had an ""African-American president."" Just a few days ago, in a flip-flop worthy of the International House of Pancakes, a straight faced Paul denied ever saying the United States should stop sending any military aid to Israel. Does he really think that little of American voters? Let's refresh the senator's memory. In 2011, Paul put forth a budget proposal that would have cut $500 billion from the federal budget and would have ended all foreign aid, including to Israel. He has since engaged in pretzel-like messaging maneuvers trying to rewrite history to fit reality -- one where a Republican candidate perceived as even the slightest bit anti-Israel can kiss any chance of the Republican presidential nomination good-bye. It gets better. Or at least more cringe-worthy. Paul has repeatedly said he is a huge proponent of immigration reform and understands how wrong his party has been on this issue. Frankly, this is one instance on which I have given Paul props for being on the right side of history, the American people and the long-term viability of his party with at least a glimmer of hope and an opening to start a conversation with Latino voters. That hope fizzled recently when first, Paul decided to go campaign for Rep. Steve King of Iowa, the most anti-immigrant/anti-immigration reform member of Congress. Then, in a grand gesture, a profile in courage, Paul could not have fled faster as Erika Andiola, an undocumented ""Dreamer"" confronted King at an event, with Paul sitting right next to him. According to his staff, Paul left so abruptly because he was late for a media interview. Maybe. Or maybe, he didn't have the guts to reconcile his hypocritical pro-immigration reform statements with his support of someone like King. At least King, who stayed and spoke with the young woman, had the courage of his convictions, twisted as they are. Maybe there is something in the water in Iowa. Or something in the voters. Oh, yes, they get to decide presidential nominees. That must explain why Paul, in another rewrite of his record, said he didn't think anyone there wanted to ban birth control. This is a tad bit different from reality. Paul's staff should remind him we can all do Internet searches for what our elected officials have said and done in the past. In 2013, Paul introduced the personhood amendment that would not only have banned abortions but also would have in effect banned many forms of birth control, including some forms of the pill. Paul also supported the Blunt Amendment, which would have given employers an excuse to deny contraceptive health care coverage based on their conscience. When this was defeated in the Senate and the issue made its way to the Supreme Court in the form of the Hobby Lobby case, Paul praised the decision that lets employers deny such coverage on religious grounds. Every one of these flips underscores how the GOP has flopped in gaining traction with key demographics it will need to be competitive in a 2016 general election. This last one underscores how nervous Republicans are that even in the midterms, the ever-growing gender gap might be big enough to deny the ""Republican wave"" the party is dreaming about--and that would include taking over the Senate. As a strategist, I understand Paul's (and his party's) frustration and the need to try to bamboozle the public into thinking he supports something he has denied in the past, and sometimes vice versa. It's very confusing. But as a woman and a Latina, a member of two key constituencies where Republicans desperately need to gain support if they are ever to see the inside of the Oval Office, I am offended. I can read. I can do research. This is not George Orwell's ""1984."" Paul does not get to rewrite history and pretend he is not doing so.","Maria Cardona: Rand Paul has been shifting positions so often, it could give you whiplash .
She says he's talking now about minorities' rights, but previous statements will haunt him .
She says he denies saying U.S. should stop aid to Israel. But he did. Voters can use Internet .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer produced an imperious performance to end Novak Djokovic's 28 match winning streak on Chinese courts and claim a place in the final of the Shanghai Masters tournament Saturday. The Swiss was in a confident, aggressive mood all evening, serving eight aces and firing down 35 winners, on his way to a 6-4 6-4 straight sets victory in just over an hour-and-a-half. Federer will now face the unseeded Giles Simon in Sunday's final after the 29-year-old Frenchman overcame Feliciano Lopez of Spain 6-2 7-6 (7/1) in the day's earlier semifinal matchup. ""I'm not going to come into the match and play terrible,"" Federer said in quotes carried by the ATP website. ""It just won't happen - not in the finals, not against Simon. That's the confidence I have right now."" ""There was nothing in the game today that wasn't working. I think it was a high-level match. I'm unbelievably happy with the way it went."" The vanquished Djokovic was humble in defeat and paid tribute to his opponent's ruthlessness. ""I think I did not play too bad,"" said Djokovic, whose impressive China run included Shanghai Masters titles in 2012 and 2013 as well as three straight wins at the China Open in Beijing. ""It's just that he played everything he wanted to play,"" Djokovic added. ""He played the perfect match ...an amazing match."" Federer's passage to the Shanghai final coupled with Rafael Nadal's early exit means he is now guaranteed to return to No.2 in the ATP world rankings on Monday no matter the outcome of Sunday's match. Simon last reached the final of a Masters tournament six years ago and has dropped as low as 44th in the world this year but could rise to as high as 15th if he defeats Federer. ""I just know that I can do it,"" Simon told reporters after defeating Lopez. ""When I'm playing good, I can play at (Federer's) level."" ""The question is whether I will be able to do it tomorrow."" The race to London . Andy Murray and David Ferrer have both announced they will take on an extra tournament next week in a bid to qualify for November's ATP World Tour Finals in London. Only the top eight ranked players qualify for the season-concluding event with a potential $2 million prize pot. Ferrer is currently ranked ninth while Murray is two places adrift in eleventh. Both players have registered to take part in the Vienna Open which begins Tuesday and will also appear at tournaments in Valencia and Paris later in October. Only three players, Djokovic, Federer and Nadal, have the rankings points to guarantee their participation in London. Others with a shot of appearing in the British capital include Milos Raonic, Kei Nishikori, Tomas Berdych, Stan Wawrinka and Grigor Dimitrov.","Roger Federer defeats Novak Djokovic in Shanghai Masters semifinal .

"Washington (CNN) -- Members of Congress returned to Washington on Monday from a five-week summer break. And they already can't wait to go back home. Despite frightening international developments drawing the United States into a major military fight against the terrorist group ISIS and several unresolved policy disputes on things like immigration, members of the House and Senate come back to the Capitol with one thing in mind: Do the bare minimum and get back on the campaign trail. At the top of the must-do list: passing a government funding bill and avoiding another government shutdown. Federal agencies run out of money at the end of September and the House could vote as early as this week on a ""CR,"" or continuing resolution, that keeps current funding levels through mid-December. Congressional Republicans, confident they will regain control of the Senate, want to pass the spending bill quickly and without drama. Privately, some Democrats relish the idea of more brinkmanship on the issue because of the political damage a shutdown inflicted on Republicans last fall. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is in a tight re-election battle, told CNN's Dana Bash recently he would not allow a shutdown to occur. ""I did rule it out. I'm the guy who gets us out of shutdowns,"" he said. ""That's a failed policy."" Leaders may decide to tack on a short-term extension of the Export-Import Bank, the credit agency that gives loans to companies to promote U.S. exports. The bank's credit authority expires at the end of the month, but many conservatives oppose renewing it, arguing the institution is another example of government doing what the private sector should do. GPS: Why the Export-Import Bank matters . Another key item in front of Congress: whether to vote on authorizing military action against ISIS. After demanding a plan from President Barack Obama on how he will respond to the terrorist threat, top congressional leaders will head to the White House on Tuesday to hear from the President before he outlines his strategy in a national address on Wednesday. Administration officials have been summoned for a series of hearings on the Hill, but it's an open question whether there will be an actual vote to grant the President new war authority or provide additional money to arm Syrian rebels. Obama: U.S. to 'go on some offense' in ISIS fight . Asked on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" over the weekend, the President signaled that he may not think he any needs sign-off from Capitol Hill. ""I'm confident that I've got the authorization that I need to protect the American people,"" Obama said. But some on Capitol Hill said it's up to the Congress, not the President, to give the go-ahead for military action. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, said ""formal congressional authorization is required by the Constitution and would force the President to commit a clearly defined strategy to protect our national security."" CNN Poll: Most Americans alarmed by ISIS . Senior aides from both political parties said it's hard to gauge whether a new authorization could pass until they see the administration's plans. Already, a number of proposals are being pushed by bipartisan lawmakers, ranging from a narrowly tailored bill that would authorize airstrikes against ISIS in Syria to broader legislation that would give the President congressional approval to go after terrorists around the world. The House is scheduled to be in session for just a dozen more days before the November election, but if the continuing resolution clears both chambers without any problems, it's likely that Congress will head home for the final campaign stretch earlier than planned. The brief fall, pre-campaign session will be more about political messaging than legislating. The GOP-led House will roll up a laundry list of previously approved jobs bills into one major economic measure, pass it and send it to the Democratic-led Senate. It will also vote on a nonbinding resolution condemning the Obama administration for not consulting Congress earlier this year when it traded five Taliban prisoners for the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive in Afghanistan. Republicans continue to believe complaints about Obamacare resonate with voters, so the House is scheduled to vote this week on a bill proposed by Louisiana GOP Rep Bill Cassidy that would allow those who like their current health care plans to keep them. Cassidy is running for Senate against one of the most endangered red state Democrats, Sen. Mary Landrieu. Any action on the politically tricky issue of immigration reform will be punted until November's lame duck session. Obama announced over the weekend that he is delaying any executive action to curb deportations of undocumented workers until after the midterms, a move House Speaker John Boehner said ""smacks of raw politics."" But the President is expected to announce a new policy before the end of the year and congressional Republicans will certainly fight back and try to block it. In the Senate, the first noteworthy vote of the shortened session won't have anything to do with keeping the government funded or defeating ISIS. Instead, the Monday evening vote will be on whether to take up a Democratic-authored constitutional amendment to allow the states and federal government to regulate campaign financing. Most Republicans oppose the approach but may vote to take it up nonetheless if for no other reason than to shrink the window into which Democrats can propose other measures Republicans consider political show votes. The constitutional amendment has virtually no chance of getting through the GOP-controlled House, not to mention ratification by three-quarters of the states as would be required. It is sponsored by several Democrats up for re-election and has been championed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who routinely blasts the billionaire Koch brothers for spending millions to help Republicans win control of the chamber this fall. With the Senate set to leave town September 23 -- after just 12 work days -- Reid warned before the August break senators might be forced to work weekends in September to complete their business. According to aides, that heavy workload may include bills to boost the minimum wage, reform the federal student loan programs, and other Democratic priorities. Republicans oppose those bills and bristle at Democrats for clogging the calendar with measures designed to rally the liberal base and boost Democratic candidates, not actually pass laws.","At the top of the list, passing a funding bill to avoid another government shutdown .
Congress will also hear from President Obama on his plan to combat ISIS .
Little else is expected to be done with midterm elections less than two months away ."
"(CNN) -- A new report said that ""Super Mario Brothers"" was a favorite video game of Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza. He had no history of violent behavior. But he was interested in mass murderers. Nearly a year since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School where Lanza killed 26 people, Connecticut's state attorney office released its official report that tried to piece together what happened. The investigation provided some insights into the life and actions of the gunman, but his motive remains a mystery. The report suggests that improving the delivery of mental health care to those with chronic mental illness may be an important element in reducing certain acts of violence, and that mass shooters are not ""enthralled"" with violent video games. Lanza was a young man with clear mental health issues. He appears to have been isolated, even communicating with his mother mainly through e-mail despite their living in the same house. It seems he had some obsessive-compulsive qualities related to food preferences, dislike of loud noises or being touched, and a disdain for holidays and birthdays. Lanza's issues with social communication and problems with crowds worsened in later years. He was also diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. The report notes he declined to take any medications or participate in behavioral therapy. However, it makes no mention of him being aggressive or violent before the shooting. The report does suggest he had an interest in things related to death and mass shootings. Lanza had a spreadsheet of mass murderers. He also had literature related to pedophilia -- but no child pornography. From all of this information it's hard to draw any conclusion. But it's fair to say that chronic mental health issues are common among mass shooters, including Lanza. On the other hand, it's important to note that most individuals with chronic mental illness are not violent. Nor is Asperger's syndrome linked to violence. The tragedy at Sandy Hook may represent a missed opportunity to have a frank discussion about our inadequate mental health system. Other than a few nods to the issue we didn't have that discussion. Mainly, we talked about gun control and video games. This is too bad. While it's certainly true that most mentally ill people are nonviolent, research also suggests that chronic mental health issues such as psychosis or depression are risk factors for violence, particularly when mixed with chronic anger. We must do more to take away the stigma associated with mental illness. Yet pretending no relationship exists between mental health issues and some acts of violence may backfire by reducing our sense of urgency in improving the mental health care system. As for the issue of video games, the Sandy Hook shooting set off a year's worth of speculation about the harm violent video games may or may not do and whether they are a threat to society. The report, in the end, had relatively little to say about video games and did not link them to the shooting. For example, much like any 20-year-old, Lanza played an assortment of both violent and nonviolent games. But it turns out that he was fond of games that were nonviolent, particularly ""Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Dance Dance Revolution."" Despite speculation and efforts by some politicians such as Sen. Jay Rockefeller and Rep. Frank Wolf to tie mass shootings to violent video games, Lanza's video game playing was unremarkable. Once again we are reminded of our society's eagerness to assign blame quickly even if evidence suggests otherwise. For example, the youth violence rate has actually declined by nearly 90% during the video game era. That statistic is one reason why policymakers should not rush forward with regulations before we get the full picture. In the end, we may simply never know why Lanza did what he did other than that he was a disturbed, angry young man who made the choice to do something horrible. Perhaps it is time to stop looking for external explanations for his behavior and acknowledge that this catastrophic choice was his and his alone. As we approach the one-year anniversary of the shooting, our thoughts and prayers will be going out to the families of the victims of Sandy Hook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher J. Ferguson.","Connecticut has released official report on the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary .

"(CNN) -- It's tight at the top after day two of the PGA Championship at Wentworth, England, with overnight pace-setter Thomas Bjorn tied for the lead at 10-under-par with Ireland's Shane Lowry. The Dane scored eight birdies and an eagle on Thursday to card a course record 62 but a level-par round on a soggy Friday allowed Lowry to draw level atop the leaderboard. It could have been worse for Bjorn, who dropped two shots on the front nine as the rain lashed down before recovering with two birdies on 15 and 18. ""Those were tough conditions for everybody out there today,"" the 43 year old Dane told European Tour website upon returning to the clubhouse. ""Especially on the front nine it was extremely difficult to get into a rhythm. ""We played those first four holes in I don't know how long, and we had a couple of rulings in front of us. It was just impossible to find a good rhythm and Retief (Goosen) left us with a back injury after five holes, so we got caught in a two-ball. ""It just seems like all day we were waiting and waiting for a long time on a lot of these shots. It was a tough ask today so I was pretty pleased with the way I finished the round."" World number 142 Lowry took advantage of Bjorn's difficulties with a 2-under-par round of 70 to draw level with the Dane. ""I was good out there today,"" Lowry told reporters upon completing his round, ""I was mentally there and really enjoyed it."" ""It was tough for the front nine with the rain and stuff but it was a nice back nine and I managed to take advantage of it."" The lowest round of the day was a five-under-par carded by Luke Donald, moving the Englishman into a tie for third place with Spain's Rafa Cabrera-Bello. The Englishman told reporters he planned to treat himself to a Friday night curry to celebrate drawing himself back into contention. Another man pleased with his second round showing after a tough week was world No. 10, Rory McIlroy. The Northern Irishman split from his fiance, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, earlier in the week, but registered a one-under par round after recovering from an awful 38-shot (three-over-par) front nine to join Sweden's Henrik Stenson and Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti in a tie for fifth at five-under-par. Stenson could replace Adam Scott atop the world rankings this weekend this if he scores a significantly higher finish at Wentworth than Scott does at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at the Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth Texas. Scott battled back from a poor opening round and nervy front nine on day two to make the Colonial cut at one-under-par. The Australian is six shots behind leader Brice Garnett, however, who leads the way on seven-under-par. Chris Stroud and Rober Streb are a shot behind Garnett in a tie for second going into the weekend while Bo van Pelt, Dustin Johnson, Aaron Baddeley, Chad Campbell, Jimmy Walker, Tim Clark and Brian Davis are all tied for fourth on five-under-par.","Thomas Bjorn and Shane Lowry tied for lead at PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- American teenager Lexi Thompson has sealed her first major victory at the Kraft Nabisco Championship in California. The 19-year-old shot a four-under-par 68 in the final round at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage to win by three shots from compatriot Michelle Wie. Thompson had been tied with Wie on 10 under after Saturday's third round and got off to the perfect start on Sunday with a birdie at the par-four first hole before picking up three more shots on the front nine. Wie kept pace for a time, drawing level with a birdie at the second, but a bogey at the next hole would set the tone for a mixed round of 71 following a flawless round of 68 on Saturday. Thompson, meanwhile, was faultless and nerveless down the final stretch scoring nine consecutive pars to cruise to victory. ""Well, it was an amazing day,"" said Thompson, who picks up a winner's check of $300,000. ""Starting off with a birdie definitely helped. But just hitting that first tee shot obviously a little nervous, but it was definitely what I've been practicing for, what I live for, to play under that pressure and to get a major win under my belt, especially the Kraft Nabisco. It's such a huge honor to win this tournament,"" she added. Wie, 24, who is still seeking a first major title, was full of praise for her playing partner on Sunday. ""(Lexi) played amazing today,"" Wie said. ""She played probably the best I've ever seen her play. She hit the ball so well. She made everything. It was just hard to catch up to her all day today, but I'm really happy for her. I'm really proud of her."" America's Stacy Lewis finished seven shots behind in third with compatriot Cristie Kerr finishing in a tie for fourth with Korea's Se Ri Pak. Thompson's victory cements her place as one of the finest young female players in the game. In 2007, at the age of 12, Thompson became the youngest player to qualify for the U.S. Women's Open and in 2011 became the youngest winner on the LPGA Tour winning the Navistar LPGA Classic aged 16 years, seven months and eight days. The Florida native confirmed her growing reputation with two more Tour wins last year ,winning the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia and the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Mexico. At 19 years, one month and 27 days, Thompson becomes the second youngest winner of a women's major after compatriot Morgan Pressel (18 years, 10 months and nine days) won the same tournament back in 2007. The U.S. Women's Open will take place at Pinehurst in June.

"(CNN) -- Critics say that President Barack Obama's foreign policy is ""feckless,"" ""mushy"" or ""too cautious"" and above all, that it lacks a clear overarching doctrine. But Obama's foreign policy is very clear insofar as it clearly reflects the unclear role of America at a time of national and global transition and is responsive to this moment in history. Call it the ""Transition Doctrine."" Whether one agrees with his decisions or not, it's ridiculous to suggest the President is a weak leader. Just ask Osama bin Laden. Or consider that Obama is bombing ISIS, pressing Iraq to fix its broken government, working with NATO to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down and making real progress in curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. And then there are the drone strikes, including one that killed the leader of the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Feckless? Hardly. The criticisms aimed at the President reveal more about those doing the criticizing, most of whom have never met a war they didn't like and have been so wrong so often on foreign policy it's shocking they're still deemed remotely credible at all (ahem, Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham). America tried ""Cowboy Adventurism"" as a foreign policy strategy. We didn't like it. We're not trying it again. No matter how much Dick Cheney goads us. Even though the actions of ISIS are atrocious, and public support for military action has increased, most Americans are reluctant to rush into war and repeat the mistakes of the previous Republican leadership. For instance, even though fear of a terrorist attack has increased, according to a recent CNN/ORC International poll, six in 10 American voters still oppose sending ground troops to fight ISIS. Obama is echoing America's fatigue with the hawkish aggressions of the past by insisting he will not use ground troops. Yet to characterize Obama's foreign policy strategy as merely a reaction to Bush-era truculence misses something else -- that the very nature of the world, and America's role within it, is changing. Of course, Obama's foreign policy could use more clarity -- because the world could use more clarity. Whether bombing ISIS is the right strategy or not (and I think it's not), Republicans who support military action relentlessly dinged the President for not acting -- and then dinged him for not acting sooner. That sort of political point-scoring overlooks the complexity of the situation. The entire region has been changed not only by the American war in Iraq but also by the Arab Spring, which has altered the local geopolitics. Amid the civil war in Syria and the volatility of Iraq, the brutal ISIS found a way to wreak havoc. No responsible military analysts believe the solution to ISIS is simple. Bullheaded clarity in the face of such complexity would be naive. In a 1999 essay for Foreign Policy, Samuel Huntington described the early contours of global power that prevailed in the post-Cold War era. Huntington wrote that international politics was a ""uni-multipolar system with one superpower and several major powers"" and that the ""settlement of key international issues requires action by the single superpower but always with some combination of other major states; the single superpower can, however, veto action on key issues by combinations of other states."" That was then. Today, the power of the United States has contracted, in part because our economic supremacy has been undermined by domestic challenges as well as by the rise of other global powers. There is less appetite for military spending abroad after George W. Bush's expensive adventures. Obama is not the only one who's unambitious in flexing America's muscles or preferring to settle for singles and doubles in the game of global influence. His sentiment reflects the sentiment of American voters who are responding to the changing terrain of international politics. As our footprint of power around the globe is reduced, the practical expectations for stomping that foot -- let alone singularly squashing any enemies with it -- are also reduced. A true multipolar world, where not just one country leads and dominates but many countries lead, has never quite existed in our modern time. It's no wonder we can't yet realize our role within it. We're watching the President of the United States in real time leading our country and grappling with the future -- it's a process that, just like change itself, is neither clean nor tidy. It will take time to find our new formula for balancing force and restraint, diplomacy and aggression -- between being a superpower versus not being the world's police force. Those calling for the aggressive, big military, pro-intervention-no-matter-what policies not only ignore how that failed us in the past but also that the past is no longer our present. The ""Transition Doctrine"" is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the world as it is today and the necessity for a new, responsible and effective American posture for the future.","Sally Kohn: Critics say President Obama's foreign policy is too cautious or lacks clarity .

"(CNN) -- Through time the art and architecture of the Islamic world has defined a civilization that once extended from Cordoba in Spain to the Mogul empire in China and India. Today a new cultural landmark in Qatar brings together 14 centuries of that history under one roof at the Doha Museum of Islamic Art. Designed by architect I.M. Pei, best known for his glass pyramids at Paris' Louvre museum, the stunning building houses 3,800 square meters of treasures, spanning three continents. From intricate metal work and calligraphy to ceramics, textiles and precious stones, the collection represents the feverish efforts of the Qatari royal family to assemble an unrivalled collection of Islamic antiquities over the past few years. ""One of the enormous achievements is to have built up such a collection of such enormous historic and aesthetic importance in such a short space of time,"" Museum Director Oliver Watson told CNN. Treasure trove of antiquities . Among the standout pieces in the museum's collection are the earliest surviving pages of the Koran, dating from the late 7th century, the earliest surviving silk carpet from Iran and a 9th century Iraqi porcelain bowl. Such objects bore enormous influence on the Islamic world and beyond. For example, Iraqi pottery such as the museum's white glazed bowl with blue calligraphy was copied by the Chinese, eventually becoming the largest ceramics industry in the world. ""The interesting thing is not only that the Islamic world had trade connections out to China, but that this kind of ware, that wasn't used in China [at the time] was commissioned. These were works that were commissioned by merchants in Basra to be made in central China,"" Watson explained. The Chinese ""took the blue color from the Middle East, and the Middle East was the first major customers for Chinese blue and white [porcelain]."" In a nearby gallery rests the jade pendant of Shah Jahan. The Mogul Emperor wore it as a necklace in the 17th century to calm the despair in his heart after his wife died during childbirth. Shah Jahan is perhaps better known for the mausoleum he built to his wife -- the Taj Mahal in India. ""There is the whole history of a whole culture, a whole civilization embedded in these objects, and we are just beginning to explore that,"" said Watson. Modern architectural icon . The Doha museum opened in 2008 with extravagant celebrations. In a region known for its glass and steel towers, this structure stands out as a modern icon paying homage to ancient traditions. ""This building is very special to me, simply because it helped me to learn something about another world, another religion, another culture,"" said Pei at one of the opening events. The building's design combines minimalism, cubism and the arabesque. It has wide open spaces, geometric patterns typical of Islamic art, octagons, circles, domes and cubes. Pei found his inspiration for the design in the courtyard of Cairo's Ibn Tulun mosque, specifically the 13th century ablution fountain in the center, the sabil.","Doha Museum houses antiquities spanning 14 centuries and three continents .

"(CNN) -- With warm weather under way, there's no better time to update your living quarters. But how do you turn your home into a space that reflects your personality? Interior design expert Erin Gates, founder and editor of popular lifestyle blog ""Elements of Style,"" recommends looking in your wardrobe closet for inspiration. Whether she's decorating a sailboat in San Francisco or a studio apartment in Boston, Gates looks for parallels between fashion and popular interiors. ""The trends translate between the two seamlessly,"" Gates says. Overcoming the builder-grade countertops, mass-manufactured lighting, and drab white walls can seem like a challenge, especially if you're on a budget. Where do you start? 1. Shop vintage or rummage through your parents' or grandparents' furniture. With a fresh coat of paint or new upholstery, something you grew up with could fit beautifully into your space and tell a story. 2. Just as fashion is ever-changing, you can keep your home in pace with trends, but be sparing about it. Keep the investment pieces simple -- sofas, beds and dining tables -- and swap out accessories like throw pillows, rugs and lamps to reflect the current trends. Keep your space looking timeless so you won't tire of it in six months. It's much easier to toss a peplum top than a brass chair. 3. To help feel stimulated, make inspiration boards either virtually or from fashion and decor magazine clippings, she suggests. Are you seeing similar colors, patterns, and shapes? This should give you a good idea of what would make you happy in your space. 4. As far as your home goes, gray is still the hottest neutral color, use brass instead of chrome, large-scale photography, blush or light mint green as accent colors and add a potted ficus tree somewhere. Bringing live greenery inside adds so much life. 5. Buy the best you can afford once instead of spending poorly three times. We've all bought something cheap because we didn't want to save up for what we really wanted, and then we end up buying it anyway when the first thing falls apart. You end up spending more than you would have if you just bought what you wanted in the first place.

"(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer stretched his lead at the top of the U.S. Open leaderboard with a second successive round of 65 at Pinehurst No. 2 Friday. The German's combined score of 130 over two days is the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the U.S. Open. The record was previously held by Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy who carded 131 (65 and 66) over the first two rounds as he went on to win the 2011 U.S. Open at the Congressional Country Club's Blue Course in Bethesda, Maryland. ""I played very well,"" former world No. 1 Kaymer told the U.S. Open website upon reaching the clubhouse. ""I had some good rounds in the past as well. But yesterday and today, especially today, the way I worked my way around the course ... I hit some smart shots. ""I didn't play too aggressive and when I had a good number, I went for the flag and I didn't make many mistakes on the greens. I didn't three putt, I made a lot of good putts today and yesterday."" At 10 under par, Kaymer was six shots clear of second-placed American Todd Brendon going into the weekend, as he seeks his second major title. Brandt Snedeker and Kevin Na were a shot behind compatriot Brendon at three-under-par while a group of five players including Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson were tied for fifth on two under. Despite his considerable advantage Kaymer -- who won the U.S. PGA Championship in 2010 and picked up the Players Championship at Sawgrass last month -- refused to look beyond Saturday, where he hopes to maintain his lead. ""It's not a done deal,"" the world No. 28 said. ""The last three, four holes, I got a little bit tired. I didn't swing as good as the first 14 holes."" Kaymer's wariness is perhaps understandable given a poor spell of form suffered over the last 18 months. But current world No. 1 Adam Scott was less convinced by talk of Kaymer's perceived slow finish. ""If he does it for two more days, then we're all playing for second spot,"" the Australian told reporters. Scott was tied for 14th position at level-par but still holds out a slim chance of catching the runaway leader. ""We all know that U.S. Opens get very difficult and if I can just somehow put together two really good rounds, maybe slowly but surely I'll creep my way up towards Martin."" Elsewhere on the course, two bogeys on the final three holes made for a disappointing finish for in-form young American Jordan Spieth, who ended the day at one-under-par, nine off the pace. The 20-year-old, who tied for second at the Masters in April, was equal 10th alongside McIlroy (68), world No. 5 Matt Kuchar (70) and fellow American Chris Kirk (68). Meanwhile, reigning U.S. Open champion Justin Rose shot a carded a 69 to finish the day at one-over-par after a difficult 72 on Thursday. Six-time runner-up Phil Mickelson was tied for 33rd after a 70. Masters champion Bubba Watson shot the same score, but missed the cut by one stroke following his opening 76.

"(CNN) -- Solheim Cup veteran Carin Koch has been given the responsibility of extending Europe's dominance in the prestigious women's golf competition. The 43-year-old Swede was vice-captain last year when Europe beat the U.S. on American soil for the first time. She will lead Europe's women for the 2015 match at St. Leon-Rot in Germany, seeking to clinch an unprecedented third successive victory for the team. It would match the best winning run by the Americans, who managed it from 1994-98 and 2005-09. The Ladies European Tour made the announcement in Frankfurt on Friday, when Koch also revealed that one of her vice-captains will be fellow Swede Annika Sorenstam, a former world No. 1, 10-time major winner and eight-time Solheim Cup representative. Koch played in four straight Solheim Cups between 2000 and 2005, winning 11.5 points out of 16. ""I am extremely delighted and honored to captain the 2015 Solheim Cup team,"" Koch told reporters. ""Being vice-captain to Lotta (Neumann) in 2013, I once again experienced the thrill of the Solheim Cup matches which are unlike any other tournament in professional golf. ""I cannot wait to stand with the team on the first tee next September to start our quest for the hat-trick of wins against the U.S. team. ""I look forward to working with the German team at Golf Club St. Leon-Rot for the next year and a half to put on the best Solheim Cup ever."" Ladies European Tour chief executive officer Ivan Khodabakhsh congratulated Koch on her appointment. ""We are delighted that Carin has accepted the invitation to lead the European Solheim Cup team as she is a fantastic representative of European golf and her passion and experience of the event will transfer to her being an excellent and inspiring captain,"" he said. The Solheim Cup, a three-day equivalent of the men's Ryder Cup, was first staged in 1990.

"(CNN) -- A shootout in a border city that leaves five alleged drug traffickers sprawled dead on the street and seven police wounded. A police chief and his bodyguards gunned down outside his house in another border city. Four bridges into the United States shut down by protesters who want the military out of their towns and who officials say are backed by narcotraffickers. Mexican police carry a body after a clash with gangs that left 21 dead in the state of Chihuahua on February 10. That was Mexico on Tuesday. What is most remarkable is that it was not much different from Monday or Sunday or any day in the past few years. Mexico, a country with a nearly 2,000-mile border with the United States, is undergoing a horrifying wave of violence that some are likening to a civil war. Drug traffickers battle fiercely with each other and Mexican authorities. The homicide rate reached a record level in 2008 and indications are that the carnage could be exceeded this year.  Watch a reporter duck to avoid gunfire » . Every day, newspapers and the airwaves are filled with stories and images of beheadings and other gruesome killings. Wednesday's front page on Mexico City's La Prensa carried a large banner headline that simply said ""Hysteria!"" The entire page was devoted to photos of bloody bodies and grim-faced soldiers. One photo shows a man with two young children walking across a street with an army vehicle in the background, with a soldier standing at a turret machine gun. Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, calls it ""a sickening vertigo into chaos and plunder."" By most accounts, that's not hyperbole. ""The grisly portrait of the violence is unprecedented and horrific,"" said Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. ""I don't think there's any question that Mexico is going through a very rough time. Not only is there violence with the gangs, but the entire population is very scared,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy center. Speaking on a news show a few weeks ago, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it a civil war. Birns agrees. ""Of course it's a civil war, but that only touches the violence of it,"" he said Wednesday. ""It's also a civic conflict, as an increasing number of people look upon the law and democratic values as something that can be violated."" Hakim is not prepared to go that far. ""One has to be careful and not overdo it,"" he said. ""Mexico is a long way from being a failed state. Mexico has real institutions. It paves roads and collects the garbage. It holds regular elections."" Enrique Bravo, an analyst with the Eurasia consulting group, points out that the violence so far is mostly affecting just drug gangs and is primarily localized along the U.S. border and Mexico's western coast. The violence along the border is particularly worrisome, analysts say. ""The spillover into the United States is bound to expand and bound to affect U.S. institutions,"" Birns said. Pastor and Hakim note that the United States helps fuel the violence, not only by providing a ready market for illegal drugs, but also by supplying the vast majority of weapons used by drug gangs. Pastor says there are at least 6,600 U.S. gun shops within 100 miles of the Mexican border and more than 90 percent of weapons in Mexico come from the United States. And it's not just handguns. Drug traffickers used a bazooka in Tuesday's shootout with federal police and army soldiers in Reynosa, Mexico, across the border from McAllen, Texas. ""The drug gangs are better equipped than the army,"" Hakim said. Pervasive corruption among public officials is central to the drug cartels' success. ""There is so much money involved in the drug trade, there is so much fear involved in the drug trade, that no institution can survive unaffected,"" Birns said. ""This has really revealed just how corrupt Mexican officeholders are,"" Hakim said. In one recent instance, Noe Ramirez Mandujano, who was the nation's top anti-drug official from 2006 until August 2008, was arrested on charges that he accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers while in office. Such dire problems call for a new way of looking at the situation, some say. ""The unthinkable is happening,"" Birns said. ""People are beginning to discuss decriminalization and legalization. ... There's only one thing that can be done: Take the profit out of it."" Pastor calls the problem in Mexico ""even worse than Chicago during the Prohibition era"" and said a solution similar to what ended that violence is needed now. ""What worked in the U.S. was not Eliot Ness,"" he said, referring to the federal agent famous for fighting gangsters in 1920s and '30s. ""It was the repeal of Prohibition."" That viewpoint has picked up some high-level support in Latin America. Last week, the former presidents of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in strategy on the war on drugs at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference, in which the 17-member commission's recommendations were presented. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has taken the war on drugs to the cartels and some say it's not working. ""It's as if the burden of being the main arena of the anti-drug war has overwhelmed Mexican institutions,"" Birns said. ""The occasional anti-drug battle is being won, but the war is being lost. And there's no prospect the war is going to be won."" In the meantime, the killings will continue at a record pace. On Wednesday, the Mexican cities of Torreon and Gomez Palacio reported at least eight shootouts involving heavily armed men. The toll: seven dead, seven wounded.","Drug-related conflicts bring waves of violence, death that some liken to a civil war .

Germany's Kaymer, who opened with a joint course record 63 had to settle for a level par 72 on what is traditionally moving day at most tournaments, but the lead duo still kept a three-shot lead over nearest challengers Sergio Garcia of Spain and Australian John Senden. Spieth also made superb par saves on the 14th and 16th and wants to keep his run going on the last day with a $1.8 million prize up for grabs. It would be really cool to play the whole tournament that way and that should be my goal tomorrow, with a . couple more putts falling,"" he said. England's Lee Westwood is another two shots back after a 71 left him on seven-under-par, the same mark as his Ryder Cup colleague Francesco Molinari of Italy, whose 67 was the joint lowest score of the day. Spieth, who eventually had to give best to Bubba Watson at Augusta in the first major of the season, admitted that the defeat still rankles. ""Augusta left me feeling a little hungry,"" he told the official PGA Tour website. He expects to receive the support of the galleries in what Kaymer is comparing to a Ryder Cup style situation, man against man. ""Hopefully we'll get out there and give them something to cheer for,"" Spieth said, ""and try and gain momentum off of the fans who have been so special here."" But 2008 winner Garcia, second last year to the absent Tiger Woods, may well be a factor again and he might have been closer to the leaders but for a three-putt bogey on the famous par-three 17th. Last year he dumped his tee shot into the water to hand the title to Woods and says he has learned from the experience. ""I'm looking forward to the final round.

"(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer built upon his record equaling opening round of 63 at Sawgrass Friday to head the Players Championship at the halfway stage. The German carded a three-under-par second round of 69 to take his overall tournament score to 12-under-par. Kaymer, an early starter on Friday, leads the way from Jordan Spieth in second place at 11-under-par and Russell Henley three shots further back at 8-under par. Jim Furyk, Lee Westwood, Gary Woodland, Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia are all tied for fourth place at six-under-par. ""It was very difficult today, a little bit tougher (than yesterday),"" Kaymer told Sky Sports after reaching the clubhouse. ""When you shoot such a low round your expectations are very."" Kaymer, a former world No. 1, has not won a tournament since November 2011 and struggled throughout 2013. Yet he become only the fourth player in TPC history to shoot a 63 -- the others being Greg Norman, Fred Couples and Roberto Castro. The 29-year-old never come close to replicating this thrilling form on Friday but remained content with a steady showing that featured five birdies and two bogeys. ""69 was a very good score but it was a little bit more tough (today). The pins were in some corners and it was a little bit more windy so I'm pleased."" Kaymer started the day two shots ahead of Henley but will be looking over his shoulder from the start on Saturday after a barnstorming second round from Spieth. The 20-year-old Texan has yet to card a bogey in 36 holes at the famous Sawgrass course and produced a near majestic display again Friday, holing six birdies to secure a second round score of 66. Any of the group at six-under-par, meanwhile, will fancy their chances if they can put an run of form together over the weekend. Elsewhere on the course, former U.S. Masters PGA Championship winner Rory McIlroy just made the cut after a birdie on the last secured a round of 74. The Northern Irishman had been five-under-par after just 11 holes on the opening day before fading badly. One man not so lucky at the 18th, however, was Phil Mickelson.

"(CNN) -- In the heat of battle, it's best to have your key allies closest to you and European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley has certainly done that by naming two close friends as his vice-captains. His decision was eased by knowing that both Sam Torrance and Des Smyth have previously played major roles in leading Europe to victory. The Irishman now hopes they can do the same when the Europeans seek to defend the trophy at Gleneagles in Scotland in September. McGinley's compatriot Smyth was one of Ian Woosnam's vice captains in 2006 when Europe recorded their largest home victory -- by 18½ points to 9½ -- at the K Club in Ireland. Torrance, meanwhile, was an unforgettable skipper as he inspired Europe to a 15½-12½ victory at The Belfry in England in 2002. Neither the Scot nor McGinley will ever forget the success since it was the Irishman himself who sunk the winning putt on his Ryder Cup debut. ""Paul was a special part of my team at The Belfry in 2002 and he knows I will do everything possible to help him and the team at Gleneagles,"" Torrance, 60, said in a statement. ""Everyone knows how much The Ryder Cup has meant to me over my career so I am absolutely delighted to be involved once again."" A veteran of 11 Ryder Cups, Torrance has won the competition three times -- twice as a player and once as a captain. Smyth, 61, is a relative newcomer by comparison, having lost both competitions he contested as a player in 1979 and 1981 prior to the stunning turnaround in fortunes when vice captain eight years ago. However, he does have the advantage of having known McGinley, now 47, since the Irishman was a teenager. ""As well as being good friends, (Smyth and Torrance) are two guys I greatly admire both personally and professionally and I know they will be vital assets to me in Scotland,"" McGinley said. ""They were the first two people I had in mind for this role when I was appointed captain and, since then, I have talked to a lot of the experienced European players about having them as part of the team and, to a man, they have been very supportive of the idea. ""Des took me under his wing when I was a young rookie on Tour and gave me tremendous advice which was not only valuable then but has continued to ring true for me throughout my professional career. ""His views and ideas about The Ryder Cup particularly have consistently proved to be spot on and I really enjoyed working with him as a vice captain in 2006 when I was a player."" McGinley added that he is spoiled for choice when it comes to his other vice captains but he will only name them once he learns who has qualified automatically for the European team in September. Among the possible candidates are Thomas Bjorn of Denmark and Spanish duo Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal, who captained Europe to victory in 2012. ""It's quite clear a lot of potential further vice captains could more than likely qualify for the team,"" said McGinley. ""A lot of them would still like to make the team so I just don't want to distract them by talking about Ryder Cup and so they can focus on making the side.""

Ray Albers, who threatened and pointed an assault rifle at protesters; Dan Page, an officer caught on camera pushing a CNN correspondent before a video surfaced of him ranting about the Supreme Court and Muslims; and Matthew Pappert, an officer fired after making what his chief called ""very ... inappropriate"" Facebook comments about the protests in Ferguson. Albers, a 20-year veteran of the St. Ann, Missouri, police department, resigned Thursday, according to City Administrator Matt Conley. Albers stepped down after the city's board of police commissioners recommended to the board of aldermen that he be fired or resign, St. Ann Police Chief Aaron Jimenez told CNN on Saturday. ""He's one of my best friends but we have to do what's best for the city,"" Jimenez said. ""It doesn't mean he's a bad guy, but he made a mistake after 20 years of solving crimes."" Albers was the officer who pointed a semiautomatic rifle at a Ferguson protester and threatened to kill him on August 19 -- a tense moment caught on video and posted online. A day after the incident, police officials announced that the officer had been ""relieved of duty and suspended indefinitely."" In the video, Albers can be seen walking around with his assault rifle raised, then pointing it in the direction of protesters. ""I'm going to f---ing kill you,"" he says. ""Get back. Get back."" Police said the protester involved in what it deemed ""a verbal exchange"" was ""peaceful."" Another man in the crowd said out loud, ""Did you threaten to kill him?"" When the officer was asked for his name, he responded: ""Go f--- yourself."" Protesters mocked the officer before he was led away by another member of law enforcement. A CNN crew also saw the officer point his weapon at those around him as he cursed, shouted and threatened people by saying he'd kill them unless they stayed away. Jimenez said of Albers: ""He's not doing well, but he's trying to stay positive. He knows over his 20 years, he's done a lot of good work. You do one thing and it can ruin your career. He recognized what he did was wrong. That's his first step in moving on. He feels remorse. He said he was scared and wasn't thinking."" Page, an officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, retired effective August 25, according to St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman. Page was caught on camera pushing CNN's Don Lemon. He was placed on administrative leave after a video surfaced of him ranting about the Supreme Court and Muslims, among other things. He also refers on the video to Barack Obama as ""that illegal alien who claims to be our President."" This week, officials in the city of Glendale, Missouri, confirmed that Pappert was fired after making what his chief called ""very ... inappropriate"" Facebook comments, according to a city official. ""These protesters should be put down like a rabid dog the first night,"" Pappert wrote in one post, according to CNN affiliate KMOV. There were reportedly five inappropriate posts, KMOV said. Pappert, a six-year veteran of the Glendale force, was originally suspended on August 22 after the comments came to light. An inquiry was initiated that day. ""Officer Pappert was dismissed following the conclusion of the investigation,"" City Administrator Jaysen Christensen said. ""Our focus at this point is to move past this, and turn the focus back to healing in ... Ferguson."" Glendale, like Ferguson, is a municipality in St. Louis County. The two suburbs are about 15 miles apart. A week ago, Glendale Police Chief Jeffrey Beaton suspended Pappert and cited what he called the ""inappropriate posts on his personal Facebook page,"" according to the Webster-Kirkwood Times, an online news outlet in the area. Police in the area have come under fire for their heavy-handed response to the Ferguson protests following Brown's death. An attorney for Pappert said his client was sorry for his online comments. ""Officer Pappert is deeply remorseful about what he posted on social media,"" lawyer William Goldstein said. ""We ask for (the) same spirit of forgiveness and the opportunity for redemption.""

"(CNN) -- Luke Donald leads the way with 18 holes to play at the RBC Heritage tournament in South Carolina. The Englishman posted a five-under par 66 in Saturday's third round to finish the day eight-under par overall at the Harbour Town Golf Links. Donald, who is seeking a sixth PGA Tour win, has a two-shot cushion over America's John Huh who posted a second successive round of 68. Erratic progress on the opening nine -- an eagle, two bogeys and two birdies -- was replaced by some more consistent form by Donald on the back nine with birdies coming at the 10th, 11th, 14th and 17th holes. South Africa's Charl Schwartzel is currently tied for third at five under with America's Nicholas Thompson, Ben Martin and Jim Furyk. A total of 65 players returned early on Saturday to complete their second rounds after rain had halted play on Friday with Furyk (66) and Martin (67) tying the lead at five-under with South Korea's K.J. Choi after 36 holes. Both men made steady progress in the third round with even-par rounds but Choi slipped down into a tie for 16th place with a three-over par round of 74. First round joint-leader, Matt Kuchar is tied for seventh on four under following a round of 70 on Saturday. British amateur Matt Fitzpatrick is also in the mix. A third round 69 leaves the 19-year-old on two-under par. Defending champion Graeme McDowell is one shot further back following a disappointing round of 73 on Saturday. Westwood lead cut in Malaysia . Meanwhile at the Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur, Lee Westwood will take a one-shot lead into Sunday's final round. The Briton fired a one-under par 71 in his third round but saw his overnight lead of four strokes cut on Saturday thanks to a fine round of 66 from compatriot Andy Sullivan. The 27-year-old, who is seeking a first European Tour win, finished the day one behind Westwood on 13-under par. France's Julien Quesne is currently third on 10-under after shooting a 69 -- his third consecutive sub-70 round of the week.

"(CNN) -- Heavy rain halted play on the second day of the RBC Heritage in South Carolina on Friday. Players were called off the course at 3pm local time and with little sign of a change in weather proceedings were called for the day just over 90 minutes later. Play is scheduled to resume early Saturday for all 64 players who failed to complete their second round although the rain is not expected to let up overnight. Korea's K.J. Choi ended the day as leader in the clubhouse after scoring a morning round of 67 which leaves him at five-under-par for the tournament. Choi leads Robert Allenby by a stroke, although the Australian has completed just five holes of his second round card. Overnight co-leader Matt Kuchar made double-bogey on holes four and six before play was halted, dropping him down to joint 16th position at one-under-par. Kuchar's first round co-leaders, Scott Langley and William McGirt also fell away at the beginning of Friday's round. Langley, who started the day at five-under-par, dropped all the way to even before recovering to finish the day three-under, where he is now tied for third place with Luke Donald, Billy Hurley III, Bo Van Pelt and Ben Martin. Langley, Donald and Hurley all completed their rounds for the day while Martin and Van Pelt have played through holes four and five respectively. Westwood out in front in Malaysia . On the European tour, meanwhile, Lee Westwood stretched his lead on day two of the Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpor. The Englishman, a former world No. 1, followed up his opening round of 65 with a 66 to end the day four shots clear of European Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts. The Belgian was tied for second with 327th-ranked Antonio Lascuna of the Philippines, who finished 90th in the Kuala Lumpur tournament last year. Elsewhere on the course, a bizarre incident saw Spain's Pablo Larrazabal attacked by giant hornets forcing him to take off his top and jump in a lake to escape the stinging swarm. Remarkably, Larrazabal emerged from the water to birdy the hole he was on when the attack occurred -- the 14th -- then completed his second round in four-under-par 68, which meant he made the halfway cut of the European Tour event.

"(CNN) -- Louis Oosthuizen shot a six-under par round of 64 to claim a share of the lead at the Byron Nelson Championship on Saturday. The South African reached the turn at one under for the day before firing five birdies on the back nine at the TPC Four Seasons Resort in Texas to jump 14 places up the leaderboard. The round leaves the former Open champion tied with America's Brendon Todd on 10-under par with just one round to play. Todd, who fired a 64 in Friday's second round, made more steady progress on Saturday equaling his opening round of 68. One shot back are America's James Hahn, who shot 65, Gary Woodland (66) and Canada's Mike Weir (67). Four players are tied for sixth on eight-under par, with Ireland's Padraig Harrington, Aussie Marc Leishman, Graham DeLaet of Canada and Morgan Hoffmann of the U.S. all well placed to challenge for the $1.242 million first prize. Australian Greg Chalmers and America's Boo Weekley and Charles Howell III are on seven under par. Players Championship winner Martin Kaymer is having a quieter week so far but remains in contention despite a disappointing one-over par 71. The German, who pipped Jim Furyk at Sawgrass last weekend, finished the day in a three-way tie for 15th, five shots off the lead. Read more: Campbell out of U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- Danish veteran Thomas Bjorn carded six straight birdies on the back nine at Wentworth to revive his third round in spectacular fashion and take a five-shot lead into the final round of the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth. Bjorn, who has been at the head of affairs since a 10-under 62 in the first round, was slipping back through the field after dropping three shots in his opening five holes Saturday until he began his incredible run. A birdie on the sixth was the forerunner to his charge from the 11th -- which ended when he missed a three-foot birdie putt on the 17th for seven in a row. He completed his round on the 18th with his seventh birdie in eight holes for a five-under 67. That took him to 15-under 201, with England's two-time champion Luke Donald leading the chasers after a 68. Ireland's Shane Lowery, who led overnight on 10-under with Bjorn, was next best, a further shot back. Former World No.1 Rory McIlroy recovered from a double bogey on his opening hole to card a 69 to be tied fourth on eight-under with Dutchman Joost Luiten (67) but seven shots behind the rampaging Bjorn. ""I would have to shoot ridiculously low tomorrow to have any realistic chance but even then Thomas is so far ahead,"" Northern Ireland's McIlroy told the official European Tour website. The 43-year-old Bjorn has taken a particular liking to the back nine on the West Course, shooting 16-under for this half as against one-over for the front. ""I had a terrible start with some poor decisions but I settled myself down and knew I could play this back nine pretty well. I got the momentum and kept it going,"" he said. ""I'm in a strong position going into tomorrow but the job is not done yet. ""There is a lot of golf to play and I know there are top guys just behind me who can shoot very low as well. So I have to maintain my concentration and form to the end."" Heavy overnight rain delayed the start of the third round by three hours and players were allowed to place their golf balls on the fairways in preferred lies. It is the 60th edition of the prestigious tournament with the last 30 stagings at Wentworth, which is also the headquarters of the European Tour. Meanwhile, in the Colonial tournament on the PGA Tour, David Toms, Chad Campbell, Chris Stroud and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama shared the lead on seven-under after the third round. In a bunched leaderboard, there were 49 players within five shots of the lead, including FedExCup points leader Jimmy Walker (tied for fifth at six-under and world number one Adam Scott of Australia (tied for 11th, two shots back.","Thomas Bjorn leads PGA Championship at Wentworth .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A spending bill that funds the U.S. government for the rest of the budget year passed the Senate on Tuesday despite complaints about nearly $8 billion in what critics called ""pork-barrel"" projects. The Senate passes a bill to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year. Senators voted 62-35 to cut off debate on the $410 billion measure and passed it on a voice vote immediately afterward. The omnibus spending bill includes more than 8,000 congressional ""earmarks,"" which total almost $8 billion. The earmarks have caused critics to question President Obama's pledge to end wasteful spending, but Obama administration officials said the bill is a holdover from the previous Congress. ""It is in America's best interest to close the book on the last administration and let the new one hit the ground running,"" said Sen. Daniel Inouye, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.  See where the money is going » . But Sen. John McCain, a longtime critic of congressional spending and Obama's Republican opponent in the 2008 election, said the vote shows ""business as usual"" remained the order of the day. ""If the president were serious about his pledge for change, he would veto this bill. He won't,"" McCain said. The bill funds the U.S. government through September, when the 2008 budget year ends. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, postponed the vote last week because he wasn't sure supporters had the 60 votes needed to break a potential GOP filibuster. Republican critics, led by House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, have urged Obama to veto the bill because of the earmarks, targeted spending provisions inserted by Democratic and Republican lawmakers. The measure passed the House of Representatives last week. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday called the bill a ""missed opportunity."" ""In the midst of a serious economic downturn, the Senate had a chance to show it can impose the same kind of restraint on itself that millions of Americans are being forced to impose on themselves at the moment. ... If the president is looking for a first bill to veto, this is it,"" he said. McConnell has requested 36 ""solo"" earmarks -- those without cosponsors -- totaling $51 million in the bill, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. The group said five senators have not requested any earmarks: Sens. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma; Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina; Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin; John McCain, R-Arizona; and Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri. Some other senators have not requested any solo earmarks, but they have jointly requested funds with other lawmakers. Lawmakers on Monday night defeated an amendment from McCain that would have stripped the bill of most of its earmarks. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president is planning to unveil new guidelines Wednesday aimed at cutting down on the number of earmarks that make their way into future appropriations bills. Gibbs said Obama may sign the spending bill into law behind closed doors rather than make a public show of it. He said the president will lay out the new guidelines on earmarks as a not-so-subtle threat that he could veto future spending bills that do not comply with his objectives. ""Although it's not perfect, the president will sign the legislation but demonstrate for all involved rules moving forward that he thinks can make this process work a little bit better,"" Gibbs said. Gibbs added that ""over the course of the president's tenure in Washington, dozens of those bills will come to his desk"" and Obama wants to make clear ""that there will be some new rules of the road"" for lawmakers to follow. Top Democrats, including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, have suggested lawmakers do not appreciate being dictated to on an issue that is a Congressional prerogative. Given the sensitivity of the issue with fellow Democrats, senior White House aides were reluctant Tuesday evening to preview any of the new rules the president will lay out for lawmakers. Aides would not specify whether the president would make public remarks about the new guidelines or release a written statement. CNN's Ed Henry, Sandra Endo, Ed Hornick, Kristi Keck and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama will unveil new guidelines Wednesday to cut down on earmarks .

"(CNN) -- Storylines won't be lacking entering the final round of golf's Masters. You have Jordan Spieth, at 20 trying to become the youngest winner at Augusta. Popular Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, 50, could become the oldest champion at the event. Sentimental favorite Thomas Bjorn -- he of the collapse at the British Open more than 10 years ago -- remains in contention and Matt Kuchar, like the other three, wants to bag a maiden major. Oh, and we shouldn't forget Bubba Watson, attempting to win at Augusta for the second time in three years. Those are just a few. Spieth and Watson share the lead at 5-under-par 211, a shot better than Jonas Blixt and Matt Kuchar and two better than Jimenez and Rickie Fowler. Watson had a three-shot advantage after two rounds. Spieth, a Masters rookie like Blixt, has been solid in all three of his rounds rather than spectacular. His 1-under-par 71 on Thursday was followed by a 70 Friday and another 70 Saturday. He mixed four birdies with two bogeys in the third round. ""This is where I wanted to be,"" Spieth told Sky Sports. ""It was a huge goal of mine to put myself in the position to contend at a major championship, and the Masters sticks out in my head as the one tournament to win in my whole life."" ""I'm trying not to think about that, you try to stay level headed on the golf course and so far so good, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else right now. There is still a quarter of the tournament to go but ultimately it would be a dream come true for me. ""I've dreamed of playing here and of winning here so who knows what can happen tomorrow."" Jimenez struggled Friday with a 76 but was 10 shots better off Saturday, thanks in large part to seven birdies. If he was to win Sunday, Jimenez -- soon to be competing on the Champions Tour -- would surpass Jack Nicklaus as the oldest titlist at Augusta. ""If you are 50, it doesn't mean that you cannot play well,"" Jimenez told reporters. ""I'm still moving. I'm still flexible. ""I hit the ball longer than ever. I'm not a long hitter necessarily, just a medium hitter. But I still play my irons, when I want to play a fade or draw, high or low, it still happens. I'm competitive. ""Majors are about patience. Today I was very patient. I have plenty of victories in my career and having a major in my career would be amazing. That would be the flower on top."" Kuchar would have joined Watson and Spieth atop the leaderboard had he not bogeyed the last hole and Bjorn will be ruing three bogeys in his last six holes, although he trails the leaders by merely three shots. Watson couldn't match his sizzling Friday display, when he tallied five straight birdies on the difficult back nine. Instead he endured a shaky start, bogeying four holes on the front nine. He held it together thereafter, dropping another shot only at the 16th as part of his 74. ""I was pumped up, my shots were going further than I was expecting them to, and the greens got firmer, harder and made it difficult,"" Watson told Sky Sports. Defending champion Adam Scott slumped into a tie for 16th following his 76 and was overtaken by, among others, American Gary Woodland. Woodland matched a Masters record by hitting a 30 on the front nine. Three bogeys and a double bogey, though, on the back nine left him five shots behind Spieth and Watson.","Jordan Spieth and fellow American Bubba Watson share the lead at the Masters .

"New York (CNN) -- The unemployed apparel designer who killed a former coworker near the Empire State Building on Friday morning left his Manhattan apartment intending never to return, according to a police source with knowledge of the investigation. The police source told CNN that when Jeffrey Johnson closed his door, he left the keys behind for the landlord before heading off to shoot Steven Ercolino. The landlord was surprised, the source said, because Johnson was scheduled to move out a week later on August 31 in anticipation of apartment renovations. Johnson apparently told the superintendent earlier in the week he had found a new place to live, had placed his cats with friends and that, ""Things would be resolved by Friday."" Empire State shooting victim hit 5 times in head . On that day, Johnson, 58, returned to Hazan Import Corp., the company where he'd been laid off about a year earlier due to downsizing. Police say he waited outside for Ercolino, a 41-year-old sales executive whom he blamed for losing his job. He shot Ercolino five times in the head, according to the New York City medical examiner. Police are searching through files on Johnson's computer found in his apartment, along with several books on shooting such as ""Sniper: The Techniques and Equipment of the Deadly Marksman,"" according to the police source. After the shooting, Johnson quickly walked to Fifth Avenue, trying to hide among large planters. A construction worker was among those who dashed after the gunman after the initial gunshots. He alerted counter-terrorism officers assigned to the Empire State Building. They responded and ordered Johnson to freeze. Instead, he reached into his bag and pulled out his handgun. The police source said, ""Was he trying to escape the police by shooting his way out? Or disregarding his orders? You can't get into his mind."" Two officers fired 16 rounds, hitting Johnson at least seven times. Nine other people were injured -- two after being shot by police, seven from bullets that fragmented. The NYPD uses hollow-point bullets that prevent collateral damage by mushrooming once inside the body. However, a number of the bullets struck the large planters and fragmented -- causing seven of the nine bystander injuries. Two of the wounded remain hospitalized -- a woman reported to be in good condition and a male in fair condition -- according to Evelyn Hernandez, director of media relations at NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation. The two officers were praised by city officials for their quick response and their accuracy in taking down the gunman. As per NYPD procedure, they are on administrative duty -- with guns and badges -- pending the outcome of the investigation by police and the district attorney. Johnson's elderly parents and a sister in Gainesville, Georgia, have not yet claimed his body.

"(CNN) -- Defiant authorities in Ecuador say they won't bow to U.S. pressure as they weigh former NSA contractor Edward Snowden's request for asylum. Ecuador's president and other top officials said Thursday that they're turning down the trade benefits the United States gives them as part of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act. ""In the face of threats, insolence and arrogance of certain U.S. sectors, which have pressured to remove the preferential tariffs because of the Snowden case, Ecuador tells the world we unilaterally and irrevocably renounce the preferential tariffs,"" President Rafael Correa said Thursday, reiterating comments other officials from his government made earlier in the day. In a fiery speech at an event in Quevedo, Ecuador, the president vowed not to back down. ""It is outrageous to try to delegitimize a state for receiving a petition of asylum,"" Correa said. Authorities in Ecuador said they're still evaluating Snowden's asylum petition, which has thrust the South American country into the international spotlight as a key player in the global manhunt for the fugitive who has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the United States, is slammed as a traitor by critics and hailed as a hero by his supporters. Where can you buy a second citizenship? For Correa, a left-leaning economist who is known for decrying what he and other Latin American leaders have called U.S. imperialism, the leaker's case has provided a platform both to espouse his views and to slam his critics. He offered a swift response on social media when a Washington Post editorial this week criticized what the newspaper called a ""double standard"" in Ecuador, noting that the country is weighing asylum for Snowden just after it passed new regulations cracking down on press freedoms. ""What a joke! Do they realize the power of the international press? They have centered the attention on Snowden and the 'evil' countries that 'support' him, making everyone forget the terrible things that he denounced in front of the American people and the entire world,"" Correa said in a series of Twitter posts. But even as government officials ratchet up their rhetoric, some in Ecuador have expressed concerns about the effect souring relations with the United States could have on the country. Ecuador-U.S. relations in the spotlight . The head of Ecuador's chamber of commerce on Thursday criticized the government's decision to withdraw from the trade deal as a ""hostile act"" that was ""irresponsible."" Former Vice President Blasco Penaherrera Padilla, a sharp critic of Correa's government, said it was a decision that would have a ""gravely negative"" impact on his country. ""It creates an unsuitable climate for a profitable, productive and positive relationship, which is what Ecuador and the United States should have,"" he said. Trade between the United States and Ecuador totaled more than $16 billion last year, according to figures from the U.S. Census. About half of Ecuador's foreign trade depends on the United States. Analysts say the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, which has allowed Ecuador to import and export goods with reduced tariffs, has fueled growth in trade and commerce between the two nations. On Thursday, a U.S. State Department spokesman warned that Ecuador's economic ties with the United States could be in jeopardy if the South American country offers asylum to Snowden. ""What would not be a good thing is them granting Mr. Snowden asylum,"" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell told reporters. ""That would have grave difficulties for a bilateral relationship."" He added that withdrawing from trade agreements isn't exactly an option for Ecuador. ""They're unilateral trade provisions that provide a benefit to certain Ecuadorian products,"" Ventrell said. ""Whether they're renewed or not is a prerogative of the U.S. Congress."" Ecuador offers $23 million to the United States . The agreement is set to expire next month. Many believed it wouldn't be renewed, said Vicente Albornoz, dean of economics at the University of the Americas in Quito. That could make Correa's announcement Thursday a wise political move that will bolster his support at home, but cost the country relatively little, Albornoz said. ""He is giving up something that we did not have, because it was evident that the ATPDEA was not going to be renewed,"" Albornoz said. ""It's like if I withdraw from winning the lottery when I haven't bought a ticket, and I announce that I won't accept first prize."" Jorge Leon, an Ecuadorian sociologist, warned that Ecuador's role in the Snowden case could have a chilling effect on investors. ""Ecuador is searching for investors, and this image of going more and more to a radical position on the left does not generate tranquility,"" he said. But the Snowden case and Ecuador's decision last year to grant asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange have helped Correa promote his image as a leftist leader in the region, Leon said. ""They help him gain credibility on the leftist scene,"" Leon said. On Thursday, Ecuadorian officials offered to give $23 million annually -- roughly the same amount officials said that Ecuador receives in benefits from the tariff deal -- to the United States. The money, Communications Secretary Fernando Alvarado told reporters Thursday morning, could be used for human rights training. By Thursday evening, Correa didn't show any sign of changing his government's tune, vowing to make the decision regarding Snowden's asylum request with absolute sovereignty and without regard to any trade deals or other international pressures. ""Our dignity,"" he said, ""doesn't have a price."" CNN's Adriana Hauser, Matthew Chance and Michael Pearson and journalist Andres Lopez contributed to this report.","Ecuador says it's turning down a tariff deal with the U.S. and won't bow to pressure .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Bahraini pro-government medics and state media staffers ""bullied and intimidated"" an Irish delegation of health workers and politicians here to secure the release of more than a dozen Bahraini health workers, said former Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews. The incident occurred as the Irish delegation was completing a two-day fact-finding mission intended to determine the condition and secure the release of more than a dozen doctors and medical staff detained on anti-government charges. But the news conference began to fall apart when 10 to 15 pro-government doctors and reporters for the state-run media approached the Irish delegation demanding to question them about their visit. As the pro-government doctors and reporters circled the Irish health workers in the hotel lobby, officials decided to call off the news conference. ""That's not the sort of treatment we received when we were here,"" Andrews told a reporter afterward. ""It's most unfortunate that we were bullied and intimidated by him and his representatives."" He accused the president of the Bahrain Medical Society, Dr. Nabeel al-Ansari, of provoking the incident. Al-Ansari, who received his medical degrees in the Ukraine and the University of Toronto in Canada, was reappointed chief of emergency medicine at Salmaniya Hospital recently in the wake of the unrest after being sacked from the same post in 2006. Speaking to reporters, al-Ansari said that the delegation was one-sided, despite the fact that its members had met with Bahraini government officials during the visit. ""Did they meet Bahrain medical society??"" he asked on his Twitter account. ""Noooo."" ""We have not come to save Irish doctors,"" Damian McCormack, who led the delegation, told reporters. ""We came to Bahrain to help Bahrainis,"" said the professor of orthopedic surgery at Temple Street Children's Hospital in Dublin. The delegation arrived on the Gulf island with a letter of support from the Irish foreign minister, Eamon Gilmore. They traveled here as part of an effort to determine the condition of the Bahraini health workers, many of whom had trained in Ireland. Since March, 47 Bahraini doctors, nurses, and paramedics have been charged and detained for supporting protesters during this year's pro-reform demonstrations that have swept across Bahrain. Another, a doctor, left the country without having been detained. Fourteen of the health workers remained Thursday in custody. The others were released after their military trials, which began in June. Those released alleged that they had been tortured and forced to make false confessions. The government has responded that it is not involved in torture. An independent, fact-finding mission headed by international experts has been set up to look into the assertions, but it will not be operational until next week. Many of the Bahraini doctors are Shiite. Bahrain's majority Shiite community has long complained of discrimination by the ruling Sunni elite. Bahraini protesters assert that the Sunni majority government discriminates against them in matters relating to their welfare spending, employment and the like. The Shiites make up about two-thirds of Bahrain's population. The authorities here allege that Bahrain's Shiites who participated in the pro-reform protests that began on February 14 have links to Shiites in Iran. The Bahraini Shiites deny that is the case. Last May, a report by Medecins Sans Frontieres, also referred to as Doctors Without Borders, said medical staff in Bahrain had been unfairly targeted by government forces and that wounded protesters were arrested when they arrived at hospitals for treatment. Twenty of the health workers face charges that include weapons possession, the occupation of a public building, and calling for the overthrow of the regime.

"(CNN) -- You might think the Senate was debating a bill about the politically influential Koch brothers over the last two days -- various Democratic senators criticized them more than 20 times on the floor as they decried the influence of money in politics. ""We've witnessed the Koch brothers trying to buy America -- untold millions hoping to get a government that will serve them and make them more money,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday. ""How many individual donations does it take to get the same time to present your case as the Koch brothers' spending, say, $3 million?"" asked Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon. What's at stake in the 2014 midterms? But the debate, which resumed Wednesday, is on a proposed constitutional amendment allowing broader regulation of campaign finance and reversing the Supreme Court's ruling permitting unlimited election spending by businesses. After several years of attacks by various Democrats, allies of the billionaires Charles and David Koch, who had in past years rarely publicly contest critics, are now fighting back against criticism aimed at them. And they're trying to going on offense. Who are the Koch brothers? ""It is imperative we speak out, that I speak out ... to set the record straight,"" Mark Holden, senior vice president and general counsel for Koch Industries, told CNN. The brothers' business is centered on Koch Industries, a major privately held conglomerate of companies producing fuel, paper, chemicals, electronics and fertilizer products. It employs 60,000 people in the U.S. Opinion: The truth about the Koch agenda . Several of the politically active organizations affiliated with the Kochs, such as Freedom Partners, Americans for Prosperity and Generation Opportunity, are major players on the Republican side. These nonprofit groups are controversial because they don't have to disclose the names of their donors or the amounts of their gifts because they are classified as tax-exempt. How much the Kochs themselves have given to them is unknown. It has been estimated these groups, which are some of Republicans' biggest boosters, could spend $290 million on television ads this year. According to a recent study from the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity, a group of six entities linked to the Kochs aired 43,900 TV ads this election cycle -- nearly one out of every 10 spots -- signifying their prominence. Holden said how these groups operate is similar to how more liberal-oriented ones do, highlighting an organization called the Democracy Alliance, which supports major groups in the progressive movement. ""We are not going to back down,"" Holden said. ""I want to make sure people understand the hypocrisy by the Democrats."" ""I respect their rights not to disclose,"" Holden added. ""They are hypocritical. They attack us."" The Democracy Alliance and many of the groups supported by it also don't have to disclose their donors because of how they are organized through the tax code. One difference, however, is the alliance does not directly give money to Democratic-aligned groups it supports, including the Center for American Progress, America Votes and the Center for Community Change. A requirement of alliance membership, however, includes giving at least $200,000 to entities it supports. A chart being circulated on Capitol Hill among conservatives detailing the reach of the Democracy Alliance was provided to CNN by a conservative activist involved in campaign strategy. According to the alliance's spring investment booklet, first reported by Politico, the 21 groups at the core of its portfolio intend to spend $200 million this year to help support candidates and agenda priorities. The alliance estimated that $39 million of that would come from alliance donors, with the rest coming from other supporters. ""They are spending more. They are doing more,"" Holden told CNN speaking of some of the groups on the left supported by the Alliance, such as The American Constitution Society, which advocates on the makeup of appellate courts, and pushed for changes in Senate filibuster rules regarding judicial nominations. He said he doesn't ""think it is going to stop any time soon."" Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, disputed that assertion. ""While we appreciate the Koch brothers' backhanded compliments that our network is better coordinated and more effective, the real difference is this: Democracy Alliance donors will probably always be outspent by our counterparts on the right, but we are having a greater impact because our vision aligns with American values,"" LaMarche said in a statement to CNN. ""DA (Democracy Alliance) members are wealthy individuals and families who are trying to end the corrupting influence of money in the world and advance a world in which one person's vote counts for more than their bank account."" Organized labor launches ""Koch Sisters"" campaign . As Election Day nears -- and the Democratic attacks on the Kochs surely intensify -- Holden, who has granted interviews to several major media outlets this week, including The Washington Post and CNN, promised to talk to as many people as possible to spread his message about the hypocrisy he sees coming from the left.

"London, England (CNN) -- Microsoft is to offer its European users the chance to use a Web browser other than its own. The agreement with the European Commission ends a long-running dispute over the U.S. software giant's dominant market position. Earlier this year European regulators said the inclusion of a browser with its Windows operating system was a likely violation of European antitrust law, despite the fact it had done so for over a decade. Given Microsoft's dominance of the PC operating system market -- with 100 million European users of Windows according to the EU -- the Commission argued on its Web site that bundling the two products together deprives consumers of choice and results in fewer innovative products on the market. As of Monday users will be able to select an alternative browser from a pop-up menu or opt to stick with Internet Explorer. According to Microsoft, this ""browser choice screen"" will present users with a list of leading browsers -- including Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome -- presented in random order, in keeping with its agreement with the European Commission. The pop-up screen provides three options: . 1. Click on ""Install"" to install one of the listed browsers. 2.

"(CNN) -- The world's leading golfers have welcomed changes to the European Tour which will see a greater number of players share one of the sport's bumper prize funds. The European Tour has announced the season-ending DP World Tour Championship will boast an increased jackpot of $5 million to be shared between the top 15 players. That's an increase of $1.25m on last year's total, which was shared between just 10 players. The DP World Tour Championship is the climax of the Race to Dubai, the European Tour's equivalent of the PGA Tour-based FedEx Cup. Last year Henrik Stenson became the first golfer to win both the Race to Dubai and the FedEx Cup, helping the Swede pocket a cool $20m in 2013. The world No. 3 welcomed Monday's announcement, which is designed to encourage more players to participate in the Final Series -- the four tournaments, culminating in the DP World Tour Championships, which bring the curtain down on the European Tour season. ""It's good to evaluate and make tweaks to any system,"" Stenson said in a statement. ""These changes are for the better and won't cut anyone out if they don't want to play all of the Final Series events. ""It's down to yourself, but if you do play in all of them you are giving yourself an even better chance of winning The Race to Dubai. It's always nice to see an increase in the Bonus Pool as well, so I think the announcement is a good move all round."" In order to play in last year's DP World Tour Championship, played at Jumeirah Golf Estates, golfers had to compete in at least two of the three events prior to the Dubai finale. That requirement has now been scrapped, a move welcomed by former world No. 2 Sergio Garcia. ""I'm very happy with the changes and I'm looking forward to The Final Series,"" said the Spaniard. ""At the end of the day, we are all working together. I'm very happy to see that we've reached a middle ground which should help make us all happy."" The 2013 Final Series starts with the BMW Masters on October 30 and the WGC-HSBC Champions event on November 9, both set to take place in Shanghai, China. The Turkish Airlines Open in Antalya, Turkey on November 13 will be the penultimate tournament of the season before the Dubai decider on November 20.","The climax of this year's European Tour will have a increased prize fund .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- After disrupting a national election, anti-government demonstrators in Thailand have vowed to keep up their campaign against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The troubled election Sunday, which was boycotted by the main opposition party, appears unlikely to resolve Thailand's protracted political crisis, which has fueled bouts of deadly unrest in the Southeast Asian country. During the tense election process, anti-government protesters stopped candidates from registering, blocked delivery of ballot boxes and prevented people from casting their votes. As a result, voting was disrupted in 69 out of the country's 375 electoral districts, authorities said. The demonstrators have been protesting since November, saying they want to rid Thailand of the influence of Yingluck and her older brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in exile. Protest leaders are demanding that an unelected ""people's council"" be given the power to carry out political and electoral changes in a country where parties affiliated with Thaksin have dominated elections since 2001. Disrupted election . Yingluck has insisted that an election is the only legitimate way forward for Thailand, which has been repeatedly wracked by political conflicts over the past eight years. Her party is expected to win this vote comfortable, especially as the opposition Democrat Party refused to participate. An estimated 45.84% of voters participated in the election, the Election Commission said Monday, a far lower turnout than the 75% in the 2011 vote that brought Yingluck to power. Election results are yet to be announced, but since voting was disrupted in so many districts, the vote appears unlikely to produce enough valid results to form a parliament, meaning Yingluck will remain as caretaker Prime Minister. The Electoral Commission says holding by-elections in all the disrupted districts -- a process likely to face further pressure from protesters -- could take as long as six months. But Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkarnchana said Monday that the commission is required under the constitution to organize enough by-elections to reopen parliament within 30 days of Sunday's vote. The opposition, meanwhile, is mounting a legal challenge to the election's legitimacy. Last week, an attorney for the Democrat Party filed a petition asking the nation's constitutional court to declare Sunday's election invalid because of the disruptions to voting. Protesters resolute . The outlook for Thailand appears to be more uncertainty and unrest. Since November, at least 10 people have died and nearly 600 have been wounded in violence linked to tensions around the protests. The conflict has deepened the country's political divide. The anti-government movement draws it support from southern Thailand, Bangkok's middle class and the established elites. Yingluck's base is in the less affluent but more populous regions north and east of the capital. In Laksi, a Bangkok district of mixed pro- and anti-government sentiment, gunfire erupted Saturday between masked men amid demonstrations against the elections, witnesses said. Health officials reported at least eight people wounded since Saturday. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban on Sunday sought to distance his movement from the violence. ""We need to keep our principles. We fight in peace, with no weapons and violence. We only fight with our feet and whistles,"" he said. ""We have the right to a peaceful protest."" Suthep said his supporters would continue efforts this week to block government offices in Bangkok. They held a march in the center of Bangkok on Monday. Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, the national security chief, estimated that there were between 2,000 and 3,000 demonstrators on the city's streets Monday. Protesters generally dispute authorities' estimates of their numbers, claiming they are far higher. Amid the political deadlock, some observers have suggested Thailand's powerful military, which has carried out coups in the past, could step in. The military's stance on the crisis remains unclear. The U.S. government is opposed to a coup, the State Department said Monday. ""We are speaking directly to all elements of Thai society to make clear the importance of using democratic and constitutional means to resolve political differences,"" Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said at a regular news briefing. Voters determined . Despite the tensions in Bangkok over the weekend, many voters insisted on casting their ballots. ""I'm very excited to exercise my right to vote today,"" Nopphorn Tabupha said from Bangkok's Bueng Kum district. ""I didn't think I would be able to come out. I thought I was going to be blocked by the protesters."" Others found their efforts to participate frustrated. In the Bangkok district of Din Daeng, voting was called off because protesters blocked officials from distributing ballot boxes. A group of government supporters responded by gathering at the district office chanting, ""Election, election"" and ""We want to vote today."" Meanwhile, opposition supporters reiterated their rejection of the vote. ""No, I didn't (vote) -- I want reform before elections. Because if I did, we will only get bad people, corrupt politicians,"" said Suriya Phodhikul, a computer technician participating in an anti-government rally in the Phayathai district of Bangkok. Thaksin's role . Suthep's anti-government protesters say Yingluck is merely a puppet of Thaksin, a polarizing figure who built his support on populist policies that pleased residents of the north and northeast. Yingluck has repeatedly denied her brother calls the shots in her government. Thaksin, a business tycoon whose electoral success unsettled the Thai elite, was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. Yingluck's government set off the current crisis with a botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for Thaksin's return. The move stirred anger around the country. Thailand's worst civil unrest took place in 2010, when the government -- run at the time by the Democrat Party -- ordered a crackdown on largely pro-Thaksin protesters, leaving about 90 people dead.

"(CNN) -- A suspicious piece of luggage that was about to be loaded onto a plane at Windhoek Hosea Kutako International Airport in Namibia contained no explosives, a spokeswoman for the airline said Thursday. ""Air Berlin has confirmed that there was no explosive material in the laptop bag found in Namibia,"" Sabina Teller, spokeswoman for Air Berlin, told CNN. ""The luggage was found in the airport, at no point was on the plane. It had no luggage label so it was impossible to know where it was going, which company it was supposed to fly with or who it belonged to."" The laptop bag, found Wednesday morning among the luggage being loaded onto flight 7377 to Munich, Germany, contained a functioning electronic clock with wiring attached, suitable for use in a bomb, sources close to the investigation told CNN Thursday. The sources asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the investigation. The bag was discovered at a luggage screening point by security officials, who then notified the Namibian police explosives unit. After it was verified that the bag contained no explosives, passengers were asked to get off the plane to identify their luggage, but no one claimed ownership of the laptop bag, the source said. The flight resumed about six hours later to Munich, but some cargo was held back for investigation by officials from Namibia, Germany and the United States. The Namibia Airports Company, which runs the Windhoek airport, said the item was found at the luggage screening point prior to loading, though it did not specify whether the item was supposed to be loaded onto the Air Berlin flight. The 296 passengers and all the bags on the flight were subjected to additional security checks before the flight took off. It landed safely in Munich after a six- or seven-hour delay, said Air Berlin spokeswoman Silke Manitz. Germany raised its threat level on Wednesday, saying concrete evidence had emerged of a possible attack planned there later this month and of persistent efforts by Islamists to attack it. A senior German counterterrorism source told CNN on Thursday that the German Interior Ministry warning was linked to recent threats to the country from al Qaeda in Pakistan. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said there was ""reason for concern but no reason for hysteria."" ""Security authorities are considering three different threat scenarios by international terrorists,"" he said. ""Security authorities have been pursuing these indications for weeks with the highest intensity and proper sensitivity -- in closest cooperation with our international partners. ""Now further insights and facts relevant to danger have added themselves to these established insights,"" he said Wednesday. The ""new situation"" prompted authorities to raise the threat level. Last month, the United States issued a travel alert for Americans in Europe amid concerns that al Qaeda or related groups might be planning attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro in London; Ben Brumfield in Atlanta, Georgia; Diana Magnay in Hamburg, Germany; John Grobler in Namibia; and Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa, contributed to this report.","Suspicious bag found to contain no explosive .

"(CNN) -- The man who has admitted to leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs appears to have his sights set on Ecuador. Edward Snowden, who is charged with espionage in the United States, has asked for asylum in the South American country, its foreign minister said. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the publication of classified information and has said it's helping Snowden's asylum bid, said Sunday that Snowden was heading to Ecuador ""via a safe route."" ""Once Mr. Snowden arrives in Ecuador, his request will be formally processed,"" WikiLeaks said in a statement on its website. CNN spotted a car with diplomatic plates and an Ecuadorian flag at Moscow's airport on Sunday. And the Reuters news agency reported that Ecuador's ambassador to Russia said he would be meeting with Snowden at a Moscow airport hotel. As word spread that Snowden had left his Hong Kong hideout and was headed to Russia on Sunday, the former NSA contractor became the center of a global guessing game. Media reports speculated that he could be traveling to Ecuador, Venezuela or Cuba -- all countries where leaders have sharply criticized what they call the U.S. government's imperialist approach. Why would Ecuador win out? Is that country likely to grant Snowden asylum? Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, a left-leaning economist, has railed against the United States in concert with allies in Latin America. Lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as Snowden lands in Russia . And it's been nearly a year since the South American country approved a similar asylum request from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is now holed up inside Ecuador's embassy in London. He faces arrest in Britain and possible extradition to Sweden if he leaves the embassy. Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino has called on British authorities to reconsider Assange's case, describing it as ""politically motivated."" On Sunday, he said that authorities would review Snowden's petition and give him a reply as soon as possible, Ecuador's state-run Andes news agency reported. Embassy life like 'a space station,' Assange says . The foreign minister is scheduled to speak at a news conference Monday from Vietnam, where he is traveling on a state visit. On Sunday, a senior administration official said the United States was asking Ecuador, Cuba and Venezuela not to let Snowden in or expel him if he enters their countries. A source familiar with the matter said the U.S. government had revoked Snowden's passport. There appear to be no direct flights from Moscow to Ecuador, and it's unclear whether Snowden could have a connecting flight in another country. Tom Fuentes, CNN law enforcement analyst and a former assistant director of the FBI, pointed out that Ecuador hasn't granted Snowden asylum yet. WikiLeaks' Assange urges support for Snowden, slams Obama . ""Right now who knows where he's going to ultimately end up, or how long it's going to take him or how many connecting flights,"" Fuentes said on Sunday. ""And you know, he's pushing the envelope of how many places he can try to go before he would fall into hands of being in custody and possibly extradited back to the U.S. ""Or technically, because he does not have a valid U.S. passport, and if he does not have another valid passport, then the next situation could be for those countries to say, 'you're here illegally and we'll deport you,' "" Fuentes said. Wherever Snowden goes next, U.S. officials have said they plan to push to prosecute him. But Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, told CNN that extradition treaties ""are read differently by countries in different circumstances."" The United States has its share of critics who say it ignores international law regarding the treatment of prisoners or the use of drone attacks, and host countries are allowed to question ""whether a charged crime was a political act."" ""It doesn't help to have all these senators and members of Congress calling for this guy's head,"" Turley said, referring to lawmakers who have accused Snowden of treason.

"Gaza City (CNN) -- A delegation from Gaza was in Egypt Monday to hash out more details of a cease-fire deal between Hamas and Israel, less than a week after the truce ended an eight-day conflict. The continued talks are a key part of the agreement, which called for ""total cessation of all hostile activity"" and discussion of topics such as opening border crossings and easing Israel's economic blockade in Gaza. Israel-Gaza conflict timeline . While new negotiations were under way in Egypt Monday, there were reports of violence along the Gaza-Israel border. Hamas police and ambulance operators said Israeli soldiers injured two civilians when they fired at Palestinian homes east of Rafah City in Gaza. An Israeli military spokesman said the soldiers fired warning shots in the air and later shot toward the legs of ""Palestinian rioters"" who were damaging a security fence at the border and trying to enter Israel. The Israeli military said earlier that it was investigating a stabbing Monday near the border. Israeli soldiers killed a man who infiltrated the village of Sde Avraham from Gaza and stabbed a woman, who was lightly injured, the Israel Defense Forces said. The fragile truce between Israel and Hamas has appeared to hold up despite such flareups. On Friday, there were reports that Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man near the border. Fighting also was recorded Thursday, a day after the cease-fire was declared. Egypt and the United States helped broker the cease-fire last week after Israel launched a series of military strikes on Gaza with the stated goal of halting Israel-bound rocket attacks from militants in the Palestinian territory. Can cease-fire result in real change? Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy helped forge the cease-fire, as Israeli forces gathered near the Gaza border for a possible ground invasion. On Monday, Morsy was facing a political crisis in his own country, with some protesters calling him a dictator and judges striking nationwide in protest of the president's announcement last week that Egyptian courts cannot overturn the decisions or decrees he's made since taking office in June. It was unclear whether the turmoil in Egypt would affect the cease-fire talks. How would you feel if your children were constantly scared? The Gaza-Israel conflict left more than 160 Palestinians dead, many of whom were civilians. The brother of BBC journalist Jihad Misharawi, whose 11-month-old son was killed in an Israeli airstrike, died from wounds suffered in the strike, medical sources said Monday. Six Israelis also have died during the conflict, including civilians and soldiers. The ongoing talks over the cease-fire deal come as Palestinian Authority leaders plan to make a pitch this week to become a non-member observer state at the United Nations. ""All the Palestinian factions are behind us as we go ... to the United Nations,"" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told supporters Sunday. Hamas added its support Monday, an apparent change in position after stating a day earlier that there was ""no truth"" to reports that Haniyeh's office ""has blessed the move to go to the United Nations."" The shift followed a phone call between Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal and Abbas, according to the Hamas website. The Gaza-based Hamas has long opposed the gambit that Abbas launched last year. A vote on the Palestinian status is expected at the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday. CNN's Kareem Khadder, Amir Ahmed and Michael Schwarz contributed to this report.

"London (CNN) -- The head of the International Olympics Committee again rejected calls for a moment of silence during the Games' opening ceremony to honor Israeli Olympians killed in a terror attack at the 1972 Games. ""We feel that the Opening Ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident,"" Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said Saturday. Ronald Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, condemned that stance Sunday as ""unfeeling"" and ""completely out of touch."" More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition calling for a moment of silence in memory of the 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian militants at the games in Munich, Germany, 40 years ago. A German policeman and five of the attackers also died. President Barack Obama supports the campaign, the White House said Thursday. Read more: Obama says yes to Olympic tribute . Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon has also been a vocal proponent, campaigning on Facebook and Twitter for ""Just One Minute"" of silence. The refusal of the IOC to back the plan ""told us as Israelis that this tragedy is yours alone and not a tragedy within the family of nations,"" Ayalon said in May. Ankie Spitzer, whose husband Andrei was among those killed, was the first to sign the petition. ""They came to Munich in 1972 to play as athletes in the Olympics; they came in peace and went home in coffins,"" she writes in the online plea. She says she has ""no political or religious agenda. Just the hope that my husband and the other men who went to the Olympics in peace, friendship and sportsmanship are given what they deserve. One minute of silence will clearly say to the world that what happened in 1972 can never happen again."" Rogge said Saturday that the IOC would ""be present"" at the September 5 ceremony honoring the dead at the site where they were killed in Germany. ""We are going to pay a homage to the athletes, of course, as we always have done in the past and will do in the future,"" he said. But Lauder of the World Jewish Congress said that was inadequate. ""Frankly, that's not good enough,"" he said, arguing that ""hardly anybody"" will notice that event. The attack began in the early hours of September 5, 1972, when eight Palestinian terrorists disguised in track suits broke into the Olympic Village in Munich. Read more: Can we feel safe in a crowd anymore? They stormed the apartments housing Israeli athletes and coaches, killing two and taking nine others hostage. Hours later, the world woke up to the image of a masked man on the balcony of the Olympic Village. From the Olympic Village, the militants demanded the release of 200 Arab inmates from Israeli prisons or they would start killing the athletes in Munich, one every hour. Israel refused to negotiate, and the terrorists demanded an airplane to Egypt. The German government then attempted a rescue at the airport. When it was over, all the Israelis, five terrorists and one German police officer lay dead.

"(CNN) -- Jack Dorsey might be an unassuming character -- but he's also a tech titan who reinvented the way the world communicates. And now he's on a mission to do the same for commerce. The co-founder of Twitter and chief executive officer of Square met with CNN's Maggie Lake to share his vision on how mobile payments will change the world of commerce. Square, which enables the virtual exchange of cash and goods, is designed to ""give time back to our sellers, give time back to our merchants, so they can really focus on building their business up,"" Dorsey told CNN. ""We don't want this to just be about payments, we don't want it to be about transactions -- those are all mechanical things that should be so intuitive that they disappear,"" he said. Dorsey is criss-crossing North America to promote Square and talk to small business owners, whom he sees as key to reinvigorating economic growth. ""What I think is great about technology, and every technology that exists, [is that] it increases the number of people who can participate, in our case commerce,"" Dorsey said. ""And, it increases the velocity that they can participate."" Square, Dorsey added, enables a businessperson to ""start as an individual, you can start selling something, and then you can grow."" Square is competing in a jammed arena -- mobile payments already exist via Paypal and others -- but Dorsey told CNN its pitch is different. ""A lot of folks are looking at parts of the equation and Square is looking at the entire thing,"" Dorsey said. ""If you're not solving for the entire experience, you are putting those seams in front of the customers -- and the customers see that. And they have all these friction points, and it actually slows down the business."" Square aims to have ""one, end-to-end, great, frictionless experience -- and that's been our focus from day one,"" Dorsey said. Transactions through Square have tripled over the last 18 months, a success that nevertheless remains overshadowed by the Dorsey's involvement in Twitter. The micro-messaging social network, which has shifted how people and businesses communicate, is valued at up to $11 billion and will go public next month. However, Dorsey said Square is an ""entirely new canvas,"" dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication. Both ideas are ""fundamental to humanity....both are extremely complex and both companies are trying to make each simple."" But, Dorsey added, "" they are very very different problem sets and they require different solutions to each one.""","Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is now ceo of a mobile payments company .

"(CNN) -- Amid growing concern about brain injuries that cause about 250,000 emergency room visits by young athletes annually, the White House will convene the Healthy Kids and Safe Sports Concussion Summit on Thursday. More than 200 participants, including the National Football League, professional athletes and the Pentagon, will discuss what can be done to help educate parents and athletes on how to better prevent concussions and protect athletes' brains, according to a White House statement. White House press secretary Jay Carney said the summit came from conversations he and President Barack Obama had regarding the concerns parents had about concussions. ""As parents tend to do, we talk about our kids, and we talk a lot about sports,"" Carney said. The White House will announce initiatives on Thursday, including an effort to help start a national concussion database through the University of California, Los Angeles, as well as a $30 million partnership between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Department of Defense to fund the most comprehensive clinical study of concussions among college athletes, the statement said. The NFL will commit $25 million to work with the National Athletic Trainers Association to get more athletic trainers in high schools. Currently, about half of all high schools have no athletic trainers on their sidelines. Dr. David Dodick of the Mayo Clinic told CNN the summit will focus unprecedented attention on the issue of concussions and youth athletes. ""It really highlights this as a public health crisis, and elevates this to a national health priority,"" he said. High school athletes found more vulnerable to concussions .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba marked the 58th anniversary of the start of Fidel Castro's revolution Tuesday, without a speech from his younger brother, current President Raul Castro. Instead, Cuba's vice president took the podium to talk about economic challenges ahead but did not reveal any new details about reforms under way to allow more private enterprises and shrink the role of the state. ""We are not applying patches or improvising, but looking for permanent solutions to old problems,"" 80-year-old Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura told crowds in the eastern Cuban city of Ciego de Avila. The National Day of Rebellion has traditionally been used by Fidel or Raul Castro to make major announcements or set policy. But this is the second year in a row that the vice president has delivered the main speech at the celebration, which commemorates Fidel Castro's first attack on an army barracks. The attack failed, but it marked the start of his armed revolution. This year, the speech was short and focused on familiar ideas like boosting productivity and updating the economic model in order to strengthen, not undermine, the socialist system. Last year, Raul Castro announced reforms to permit a bigger role for the private sector to soak up some of the 1 million state jobs that he said would need to be eliminated. Cubans were hoping to get new details about that plan and the president's announcement earlier this year that restrictions on the buying and selling of homes and cars would soon be lifted. There is still a chance that details on the reforms will emerge next week when Cuba's National Assembly meets for one of its biannual sessions.","For the 2nd year in a row, the vice president delivered the annual speech .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A 3-month-old baby, whose father has been arrested on allegations he beat her for being born a girl, died Wednesday at a hospital in South India, a doctor said. The baby, named Afreen, was hospitalized in Bangalore on Sunday with burn marks on her head and a dislocated neck, injuries that police said were caused by her father, Umar Farooq. Farooq, a 22-year-old car painter, was arrested Sunday and is in custody facing trial on charges of attempted murder, said N.H. Siddappa, a police investigator. Following Afreen's death, Farooq will now be charged with murder, Siddappa said. The baby died of cardiac arrest after multiple convulsions Wednesday, said R. Premalatha, a pediatrician at Bangalore's Vani Vilas Hospital. Siddappa said that Farooq had confessed to battering the baby because he wanted a son. According to the police, Afreen was the first child of Farooq and his 19-year-old wife. The case highlights the preference among many Indians for sons over daughters, a situation that has already created a worrisome gender imbalance in the world's second most populous nation after China. A 2011 census report recorded an alarming drop in the percentage of girls among the country's preschoolers. For every 1,000 boys aged 6 or younger, the findings counted 914 girls, down from 927 a decade ago -- the lowest ratio since India gained independence in 1947, according to the report. Sex-selective abortions, although illegal in India, are believed to be rampant, often aided by unauthorized clinics. ""The reasons for high number of incidence of female feticide in India include a deep-rooted traditional son preference, continued practice of dowry, and concern for safety of the girl child and exploitation and abuse of women and girl children,"" Krishna Tirath, India's minister for women and child development, said last year. Afreen's death follows that of a 2-year-old abandoned girl last month. The 2-year-old, named Falak, had been hospitalized in New Delhi with severe head injuries, fractured arms and human bite marks covering her tiny body. Once the police began investigating Falak's back story, they unearthed suspicions of a human trafficking ring. The details sparked outrage among authorities and the public alike, who say the case raises a host of questions about child abandonment, exploitation and the poor treatment of girls and women in India.","3-month-old Afreen Farooq died of cardiac arrest after convulsions, a doctor says .

"(CNN) -- While the educational prospects for poor children have improved in the 50 years since I was a young boy going to PS 99 in the South Bronx, our country continues to needlessly lose the talents of millions of children because of a failing, entrenched public education system. There are no shortages of great ideas in education, both small-scale and large-scale. There are some brilliant teachers and educators out there in the field. But we have not done much more than tinker at the edges of the system. For that reason, we have doomed massive numbers of children -- particularly those with the misfortune to be born poor -- to academic underachievement and having no real shot at the American dream of a comfortable middle-class life. I believe that when large numbers of children fail academically, it is the responsibility of the adults around that child. The schools in my neighborhood in the South Bronx were lousy in the 1960s, and they are by and large still lousy today. Why wouldn't they be? They pretty much have not changed what they do. The kids aren't going to spontaneously get better by themselves. We, as a country, need to say ""enough is enough."" Anyone calling for reform is treated as a radical, but I think we simply need to let the science of education lead the way to real innovation and improvements. If the ""summer melt"" sets back our students academically -- particularly those in poor neighborhoods with few good summer options -- let's extend the school year. If we know for a fact that the first three years of a child's life are incredibly important for a child's later learning, let's give up the idea that education starts in kindergarten and train new parents and work with 0-3 children as early as possible. If you really want to be branded as a radical, suggest that we provide better health care and other services for children. Watch Geoffrey Canada's TED Talk . Over the years, when I raised funds for health care for my kids, I would explain that kids with a toothache can't concentrate on classroom work or that a near-sighted kid without glasses may be classified as ""slow"" when he just can't see the board. I point out that kids need a safe, enriching environment after school, too. And that sports and arts programs can help a child find a focus and self-discipline that helps their academics. As I've gotten older, when people push back on that kind of reasoning for wrap-around services, I just tell them I want to do it for a simple reason: I like kids. Or I tell them I want to do it for the same reasons they do it for their kids. Taking care of children so they can succeed in school and life should be the floor, not the ceiling, of our expectations. The science of evaluation and assessment also needs to be better incorporated into schools' standard operating procedure. We give students standardized tests in English and math, but schools get the results in July or August; the students and teachers have moved on, and so nothing is done with all this incredibly valuable data that we have spent a fortune obtaining. Teachers need data about how the children are progressing in real time so they can target their efforts at where the children really are. We can't stifle innovation. Some promising approaches will fail, but that doesn't mean we should give up trying. We need to keep pushing until we nail what works. Look at the world of technology: When the Palm Pilot crashed and burned, no one took that as a signal to stop creating handheld devices. As with any industry, research and development -- not to mention implementation -- takes money. But the cost of fixing our education system is a relative pittance. What have we spent in Afghanistan in the past year in the name of national security? I would say that fixing our broken education system is similarly a matter of security for our country. The problems of the system are most obvious in poor communities, but the problems are everywhere: We are not preparing our children for a highly competitive global marketplace of high-skill jobs. We are still the world's undisputed superpower. When the country cares about something, we spend the money. Americans need to wake up and see this for the widespread crisis it is. Join me in calling for a dramatic reform of our school system.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's ruling Congress party has suffered a crushing defeat in local elections that are considered a litmus test for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government. The count from multiphased polling in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, showed the Congress party winning in less than 30 of the 403 boroughs. Voters, instead, backed the regional Samajwadi Party, giving it a decisive majority of 224 seats to rule the province. Led by politician, Akhilesh Yadav, 38, the Samajwadi Party unseated powerful low-caste chief minister Mayawati, who goes by one name. Yadav is son of Uttar Pradesh's veteran leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, a former state chief and a former wrestler. His party is believed to have a strong base among Hindu middle castes and Muslims. The tally for the Congress party count fell far short of its target, notching a fourth place finish in statewide voting. ""Anti Congress,"" said a bold page-one headline on the ""Indian Express"" newspaper. The outcome is a personal setback for star campaigner Rahul Gandhi, who struggled hard to revive the Congress party. ""This is one of my defeats and I take it in my stride,"" said the 41-year old scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, billed by some as a future prime minister. Gandhi, a federal lawmaker from Uttar Pradesh, was not a candidate, but led a tireless campaign in the provincial elections. His party leads the United Progressive Alliance government at the national level. ""The Congress (party) needs to wake up and smell the anti-incumbency that's rising nationally against the UPA government, fueled by rising prices, poor economic management and corruption,"" the Times of India wrote in an editorial. In the run-up to polling, the Congress-led federal government, reeling from a raft of multibillion-dollar corruption scandals, approved job quotas for minority groups in a move widely perceived as an attempt to woo the Muslim community in Uttar Pradesh -- which makes up an estimated 18% of the state's population, according to official figures. Though the state is almost paralyzed by widespread poverty and poor health care, political observers say caste and religion still take precedence over development in local politics. ""Religion and caste factor in right from the selection of candidates by almost all political parties. Candidates are chosen on the basis of the population constitution of constituencies,"" said political analyst J.P. Shukla. The ousted leader, Mayawati, became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2007 after leading her Bahujan Samaj Party to an overwhelming victory in this state of more than 200 million people. An icon of the Dalits, once known as ""the untouchables"" and the lowest rung in the Hindu caste system, the 56-year-old has been widely criticized for her alleged extravagance while heading one of India's poorest parts. Yet Mayawati's supporters -- not just Dalits -- praised her for bringing about what they describe as a ""qualitative difference"" to the lives of a rainbow of castes during her tenure. Meantime, Congress suffered a major setback in other states. It failed in Punjab and Goa while securing a victory by a whisker -- but without a clear majority -- in the mountainous Uttarakhand state. An influential local leader, Okram Ibobi Singh, was credited for retaining power for the Congress party in the far-flung, insurgency-wracked Manipur province.","The elections are considered a litmus test for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government .

"Ann Arbor, Michigan (CNN) -- There haven't been many times when I have been at a loss for words when conducting an interview as a medical reporter. This was one of those moments. The man cleared his throat, after ignoring the question I just asked him. ""You want to know what I think?"" he said loudly. ""I do,"" I replied. ""Is that what this is about -- you want to know how I really feel, what makes me tick?"" he said even louder. I nodded as calmly as I could. ""Let me tell you something,"" his voice trailed off. He paused and looked momentarily distracted. He gave a long, hard look at his lawyer, who was standing right behind me. He shivered a little bit and bunched up his powder blue sweater. ""I have no regrets, none whatsoever,"" he said. It was windy outside, but it was also over 90 degrees in sunny Ann Arbor, Michigan. I was now sweating, and he was ... well, cold. He shifted his gaze from his lawyer back to me. ""Sanjay, you want to know the single worst moment of my life?"" That wasn't the question I asked, but in fact I was curious to know the answer. ""OK,"" I replied -- a little uneasily. He smiled now and said in a very deliberate, almost staccato voice: ""The single worst moment of my life... was the moment I was born."" And, we had officially begun my sit-down interview with Dr Jack Kevorkian. We were in Ann Arbor because we both attended the University of Michigan Medical School. I graduated in 1993 and the 82-year-old Kevorkian in 1952. We found his class picture in a long hallway connecting the medical school to the University Hospital. As he shuffled toward the picture, he leaned in to me and said, ""I am not a sentimental person."" Still, he had a glimmer in his eye when he identified the younger and more handsome version of himself. I was about to ask him about the other members of his class, when he started pointing at various student pictures. ""Dead... dead, dead,"" he repeated over and over. He was bringing me up to date on the status of his classmates. ""Dead, dead,"" he paused and cracked a smile. ""This guy here ... he wanted me in jail."" I looked over, pointed, and asked, ""This guy?"" ""No... but, he probably did as well,"" Kevorkian replied. He then laughed and shuffled off again down the hallway. I didn't know what to expect when I was planning this interview. I had read everything I could find about him, including two books he had written while in prison. I had watched the documentary that will premiere June 28 on HBO and the recent docudrama with Al Pacino, for which, he told me, he received ""not a penny."" He lives in a small apartment in Royal Oak and has recently adopted a caloric-restriction diet, eating around 500 calories a day, he says. Kevorkian had sprung onto the national scene right about the time I was starting medical school. He fascinated my parents, and during the rare occasions I attended a cocktail party with them, the conversation among their friends seemed to always turn to him. He invoked strong emotions in so many people he had never met. ""During your interview for medical school, right there in that building, when they asked you, 'Why do you want to be a doctor?'  what did you answer?"" I asked. ""What did you answer?"" he replied somewhat harshly. Throughout the two-and-a-half hour interview, he fluctuated wildly between being downright combative and hostile to being sweet and fatherly. It was almost as if he desperately wanted me to understand all the decisions he had made in his life. By this point, I knew he was just asking me rhetorically, so I waited patiently for him to collect himself. ""I told them all the stuff they wanted to hear. Oh, I want to heal people and I want to join medicine, because it is the noblest of all professions... noble, yeah right."" ""Is medicine a noble profession?"" I continued. ""What do you think?"" he once again fired back. I waited. ""No, it is not,"" he finally answered. Dr. Jack Kevorkian is as opaque a person as I have ever met. But despite his crazed rants -- often about the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution, complete with a defense of James Madison and trashing of Thomas Jefferson (that guy ... he just took all the credit!) -- Kevorkian still knows how to make a point. Not surprisingly, he strongly advocates assisted suicide, or euthanasia, or what he calls ""patholysis."" Terms matter to Kevorkian, and this is the term he prefers when describing the ""medical procedure"" he performed on at least 130 people, by his own count. ""Path means disease or suffering,"" he said to me. ""And lysis, means destruction,"" I said. ""Exactly,"" he answered. Patholysis, he repeated. The destruction of suffering. As we walked around campus, Kevorkian drew a lot of attention. Many stopped to say hello, ask for an autograph or take a picture. He spent time with every person, asking about them and their role at the university. It was about an hour into the interview when I realized Kevorkian was trying to make a broader point. It started when I cited a study about the people he had ""patholysed."" ""It says here that in at least five of the people, there was no evidence of any disease on autopsy."" I let that hang in the air for a second. He seemed a little stunned that I had found this study. He shook his head slightly, and looked again at his lawyer, with no intention of addressing the point I had just made. ""Recently, I had three former CEOs of companies -- perfectly healthy -- who called me up and told me they wish to die."" He let that sink in. It was my turn to be stunned. ""So... what did you do? What did you tell them?"" I asked gently. ""No, nothing,"" he said with a dismissive wave of his hand. ""I didn't do anything, but people have their rights."" I realized this was what he had building up to for some time. This wasn't just about assisted suicide; this was about upholding the ability for people to do whatever they wanted to do, without interference from doctors, the states or the federal government. That the rights of the masses should not impede on the rights of a few. Someone once told me that was the ""gist"" of the Ninth Amendment, and it is something that has helped inform Dr. Jack Kevorkian's thinking and his life. Turns out he did have some regrets, which he told me about. He wishes he'd treated his parents better, and his sister, he said quietly. He also is deeply resentful that the Supreme Court never heard his case, which he felt was a constitutional one. ""That is what they are for!"" For a moment, I had finally penetrated inside the head of Kevorkian, and it was a lucid, well thought-out, and somewhat frightening place to be. And, perhaps he was right about Madison as well -- he really didn't get enough credit for contributing to the Constitution. ""In times of desperation, people may make decisions they regret,"" I started up again. ""This isn't about deciding whether you want frozen yogurt or ice cream. These decisions about patholysis are ... forever."" He agreed with that point, but quickly pointed out that he obtained mental health exams on all of his patients before agreeing to proceed. He also thoroughly reviewed medical records -- about what he was looking for exactly, he was less forthcoming. Fact is, he says he turned down ""many"" patients who had requested his services. And, for what it is worth, he never charged. A family member had once sent repeated checks to him after Kevorkian assisted in his wife's suicide, and he kept sending the money back, he told me. I did ask Kevorkian about his reflections on his own mortality. ""I am not ready to die,"" he answered. ""I have purpose in my life and three missions,"" he added. He wants to tell mankind about ""impending doom."" He worries that our culture of overabundance will soon lead to the extinction of the human race. ""I am not going to be too popular for that one."" His second mission is to educate people about patholysis. ""They just don't get it in Oregon, "" he said. ""Or in Washington state or Montana, the other states,"" where assisted suicide has been legalized. In those states, a person has to be considered terminal in order to qualify for assisted suicide. ""What difference does it make if someone is terminal?"" he said. ""We are all terminal."" His third mission is to convince the American public that their rights are infringed upon each and every day -- and that the Ninth Amendment is not being upheld. Everything from banning smoking in public places, to assisted suicide, euthanasia and patholysis. By the end of the interview, Dr Jack Kevorkian was smiling a lot and thanking me for spending a day with him. He was back to the paternal, friendly Jack. We shook hands, and he hung on for a few extra seconds, looked me in the eyes and said, ""Thank you Sanjay."" I told him it was an honor to meet him, and hoped to see him again soon. As he shuffled away, I couldn't help but think Kevorkian still invoked strong emotions in people -- but I also hoped that if the moment of his birth was the worst of his life that he had some good moments since then.

"(RollingStone.com) -- It's been a rough year for Morrissey, as the laconic singer has endured everything from tour-canceling illnesses to possibly being dropped from his new label to bizarre allegations of a murder-for-hire plot. However, in a new interview with El Mundo, the former Smiths singer reveals he's dealing with some health issues that make all those other troubles seem insignificant. According to Morrissey, he's had a cancer scare, although in talking about the disease, the singer doesn't seem that scared at all. Morrissey talks about his health, sex appeal . ""They have scraped cancerous tissues four times already, but whatever,"" Morrissey told the Spanish-language El Mundo (via a translation by the Guardian). ""If I die, then I die. And if I don't, then I don't. Right now I feel good. I am aware that in some of my recent photos I look somewhat unhealthy, but that's what illness can do. I'm not going to worry about that. I'll rest when I'm dead."" Over the past few years, Morrissey has canceled tour dates for reasons like food poisoning, bleeding ulcers, pneumonia and a sickness he blamed on his opening act, but this is the first time the usually candid rocker has uttered the C-word aloud. In early 2013, Morrissey spent some time in a Michigan hospital after suffering from ""a concussion, a bleeding ulcer and Barrett's esophagus."" Morrissey denies former bodyguard's allegations . After canceling six U.S. shows following his hospital stay, the singer penned a grim letter to fans where he discussed his own mortality. ""The reports of my death have been greatly understated,"" Morrissey wrote. ""The positive from all of this is that there are now no known ailments left for me to try."" The singer also joked about an upcoming Las Vegas concert, writing, ""If there's an audience of any kind in attendance, I just might die with a smile on my face, after all. If I am not there, I shall probably never again be anywhere. Equally, I am determined to play Flint [Michigan] if it kills me (which, on the face of it, it almost has)."" He concluded the letter by signing off, ""pause at my headstone, MORRISSEY."" Morrissey partners spar over cancellation . In a recent interview where Morrissey talked about his many health issues, he proclaimed that, ""The worst was in June in Boston, when I was hospitalized with acute fever. I was delirious for six hours, talking absolute nonsense and unable to stop. I've never been so frightened in my life. Then, of course, you get these bitchy comments for having to cancel shows.... I've been to so many hospitals lately that there's hardly any point in my leaving."" At press time, Morrissey hasn't updated his fan sites about the cancer reports. Whatever the diagnosis, Morrissey is back out on the road, and NME reports that the singer's backing band is proudly donning shirts that say ""F*** Harvest"" as a nod to his record label after the label released Moz's new LP ""World Peace Is None of Your Business.""

"(CNN) -- Going to a restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing experience. But for Katherine Dillinger, there was one thing that was guaranteed to stress her out: Seeing ""Caesar salad"" misspelled on the menu. ""It would just drive me ballistic,"" Dillinger said. After years of practice, she's learning to relax. ""Now, I just shrug it off. I still notice it, but it doesn't drive me crazy like it used to."" Many of us have a tendency to notice bad grammar and misspellings, as evidenced in the gallery above. But for copy editors, the people who read and edit stories for grammar, style and substance, fixing errors is their job. In honor of National Grammar Day, we sat down with Dillinger, one of the funniest grammar gatekeepers on the copy desk. She has been a copy editor for 15 years, six of which she's spent at CNN.com in Atlanta. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: What made you want to become a copy editor? Dillinger: I wanted to be a writer first, actually, but I took a reporting class in college and hated it. I didn't like going up to people, saying, ""Your house just burned down. How did it feel?"" At the same time, I was taking an editing class. It came easily, I enjoyed it, and it seemed like fun. CNN: What are the most common errors you come across in your job? Dillinger: Where to start? It's probably punctuation errors, specifically comma errors with independent and dependent clauses. Spell check means most people usually don't make spelling errors unless they just don't pay any attention at all. Most people get verb tenses correct. And capitalization ... people love to capitalize things they shouldn't. CNN: What are your biggest grammar pet peeves? Dillinger: Misuse of the em dash when you should have a colon instead drives me crazy! And I really hate the word ""probe,"" just in general. I have a bunch, but those are my two main ones. I'm constantly taking em dashes out of stories. Learn the colon! There are proper ways to use a colon. I shake my fist at you. CNN: Could you ever be close friends with someone who makes lots of grammatical mistakes? Dillinger: I used to date somebody who did, back in college. He was as bad a writer as you could get. I used to type his papers for him and edit as I was going. You learn to live past it, I guess. CNN: Have you ever made a mistake? What's your most memorable one? Dillinger: Oh, God, I've made so many. That's the nature of the business. When I was in Austin (on the copy desk of the local newspaper), there was a month where I just made one after another. It was terrible. It's your job not to do those things. I've put incorrect information into stories. It kills you every time you do it, too. Luckily, none of them has been libelous or gotten me called up to the publisher. CNN: What's the best grammar fail you've seen? Extra points if it made you laugh. Dillinger: Where they misspell the team name on a jersey. Those always crack me up. It's not a grammar fail; it's more of a spelling fail. CNN: The grammar rule that must never be broken is ________ . Dillinger: You can make an argument that, within reason, you can break almost any grammar rule. You learn over the years that it's OK to break the rules. It's all in how you were taught. You go by what this story says to you. If this story splits an infinitive but it works, then I would split the infinitive! How the story sounds is sometimes more important than being totally adherent to every grammar rule. CNN: How will you be celebrating National Grammar Day? Dillinger: Every day is grammar day when you're a copy editor. Is grammar really important to you? What's your biggest grammar pet peeve?

"(CNN) -- After Thursday's vice presidential debate, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell was emphatic that moderator Martha Raddatz's question about the role of the candidates' faith in their positions on abortion had ""absolutely no business in a government that has a separation of church and state."" In the now-famous words of Vice President Joe Biden, ""That's a bunch of malarkey."" All of us are guided by an internal code of morality, whether it is dictated by religion or by personal responsibility to humankind. Both Rep. Paul Ryan and Biden were explicit that their faith informs all of their decision-making, and that includes issues related to a woman's body. ""I don't see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith,"" Ryan said. Biden echoed his sentiments, saying his religion ""defines"" who he is and has ""particularly informed"" his social doctrine. (The difference in their approaches lies in Biden's refusal to shape national abortion policy according to his personal beliefs, an important distinction for candidates to make.) While abortion is often framed as a matter of rights (with many women supporting it merely on principle rather than personal necessity), its implications for women go far beyond the mere theoretical. For so many women, especially the 25 million women who are currently living in poverty, the ability to control when and whether they have children is the critical link to their family's economic security. With so much of the presidential race focused on the economy, it is unfortunate that the campaigns have not drawn attention to the impact that unintended childbearing has on a woman's personal economy. More than 10% of American families are thrust into poverty within one month of the birth of a child. Since the United States is one of just a handful of industrialized countries worldwide that doesn't mandate paid maternity leave, a new mother in America may be forced to return to work immediately after her child's birth. And that is only if she is amongst the privileged few who is able to return to work at all. With the cost of child care exceeding the average cost of rent in half of all states, this woman may not be able to afford the child care she needs to continue working. Millions of American women are one unintended pregnancy away from financial despair. Where a candidate stands on reproductive rights influences everything from health care coverage to economic issues to basic human rights, all extremely relevant to a voter's complete understanding of a presidential candidate and his closest advisers. The impact of a candidate's religion on these issues matters. For women specifically, whose perspectives are often shaped differently from men's due to biological factors and historical inequality, an explanation of a candidate's position on abortion -- and the moral or religious justification that influenced that position -- is valuable in determining far more than the availability of a common medical procedure. In fact, a candidate's full stance on abortion symbolizes their understanding of the realities of women's lives and the actions necessary to enable American parents to live up to their responsibilities. Can the candidate reconcile anti-abortion religious teachings with respect for the legal right to make reproductive choices that impact the direction of women's lives? Will the candidate's religion affect his or her support of policies that enable women to achieve equal success to men? Martha Raddatz was a fantastic moderator. She challenged two wealthy, deeply religious men to articulate their spiritual basis for positions that have enormous significance to the vast majority of American women who don't see themselves represented in political conversations about their bodies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anika Rahman.","Debate moderator was criticized for asking question about candidates' faith and abortion .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party got the most votes in Israel's national election Tuesday, but a respectable showing by centrists could slow or halt a rightward swing in the government. Netanyahu's Likud Beitenu won between 31 and 33 Knesset seats in the Israel election, TV exit polls reported, winning the most, as expected. Jewish Home, an extreme right party with a charismatic leader named Naftali Bennett, got between 11 and 12 seats. But the Yesh Atid party, a new centrist movement devoted to helping the middle class and halting military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox civilians, came in a surprising second place with at least 18 seats, according to the exit polls. Netanyahu told weary but elated supporters early Wednesday he plans to form a government ""as broad as possible"" and pursue his goals with ""many partners."" ""I believe the results of the election represent an opportunity to make changes that the people of Israel want to see and that will serve all citizens of the state of Israel,"" he said. ""I plan to lead those changes and to that end we must establish a government that is as broad as possible, and I've already started out on that task."" He cited a number of principles a new government will embrace: security, preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, economic responsibility in the face of the global financial crisis, increasing equality in sharing burdens and lowering the cost of living, including the cost of apartments. Israel defies international criticism of settlement plans . ""It is a great privilege but it is also a great responsibility,"" Netanyahu said. ""I believe the results of the elections represent an opportunity to make changes that the people of Israel want to see and (that) will serve all of the citizens of the state of Israel."" But the centrists and leftists attracted waves of voters displeased with, among other things, Israel's high cost of living, and more supportive of talks with Palestinians. At first glance, the initial result reflects a politically polarized electorate, with possibly an edge to the rightists. Yossi Beilin, a politician who is staunchly in the peace camp and one of the chief architects of the Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative called the Oslo Accords, said he thinks that it will be impossible for Netanyahu to form his own government and he hopes none of the center-left parties join his government. ""The center-left in Israel is alive and kicking. It's almost the majority, or half and half,"" he told CNN. ""All the talks about the demise of the left are over for the time being."" Yesh Atid's leader is a dynamic figure -- Yair Lapid, a longtime prominent journalist whose late father, Tommy Lapid, led Shinui, a onetime secularist party that took on the influence and power of the ultra-Orthodox. Yesh Atid also calls for reforming the governmental system, improving education, jump-starting the economy through small-business assistance and providing housing assistance for military veterans and young couples. The Labor Party, whose leader Shelly Yacimovich campaigned solely on economic concerns, apparently won 17 seats, according to exit polling. Before the election, she was expected to finish in second place, so that is a surprise. She and other centrists were working to tap into the disaffected Israelis who took to the Tel Aviv streets in 2011 to protest frustrating economic conditions. Hatnua, the party of former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, who is focused on talks with Palestinians, gained seven seats. Another poll says Meretz, a longtime left-wing party, gained at least five seats. ""Politics is often about expectations,"" said David Makovsky, an Israeli analyst at the the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""Once the public thought that Netanyahu was a shoo-in, it assumed his victory and looked for a fresh face that would be focused on issues that he has not prioritized. This explains the meteoric rise of a new party (Yesh Atid) which said it would focus on the middle class and find a way so the ultra-Orthodox participate in burden-sharing by joining either the compulsory army or civilian form of mandatory service."" One party in Israel never gets a parliamentary majority of more than 60 seats, so parties must rely on coalition-building. The question is whether Netanyahu will stay on the right or move to the center. Will Netanyahu form a right-wing coalition with Jewish Home and religious blocs such as Shas -- which earned between 11 and 13 seats, exit polls show? Or will he move to the center and try to form a coalition with Yesh Atid, for example, and others? Or is it possible that a center-left coalition could be cobbled together, without the right wing? Netanyahu and his party sensed Yesh Atid's momentum. He called on his backers to come out and vote. ""The Likud government is in danger, go vote for us for the sake of the country's future,"" he was quoted as saying. Opinion: Don't expect an Obama-Netanyahu blowup . After the exit polls rolled in, Netanyahu thanked Israelis on Facebook for his showing and indicated that he wants to ""a very wide government"" as the hard work of coalition building begins on Wednesday. ""The (election) results observed are a great opportunity for many changes for the benefit of all citizens of Israel. The complications ahead of us are many and wide, as from tonight I will start my efforts to form a very wide government as possible."" Michael Singh, managing director at the Washington institute, said the result reflects polarized politics in Israel. The immediate consequences of the result is that coalition building will be quite difficult and time-consuming, he said. The worst-case scenario would be government paralysis and maybe another election sooner rather than later. While he said it's possible that a centrist coalition led by Yesh Atid, which means ""there is a future,"" and Labor could emerge, Singh thinks Netanyahu and Lapid will form a government. Likud celebrated after the results came in. Danny Danon, a Likud party member expected to serve in the next Knesset, was asked why the Israeli-Palestinian peace process hasn't been front and center in the campaign. Both talks and the issue of Iran were not as prominent among factors as expected by many observers. Domestic issues, in contrast, played a large role in the campaign. Israel has no partner among Palestinians, Danon said, and noted that peace initiatives have been tried but haven't borne fruit. He cited the situation in Gaza, where militants fire missiles into Israel despite the country's departure from that Palestinian territory. Israel launched an offensive against Palestinian militants in Gaza last year after enduring missile fire on its territory. The next government, he said, will reach out to Palestinians ""but will also continue to make sure Israelis are strong and safe."" Israel doesn't ""want to see an al Qaeda state in our backyard,"" Danon said. Makovsky said the election is good news for the Obama administration, which has had prickly relations with the right-wing Netanyahu government. It comes after a high turnout -- the percentage of eligible voters who cast a vote was 66.6%, just 1% more than the 2009 election. ""It's unclear if Netanyahu wanted a pure right-wing option in the first place,"" he said. ""But Washington can breathe a sigh of relief that Netanyahu will need to reach accommodation with some parties at the center of the map who essentially would like to see progress on the Palestinian issue as well as on economic issues."" CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta. CNN's Sara Sidner, Kareem Khadder and Nicola Goulding reported from Israel.","Netanyahu's party wins but the centrists do well, exit polls show .

"(CNN) -- Irreverent? Obscene? Glorious? While some parts of the world are instituting bikini bans and campaigning for travelers to cover up, elsewhere, travelers are encouraging others to take it off on social media for everyone to see. What began as a spontaneous idea and Instagram post has sparked a stream of travelers to send in fun, topless photos -- taken from the back -- to be featured on the social media channels of the Topless Tour, which began as an Instagram project. Judging from the enthusiastic response and growing number of participants, there's something about posing topless that heightens the feeling of liberation and adventure while traveling. Japan's 'anti-loneliness cafe' goes viral . How it started . The Topless Tour was started two years ago by friends Olivia Edginton, 20, Lydia Buckler, 21, and Ingvild Marstein Olsen, 20, students at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music & Dance in London. After taking an impromptu topless dip in a cold lake in Olsen's hometown in Norway, the three friends wanted to capture the moment of freedom. ""It simply just happened, no planning involved,"" Edginton wrote in an e-mail. They continued to travel and post similar photos throughout Europe and New York, all featuring themselves in topless poses against dramatic backgrounds. Then they called for others to send in their topless photos from around the world. From Idaho to Cape Town to Thailand, the mildly salacious images poured in. Among the more amazing submissions: a woman bungee jumping topless in the Swiss Alps. More to come . The Topless Tour currently has nearly 20,000 followers on Instagram. That number is increasing quickly as the trio and a growing community continue to document their travels with bare backs. Although the topless photos come predominantly from women, many men have submitted as well. ""We never imagined it would have such global reach and appreciation,"" Edginton said. ""It was always just something we would hope would catch on, never really thinking it would happen."" For the trio leading the Tour, the best part of the experience has been hearing people's stories from all over the globe, and how the project has helped people ""feel themselves again, be proud of who they are and love their beautiful bodies,"" said Edginton. ""One of our followers recently said these lovely words: 'All that pressure and judging went away. And so did my shirt. I felt free, happy, and me.'

"(CNN) -- Russia's controversial anti-gay propaganda law has sparked the ""defining civil rights movement of our time"" according to U.S. athlete Nick Symmonds. The recently implemented law has been criticized by U.S. President Barack Obama and there have been calls by some to boycott next year's winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi. It bars ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors"" and so effectively prevents gay people from expressing their sexuality in public. ""As an American who believes in freedom of speech and freedom of assembly I take huge offense that the Russian government is limiting their people in that way,"" Symmonds told CNN Friday. Already a talking point at the track and field world championships in Moscow, the issue intensified when one of Russia's greatest athletes, Yelena Isinbayeva, appeared to back her nation's stance Thursday. ""If we allow to promote and do all this stuff on the street, we are very afraid about our nation because we consider ourselves like normal, standard people,"" Isinbayeva said in English at a press conference. ""We just live boys with woman, women with boys."" After the pole vaulter was criticized, too -- Symmonds was one of those who took offense -- she backtracked Friday, claiming she had been misunderstood as English wasn't her first language. But even before Isinbayeva's comments, Symmonds had stated his disapproval with the law in his blog for Runner's World -- though he promised to not discuss the subject during the championships. However he ""couldn't stay silent anymore"" after watching a CNN story that showed two Russian women shoved to the ground after they appeared to kiss each other in the street. It was ""based on nothing more than they wanted to express their love for each other,"" he told CNN. ""I was just appalled."" Symmonds dedicated the silver medal he won in the 800 meters Tuesday to his gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender friends in the U.S., British newspaper the Independent reported. ""This is the defining civil rights movement of our time,"" Symmonds told CNN. ""I just want to say in 100 years when people look back on this moment, the people who are against equality and against love are going to be remembered on the wrong side of history. ""And I'm honored to be standing alongside our gay and lesbian friends on the right side of history."" He isn't the only competitor at the world championships supporting gay rights. Swedish high-jumper Emma Green Tregaro and sprinter Mao Hjelmer wore rainbow-colored fingernails in their events. Green Tregaro posted a picture on her Instagram account captioned: ""Nails painted in rainbow sign#pride#moscow2013."" That prompted Isinbayeva to hit back. She complained about the Swedes being ""unrespectful to our country"" and ""unrespectful to our citizens because we are Russians. ""We have our home and everyone has to respect (it). When we arrive to different countries, we try to follow their rules."" Symmonds said he was trying to be respectful but felt he had to speak up. ""I'm a guest in this nation,"" he told CNN. ""And if I really wanted to press this issue I could go a lot further and be assembling in the streets but I want to be respectful. Respect the fact that there are a lot of competitors around here that still have to compete and I'm trying to not create a huge distraction for them. ""But at the same time, you watch that video and if that just doesn't show how antiquated some people's thoughts are on this issue, then I don't know what does. ""Running around in circles is great. Winning medals is awesome. If you can maybe change the mind of people for the better and encourage love and equality, then that's what this is really all about.""","U.S. runner Nick Symmonds slams Russia's controversial anti-gay propaganda law .

"(CNN) -- A Florida jury found a teenager guilty Thursday of impersonating a physician assistant and practicing medicine without a license. Matthew Scheidt spent some two weeks posing as a professional at the Osceola Regional Medical Center in August 2011. He was just 17 at the time. Scheidt told investigators he went to the hospital last year to get a badge for his job as a clerk at a doctor's office across the street. But he said someone botched the paperwork. He was charged with two counts of impersonating a physician assistant and three counts of practicing medicine without a license. He was found guilty on four of the five counts, excluding one count of practicing medicine without a license. Scheidt is scheduled to be sentenced on November 14. Each count carries a maximum of five years in prison. According to prosecutors, Scheidt worked in the hospital's emergency room, changing bandages and helping to conduct exams. He sported a lab coat, scrubs and a stethoscope, in addition to the badge that identified him as a physician assistant. He held the hand of a child who was getting sutures and helped to restrain an unruly psychiatric patient, trial testimony showed. After his arrest, Scheidt admitted to performing CPR on a patient suffering from a drug overdose, authorities told CNN affiliate WFTV. ""I felt so uncomfortable even doing that. And, you know, the only reason why I did do it was because there was nobody else in there. And I'm not going to let her die,"" he told investigators at the time, according to the television station. During his interrogation, Scheidt confessed and admitted he had made mistakes, according to WFTV. ""I messed up. I should have addressed the issue when it was given to me. I just didn't want any questions asked, like I just wanted to learn as much as I possibly could,"" he said. Scheidt pleaded not guilty to the charges and had sought to get his confession thrown out of court. The defense argued that Scheidt presented himself as a student, not a physician assistant, and that whatever contact he had with patients was minimal and meant simply to provide comfort. He was arrested in September 2011 and allowed to bond out. But in January, Scheidt was back in police custody. The charge: impersonating a police officer. CNN's Lateef Mungin and In Session's Aletse Mellado contributed to this report.","Matthew Scheidt was just 17 years old when he posed as a medical professional .

"(CNN) -- Champions of equal protection had their day in court -- but it was a highly politicized day in the Supreme Court. Unlike the 1967 interracial marriage case of Loving v. Virginia, the gay rights decision in United States v. Windsor, while also a victory for civil rights, is not a moment of legal clarity or coherence. In court politicization, Windsor is closer to Bush v. Gore. How cases end matters. The Loving case, at 9-0, was a victory for civil rights wrapped in a moment of Supreme clarity; 5-4 Windsor is a victory wrapped in a Supreme food fight. Almost a half-century ago, Chief Justice Warren delivered a unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court, invalidating state laws prohibiting interracial marriage. Sixteen states maintained such laws, including Virginia. Loving invalidated laws banning interracial marriage. Windsor invalidated federal law denying benefits to homosexual couples married in states permitting same-sex marriage. A comparison of the two cases reveals how divided and divisive our court is today. Richard and Mildred Loving were a mixed-race couple validly married in the District of Columbia, who upon returning home to Virginia faced continuing arrest and harassment by local police for violating Virginia's miscegenation laws. After a decade-long cat-and-mouse game with the local authorities and a parallel odyssey through Virginia courts, the Lovings were vindicated when a unanimous Supreme Court held that state miscegenation laws were unconstitutional since they ""rest solely on distinctions drawn according to race"" and have ""no legitimate overriding purposes independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification."" The court held marriage to be among the ""basic civil rights"" that no state can infringe. Doctrine was born. Several years ago, the documentarian Nancy Buirski asked me to executive produce ""The Loving Story,"" a documentary film chronicling a civil rights story and a love story. HBO co-produced the film. America loved Loving, with its legal and moral clarity. The film was a top performer at the 2011 New York Tribeca Film Festival. HBO began airing it on television on Valentine's Day 2012. This year the film won a Peabody. Loving v. Virginia was notable for its coherence as the court's resolution of a legal odyssey. Today's legal culture includes conservative judges accusing jurists of partisanship at every turn, even the hardest cases. Call it Supreme Gridlock. The dissent in Windsor excoriates the majority as ""hungry"" to grandstand in a case it claims was never properly before the court -- ignoring that Edith Windsor had won a judgment for an estate-tax refund that the U.S. government refused to honor unless the Supreme Court would invalidate the Defense of Marriage Act. Justice Antonin Scalia was wedded to his technicalities and indifferent to Ms. Windsor's equities. The dissent slams the majority for ""rootless and shifting"" reasoning and claims the majority views DOMA's supporters as having ""hateful hearts,"" a politicized barb at odds with the muted language with which the majority duly inspected the legislative purpose of DOMA. Scalia is erudite but dead wrong in claiming, ""In the majority's telling, this story is black and white. Hate your neighbors or come along with us."" Come again? DOMA said the federal government could declare the validly married same-sex couple next door unqualified for any federal benefits extended to married heterosexual couples. And the court's majority is mongering hate? Joining the politicized dissent is Justice Samuel Alito: ""The family is an ancient and universal human institution"" and ""changes in family structure and in the popular understanding of marriage and the family can have profound effects."" One struggles to rest much on these generalities. Similarly one would struggle to rely much on the broad intonations of the overruled state court judge in Loving: . ""Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And, but for the interference with his arrangement, there would be no cause for such marriage. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix."" The entire 1967 court could spot poppycock when it saw it. Chief Justice Earl Warren, concerned with precedent more than politics, probably nonetheless had to do some arm twisting to get unanimity, but he got it. In 2013, by contrast, a virulent dissent offers new polemics -- and then accuses the majority of being politicized. Loving ended with legal and moral clarity. The New York Times headline read, ""Justices Upset All Bans on Interracial Marriage, 9-0 Decision Rules."" Windsor ended with, well, democracy still working its virulent ways, including at the court, whose members of its right flank were knitting angrily in their chambers. The dissent reaches for judicial temperament but unleashes judicial temper. Perhaps it is time for a new documentary, ""The Windsor Story."" This one too will have a happy ending for the original petitioners, but this time told through the lens of Supreme Gridlock. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marshall Sonenshine.","Marshall Sonenshine: Equality won for same-sex marriage, but it was far from a slam dunk .
In 1967, court ruled 9-0 in Loving that interracial marriage ban was unconstitutional .
He says Loving had legal and moral clarity; Windsor case at 5-4 vote was politically charged ."
"Stockholm (CNN) -- Stockholm fashion may not have the clout of Parisian haute couture or the glamor of Milan's upscale brands. But the city is turning its flair for sleek design into a major business export. ""Sweden is the only country that has created a unique fashion aesthetic that's recognizable around the world,"" says Yvan Rodic, a fashion blogger and photographer based in London. Along with other fashion writers such as blogger ""Susie Bubble"" and The Telegraph's Hilary Alexander, Rodic traveled to Stockholm to see the city's signature minimalistic designs gracing the runways during its Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Stockholm, when major labels unveiled their new collections for the press. Stockholm Fashion Week, meanwhile, runs until February 12. Rodic points to understated fabrics and discreetly chosen colors as reasons behind the devoted following local designers have built up in the last decade. Rodic, who runs the Facehunter blog -- with over 58,000 followers on Twitter -- says Sweden offers young, affordable and cool brands for those who aren't attracted to the fashion coming out of Paris and Milan. That fashion is seen as ""expensive, serious and pretentious,"" he says. H&M is one affordable Swedish brand which has contributed to the country's rising exports sales. But other labels, including Cheap Monday,Tiger of Sweden and Acne Studios are all making their mark on the global stage. Celebrities spotted wearing Acne denim include Rihanna, ""True Blood"" star Alexander Skarsgard and Jared Leto. Other brands are also in demand, with ""Gossip Girl"" actor Ed Westwick spotted wearing J. Lindeberg. High end brands are also thriving, with labels such as Mayla securing customers such as Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria. Designer and owner Marlene ""Mayla"" Abraham says she sold dresses to top stores in Tokyo, San Francisco and New York before branching out into other Scandinavian countries, as she was able to tap international interest in Swedish design. The successes are showing on the country's bottom line, with Sweden's textile exports hitting SEK10 billion in 2010 ($1.5 billion), a 10% increase compared to 2009, according to Sweden's Minister for Trade, Ewa Bjorling. The numbers are ""especially positive"" given overall exports fell by 17% due to the financial crisis, Bjorling says. Bjorling -- who is travelling to Shanghai this fall to promote Swedish fashion -- believes exports can be doubled by 2015, particularly if the industry can tap emerging markets. So what is the secret formula behind the popularity of Swedish fashion? Rodic, a regular attendee of Stockholm Fashion Week, says the country's blogging culture contributed to its global success. ""Sweden is a pioneering country when it comes to blogging,"" he says. ""In the last decade, people from around the world have started looking at Swedish blogs for inspiration -- mostly to enjoy the photos since they don't necessarily understand the language."" Readers have then been educated on the brands and how to create outfits without spending a fortune. ""I think this was a perfect match for the world of blogging since it promotes individuality and helped Sweden become a mini phenomenon in fashion,"" Rodic says.","Sweden is turning its flair for sleek design into a major business export .

"(CNN) -- If there's one thing better than snooping around a stranger's home, it's snooping around a stranger's home without being arrested. This weekend in London, there's a rare chance to do just this with more than 800 normally-closed landmarks, including architecturally interesting family houses, throwing wide their doors to the public. It's all part of Open House London, an annual event now in its 22nd year that lets thousands of people wander around and gawp at some of the city's most impressive buildings -- as well as some lesser known gems. Often there's also a chance to meet and chat to the architect -- and it's all free. The weekends have proved so successful, they've been adopted by 24 cities around the world, including Melbourne, Buenos Aires and Oslo. Open House Worldwide scatters its events across the calendar, potentially allowing globetrotting architecture addicts to hit several in the space of a few weeks. Following London's September 20-21 showcase, October sees New York follow suit, alongside other destinations such as Lisbon, Dublin, Chicago, Barcelona and Thessaloniki in Greece. This year's big draws in London are expected to be some of its tallest skyscrapers -- among them the gherkin-shaped 30 St. Mary Axe and another giant known as the Cheesegrater. Churches, cinemas, theaters, colleges, government buildings and subterranean top secret wartime bunkers are also included. There are also numerous homes, including one of the country's most recognizable -- the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street.

"Houston (CNN) -- When Joshua Gandara heard his cousin, Houston firefighter Robert Bebee, had died suddenly, he instinctively knew why. ""I knew (he was) saving somebody,"" Gandara said. ""That's him. ... He always put people first, before him. Anybody's needs before his needs."" Relatives of the 41-year-old Bebee -- including his parents, sister and nieces -- are not alone in their mourning. Four Houston firefighters, total, died when a wall collapsed during a major blaze Friday at a hotel. There was Matthew Renaud, a 35-year-old who worked out of five stations in the 12 years he was with the Houston Fire Department. Robert Garner, 29, had been at Fire Station 68 since joining the department in October 2010. The youngest victim was Anne Sullivan, a 24-year-old who graduated from the city's firefighter academy in April. ""She was very passionate, very strong, (very) beautiful, and she was very dedicated to her career,"" Sullivan's friend and fellow firefighter Ryche Guerrero said. ""She inspired me."" Firefighter killed in Dallas blaze . The five-alarm blaze began in the Bhojan Vegetarian Indian Cuisine restaurant, where ""the majority of the fire was ... in the front,"" according to fire Capt. Ruy Lozano. It ended up spreading to the adjacent Southwest Inn, which is in the southwest part of Houston along the Southwest Freeway. Recalled Guerrero, ""I'm just amazed at how big the fire was and how quickly it spread, how the smoke was just billowing in different directions."" City fire Chief Terry Garrison explained Friday that some of the more than 150 firefighters responding to the blaze went inside the structure ""because we thought we had some civilians in the structure."" As Lozano explained, it was during normal business hours and there was reason to believe people we're inside. ""There was every indication to think that there was a life to be saved,"" he said. But when they got in, the first responders found ""the building had much more fire in it than we originally thought,"" according to Garrison. Parts of the structure collapsed, killing three firefighters at the scene, and leading to the death of the other at a hospital. Fellow firefighters quickly sprang into action, some digging through the rubble to get to their colleagues. Garrison said the death toll could have been much higher if not for their bravery and quick action. ""(There were) dozens and dozens of acts of courage that took place in the seconds when that wall came in,"" the chief said. Thirteen other firefighters were hurt in the incident, five of whom were still hospitalized Saturday afternoon. That figure includes one who Lozano said is in ""extremely critical"" condition and one who had surgery Saturday and faces ""probably more surgeries to come."" The fire captain told CNN there are ""a multitude of situations going on"" related to their ailments, from heat exhaustion to injuries to their legs and more. Given the total number of casualties, Houston Mayor Annise Parker said Friday will ""go down ... as the worst day in the history of the Houston Fire Department."" Members of the department, which is the third-biggest in the nation, are leaning on each other to get over the loss of their colleagues. ""We're one of the biggest families you'll ever meet,"" Lozano said. ""We're very close. ... We take pride in having a little city attitude in a big city."" The building that went up in flames had been inspected, with follow-up visits, within the year, said Lozano, who didn't offer any details on what they found. Volunteer firefighters step up despite personal tragedy in West, Texas . Authorities have not yet determined the cause of the blaze. Members of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the site on Saturday, as were members of the State Fire Marshal's office, the Houston Fire Department's homicide division and the Texas Rangers. ""By bringing in these outside agencies and treating it like a crime scene, and there's no reason to believe that it is, we're able to maintain that sterile environment in efforts not only to determine the cause but also to hopefully learn from it so, hopefully, it never happens again,"" Lozano said. A funeral service for the four firefighters killed is scheduled for Wednesday at Reliant Stadium, home of the NFL's Houston Texans. In addition to trying to help the families of those killed, the fire department is also trying to take care of its own. ""The firefighters are having to look to each other, look to their families, look to their faith and look to the firefighter support network to get through it,"" an emotional Lozano said. ""... They also think about when they get home and their kids ask, 'What happened?' And how do you tell them? So it's a difficult time."" Assistant State Fire Marshal Kelly Kistner told CNN that 18 Texas firefighters have died on duty so far this year, including 10 first responders killed in an explosion at a fertilizer distribution facility in West, Texas. To put this number into context, 83 firefighters were killed on the job nationwide all of last year, the U.S. Fire Administration reported. Already, more Texas firefighters have died in 2013 than over the past five years combined, according to Kistner. ""When we have one line of duty death, that's too many. And we're at 18 this year,"" Kistner said. ""It's a rough year for Texas."" CNN's Sara Ganim reported from Houston, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote and reported from Atlanta.

""I don't think the President is on the ballot as much as Mitch McConnell might want him to be."" Some Republicans were quick to notice the awkward moment and post the short clip to YouTube. She did, however, lend her support to another major Democratic political figure: Former President Bill Clinton. ""I think Kentuckians know I'm a Clinton Democrat through and through."" Clinton, an active campaigner for Grimes, is a decades-old friend of Grimes father, the former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party. Grimes' refusal to say whether she voted for Obama is the most recent in a series of attempts to distance herself with an unpopular President, who endures a meager 35% job approval rating in the Bluegrass State, according to an October Fox poll. On her campaign website, Grimes calls Obama's policies on coal ""misguided,"" arguing that his efforts ""harm hard-working Kentuckians and their families."" The energy-rich state is known for its coal industry, prompting Grimes to release a ""Pro Coal plan"" while other Democrats, including the President, have bristled at Kentucky's sky high carbon emissions.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao underlined the Asian giant's regional military ambitions and economic challenges Monday in a speech that opened the annual meeting of the country's legislators. China intends to further tailor its military to ensure it is able to prevail in conflicts in its vicinity, Wen said in a speech to the National People's Congress, a 10-day gathering in Beijing of about 3,000 delegates from across the country. ""We will enhance the armed forces' capability to accomplish a wide range of military tasks. Most important is to win local wars under information-age conditions,"" Wen said. His made his comments a day after China said it planned to increase its defense budget by 11.2% to some 670 billion yuan ($106.4 billion) this year, following similar increases in previous years and a renewed strategic push by the United States in the region. The focus on local conflicts is a key part of China's military blueprint -- the country is locked in territorial disputes with several of its neighbors. It regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to use force against the island if it ever formally sought independence. China has also claimed significant portions of the seas off its coast as its own territorial waters, putting it at loggerheads with other nations like Japan and Vietnam that have their own claims on the areas. As well as pouring more resources into the military, the authorities are also ramping up spending on internal security, according to a Ministry of Finance report released Monday. The document forecast that central and local government spending on police and other domestic security organs would increase to 701.8 billion yuan ($111.3 billion), from 629.3 billion yuan ($99.8 billion) in 2011. Read other issues China's Party Congress will tackle . China is grappling with unrest among its Tibetan population in southwestern regions and among the Uighur population in the far western province of Xinjiang. In his speech Monday, Wen also set a lower target for China's economic growth, underscoring the need to make the country's breakneck development more sustainable. The government is aiming for economic growth of 7.5% in 2012, Wen said, lower than the goal for last year of about 8%. But the Chinese economy often exceeds the official objective: last year it grew 9.2%. ""China's economy is encountering new problems,"" he said. ""There is downward pressure on economic growth. Prices remain high."" Chinese officials are concerned about high inflation and perceptions of a growing divide between rich and poor, as well as the threat of faltering overseas demand for the country's exports. Wen also mentioned challenges the country faced in real estate, agriculture, land rights and food and drug safety. The National People's Congress at which Wen was speaking is constitutionally the highest organ of power in China, although it has long been considered a rubber-stamp parliament. It passes virtually every measure, resolution and law put forward by the government or the Communist Party. CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","China aims to tailor its military to ensure it can win local conflicts, prime minster says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The worst oil spill in U.S. history has heated up the debate about how to feed the nation with cleaner, safer energy. The argument over whether to ""drill baby drill"" -- the 2008 GOP campaign mantra -- returned in April after a deadly oil rig blast spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The disaster threatened jobs in the nation's seafood and tourism industries and hundreds of miles of sensitive wetlands, marshes and wildlife. The spill came as President Obama was backing expanded offshore oil drilling and as Congress considered wide-ranging energy legislation aimed at cutting pollution and U.S. dependency on foreign oil. Before BP's Gulf oil disaster, Obama's late March proposal called for opening swaths of U.S. coastal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico to oil and natural gas drilling. After the spill, Obama said offshore drilling is key to ""our energy future,"" but it can move forward only with assurances that the Gulf disaster won't be repeated. The president halted drilling permits for new wells and ordered inspections of all deepwater operations. Former GOP vice presidential nominee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- who in 2008 called on the U.S. to ""drill baby drill"" in the protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- tweeted that Obama should offset his drilling moratorium by ""correspondingly"" allowing ""more onshore drilling, including ANWR reserves. Domestic oil's still required in US industry."" Will the spill change Obama's oil policy? Senate Democrats gave up on their goal of passing a slimmed-down energy bill before August recess. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blamed unified Republican opposition to the proposal.   ""It's a sad day when you can't find a handful of Republicans to support a bill that would create 70,000 clean-energy jobs, hold BP accountable, and look at a future as it relates to what BP did."" Republicans pointed at Reid. ""Sen. Reid is predictably blaming Republicans for standing in the way of a bill that he threw together in secret and without input from almost any other member of the Senate,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the top Republican on the energy committee. ""Process alone guaranteed its failure, although substance would have as well had Sen. Reid actually brought his bill up for debate or a vote."" The Democratic bill had been stripped of its most controversial components such as limits on carbon emissions. The remaining legislation would have eliminated a $75-million cap on economic damages that offshore oil drillers would be responsible for. It would have reformed federal government oversight of offshore drilling. It encouraged the use of natural gas engines in commercial trucks; and it promoted high efficiency appliances in homes. Republicans planned to offer an alternative bill that included lifting the Obama administration's blanket moratorium on deepwater drilling, setting up a bipartisan commission with subpoena power to investigate the Gulf oil disaster and propose reforms, and allowing for revenue sharing for states that permit offshore drilling. An energy bill passed last year by the House of Representatives included a controversial cap-and-trade system. The system would set a price for greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, and polluters would obtain and trade credits for emissions over a set threshold.   Republicans and oil and coal producers oppose such a plan. Supporters say it's the best way to begin reducing U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. Would a nuclear power comeback be a good thing? Obama has been a key figure in energy talks among lawmakers.   In late June, he met with a bipartisan group of senators at the White House to discuss passing an energy and climate change bill this year.   The president had expressed hope that something could be done.  ""There was agreement on the sense of urgency required to move forward with legislation, and the president is confident that we will be able to get something done this year,"" the White House said in a statement. Obama told senators that he believed the best way to make a transition to a clean-energy economy is with a bill that ""makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America's businesses by putting a price on pollution,"" the statement said. CNN Congressional Producer Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Worst U.S. oil spill heightens debate over ways to feed nation's energy needs .

"(Mental Floss) -- When it comes to parasites, it's all about perspective. You may call a lifetime of growing and feeding off another organism lazy, but we call it opportunistic. In fact, these life-sucking go-getters have managed to carve out some of the most ingenious survival strategies in the world. This snapper refused comment when asked if he still had a tongue. 1. Cymothoa exigua: Biting your tongue, so you don't have to . When fish mommies want to strike fear in the hearts of their misbehaving fish babies, we suspect they draw on the chilling animal savagery of the Cymothoa exigua. As a youngster, this nasty little parasitic crustacean begins a life of terror by fighting its way through the gills of its fish host of choice, the snapper. Once there, it attaches itself to the fish's tongue and begins feeding on the rich blood pumping through the artery underneath. As the parasite grows, it drinks more blood and eventually causes the tongue to atrophy and disintegrate. But does the Cymothoa mouth-squatter leave its fishy friend tongueless? Of course not. It does what any crafty parasite would do and replaces the old tongue with its own body. The fish is actually able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue, only it has to share all the food with its new friend. Yes, the whole foster-tongue thing seems like a pretty nice gesture on the part of ol' Cymothoa --until you remember there was nothing wrong with the fish's old tongue in the first place. 2. Sacculina carcini: Reasons you shouldn't pick up a hitchhiker . If you ever have a choice between being possessed by the devil and being possessed by a Sacculina carcini, opt for the devil -- no contest. A female sacculina begins life as a tiny free-floating slug in the sea, drifting around until she encounters a crab. When that fateful day arrives, she finds a chink in the crab's armor (usually an elbow or leg joint) and thrusts a kind of hollow dagger into its body. After that, she (how to put this?) ""injects"" herself into the crab, sluicing through the dagger and leaving behind a husk. Once inside, the jellylike sacculina starts to take over. She grows ""roots"" that extend to every part of the crab's body -- wrapping around its eyestalks and deep into its legs and arms. The female feeds and grows until eventually she pops out the top of the crab, and from this knobby protrusion, she will steer the Good Ship Unlucky Crab for the rest of their commingled life. Packed full of parasite, the crab will forgo its own needs to serve those of its master. It won't molt, grow reproductive organs, or attempt to reproduce. It won't even regrow appendages, as healthy crabs can. Rather than waste the nutrients on itself, a host crab will hobble along and continue to look for food with which to feed its parasite master. 3. Filarial Worms: Proof you need thicker skin . Filarial worms are the nasty little suckers you can thank for lymphatic filariasis, which, according to the Pacific Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, is the second-leading cause of permanent and long-term disability in the world. (Mental illness is No. 1.) Filarial worms are round, thread-like parasites that travel from human to human via that harbinger of disease transmission, the mosquito. How do they make the leap of host? In an interesting (if scary) example of parasite ingenuity, filarial worm embryos living underneath the skin can sense the onset of night, which is their cue to head upward to the skin's surface in order to increase their chances of being picked up by a passing 'skeeter. Should they get sucked up, they grow into larvae within the mosquito's muscle fibers and then get themselves injected into new hosts. Once they've returned to a human home, they open up a franchise in the family business -- Wreaking Havoc. Filaria often lodge in the body's lymphatic system, where they can inflict any number of torturous symptoms, not the least of which involves carting your genitals off to the elephantiasis clinic in a wheelbarrow. 4. Guinea Worms: Exposing parts nobody wants to see . Where there are guinea worms, there is Guinea Worm Disease -- and that's usually in Africa. When a human consumes water contaminated with guinea worms, the little buggers infiltrate their host's intestinal walls and commence mating. After conception, the males die off, and the females hang around for about a year, growing and eating. Eventually, these slender ladies get bored and decide they need to lay some eggs. To do so, they make their way down the body to the lower extremities, where they bore a small hole through the skin. The resulting lesion begins to fester and burn, which usually leads the host to plunge his or her foot into a soothing bucket of water. (Of course, in areas where an entire village shares a single water source, this helps spread the infection.) Unfortunately for the sufferer, the water doesn't solve the problem of having a three-foot female worm dangling its genitalia out of your foot. And to complicate matters, if you yank on that sucker, it'll break apart and could cause a fatal infection. So how do you rid yourself of the not-so-little hitchhiker? You go see a doctor, who -- over the course of three or four weeks -- will kindly wind the worm around a stick, inch by agonizing inch. Not the most pleasant method, but certainly a proven one. This cure for a guinea worm infection has been around so long, some believe it's where we get the snakes-around-a-staff symbol for medicine. 5. Leucochloridium paradoxum: Parasite for sore eyes . Prepare to be dazzled. This parasite's got a life cycle more mind-bending and chilling than an M. Night Shyamalan film. Leucochloridium paradoxum are a type of fluke (a.k.a., parasitic flatworm) that prey on birds -- a fascinating turn of events considering they begin their lives as eggs in bird droppings. Thus, the problem facing baby Leucochloridium paradoxum is, ""How do I get myself back into one of those feathery things?"" Taking a page from Greek history, the infant flatworms rely on Trojan trickery. First, they hang out in the droppings until a snail happens along and eats the bird dung. Then they initiate their devious plan of action by taking up residence in the snail's eyestalks. (Sure, it sounds slimy and gross to us, but after a childhood spent living in bird feces, it's a step up.) As they mature, the flukes become visible through the snail's translucent skin. And that's when things really get interesting. To a bird, this fluke-filled eyestalk looks like a caterpillar. So the bird devours the stalk and ends up with a bellyful of Leucochloridium paradoxum that will, of course, lay eggs and begin the cycle again. Meanwhile, the snail shakes its head, shops for an eye patch, and vows never to eat feces again. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- South African newspaper columnist Jani Allan accused Oscar Pistorius of taking ""acting lessons"" before his testimony at his murder trial. Pistorius has claimed that he accidentally killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp after mistaking her for an intruder to his home in Pretoria. I have to admit, as a criminal defense attorney, I found his testimony unusually well-focused and on-point as he attempted to accomplish what he needed to. It was this: to convince the judge (there is no jury in this case) that he was acting out of instinct and fear--rather than anger and hatred--when he fired four fatal shots through a locked bathroom door. Is it not Pistorius' right to figure out how to best present that position to the judge? Is it somehow wrong for a defendant to craft or polish his presentation to positively affect the judge's (or jury's) decision? Yes, it is his right, and no it's not wrong; welcome to the underbelly of litigation. However, it's the same underbelly that exists in business and even in social interactions. We all learn even as children to speak properly, to ""mind our manners"" and to ""put our best foot forward."" Suggesting that people don't prepare for or rehearse important interactions is not just folly; it goes against what we've been taught since we've learned to listen. On that first date, we try to look as good as we can, be as funny as we can, appear as insightful as we can. Before a job interview we study the employer and the industry. Before asking for a raise, we present our value in the warmest light possible. Good lawyers have spent their careers learning how to present their clients in the most favorable light possible during litigation. It's our responsibility. Criminal defense lawyers learn how to be persuasive and genuine when presenting their side of the story. We are trained to represent clients, any clients, as best we can and to seek the proper result for that client. Prosecutors know how to polish their presentations as well. In civil law, when many millions of dollars are on the line, corporate representatives plan for hours, days, weeks, months--even years--to properly present their side of the case. They take part in mock trial, the sole purpose of which is to identify and correct weaknesses in their presentation, to gain insight from how that presentation worked with mock jurors. Back to the question at hand: Did Pistorius have acting lessons? This will now sound insincere, but I have never, not in 30 years of practice, had a client take ""acting lessons"" or any other lessons regarding how to testify. But I have spent hours with witnesses and clients reviewing with them how to present themselves and their story in the most compelling and believable way. But remember this: Law enforcement officers also go through extensive training in how to present themselves in a courtroom, from subtleties as simple as turning toward the jury when answering a question to presenting their testimony in simple, easy-to-understand phrases, to raising and lowering their voices at just the right time. Expert witnesses are paid well for their ability to communicate their testimony effectively and believably to a jury. So is it any less appropriate for Pistorius to have reviewed his testimony with his lawyers? Would it be wrong if Pistorius had the benefit of a ""testimony presentation expert""? The answer is no, it is not inappropriate, as long as Pistorius was telling the truth. The important question is: Did he present his testimony in a way in which the judge believed he was sincere? Or will the judge believe he was coached and acting? Judges and jurors alike are not easily fooled, and they bring to the courtroom life experiences that prepare them to detect deception and insincerity. It is also the duty of the advocates on both sides of the story to advise or remind the fact finders that testimony is what it is: prepared, coached, rehearsed and presented as well as possible. My belief is that Pistorius was absolutely coached. I also believe the judge thinks so, too, and when she weighs Pistorius' testimony, she will take into consideration that it was perhaps too well polished and that it was too well rehearsed. That was, after all, a significant goal of the blistering cross examination, to show that coaching. I say we trust in fact finders -- in this case the judge, and, in the United States, the jurors -- and understand that they know how to balance the content of a testimony with the sincerity, or lack of sincerity, with which it was delivered.","Mark O'Mara: Writer charged murder defendant Pistorius took ""acting lessons"" for court .
O'Mara: True, he seemed on-point, but why shouldn't he be? He's trying to show innocence .
He says in litigation, as in life, we show ourselves in best light. Lawyers indeed coach clients .
O'Mara: Police, prosecutors, witnesses do it, too. Welcome to litigation. Pistorius is entitled ."
"(CNN) -- As video game players, our focus often falls on the freshest, most exciting new digital diversions. But much as we're all looking forward to hearing more about ""Civilization V"" and ""DJ Hero 2"" at the E3 trade show this week, it pays to remember: These titles stand on the shoulders of giants. For every exciting new present-day debut, dozens of predecessors helped pave the way for their bar-raising delivery or game-play innovations. Consider the following list, which highlights 10 of the last decade's best and most influential games. It may be hard to recall their place in history amidst a sea of splashy trailers for ""Gears of War 3"" or ""Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light."" But take our word for it: On the eve of potentially mind-blowing outings from ""Crysis 2"" to ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution,"" the modern era's most acclaimed titles wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the pioneering efforts of these 10 games, making each worth dusting off and replaying as a reminder of just how far we've come. What are your favorite video games? ""The Sims"" (Maxis/EA, PC -- 2000) -- An interactive dollhouse filled with little computer people that's among the first games to recreate reality itself. Not only did the cleverly disguised strategy title open the door for modern classics like evolutionary simulator ""Spore,"" but its familiar settings and relevant topic also showed that electronic amusements could resonate with all ages and genders (a precursor to today's casual/social gaming sensations), making it the best-selling PC game of all time. ""BioShock"" (2K Games, PC/PS3/360 -- 2007) -- Dark, brooding and sinister, this hybrid role-playing game and first-person shooter (wherein you wander a mutant-infested, capsizing undersea art deco utopia) wowed as much for its Oscar-level script writing as haunting environs. Equally impressive was one's ability to use guns and customizable genetic superpowers in endless combinations to uncover the secrets of a world as rich as any of its tragically flawed characters. ""Grand Theft Auto III"" (Rockstar Games, PC/PS2 -- 2001) -- Never mind critics and their sensationalist propaganda. Among the earliest 3-D ""sandbox,"" or open-ended, tales to let players go anywhere and do anything in a world of outsized personalities and adventures, this underworld saga is notable most for popularizing freedom of choice as a gameplay concept. An engaging plotline and memorable characters didn't hurt the epic's street cred either, as expounded upon in later installments such as the celebrated ""GTA: Vice City"" and ""GTA: San Andreas."" ""Halo"" (Microsoft, Xbox -- 2001) -- The sci-fi, run 'n' gun juggernaut single-handedly established the Xbox as a force to be reckoned with and, via sequel ""Halo 2,"" paved the way for trigger-happy experiences to provide living rooms worldwide with endless online thrills. With blockbuster production values and comprehensive internet play suites now staples for the genre, it picked up where ""Doom"" and ""Quake"" left off in helping bring smack-talking gunplay to mainstream prominence. In retrospect, it's hard to believe we ever doubted that first-person shooters could make the transition from PC to TV. ""Resident Evil 4"" (Capcom, GameCube/PS2/PC/Wii -- 2005) -- Prior to this pant-soiling epic's debut, fear was typically an emotion experienced by gamers only upon discovering that a younger sibling had accidentally deleted their most recent saved game. But via spine-chillingly atmospheric scenarios featuring homicidal villagers, mad monks and chainsaw-wielding maniacs, each creepier and more breathless than the last, it illustrated gaming's true potential to induce cardiac arrest. ""God of War"" (Sony, PlayStation 2 -- 2005) -- Melding heavy metal sensibilities with Greek mythology, this button-mashing odyssey invited players to gleefully lop off heads and wrench eyeballs from monsters' sockets. Look past the gore-drenched melodramatics though, and you'll also find incredibly polished play mechanics and skillful scriptwriting that demonstrated a simple principle. Specifically, that modern-day epics could (*gasp*) offer a heady mix of brains as well as brawn. ""Guitar Hero"" (RedOctane, PlayStation 2 -- 2005) -- From ""Rock n' Roll Racing"" to ""PaRappa the Rapper,"" music always had its place in the gaming canon. However, by pairing an intuitive plastic guitar controller with the on-screen action, it was here that we first saw the two mediums successfully collide with chart-topping results. The billion-dollar franchise has since spawned multiple spin-offs and imitators; established an entire genre; become America's new happy-hour activity of choice; and legitimized video games as today's hottest new medium for connecting fans and musicians. Encore! ""The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion"" (Bethesda Game Studios, PC/PS3/360 -- 2006) -- As a freeform fantasy role-playing franchise that players could explore in nonlinear fashion, ""The Elder Scrolls"" series wasn't the first or even best of its kind when it debuted in 1994. Upon reaching the Xbox 360 though, fans hungry for killer apps were astonished by the game's depth, scope and ambition, which set the bar for later like-minded smashes, e.g. ""Fallout 3"" and ""Mass Effect."" ""Shadow of the Colossus"" (Sony, PlayStation 2 -- 2005) -- Most games offer an array of slavering, faceless horrors, which players are invited to casually butcher in offhanded fashion. But in this action-packed epic, the high-tech equivalent of an art house film, you instead play a swordsman who must scale and slay brooding titans who both function as living levels and reminders of one's own mortality. Seldom has virtual death seemed so dignified. ""World of Warcraft"" (Blizzard, PC -- 2004) -- Call them massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), virtual worlds or glorified 3-D chat rooms. But with more than 11.5 million worldwide subscribers, none makes a stronger case for the value of blending community and socialization with compelling, internet-based play. Based on the popular series of real-time strategy games, it's helped bring fantasy dungeon crawling (and spending hours on your PC romancing sultry night elves) to mainstream acceptance.

"(CNN) -- Marissa Mayer, who was Google's first female engineer and its 20th employee when she joined that company in 1999, has been named CEO of Yahoo. She's the fifth CEO in as many years at that struggling company. Monday's announcement has caused ripples in the world of technology as people expressed surprise that Mayer would leave Google and that Yahoo has landed such a charismatic leader. Here's a quick guide to some of the most interesting and water-cooler-worthy facts about the 37-year-old. (We know what you're thinking. And yes -- an 11-point list can successfully illuminate decades of a person's personal and professional life. Of course it can.) If we missed something fun, let us know in the comments. 1. She's responsible for the clean look of Google.com. The minimalist home page, with plenty of white space and a single search bar in the center, is said to be the brainchild of Mayer, who has overseen the launch and development of many of Google's iconic products. ""Google has the functionality of a really complicated Swiss Army knife, but the home page is our way of approaching it closed. It's simple, it's elegant, you can slip it in your pocket, but it's got the great doodad when you need it,"" she told Fast Company in 2005. ""A lot of our competitors are like a Swiss Army knife open -- and that can be intimidating and occasionally harmful."" 2. She specializes in artificial intelligence. Mayer holds bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford University. For both degrees, Mayer focused on artificial intelligence, which has become a core area of focus for Google, a company that has introduced autonomous cars and whose computers are trying to use equations to understand human speech. She told CNN she holds several patents in AI and interface design. 3. She's on the board at Wal-Mart. ""She is also on the board of various nonprofits, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Ballet and the New York City Ballet,"" according to a press release from Yahoo. 4. She's obsessed with fashion. According to the Los Angeles Times, Mayer once paid $60,000 at a charity auction to have lunch with fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. ""Objects that make Mayer happy include her Oscar de la Renta cashmere cardigan with three-quarter sleeves and pointelle detailing and enamel buttons,"" Vogue wrote in 2009. 5. She has a fly penthouse. It's atop the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco, and it's worth a cool $5 million, according to The New York Times. 6. She's good in an interview. In 1999, during her interview for a job at the company, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin reportedly asked her: ""How would you write a spell-check program when you have a vocabulary so big it won't fit in a computer?"" She became a product manager at the young start-up after turning down a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University. 7. She dated Larry Page. The Google co-founder and Mayer, who was a product manager at the time, dated in the early 2000s, according to the book ""Googled"" by Ken Auletta. A Gawker blogger wrote about how Silicon Valley considered this subject taboo. 8. She can make working as a grocery clerk sound glamorous. She told the Los Angeles Times about her high school job working the cash register: ""I learned a lot about work ethic from people who had been there for 20 years. They could do 40 items a minute over an eight-hour shift. I was pretty routinely in the 38-to-41 range. I was pretty happy about that. I have a good memory for numbers. ""At the grocery store, you have to remember to charge $4.99 a pound for grapes and 99 cents a pound for cantaloupe by typing in a number code. The more numbers you could memorize, the better off you are. If you had to stop to look up a price in a book, it totally killed your average."" 9. She held office hours at Google. ""At 4 p.m., her three-times-a-week office hours begin. It's a tradition Mayer brought over from her days at Stanford, where she taught computer science to undergrads,"" wrote Businessweek in 2005. Some of Google's big ideas came out of those meetings with staff, the magazine says. 10. She likes cupcakes with a side of spreadsheets. ""I refuse to be stereotyped,"" she told The New York Times in 2009. ""I think it's very comforting for people to put me in a box. 'Oh, she's a fluffy girlie girl who likes clothes and cupcakes. Oh, but wait, she is spending her weekends doing hardware electronics.' "" She once made spreadsheets to determine the perfect cupake recipe, she told San Francisco Magazine. ""Who else in Silicon Valley could report, with absolute seriousness, that she'd recently bought an array of cookbooks to study the cupcake recipes in each, created a spreadsheet for the ingredients, and then tested the recipes before writing her own? (She made another spreadsheet for frosting.),"" the magazine wrote. 11. She knows how to rock a wedding. In 2009, she married Zachary Bogue, a venture capitalist and real-estate investor while wearing ""a knockout hand-beaded white Naeem Khan gown,"" as the San Francisco Chronicle described it. A rehearsal dinner featured a surprise performance from the Killers, according to a blog by the event's photographer. How do you balance career and family?

"(CNN) -- Mid-April marks the anniversaries of several horrendous attacks in recent U.S. history: . -- April 19, 1993: the FBI's siege of the Waco compound leaves 76 dead. -- April 19, 1995: the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City kills 168 people. -- April 20, 1999: A mass shooting at Columbine High School leaves 15 dead. -- April 16, 2007: The Virginia Tech massacre kills 33. The Oklahoma City bombing was timed to coincide with the Waco anniversary. And it's unclear whether the Columbine shooters timed that attack to mark Adolf Hitler's birthday or possibly Waco. Is there something about this time of the year that makes these types of attacks more prevalent? For an answer, CNN spoke with Robert Blaskiewicz, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.  He teaches a course examining conspiracy theories and runs a blog, called Skeptical Humanities. CNN: Is there any evidence or are there any theories that suggest attackers are more likely to strike around this time of the year? Robert Blaskiewicz: I have seen nothing to suggest that anything about April itself makes people violent. That said, the reason why we see certain types of political violence in mid- to late April is because of a few unhappy coincidences: that Waco happened to fall on the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first battles in a war against a tyrannical oppressor. For many people who labor under the idea that the federal government is a tyrannical foreign oppressor like the British monarchy, Waco symbolizes a war of a government against its people. [Timothy] McVeigh chose to bomb the Murrah Building [in Oklahoma City] on the anniversary of Waco because of that symbolic importance (indeed, the forged drivers license he rented the truck with had the date of issuance as 19 April 1993, the date of the Branch Davidian fire). If you want to squint, you might also lump in the opening of the Civil War to this part of the year, but the timing of that was chronologically tied to events following Lincoln's election, not the Revolution. Regarding the Virginia Tech shootings, my first impression is sheerest coincidence. Now, by raising this question, I think that you illustrate an important principle behind the conspiratorial mindset (something that actually undergirds even normal psychology), and that is seeing patterns in unrelated events. Seeing a cluster of completely unrelated events fires up the conspiracy theorist's mind. I have recently seen speculation about four different television personalities who recently have displayed incoherent speech during taping (including a news reporter and Judge Judy). Conspiracy theorists made the leap that they were all related and that there was probably some mind-control weapon being used. Go figure. CNN:  How strong are the beliefs/outrage surrounding the Waco disaster, nearly 20 years after the siege? Blaskiewicz: I don't have a sense of the strength of the feelings about Waco specifically; however, after Oklahoma City, the numbers of militia groups dropped. Following the election of [Barack] Obama, however, there was a steep rise in the number of hate groups, which has been ably tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Political Research Associates. Interestingly, last year on the 19th of April, gun advocates had a rally in Washington (a sort of ""bring your guns to the Capitol day"") to rally behind the Second Amendment, even though the Second Amendment has not really been on the Obama administration's radar at all. For a while, it was difficult to even buy ammunition, since terrified gun owners started stockpiling it. Nonetheless, in the mythology that has grown up around Waco and Oklahoma City among self-identified patriots, the 19th has become a sort of high holiday for those who think that they live under the thumb of a tyranny. CNN: What do you think is behind the need to see patterns in unrelated events, such as several attacks that happened all around the same time? In other words, what purpose do conspiracy theories serve? Blaskiewicz: There are several possible answers, and I'm not sure any one answer is better than any other answer. People are extremely social critters, and part of what makes that possible is the ability to perceive others as deliberately acting in the world, in other words to detect agency. It's extremely useful in building respectful communities. Sometimes that faculty doesn't turn off when it should, and you associate ""agency"" with events and ideas that are unrelated. When a responsible agent is not easily discernible, that sense that something is still deliberate endures, and you are left wondering, ""Well, who caused it, then?"" You fill in the blanks. Conspiracy theories are a contemporary mythology, not unlike the Greek gods. Everything that happens has a reason, and the gods affect the course of human events through direct intervention. The ill-defined ""they,"" whether referring to the U.N., CIA, international bankers, Jews or interdimensional shapeshifting reptilian space aliens living in the hollowed-out artificial moon (yeah, it's a real one), really seem to me to be a secular version of religious mythology. On the other side, when you are already convinced that agents are working to manipulate world events, people tend to seek out information that reinforces what they already believe. It's a tendency called confirmation bias, and it is a sort of perceptual filter for what you accept as evidence. Even the apparent clustering of events, in itself, can serve as evidence for someone who is looking for things to confirm their worldview, and allows the conspiracy theorist to discount reams of information that directly refute that belief. Each human brain comes equipped with a whole series of generally useful shortcuts to help us make sense of the immense amount of information that we have to process everyday. Conspiracy theories, I suspect, are simply an interesting (occasionally dangerous) byproduct of those mental shortcuts.","Several U.S. tragedies happened in mid-April, including Waco and Oklahoma City .

"(CNN) -- Sweet dreams on an airplane generally are reserved for first class passengers. And United Airlines is sweetening that dreamy proposition for their premier passengers with a new turn-down service on long-haul international flights. Upon request, crew members will make up a passenger's flat-bed suite, plumped up with a new sleeping cushion with a 250 thread-count cover, plus the airline's standard duvet, pillows and Philosophy-brand toiletry kit. Note: there are mints in the toiletry kit, but not on the pillow. ""Throughout their travel experience, our Global First customers expect the highest level of service,"" said Mark Bergsrud, United's senior vice president of marketing, in a statement. ""The new turn-down service offers customers even more comfort, enabling them to arrive at their destinations refreshed and ready to go."" United Global First is offered on most flights to Europe, Asia, Africa, India, the Middle East, South America and the South Pacific, and flights between Tokyo and Bangkok, Seoul, Singapore and Taipei. United isn't the first airline to offer turn-down service, according to Bryan Saltzburg, general manager of TripAdvisor Flights and SeatGuru. ""A number of international carriers have been offering turn-down service for years in their premium cabins,"" Saltzburg said in an e-mail. American Airlines was the first U.S. carrier to offer the service, he said. U.S. airline offerings have been lagging behind international airlines for years, Saltzburg said. ""With Singapore Air and Cathay Pacific setting the bar for Asia, Lufthansa and (British Airways) for Europe, and now the aggressively-rising Middle East carriers like Emirates and Etihad setting a new standard, American carriers are starting to focus more heavily on their premium cabins."" In addition to the new bedding service, United's first class passengers are also treated to multi-course meals and fine wines among other perks. These luxuries do come at a price. A search Monday for a Chicago to London roundtrip flight the first week in December yielded Global First tickets starting at more than $12,000. Bon voyage, business executives. The rest of us will continue to sleep really tight in coach.","United Airlines is offering new turn-down service in first class on international flights .

"(Mental Floss) -- As midnight approaches on December 31st, more than a few of us will crack open a bottle or two of champagne to help toast in the New Year. Many a glass of champagne will be raised during a toast to the New Year. With a few choice facts about the bubbly stuff, you can look knowledgeable rather than just tipsy when you drain your flute. Here are a few little nuggets you can share with fellow revelers. 1. What exactly is champagne? Strictly speaking, champagne is a sparkling wine that comes from the Champagne region of northeastern France. If it's a bubbly wine from another region, it's sparkling wine, not champagne. While many people use the term ""champagne"" generically for any sparkling wine, the French have maintained their legal right to call their wines champagne for over a century. The Treaty of Madrid, signed in 1891 established this rule, and the Treaty of Versailles reaffirmed it. The European Union helps protect this exclusivity now, although certain American producers can still generically use ""champagne"" on their labels if they were using the term before early 2006. 2. How is champagne made? Sparkling wines can be made in a variety of ways, but traditional champagne comes to life by a process called the methode Champenoise. Champagne starts its life like any normal wine. The grapes are harvested, pressed, and allowed to undergo a primary fermentation. The acidic results of this process are then blended and bottled with a bit of yeast and sugar so it can undergo a secondary fermentation in the bottle. (It's this secondary fermentation that gives champagne its bubbles.) This new yeast starts doing its work on the sugar, and then dies and becomes what's known as lees. The bottles are then stored horizontally so the wine can ""age on lees"" for 15 months or more. After this aging, winemakers turn the bottles upside down so the lees can settle to the bottom. Once the dead yeast has settled, producers open the bottles to remove the yeast, add a bit of sugar known as dosage to determine the sweetness of the champagne, and slip a cork onto the bottle. Mental Floss: Why is the drinking age 21? 3. What's so special about the Champagne region? Several factors make the chardonnay, pinot noir, and pinot meunier grapes grown in the Champagne region particularly well suited for crafting delicious wines. The northern location makes it a bit cooler than France's other wine-growing regions, which gives the grapes the proper acidity for sparkling wine production. Moreover, the porous, chalky soil of the area -- the result of large earthquakes millions of years ago -- aids in drainage. 4. Do I have to buy champagne to get good sparkling wine? Not at all. Although many champagnes are delightful, most the world's wine regions make tasty sparkling wines of their own. You can find highly regarded sparkling wines from California, Spain, Italy, Australia, and other areas without shelling out big bucks for Dom Perignon. 5. Speaking of Dom Perignon, who was this guy? Contrary to popular misconception, the namesake of the famous brand didn't invent champagne. But Perignon, a Benedictine monk who worked as cellar master at an abbey near Epernay during the 17th and 18th centuries, did have quite an impact on the champagne industry. In Perignon's day, sparkling wine wasn't a really sought-after beverage. In fact, the bubbles were considered to be something of a flaw, and early production methods made producing the wine somewhat dangerous. (Imprecise temperature controls could lead to fermentation starting again after the wine was in the bottle. If one bottle in a cellar exploded and had its cork shoot out, a chain reaction would start.) Perignon helped standardize production methods to avoid these explosions, and he also added two safety features to his wines: thicker glass bottles that better withstood pressure and rope snare that helped keep corks in place. Mental Floss: The men behind your favorite liquors . 6. What's the difference between brut and extra brut? You'll see these terms on champagne labels to describe how sweet the good stuff in the bottle is. As mentioned above, a bit of sugar known as dosage is added to the bottle right before it's corked, and these terms describe exactly how much sugar went in. Extra brut has less than six grams of sugar per liter added, while brut contains less than 15 grams of additional sugar per liter. Several other classifications exist, but drier champagnes are more common. 7. Why do athletes spray each other with champagne after winning titles? Throughout its history, champagne has been a celebratory drink that's made appearances at coronations of kings and the launching of ships. However, the bubbly-spraying throwdowns that now accompany athletic victories are a much more recent development. When Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt won the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1967, they ascended the winner's podium with a bottle of champagne in hand. Gurney looked down and saw team owner Carroll Shelby and Ford Motors CEO Henry Ford II standing with some journalists and decided to have a bit of fun. Gurney gave the bottle a shake and sprayed the crowd, and a new tradition was born. 8. What's sabrage? After the French Revolution, members of Napoleon's cavalry decided that the normal pop-and-foam ritual of opening a bottle of champagne just wasn't as visually impressive as it could be. They responded by popularizing a way of opening bottles using a sword. The technique, known as sabrage, involved holding a bottle at arm's length while quickly running a saber down the bottle towards the neck. When the saber's blade struck the glass lip just beneath the cork, the glass breaks, shooting off the cork and neck of the bottle while leaving the rest of the vessel intact. Ceremonial ""champagne swords"" are available for just this purpose, and if you can pull off this trick, you'll be the toast of your shindig. (Be careful, though. A flying champagne cork is already you'll-put-your-eye-out dangerous, and adding a ring of ragged broken glass to the equation doesn't make the whole endeavor any safer.)

"(CNN) -- How do social media posts about a giant inflatable toad relate to criticism of a former Chinese President? You just have to understand the secret language of Chinese netizens. The officials who installed the 72-feet-tall toad in a Beijing park two weeks ago likely wanted to attract tourists -- after all, golden toads are symbols of good luck and prosperity in China. The squatting toad floats on a giant lily pad as tourists ride boats to snap a closer picture. The toad's designer told Chinese state media it was inspired by the giant inflatable Rubber Duck that graced several Chinese cities. As soon as the toad arrived, however, comparisons to former Chinese President Jiang Zemin almost immediately shot up on the popular Twitter-like social media service Sina Weibo. Government censors cracked down, and ""toad"" is now among the most-censored words on the service. The comparison isn't just a joke about Jiang's puffy cheeks -- it's a way for Chinese people to communicate about Jiang, his legacy and the Communist Party. ""It's kind of a hidden language,"" said King-wa Fu, a University of Hong Kong journalism professor who studies Weibo censorship. ""The netizens in China have created new terms, jokes, and humor to try to communicate with others because they can't directly talk about the issue that they want to discuss."" Before the giant toad gained attention, people already referred to Jiang, who served as president for 10 years in the 1990's and 2000's, with the nickname ""toad"" on Weibo. Photos of the giant toad spread that comparison much more widely. ""Even though it doesn't really look like him, people find the association,"" Fu said. ""It's a common understanding"" that when people say toad, they mean Jiang. Toad was among the top five censored words on multiple days over the last two weeks, according to Weiboscope, an online tool created by Fu and his fellow researchers that tracks censored posts and terms. Jiang, who presided over a rapidly-growing economy while pushing market reforms, isn't the only notable figure who has received an online nickname. Retired security czar Zhou Yongkang, who came under a corruption investigation this week, is referred to on Weibo as a popular brand of instant noodles that sounds similar to his name. Xi Jinping, China's current president, is sometimes referred to by the name of his favorite pork bun, Fu said. ""There's a very special kind of environment in China -- it's censored but with a certain level of space for expressions,"" Fu said. Humor fits in that space. And the toad isn't the first giant inflatable animal to merit government censorship. A heavily censored Weibo post last year played on the iconic Tiananmen Square photo of a man standing in front of a line of tanks by replacing the tanks with yellow Rubber Ducks. But the censors are often quick to catch onto emerging trends. Fu said that what appeared to be first post about the inflatable toad was deleted after only one night. ""They understand it, they're following it,"" he said. After rumors spread online and in Hong Kong television in 2011 that Jiang, 87, had died, the government similarly cracked down on Weibo posters. Despite the online furor, visitors on Friday boated serenely around the toad in Yuyuantan Park, which is known for its cherry blossoms.","Social media users drew comparisons between a 72-feet-tall inflatable toad and former Chinese President Jiang Zemin .

"(CNN) -- Tropical cyclones in the Pacific do not worry some Hawaii residents because direct hits historically have been so rare on the islands. Hawaii is a small target in a large ocean. But the state finds itself prepping ahead of what could be a pair of back-to-back smacks from Hurricane Iselle and Tropical Storm Julio. Even if these two storms weaken or don't make landfall -- as is usually the case around Hawaii -- they can still cause damage, including flooding and debris, experts warn. Try telling that to Scott Murray, who has lived in Hilo, on Hawaii's Big island, for more than 60 years. ""People are not really nervous, but honestly just hoping for some good surf,"" said Murray, who owns the Hilo Surfboard Company. ""Surfers get excited when hurricane season starts. The people here are really nonchalant and are used to rain, which is the main thing we are expecting."" There are no lines at the supermarket or stocking of supplies, even though Iselle is on a forecast track to hit the islands on Thursday. ""I'm not worried about this storm,"" Murray said. History appears to back him up. A 2002 report by the U.S. Geological Survey states that ""actual hurricane strikes on the Hawaiian Islands are relatively rare in the modern record."" ""More commonly, near-misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands,"" according to the report. A primer on Hurricane in Hawaii by the University of Hawaii says just as much: ""Hurricanes are relatively rare events in the Hawaiian islands."" However, even if Iselle and Julio change course and miss the islands, it does not mean that dangers are averted. Flying debris poses a risk, and back-to-back storms over an area that is already saturated makes for a flooding risk. Officials at the state and local level are not taking the risks that Iselle and Julio pose lightly. ""We are actually monitoring very closely. We've had several tropical systems since June 1,"" said Darryl Oliver of the Hawaii County Civil Defense. ""The ground is very saturated. We are very hopeful it will weaken. However, it still is likely to present tropical storm force winds at 74 mph, high surf at 10 to 15 feet, and heavy rain."" As of Tuesday, Iselle was a Category 3 hurricane but was expected to weaken as it neared Hawaii, according to the National Hurricane Center. Tropical Storm Julio, on the other hand, could strengthen to hurricane force by the time it reaches the islands. ""We are very concerned with the flooding that will be possible from having two major storms so close together,"" Coast Guard spokesman Chief Petty Officer Kurt Fredrickson said. The Coast Guard's priority is keeping the Port of Honolulu open, where 90% of the state's goods and services pass through, he said. The agency is asking residents to stock up on supplies for at least seven days, as power outages are expected. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell has issued a similar warning. ""Yes, it is a concern if both storms hit back to back because the ground will be saturated with water, increasing the odds of flooding,"" he said. Many Hawaii residents spread the news of the coming storms via social media, but not all were worried about what they could bring. ""Can't wait for the storm to hit, I'm ready for some rain,"" one Twitter user in Hawaii wrote. Another wrote: ""Is it bad that my family is doing literally NOTHING to prepare for the hurricane?"" Hawaii's primary elections are slated for Saturday. Local media reported that many turned up for early voting in anticipation of severe weather on election day. Others are concerned that voting turnout could be affected. Some shelters will be set up in the same buildings where voting is to be held, the governor's office said.","Hurricanes rarely make landfall in Hawaii .

"(CNN) -- Christine McVie hasn't ventured out on tour with Fleetwood Mac in 15 years, but she's ready to get back on the road. Starting September 30, all five members of Fleetwood Mac -- McVie, her ex-husband John McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood -- are launching a tour called ""On With The Show."" The trek will begin in Minneapolis and will then stretch across North America with 34 shows in 33 cities. A rep for the legendary band confirmed in January that McVie was rejoining the group after her departure in 1998, and hinted that a tour was in the works. Over the years, McVie's had a number of reasons for her exit, including the fact that she missed her native England. But on the ""Today"" show Thursday, she also admitted that it was a persistent fear that got in the way. ""I had a fear of flying,"" she said. ""I haven't flown for 15 years."" A keyboardist and singer, McVie joined Fleetwood Mac after original guitarist Peter Green left in 1970; she was married to bassist John McVie at the time. By 1975, the McVies and drummer Fleetwood added two more members to the group: Nicks and Buckingham. The chemistry and talent among the five gave us albums like ""Rumours"" and ""Mirage,"" and established Fleetwood Mac as one of the most successful bands in pop music -- even as the band members themselves weathered personal storms. After Christine McVie left in the '90s, the group soldiered on with touring and new music as a foursome. Yet when Fleetwood Mac went to London last fall for a performance, they got Christine McVie to join them on stage for a rendition of ""Don't Stop."" For her, it helped spark a pivotal moment that would inspire her to return to Fleetwood Mac. ""Walking out in London was sensational,"" she said on ""Today,"" adding that she's rejoined Fleetwood Mac with a ""definite capital yes."" Tickets to Fleetwood Mac's upcoming tour go on sale to the general public on April 7. CNN's Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Christine McVie has rejoined Fleetwood Mac with ""a definite capital yes""

"(CNN) -- Leonard Maltin was 18 when the first edition of his ""Movie Guide"" came out in 1969. Forty-five years later, the book -- a well-thumbed totem as familiar on film fans' coffee tables as a bowl of popcorn or a stained drink coaster -- will soon be no more. The 2015 edition, out Tuesday, will be the last. Maltin wishes he didn't have to end its run, he said in a phone interview. But the writing is on the wall. ""I saw it coming a couple years ago,"" said Maltin, 63. ""There were pretty consistent strong sales for many, many years, and that started to change. It came as kind of a jolt."" Ironically, it's a screen that's killed off the ""Movie Guide"" -- the computer/tablet/smartphone screen. In the digital age, the paper ""Movie Guide,"" like former competitors such as Steven Scheuer's ""Movies on TV"" and Leslie Halliwell's ""Film Guide,"" isn't as necessary when IMDb and Wikipedia (not to mention countless blogs) are at your fingertips. For that matter, even the long-dead ""Cinemania,"" a CD-ROM that was cutting edge in the mid-'90s, is now a quaint artifact. Maltin admits as much in the new guide's introduction. ""The book's loyal followers know that we strive to offer something one can't easily find online: curated information that is accurate and user-friendly, along with our own reviews and ratings,"" he writes. ""But when a growing number of people believe that everything should be free, it's impossible to support a reference book that requires a staff of contributors and editors."" The material won't be moving to the Web, he told Deadline.com in an interview. ""Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide"" -- originally ""TV Movies"" -- has been Maltin's claim to fame since he was a senior in high school. The historian and reviewer was a movie fan even as a child growing up in New Jersey, and through the years -- whether coordinating programs for the Museum of Modern Art, teaching at Manhattan's New School or reviewing films for ""Entertainment Tonight"" -- he's always come back to the ""Movie Guide,"" compiled with the assistance of reviewers such as Mike Clark, Pete Hammond and managing editor Darwyn Carson. Oh, he's not retiring -- there will still be a ""Classic Movie Guide,"" and he continues to review movies for his Indiewire blog and Reelzchannel. He also has other claims to fame, such as the Guinness record for shortest review. CNN talked to Maltin about the origins of the ""Movie Guide,"" the role of the critic and whether he's ever changed his mind. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview. CNN: How did ""Maltin's Movie Guide"" start? Leonard Maltin: It was not my idea. I was doing what we used to call fanzines. A friend and I did our first version of that when we were in the fifth grade, and it just kept going from there. When I was 13 years old, I found out about a couple fairly successful fanzines (The 8-Millimeter Collector and Film Fan Monthly) and wrote and offered my services as a writer. They both said yes. So I saw my first byline in print when I was 13 years old. After two years of contributing to Film Fan Monthly, the editor and publisher wrote to me and said, ""I don't have time to do this anymore. Would you like to take it over?"" So I inherited his mailing list, his magazine and his format. He had 400 subscribers around the world. It was a big step up for me. I was 15 years old and I was editor and publisher of this magazine. A couple years later, I was walking down the hallway of my high school in Teaneck, New Jersey, and an English teacher stopped me. She'd seen the magazine and said, ""I have a friend who's an editor at Signet Books in New York and I think you two would hit it off. Call him and go see him after school one day."" I went to see him and I brought some copies of the magazine. He said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""It's a magazine I publish for old movie buffs."" He said, ""Do you know this book called 'Movies on TV' by Steven Scheuer?"" I said yes. He said, ""What do you think of it?"" I said, ""I think it's fine as far as it goes."" He said, ""What would you do differently?"" Now, I knew this book backwards and forwards. (So) I rattled off all those ideas. He said, ""I'm looking for someone to do a rival book. How would you like to do it?"" What do you say? I said, ""Well, I guess so."" CNN: You're still in high school. Maltin: 17 years old. High school senior. It was rather stupefying. CNN: And the first edition came out the next year? Maltin: The next year, when I was 18. Go figure. (At first) it was only a modest success, and when it came out all I saw was its flaws and shortcomings. It was five years before we got a chance to update it. At that point, I said I want to make it better, and that's what I've been trying to do ever since. One of the nice things when it became an annual (in 1986) was that, if somebody would send us a correction, I knew we could fix it the next time out. CNN: What movies have evolved over the editions that were four stars and now two, or vice versa? Maltin: The most extreme example I can think of is ""Alien,"" because I'm a wimp. I can't see graphic horror movies -- won't and can't. I was chewing my jacket most of the time I was watching it. I found it upsetting on a visceral level. I did not enjoy myself. So I wrote a review that reflected that. Twenty-five years later it was reissued theatrically and I went to see it again, having absorbed an awful lot in the 25 years that had passed, including all the imitations and ripoffs. I said, this a masterful piece of work. So I completely rewrote and rerated the film. I haven't done it a lot. CNN: Do those changes have any effect? Maltin: When people used to ask me about the influence of critics, I'd say, what influence? If film critics really had influence, there wouldn't have been a ""Friday the 13th, Part 2,"" let alone two decades' worth. And conversely, the small films we love to champion would become big hits. That doesn't happen either. CNN: You're kind of the last national film critic now, since Roger Ebert passed away. Maltin: That's because of television, let's face it. Even the book got its biggest boost when I got on TV. In fact, I'd been on ""ET"" about a year, early '80s, and I got a call from my editor in New York. He said, ""We've just had our sales meeting and we'd like to make two changes to the cover: We'd like to put your name above the title and your picture on the cover."" I said, that's OK with me. There are many other critics who are more eloquent than I am, more incisive than I am, but I got national television exposure for 30 years on ""Entertainment Tonight"" and on various cable channels and that's given me tremendous visibility and recognizability. CNN: Who do you read? Maltin: I think my favorite film critic is one who's not as widely read as he should be, which is Todd McCarthy, formerly of Variety and now of The Hollywood Reporter. I think he's brilliant and incisive. I don't know how he absorbs as much as he does in one viewing of a movie. He's also extremely articulate -- great command of language. I read other people too, but I don't read very much because I'm writing my own reviews. CNN: What do you think of aggregation sites, like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic? Maltin: They serve their purpose, but as I like to remind people, every tomato is a critic. For people who say film critics are obsolete, then you wouldn't get a score on Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. Those scores are indicative of something. CNN: Do you feel a sense of loss with the book finishing its run? Maltin: I probably couldn't even describe to you how enormous a change this is. It's affected me already. We'd already be working on next year's book by now. It takes a lot of doing things to break old habits, and one of my habits is keeping track of details when I watch a movie -- is somebody unbilled, does the movie say it's a British-French co-production, things like that.

"(CNN) -- Fred Deegbe was standing outside a shop window five years ago, marveling at the shiny pair of wing-tip Oxfords he'd just bought, when he started wondering whether such beautiful designer shoes could ever be produced in his country, Ghana. ""Impossible,"" a nearby shoeshine boy purposefully declared after being asked by Deegbe; later, at home, his friends were equally dismissive. ""Everyone was convinced that these high-end shoes could not be made in Ghana,"" recalls Deegbe. Everyone? Not exactly. Despite not having any real knowledge about the shoe market, Deegbe, who was a banker at the time, decided to prove them all wrong and take on the world's leading shoe brands. Soon after, he teamed up with a friend and started Heel The World (HTW), a high-end shoemaking company based in Accra, Ghana. That was in 2011, and one year later Deegbe quit his banking job to dedicate himself fully in his new ambitious venture. ""We started buying machines (and) brought them over to the house,"" says the young entrepreneur, who launched the company from his parents' garage. ""We had no intentions of starting the factory in the house, but one thing led to another and we just had to start."" Wearing it with pride . Inside the HTW workshop, underneath fashion images hanging from its bright yellow walls, the startup's workers are busy cutting pieces of leather and gluing soles at their work stations. The materials are imported from places like the United States and Italy but all shoes are crafted by hand here. It's a meticulous task, one the HTF staff tend to perform while wearing their bespoke creations -- anything from retro brogues and elegant loafers to stylish dress slippers and eye-catching Oxfords. ""They want their friends to ask them, 'Where did you buy that?' and they say, 'no, we made it; we made it in a garage, in Accra, with our own hands,'"" says Deegbe. Convincing people . HTW, which currently has five full-time employees, has built a website to take orders and relies heavily on social media for marketing. Yet, one problem for some potential customers is the cost -- from between $200 to $400, the price would be limiting anywhere, let alone in Ghana, where many people are still hit by economic hardship despite the country's remarkable growth and record poverty reduction in recent years. ""That's an uphill challenge that we still face,"" says Deegbe. ""It's because most of this stuff is imported,"" he explains. ""You have to convince people that these things can be made here and these things is worth all the money we are asking for,"" he adds. Proving doubters wrong . HTW has also started producing accessories such as so-called ""empowerment beads"" -- these are handcrafted creations made of glass and brass that are designed to represent all the hard work that goes into reaching a goal.

"(CNN) -- A huge relief operation is continuing across northern India and into Pakistan amid devastating floods that have killed hundreds of people and left tens of thousands more stranded. Authorities in Pakistan, anticipating further rainfall and the passage of floodwater to more populous areas, have warned that the worst is yet to come. The death toll is more than 400. Pakistan reported 257 killed, and India has reported at least 150. Hundreds more in each country have been injured. The count is expected to rise as rescuers regain access to areas cut off by floodwater. The capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, Srinagar, was also deluged, with residents perched on rooftops and other high ground awaiting rescue. Many buildings in the old part of the city have collapsed, local media report. Key infrastructure, such as bridges and roads, has been destroyed, hampering the army's relief efforts. Emergency rebuilding . Indian soldiers in the heavily flooded area rushed to erect temporary crossings in order to reach people cut off by rapidly rising waters. The focus of the Indian relief effort will remain on Srinagar and areas of south Kashmir because of the number of people still stranded without food and water, Lt. Gen. D. S. Hooda, chief of the Indian Army's Northern Command, said at a news conference. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the region at the weekend and immediately declared it a ""national-level disaster."" He said everything would be done to provide aid and restore bridges and communication links washed away by the incessant rains. Modi, who was elected this year, also offered to help Pakistanis affected by the huge floods. Devastation from 'flooding is unprecedented' ""It is a matter of great distress that the retreating monsoon rains have played havoc in many parts of our two countries,"" he wrote in a letter to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, adding that ""the devastation caused by the record rains and the consequent flooding is unprecedented."" Following a period of almost nonexistent communication in the Jammu and Kashmir region of northern India, 90 3G towers have been restored. By Tuesday, 23,530 stranded people had been evacuated by army units equipped with helicopters and boats and deployed across the province. The Indian army has also employed social media to monitor distress messages and forward them to rescuers. Around 7,000 such distress messages have been relayed so far, and many have resulted in the rescue of stranded residents. ""The Indian army will not move back to the barracks till the last man is brought to safety,"" Indian army Gen. Dalbir Singh said. The four-month monsoon season shows no signs of abating, with wet weather forecast for next week as well. Western regions of the subcontinent have usually seen the last of rains by early September, but the Indian Meteorological Department forecast ""heavy to very heavy rainfall"" in a number of states over the next few days. Peak yet to pass . In neighboring Pakistan, heavy rains have continued over the past few days, causing flooding from the main rivers of that region. Ahmed Kemal, a representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, confirmed the flooding is going to continue into the South of Pakistan into Sindh because of rising water levels in barrages, making this a nationwide crisis. ""The major peak is still to pass,"" he told CNN. ""We have to realize that water is rising; inundation is expected and will create some sort of flooding. This situation is only going to get worse."" The evacuation of northern areas of the country is underway, and as of Monday, Kemal said 18,227 people had been evacuated and moved to relief camps in northwestern Punjab province. Rainfall during this monsoon season had been below average this year, but the heavy rain of recent days has burst riverbanks across the northern part of both countries. The Jehlum and Chenab rivers in northern Pakistan have seen water levels rise by as much as 18 feet, turning parts of their courses into lakes as much 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide. The north is one of the most mountainous places in the world, and floodwater from there eventually will make its way downstream and could cause flooding in the coastal plains to the south, particularly along the course of the Indus River. Some 300 million people live in that river's basin. As many as 1,500 stranded people have been rescued by troops using helicopters and boats from areas of Punjab, the country's most populous region. The Pakistani army also airdropped 10,000 food packs to various flood-hit areas. Army troops have also been moved to towns in the stricken region.","NEW: Death toll in India and Pakistan is more than 400 .

"(CNN) -- Killing people by lethal injection will soon be as distant a memory as burning heretics at the stake and stoning adulterers -- at least throughout the civilized world. No country that employs the death penalty can be admitted to the European Union, and the practice dwindles daily. But despite the growing worldwide revulsion against this lethal form of punishment, Texas and a handful of other states continue to take their places among such paragons as North Korea, China, Yemen and Iran in the club of those who attempt to administer the death penalty as a form of ""justice."" Indeed, Texas is way ahead of all other states in the administering of such justice. At the end of this month, under the leadership of Gov. Rick Perry, the state is expected -- if all appeals fail -- to celebrate its 500th judicial killing since our Supreme Court in 1976 reinstated the death penalty as a legitimate form of ""justice,"" despite the fact that an earlier court had determined that the death penalty was ""cruel and unusual punishment."" Death row diary offers a rare glimpse into a morbid world . No one doubts that the woman who is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday, Kimberly McCarthy, is guilty of the 1997 murder of her neighbor, a 71-year-old woman and a retired college professor. At the latest count, 1,369 people have been executed since 1976 and 144 people on death row have been exonerated. Kimberly McCarthy will not be exonerated; so, why shouldn't we kill her? For the same reason Warden R.F. Coleman gave to reporters on February 8, 1924, the day the official Texas Death House was inaugurated with the electrocution of five African-American men. Said Coleman then, ""It just couldn't be done, boys. A warden can't be a warden and a killer, too. The penitentiary is a place to reform a man, not to kill him."" Warden Coleman resigned rather than pull the switch. Sadly, so many others have failed in the many years since then to follow his heroic example. And let's not equivocate: Often, and in every age, doing the right thing requires heroism. Kimberly McCarthy is a black woman. Black people are disproportionately represented on death row, as are blacks imprisoned throughout this country. Many would say (at least in a whisper) that black people are more prone to crime and violence than are white people. But as a historian, I know that there was a time, long ago, when my people -- Irish-Americans -- were deemed to be more prone to crime and violence than were others. This was in the years after the potato famines of the 19th century that brought so many desperately poor Irish people to these shores. The police in New York City became so inured to arresting Irishmen that they began to call the van they threw the arrestees into ""the Paddy Wagon,"" a name that has adhered to that vehicle ever since. But who today would care (or dare) to make a case for exceptional Irish criminality? The immigrating Irish were more prone to criminality not because of some genetic inheritance, but because they were so very poor, so neglected, so abandoned. When I see a vagrant today, snoring on a park bench, clothed in rags and stinking, I think to myself: Whatever happened to this guy, whatever the history that dropped him on this park bench, no one loved him enough when he was a child. His parents, if he had parents, were too taken up with the pain of living, with the struggle for survival, with their own hideous fears, to tend to him adequately, if at all. No one came to rescue this child, give him enough to eat, adequate shelter, a caring environment â€” the love that everyone needs in order to grow. We -- the larger society -- have a profound obligation to such people, an obligation we have largely ignored. Many other societies in the Western world devote considerable resources to keeping poor children (and their parents) from despair. As an American friend of mine who lives in Denmark says: ""In Denmark we tax the rich, but everyone is comfortable."" Not everyone is comfortable in the United States. Many children live below the poverty line, millions of them without enough food or adequate shelter and with almost no attention to their educational needs. As for their emotional needs, are you kidding me? If Texas would pay attention to the needs of all its children, if we would all do the same for all our children, if we would only admit that every child needs to be loved and that we are all obliged to help ensure this outcome, our world would change overnight. We would certainly not need our electric chairs and nooses and lethal injections. We could then say what the poet-priest John Donne said as long ago as 1623, ""Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind."" Any man's death. Any woman's death. Any child's despair. Correction: A percentage referring to death row exonerations was miscalculated in an earlier version of this article. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Cahill.","Texas set to carry out its 500th execution. If all appeals fail, Kimberly McCarthy will die .
U.S. is the only Western nation that still has death penalty, joins North Korea, China, Iran .
Thomas Cahill: Black people much more likely to be sent to prison and to death row .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius was ""praying, crying, torn apart"" after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, pleading with her not to die, the first person on the scene testified Monday at the South African athlete's murder trial. Pistorius neighbor Johan Stander made an impassioned defense of Pistorius on the stand as he described what he saw that night. ""His commitment to save the young lady's life -- when he put his finger in the young lady's mouth ... how he begged her to stay alive. ... I saw the truth that morning. I saw it. And I feel it,"" said Stander, who was the first person Pistorius called after killing his girlfriend Steenkamp, a model and law school graduate. He came to Pistorius' house in response to an urgent phone call from the double amputee sprinter at 3:18 a.m. February 14, 2013, he explained. ""Please, please, please, come to my house. I've shot Reeva. I thought she was an intruder. Please, please, please, come quick,"" Pistorius begged Stander, the defense witness testified. Stander was the manager of the Silver Woods Estate where Pistorius lived and the first witness the defense called when Pistorius' murder trial resumed Monday. Pistorius's defense team appears to be trying to use Stander and his daughter to buttress the athlete's account of the circumstances of the killing, after the prosecution savaged Pistorius on the witness stand. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel tore into Pistorius over five days in court in April, saying the Paralympic medalist had argued with Steenkamp and killed her on purpose. He tried to force Pistorius to look at a picture of Steenkamp's head after the shooting, accused Pistorius of being selfish and possessive, and said he refused to take responsibility for his actions. The defense team is now trying to reinforce Pistorius' version and lay a foundation for the sincerity and consistency of his emotional response, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said after Monday's testimony. Live blog: Pistorius on trial . Pistorius, 27, admits that he shot and killed Steenkamp, 29, but denies murder, claiming he mistakenly thought he was defending himself. The gripping trial has seen Pistorius break down repeatedly, crying, wailing and sometimes throwing up as the court sees and hears about Steenkamp's death. Evidence has included graphic photos of the wounds, testimony from neighbors, friends, police and pathologists, and the actual door through which Pistorius fired four hollow-tipped bullets on the fateful night. 'Blood everywhere' Stander's daughter Carice Stander Viljoen testified after her father, describing how she tried to help Pistorius save Steenkamp. The athlete's head sank down into his hands, his face covering his eyes, as Viljoen described seeing ""blood everywhere"" when she arrived with her father. ""He was frantic,"" she said of Pistorius, pleading: ""Carice, please, Carice, please, can we just get her to the hospital?"" Viljoen herself then broke down in tears on the stand, prompting Judge Thokozile Masipa to offer her a break. She declined, apologizing and saying she just needed a minute. ""He was begging me to put her in the car and take her to the hospital,"" she said when she recovered, her voice faltering. But Steenkamp was pronounced dead at the scene after an ambulance arrived, Viljoen said. Viljoen was afraid Pistorius would kill himself after Steenkamp was declared dead, she said, adding that she ran upstairs, shouting after him when he went to get Steenkamp's handbag for ID. Her voice cracked as she described her fear, but the athlete came back with the bag a moment later. Viljoen began her time on the stand by testifying to hearing a man shouting ""help, help, help!"" the night of the killing. ""My heart was pounding so fast. I was very afraid,"" she said, adding that she pulled her covers over her head. Tough cross-examination . Viljoen and her father were the only witnesses called Monday. The trial adjourned after their testimony, when defense lawyer Barry Roux said he had expected them to take all day and had no more witnesses ready. Roux has said he will call 14 to 17 witnesses. Stander and his daughter were the fourth and fifth, after two experts and Pistorius himself. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel aims to prove that Pistorius intentionally shot and killed Steenkamp after a heated argument in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year. During his cross-examination of Stander, Nel challenged the estate manager's description of the shooting as a ""mistake."" The prosecutor, known as a bulldog in questioning witnesses, made Stander concede that Pistorius had not said the shooting was a mistake. The description was Stander's own, the witness said. The defense team is seeking to cast doubt on the state's case and needs only to show there is a reasonable doubt that Pistorius meant to kill Steenkamp. Gripping trial . The defense case is scheduled to continue until the middle of May and then be followed by closing arguments. Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. If Pistorius is found guilty of premeditated murder, he faces 25 years to life in prison. He could be convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide, which would leave his sentence at the discretion of the judge. The trial has gripped South Africa and sports fans worldwide who considered Pistorius a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. His disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, but he went on to achieve global fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" winning numerous Paralympic gold medals on the carbon-fiber blades that gave him his nickname. He also competed against able-bodied runners at the Olympics. Only those in the courtroom saw Pistorius on the stand, because he chose not to testify on camera. His testimony could be heard in an audio feed. INTERACTIVE: Oscar Pistorius on trial: Explore each side's case . Oscar Pistorius trial enters new phase after blistering cross-examination .

"(CNN) -- The video showing Ray Rice punching Janay Palmer inside an elevator was released Monday. And everyone should watch it. In fact, you should show it to your daughters and your sons, as hard as it is to witness. We already knew that Ray Rice punched his wife and she was knocked unconscious, but when you witness the violence you can no longer turn this ""incident"" into a tiff between drunk lovers or blame the victim: Janay Palmer. Many people had done just that, and speculated on whether she had provoked Rice. The Baltimore Ravens blamed her when they suggested in a tweet that she had played a role in the incident. The tweet, which was taken down on Monday, read: ""Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident."" What role was that exactly? Her role as punching bag? Her role lying unconscious? Her role, as this FOX News anchor said after seeing her punched, ""in not taking the stairs."" Domestic violence usually takes place behind closed doors; that's because batterers typically hide the abuse. No surprise that Rice didn't assault her in the lobby but waited until they were alone in the elevator before he punched his wife. Victims are afraid of their batterers, and now that you've seen the video, you understand why. I'm sure Palmer was terrified of getting him in trouble with the police or the NFL, but thankfully Ray Rice was wrong: They weren't alone, the world was watching. We were watching as he knocked her cold onto the floor with one punch to her face, causing her to smash into the railing of the elevator and fall lifeless on the ground. We were watching as he dragged her limp body partway out of elevator and dumped her with her skirt up and bum showing to the audience in the lobby. We watch as he appeared to kicked her with his shoes on, perhaps to see if she would wake up. And as she regains consciousness, we watch her sit up then flop back down, head between the elevator doors as they are about to close. It is a stranger who kneels down and cradles her. Not only is the punch shocking, but Rice's complete lack of care, remorse or concern for her as she's lying unconscious is what sticks out. He's a batterer and she's a victim of abuse. Opinion: NFL, apologize to women for Ray Rice . I'm sure he apologized later to her and felt sorry. That's part of the cycle of abuse: violence then a honeymoon period, only to be followed by violence again. Katie Ray-Jones, president of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Dating Abuse Helpline, has said an abused woman will leave a relationship approximately seven times before she leaves for good because of the psychological damage that batterers inflict. There are countless reasons victims recant their stories or stay in an abusive relationship: low self-worth, financial worries, fear, even love. Instead of wondering why a victim stays, the world would do better to focus on punishing the batterer. The NFL, faced with new evidence that proves Janay Palmer had no role in this incident, regardless of what she might have said to downplay it, are doing what they should have done after the first video showed her unconscious on a lobby floor and Rice admitted he had assaulted her . The Ravens just released Ray Rice and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him indefinitely. It's sad that it takes a Pennsylvania daily newspaper to remove a child molester from the locker rooms of Penn State and TMZ Sports to remove an admitted batterer from their ranks. The NFL completely screwed this up from the beginning by interviewing Janay Rice with her batterer present and not using common sense and seeking the full video to begin with. The victim blaming has to end and the world must learn a lesson for the sake of all victims of domestic abuse. NFL officials knew what he did, but it was only when they had to watch it that they did the right thing. Janay, wherever you are, and despite what some will say, you need to know you have done nothing wrong. You are a victim. And when Ray Rice made the choice to punch you, he made a choice that will forever determine his fate.","Mel Robbins: Everyone should watch the video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiance .
Seeing it, you can't say, as some have (including the Ravens) that she was culpable .
She says domestic violence happens behind closed doors; there Rice abuse terrible .
Robbins: NFL dumped Rice. Victim blaming has to stop. Janay, you were the victim here ."
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has a remarkable opportunity Wednesday night. The American people have been awakened by the videotaped beheading of two U.S. journalists. Many Americans have also been deeply angered by the killing of Christians and other minorities by the Islamist radicals. Americans increasingly realize that the entire movement of radical Islamism, from Boko Haram in Nigeria through Hamas in Gaza to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is dangerous to Americans and to our civilization. Americans know that 13 years of effort under two presidents have failed to defeat the forces of radical Islamism. In fact, those forces are more powerful, more widespread and more dangerous than they were 13 years ago. Past strategies have failed. As The Washington Post's Richard Cohen described the threat of the group calling itself the Islamic State, ""The Nazis are back -- differently dressed, speaking a different language and murdering ostensibly for different reasons but actually for the same: intolerance, hatred, excitement and just because they can."" He concluded, ""The decapitation of Foley and the depredations of the Islamic State are evil returned, evil that can be understood only as beyond understanding. It needs to be eliminated."" Top questions for Obama . Because these are issues of life and death, and of mortal threat from openly avowed enemies, the American people will listen to the Wednesday night speech with intense interest. This speech has the potential to transcend partisanship and to bring together the American people in the face of a common enemy. For the President's policies to succeed will require more than one speech. The first step, however, has to be a successful, nonpartisan, national speech by the commander in chief. A successful, nonpartisan, national security speech will be new ground for Obama. On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, it's a unique moment for the President to provide real leadership and bring Americans together in the face of a common enemy. Here are some key questions citizens might ask themselves as they listen to the speech: . 1. How does the President define the nature of the enemy? Is it geographic or ideological? Do the key aims have to do with territory in Iraq and Syria or with a poisonous belief system with no borders? Any narrow focus on Iraq and Syria is doomed to fail. 2. Can Obama bring himself to describe the religious intensity of our enemies? ISIS and its allies are deeply motivated by religion. Refusing to admit that weakens any strategy to defeat them. 3. What would the President consider victory? If it is not the complete defeat of radical Islamism, it will not be a successful strategy. Talking about ""managing the problem"" or ""containing the problem"" is a concession of defeat. Every day the Islamic State, Hamas, Boko Haram, al Qaeda and their allies survive, they recruit new people, develop new techniques and become more dangerous. 4. How does he intend to defeat the more than 10,000 terrorists from more than 50 countries that are fighting with ISIS, and how does he account for the fact that the threat is in 50 countries, not two? 5. What is his strategy for defeating the terrorists and recruiters we now know are coming from the United States? British Prime Minister David Cameron is proposing significant restrictions on travel and activity by radical Islamists in the UK. How does Obama propose to counter potential American terrorists? 6. Is he prepared to ask for more resources for the military, which he is using in more and more places while continuing to cut the budget? It is impossible to have a serious strategy of defeating radical Islamism without an increase in funding for the military unless he plans to transform the Pentagon dramatically. Will he submit such a funding request to the Congress? 7. Is his strategy designed to achieve rapid, decisive victory? There are rumors of a three-year campaign. That would be an absurdity. In three years, the radical Islamists will have recruited more people in more countries. It took three years and eight months from the attack on Pearl Harbor for the United States to defeat fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Taking that long to defeat the Islamic State would be an exercise in self-defeating timidity. 8. Does the President plan to lead the fight against radical Islamism or merely to support others who he asserts have to lead? If radical Islamism and the Islamic State are mortal threats to Americans and to the United States, then we have to defeat them, even if Iraq is incompetent, Syria is a dictatorship, and the Europeans are timid. This has to be a coalition that is led by America, not a coalition that leads America. Which is Obama describing? 9. What are his plans for an extended conversation with the American people to build enough support that the strategy can be sustained with popular approval until victory is achieved? One speech, one time is a beginning, not a program for victory. 10. Will he seek congressional authorization for the plan he outlines? This is crucial because the conflict must be the country's war, not Obama's war, and a vote in Congress will legitimate his action. Cruz: How U.S. can stop ISIS . If the President succeeds in these 10 areas, he will have given a historic speech. If he misses more than one or two, then he is proposing another formula for defeat. You can analyze and decide for yourself.","Newt Gingrich: ISIS has awakened Americans to threat of radical Islamists .
He says President Obama can rally nation in his speech if he answers key questions .
How will he define victory? Will military be given funds to carry out the fight properly?
Gingrich says the U.S. needs to lead coalition vs. ISIS, and Congress should vote on it ."
"(CNN) -- If you want to use Facebook a little more like Snapchat, you might soon get your chance. The social-media giant is testing a feature that would let users set a time for their status updates to disappear. A Facebook spokesman said the feature is part of a ""small pilot"" and is available only for certain people using Facebook's iOS app. Several users reported noticing the test on their iPhones. One post on Twitter showed a list of expiration options ranging from one hour to seven days. It's not the first time Facebook has tried to emulate emerging social media services designed to be used in the moment without leaving a permanent digital mark. In 2012, Facebook toyed with the concept with a standalone app, Poke. Apparently coded in part by CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself, the effort was described as something of a lark over a holiday weekend. It was shut down this year and replaced by Slingshot, a similar app on which short-lived messages show up only once two users have sent them to each other. The ephemeral has become increasingly alluring in the social-media world, particularly among younger users, in the past couple of years. The runaway success of Snapchat, which lets you send photos, texts or videos that disappear in a matter of seconds, has led the way. The scheduled deletions on Facebook, as being considered, obviously have a longer shelf life than a few seconds. Users might also want to delete updates that would no longer be of use after a short time, i.e. ""I'll be in Atlanta until noon tomorrow"" or ""I have two tickets for tonight's concert. Who wants to go?""","Facebook users might be able to schedule expiration times for their posts .

"(CNN) -- Here's something you don't see every day: The 99% demonstrating in support of the 1%. But that's exactly what's been happening for several weeks all around New England at Market Basket grocery stores. In 1916, Athanasios and Efrosini Demoulas, who immigrated to the United States from Greece, opened a grocery store in Lowell, Massachusetts. Almost a century later, the family has expanded it to a chain of 71 supermarkets across Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. In 2008, Anthanasios and Efrosini's grandson Arthur T. Demoulas was elected president of the Market Basket board. By all accounts, Arthur T., as he is known, presided over a very successful and happy company. Not only did Market Basket continue to expand and reap profits â€” generating $4 billion in revenues in 2012 â€” but workers have thrived as well. Full-time clerks start at $12 an hour. Cashiers with experience can earn over $40,000 a year. And managers can easily make into the six figures. Keep in mind that's in a nation where the average annual salary for grocery store cashiers is $21,370 and the national minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. The company also has a generous retirement plan, matching 15% of annual salary to employee retirement funds. What's more, workers up and down the supply chain receive good bonuses throughout the year. All this and Market Basket is affordable for customers, with prices regularly 10% to 20% lower than competitors. The company is profitable in an industry known for low profit margins, and has given $500 million in dividends to the nine family shareholders over the past decade. In other words, at a time when corporate executives and wealthy investors regularly try to argue that companies cannot pay workers well and be successful in generating profits, Market Basket has been an impressive and stunning example to the contrary. Market Basket has been a good company all around -- until recently, when things changed. So what happened? Well, the family board switched sides, ousted Arthur T. and installed his cousin Arthur S. Demoulas as president. One of the first acts under Arthur S. was to distribute $250 million in profits to the nine family shareholders, what a Boston Globe editorial called ""an uncharacteristic act of greed for a firm known for its generous treatment of its workers and concern for price-conscious shoppers."" There have been other ominous signs that Arthur S. and his allies plan to push profit at all costs -- at the expense of workers and the values of the company. And so in an unprecedented mobilization, managers and workers have protested at Market Baskets across New England, calling for their beloved CEO Artie T. to be reinstated. Last week, more than 6,000 Market Basket workers and managers joined in a peaceful march outside the company's headquarters in Tewksbury, Massachusetts. If you go to any Market Basket store around New England right now, you're likely to find employees and even some customers holding up signs protesting the new executive and supporting the ousted Artie T. Employees are also using social media to get their message out, using hashtags like #MarketBasket. Of course, if you go inside a Market Basket you're not likely to find much; even the warehouse workers are on strike. These protests aren't being organized by unions; after all, Market Basket workers aren't unionized. They're being organized by the employees and managers of the company. Already, eight managers have been fired for helping lead the protests. But the protests continue. As a result, the company is reportedly losing $1 million a day. A reporter interviewed one of the Market Basket workers at a protest. ""I have a friend who works at Walmart,"" she said, ""and I asked her, would they ever do this for their CEO?"" The woman laughed. But what has become of capitalism in America is not funny: the extreme greed of a few overrunning the best interests of everyone, including workers, communities and a healthy growing economy. Just like the Occupy Wall Street protesters before them, the Market Basket workers are not protesting against capitalism. They're protesting for a certain kind of capitalism, a capitalism that works for owners as well as for workers and communities. It's the kind of capitalism that has made Market Basket a successful business for generations, the kind of capitalism that once meant shared prosperity and opportunity in America. The Market Basket managers and cashiers and bag boys joining in protest aren't just holding signs, they're also holding the aspirations of the majority of Americans. Those of us concerned about the growing economic inequality in America don't want to ""eat the rich"" â€” we simply don't want the rich to chew up and spit out everyone else.","Workers from Market Basket are protesting and calling for their ex-CEO to be reinstated .

"(CNN) -- If the world comes to an end today, it won't be the first time.

"(CNN) -- Some people hire florists and caterers when planning their wedding. Former Google employee Brit Morin brought on a programmer to create a custom app. That personal app grew into Weduary, a real product that helps people design wedding sites, and Morin went on to create her own lifestyle how-to company called Brit + Co., which combines crafting, homemaking and a bit of tech. In the year since it launched, Brit + Co. has created tons of step-by-step posts, filmed how-to videos staring Brit, brought in user-generated projects and started selling merchandise such as crafting starter kits, books and subscription boxes called Brit Kits. For $20 a month, Brit + Co. will deliver a Brit Kit box filled with crafting materials and instructions for projects such as gloves that work on touchscreen devices. Last week, Brit.co entered its newest stage by branching out into content aggregation with a feature called Brit's Picks. The company is pulling in posts from 25 popular crafting and style sites, including Style Me Pretty, Oh Happy Day and Smitten Kitchen, and hand-picking the best posts to share with the Brit.co readers. Inspired by the Maker movement and the tech culture of Silicon Valley, Morin wanted to combine her interest in technology and crafting with the popular Maker movement. ""There was really no voice or teacher, specifically on the female side, who was really sharing all of these new innovations with those inspired to live creatively,"" she said of the maker culture. The projects on Brit.co are fairly simple and meant to be completed quickly, but many incorporate cool gadgetry such as 3D and laser printers, or wired elements such as Arduino kits, which are do-it-yourself computing and circuitry kits. There are recipes for no-bake peanut butter and jelly pie, instructions on how to create homemade headbands in less than five minutes, and plenty of iPhone app and accessory round-ups. One of Morin's favorite recent projects was an LED cowboy hat she wore to the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. Using littleBits pieces, she stitched wire into the hat to spell out her Twitter handle. ""Being from Texas, it really showed who I am: a little bit style, a little bit country and a little bit tech,"" said Morin. Morin says she aspires to be a combination of Marissa Mayer and Martha Stewart. She worked with Yahoo CEO Mayer in the past, and Mayer is an investor in Brit + Co. The company raised a $1.25 million seed round of funding last year from a group that also included Tina Sharkey, the former chairman of Baby Center and co-founder of iVillage. In an effort to differentiate herself from the doyennes of DIY like Stewart, Morin avoids saying the word ""craft,"" which she thinks makes people think of popsicle sticks. Instead she enthusiastically uses the word ""hack"" to describe any time- or money-saving trick. For example, she hacked a Jawbone Up fitness tracking device by wrapping the bracelet in gold wire to make it look less like a sports accessory and more like jewelry. At Brit and Co., Morin's agreeable, bubbly personality is a big part of the product. Her photographs are used to illustrate the various projects. She stars in a the how-to videos online. And she is constantly promoting the brand in magazines and on TV programs. Next week, she's headed to the ""Today"" show, where she will demonstrate how to use the Shapeways site to print metals in 3D. This personality-centric approach to branding is all part of her larger plan to emulate some very successful companies. ""We're trying to recreate what it is to have a person as the core of the brand,"" said Morin. ""In the past it was Disney, Rockefeller, Walmart; all these huge companies that have lasted for decades had a person's name in the brand."" Morin's own homemaking skills are self-taught. The 27-year-old studied business and communications at the University of Texas in Austin before moving to Silicon Valley, where she worked in product and marketing at Apple and Google. Though she has no formal design experience, she says she planned parties when she was younger and taught herself how to sew and cook. Morin says that, like her, the current generation is interested in homemaking and DIY, but suffers from a lack of time and proper training. Morin says that with so many people 35 and younger growing up with two working parents, there's been less time for passing on cooking, crafting and DIY techniques. ""This generation specifically, as opposed to older generations, didn't spend enough time on the domestic arts,"" said Morin, who aims to fill in the blanks for today's busy, stylish and proudly geeky DIY fans.","Formerly of Apple and Google, Brit Morin has created a tech and craft how-to company .

"(CNN) -- The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history continues to plague West Africa as leaders scramble to stop the virus from spreading. Over the weekend, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf closed most of the country's borders. The few points of entry that are still open will have Ebola testing centers and will implement preventive measures, she said. The president also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels, restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five-minute video on Ebola safety. ""No doubt the Ebola virus is a national health problem,"" Sirleaf said. ""It attacks our way of life, with serious economic and social consequences. As such we are compelled to bring the totality of our national resolve to fight this scourge."" As of July 20, the World Health Organization had confirmed 224 cases of Ebola in Liberia, including 127 deaths. Overall, Ebola has killed at least 660 people in West Africa. There were 45 new cases reported in the region between July 18 and July 20. Ebola: Fast Facts . Health officials are worried about the virus spreading to other countries in the region. This is the first such outbreak to hit West Africa. On Friday, a Liberian man with Ebola died in Lagos, Nigeria, Nigerian Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said. Patrick Sawyer arrived at Lagos' airport on July 20 and was isolated at a local hospital after exhibiting common Ebola symptoms. He told officials he had no direct contact with anyone who had the virus. Lagos State Health Commissioner Dr. Jide Idris said authorities are working to identify people who may have come in contact with the man on his flights. The process has been delayed, he said, because the airline has not provided the passenger lists for all three of the flights Sawyer took. Sawyer flew first to Ghana before he went to Togo and then switched planes to fly to Nigeria, according to the health commissioner. ""In collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Aviation, I've also put into motion mechanisms to track down all contacts at high risk,"" Idris said. The state department has identified 59 people so far who came into contact with the man. Twenty have been tested for Ebola. On Monday, Arik Air, one of Nigeria's biggest airlines, suspended operations into the country's capital, Monrovia, and another city called Freetown, according to AllAfrica.com. It is unlikely the virus would spread on a plane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, American health care workers helping to fight this deadly disease abroad have put themselves at risk. Dr. Kent Brantly, a 33-year-old Indianapolis resident, had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia when he started to feel sick. Brantly works with Samaritan's Purse, a Christian international relief agency founded by evangelists Franklin Graham and Robert Pierce. He has been the medical director for the Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia and has been working to help Ebola patients since October. Deadliest ever outbreak: what you need to know . ""When the Ebola outbreak hit, he took on responsibilities with our Ebola direct clinical treatment response, but he was serving in a missionary hospital in Liberia prior to his work with Ebola patients,"" said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for the organization. After testing positive for Ebola, he went into treatment at a Samaritan's Purse isolation center at ELWA Hospital in Paynesville City, Monrovia. His condition is rapidly deteriorating and Samaritan's Purse has been working to evacuate him for better care, but Liberia is not allowing the evacuation, according to Samaritan's Purse vice president of international relief, Ken Isaacs. The reason for the delay is unclear. The CDC said the doctor's family had been with him, but left for the United States before he became symptomatic; as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him. Out of an abundance of caution they are on a 21-day fever watch, the CDC said. Another American working with Samaritan's Purse has also been infected. Nancy Writebol from Charlotte, North Carolina, works with Serving in Mission, or SIM. She and her husband used to work with orphans and other children who struggle with poverty-related issues but expanded their efforts to take on the complex medical problems in Monrovia. She had teamed up with the staff from Samaritan's Purse to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Monrovia when she got sick. She, too, is undergoing treatment. A spokesperson for Samaritan's Purse said there have been riots outside the clinic. Another doctor who has played a key role in fighting the outbreak in Sierra Leone, Dr. Sheik Humarr Kahn, is sick. He is being treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres --also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, according to a representative of that agency. Kahn had been overseeing treatment of Ebola patients in isolation units at Kenema Government Hospital, which is about 185 miles (298 kilometers) east of the capital, Freetown. Sierra Leone's minister of health and sanitation called the doctor a national hero for the sacrifices he has made in trying to stop the outbreak. Doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected. It can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person's bodily fluids. The disease is not contagious until symptoms appear. Symptoms of Ebola include fever, fatigue and headaches. They can appear two to 21 days after infection, meaning many who are sick don't know it. The early symptoms then can progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function, and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Leaders in the international health community characterize the Ebola epidemic as the ""deadliest ever."" While the World Health Organization has mobilized to fight the epidemic, it can be a difficult one to stop. It is so highly infectious that it typically kills 90% of those who catch it. The death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly 60% since it has been treated early in many cases. There is, however, no Ebola vaccination. Is it time to test experimental vaccines? With the announcement that Liberia is closing its borders, the country also instituted a new travel policy to inspect and test all outgoing and incoming passengers. The hope is that such measures will stop the spread of the virus. There has never been a confirmed case of Ebola spreading to a developed country, said Kamiliny Kalahne, an epidemiologist with Doctors Without Borders. ""This is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick, have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations, they don't travel. ""And even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country, they will be in a good hospital with good infection control, so they are very unlikely to infect others,"" she said. ""This is not the great plague,"" CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said after his trip to the region in the spring. ""But it is a pretty formidable killer."" ""The grim reality is it often kills so quickly, people don't have time to spread it."" The CDC held a media briefing Monday to emphasize the fact that there is ""no significant risk in the U.S."" for an Ebola outbreak. CDC officials said with the spread of Ebola to U.S. health care workers, there is a real need for ""vigilance"" to make sure workers are careful, get tested if there is any suspicion of illness, and that all sick travelers should remain isolated when returning from areas affected directly by the epidemic. Stephan Monroe, CDC's deputy director of the National Center for Emerging & Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said the CDC is working with American health care providers to educate them about Ebola. The agency sent a notice Monday to remind doctors to take important steps to avoid the spread of the illness, including asking their patients about their travel history, particularly if they have traveled to West Africa in the last three weeks.

"(CNN) -- India's president expressed her condolences Sunday for those killed by a devastating cyclone that has forced thousands to seek refuge in emergency shelters. The death toll along India's southeastern coastline stood at 27 as of Sunday, according to officials. This was two days after Cyclone Thane brought heavy rains and winds gusting at almost 90 miles per hour at its peak to the area. Pratibha Devisingh Patil reached out to some of those affected by the storm in the states of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, according to a statement posted on her website. ""The president has conveyed her condolences to the members of bereaved families and wished speedy recovery to the injured persons,"" her office said. The Tamil Nadu district of Cuddalore, south of the city of Chennai, was hit particularly hard. The storm uprooted trees, ripped off traffic signals from their posts and sent shards of glass and other debris whizzing through the air. Amuthavalli, the district's top official who goes by a single name, told CNN that some people lost their lives when walls collapsed or downed power lines caused electrocution. Some 7,000 people are staying in emergency shelters set up in school buildings, community halls and 20 cyclone centers in the Cuddalore area, she said.

"(CNN) -- India's central bank cut key lending rates for the first time in three years on Tuesday in an aggressive effort to stimulate growth and boost investment at a time when the gloss is rapidly coming off Asia's third largest economy. The Reserve Bank of India cut the repo rate -- the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks -- by 50 basis points to 8 per cent. The more-than-expected reduction was widely welcomed by business. After having increased interest rates 13 times since March 2010, the RBI's move reflects a shift in the bank's policy from focusing exclusively on reining in inflation -- which at 6.89 per cent remains high -- to reviving the country's slowing economy, which has been choked by its aggressive monetary tightening strategy. ""The rate cut shows that the attention has now shifted towards stimulating growth, there is no doubt about that,"" said A Prasanna, an economist at ICICI securities. ""The RBI was worried about inflation but from the latest data we can see that it has come down and is somewhat under control. Now that inflation's trajectory is downward the RBI is more confident to cut rates,"" he added. The decision announced by Duvvuri Subbarao, India's central bank governor, comes after China, Brazil and Indonesia moved to ease liquidity, as emerging economies try to shield themselves from the European debt crisis. Growth in the last quarter of 2011 was the slowest in nearly three years, rising 6.1 per cent in the three months to December 31, compared to above 8 per cent a year earlier. Meanwhile, inflation has eased persistently over the last year. The wholesale price index rose 6.89 per cent in March -- below 7 per cent for the third consecutive time. Indian companies welcomed the move. Industrialists had been begging the central bank to cut rates over the last two years, as they blamed the RBI's aggressive monetary tightening policy for stalling investment and damaging overall growth. Rajiv Kumar, director of the Federation of India Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the move would be overwhelming welcomed by business. ""We called for a bold move and finally we got a bold rate cut,"" said Mr Kumar. However, he cautioned that a 50 basis point rate cut would not be enough to put the Indian economy back on strong growth track. He said that the government had to push through structural reforms to ease investment. ""The RBI has done its part now the government needs to do its part,"" said Mr Kumar. ""Unfortunately they [the government] don't inspire much confidence at the moment."" Economists warn that there will not be a wave of rate cuts in the following months, especially as inflation will remain a key concern for the central bank over the next three quarters.","India's central bank cut key lending rates for the first time in three years .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge's ruling Wednesday cleared the way for a controversial mosque in Tennessee to open in time for the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. County officials must conduct a final building inspection at the mosque in Murfreesboro, near Nashville, U.S. District Judge Todd J. Campbell said in a temporary restraining order. The order will allow the mosque to complete the inspection process so it can use its building in time for the religious holiday of Ramadan, which starts at sunset Thursday, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty said in a statement. ""This is a great victory not just for the Muslims of Murfreesboro, but for people of all faiths. No house of worship should be kept from meeting just because the neighbors don't like their religious beliefs,"" said Luke Goodrich, deputy general counsel at the Washington-based fund, which represented the mosque in a federal lawsuit. The U.S. Justice Department and the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro filed separate lawsuits this week, arguing that Rutherford County officials violated federal laws when they denied requests for a final inspection and certificate of occupancy for the mosque. The center argued that it was being unconstitutionally blocked ""merely because local anti-Islamic protests have made the mosque controversial."" Justice Department officials coordinated the timing of their lawsuit with the local case because they thought there would be ""irreparable harm"" if the mosque were not allowed to open for Ramadan, spokesman Mitchell Rivard said. Plans for the mosque have resulted in threats to the center and a lawsuit that led to a county judge's order shutting down the project in June. County officials had cited that order when they denied requests for the final inspection. The construction site had been vandalized multiple times, including by an arson attack in 2010, and federal authorities have charged a Texas man with calling in a bomb threat to the center before last year's anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Tennessee mosque's fate up in the air after court ruling . The center's lawsuit argued that it was ordered to meet ""a heightened standard of notice in the zoning process"" because of objections by some Murfreesboro residents, a standard no other religious institution has been asked to meet. ""This double standard for the mosque has deprived ICM of its legal rights under federal law and the Constitution, serves no public purpose and threatens to cripple ICM's ability to observe Ramadan,"" the lawsuit states. The project had been approved by a planning commission and was under construction when Corlew reversed that approval because of what he said was the insufficient notice. The county followed its normal practice of publishing notice of the hearing in the local newspaper, but Corlew said more should have been done because the mosque was ""an issue of major importance to citizens."" Four county residents filed suit to block the mosque in September 2010, arguing it posed a ""risk of terrorism generated by proselytizing for Islam and inciting the practices of Sharia law"" and that planning commissioners violated their due process rights. They also demanded the judge bar any approval until the Islamic center showed that it was not interested in ""the overthrow of the American system of government, laws and freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution."" On Wednesday, Campbell ruled that the Justice Department had ""demonstrated that the mosque is necessary to accommodate the number of worshipers, especially during the holy season of Ramadan, which begins July 20. The new building, which is ready to serve the community, eliminates the facilities problems, providing ample space for prayer, holiday celebrations, religious meetings and children's play.""

"Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN) -- The three main UK party leaders gave a joint promise Tuesday that Scotland will get extra powers if it opts to stay part of the United Kingdom in a landmark vote in two days' time. Opinion polls have put the pro-independence and pro-union camps neck-and-neck in the run-up to Thursday's referendum. With the survival of the 300-year-old union of England, Scotland and Wales as Great Britain on a knife-edge, UK Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservatives, coalition partner Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats and Labour leader Ed Miliband have joined forces to beg Scotland to stay. In a pledge published on the front page of Scotland's Daily Record newspaper, the three leaders say that if Scotland's voters reject independence, work to devolve ""extensive new powers"" from the central government in Westminster will start Friday. The issue of spending on social welfare and health care, through the National Health Service, has been central to the pro-independence campaign. Questions over the economy and taxation have also been key. In their promise, the leaders say ""we can state categorically that the final say on how much is spent on the NHS will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament."" They conclude, ""People want to see change. A No vote will deliver faster, safer and better change than separation."" 'Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' With a huge turnout expected for the referendum, both sides are desperate to win over the undecided voters who could hold the future of the United Kingdom in their hands. In a speech Monday in Aberdeen, Scotland, Cameron made an emotional plea for Scotland not to ""end the United Kingdom as we know it"" and warned that there was no turning back if voters decide on independence. ""This is a decision that could break up our family of nations, and rip Scotland from the rest of the UK,"" he said. ""And we must be very clear. There's no going back from this. No rerun. This is a once-and-for-all decision. ""If Scotland votes yes, the UK will split, and we will go our separate ways forever."" Cameron said he spoke for millions of people across the United Kingdom -- including in Scotland -- who would be ""heartbroken"" to see Scotland leave, and he warned that it would be a ""painful divorce."" Photo blog: Scottish teens face historic vote . The ""Yes Scotland"" campaign, led by Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, says that only by voting for independence can Scotland be sure that it will have full control of its own taxation and spending. Salmond, speaking in Edinburgh on Monday, called the vote a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" for Scotland. ""Nobody goes back"" from independence, he said. ""The evidence is that more and more people in Scotland are wanting to put Scotland's future into Scotland's hands."" The yes/no referendum question will ask voters, ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" Scotland's vote: What you need to know . White House: We want a strong, robust UK . White House spokesman Josh Earnest weighed into the debate Monday, echoing remarks previously made by U.S. President Barack Obama. ""This is a decision for the people of Scotland to make,"" he said. ""We certainly respect the right of individual Scots to make a decision about the -- along these lines. ""But, you know, as the President himself said, we have an interest in seeing the United Kingdom remain strong, robust, united and an effective partner."" Many unanswered questions revolve around defense if Scotland votes for independence. The Scottish National Party, headed by Salmond, has said it wants to remove the UK nuclear submarine fleet from Scottish waters as soon as possible. 'A fool's errand' The debate has polarized opinion in the business world, as well as in political circles. The Financial Times published a full-page editorial last week headlined, ""The case for union is overwhelming. The path of separation is a fool's errand."" Speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour this week, editor Lionel Barber said, ""We really believe that it would be very dangerous and highly risky in terms of economics. ... We believe that the 'Yes' campaign has not answered important questions -- notably: What will the currency be? We don't know."" The three main parties in Westminster have said that an independent Scotland would not be able to keep the pound. There are also unanswered questions about tax increases and the fiscal implications of independence, Barber said. While the newspaper does not deny that Scotland has the right to choose independence, he said, ""We are just pointing to the dangers of uncertainty, the price of uncertainty, which will affect ordinary people."" Salmond, who met with business leaders in Edinburgh, said the ""impressive array"" of business leaders who back the independence campaign ""is a very strong point in the 'Yes' campaign."" ""These are the people looking forward to the realization that Scotland can have a more prosperous economy but also wants a more just society. And their voice and that combination of things is something that will carry a good deal of weight off the ballot sheet."" CNN's Max Foster reported from Edinburgh, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.","Leaders of the three main UK parties give Scotland a joint promise of extra powers .

"Kolkata, India (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday applauded India's efforts to reduce its imports of Iranian oil but urged it to cut them further to keep pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program. ""We think India as a country understands the importance of trying to use diplomacy to resolve these difficult threats and is certainly working toward lowering their purchases of Iranian oil,"" Clinton said in Kolkata, the first stop on her visit to India. ""We commend the steps they've taken thus far and hope they will do even more."" The United States and other Western countries are using economic pressure on Iran, particularly on its oil industry, to try to push Tehran into halting its nuclear program. They have encouraged Asian countries like India, Japan and South Korea -- key consumers of Iranian oil -- to cut back their purchases. U.S. officials say India has lowered the amount of oil it buys from Iran in recent months. But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government is also wrestling with stubbornly high inflation and is wary of provoking upward pressure on prices. India imports about 70% of the oil it uses, with around 10% to 14% estimated to come from Iran. Clinton said Monday that there was an ""adequate"" supply of oil ""in the marketplace."" Key world powers met with Iran earlier this month about its intentions for its nuclear program and announced that the next meeting would take place in late May. Iran maintains it is not planning to build a bomb. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has cautioned that he doesn't think the economic sanctions are having an effect. Clinton argued in favor of the current approach on Monday. ""We do not believe Iran would have come to the table if there had not been sanctions and pressure,"" Clinton said Monday. ""We do not believe Iran will peacefully resolve this unless the pressure continues."" She made the comments before she traveled to New Delhi, where she is met with Singh and other top officials.

"Seoul (CNN) -- Like most South Korean mothers, Ahn Mi-ja was worried about her son's compulsory military service. She has a point -- Yoon Seung-joo's medical unit is stationed close to the border with North Korea, which remains a very real threat. Yet the real enemy was far closer than she could have ever imagined. For more than a month, Private Yoon was beaten. Denied food, the 20-year old was forced to lick phlegm from the floor or eat his own vomit. He was hooked up to an intravenous drip to revive him when he faltered. Then on April 6 this year, his body could take no more. Force-fed frozen food as he was being beaten, he simply stopped breathing and died. The official autopsy report stated the cause of death as asphyxiation. His alleged abusers were half a dozen of his fellow comrades. The oldest was just 25. Extensive bruising . It was a Sunday afternoon when Yoon's parents got the call to come to the hospital. When Yoon's two sisters arrived they noticed extensive bruising on his body and questioned the claim that he choked. ""The military came and started taking photos,"" Yoon's mother recalled. ""They didn't answer our questions, just took photos and left."" It would take months before the full scale of Yoon's abuse became clear. And it did not come directly from the military, rather from a leaked internal report obtained by a military human rights group. ""The handling of this case is simply not transparent,"" said Lim Tae-hoon of The Center for Military Human Rights. ""We would like the families of the bereaved or the victims to have unlimited access to military information."" Reforms . South Korea's defense ministry has made some structural changes: Parents can now call and visit more often, leave is more flexible and barracks are being updated. ""The Korean military has tried very hard to obliterate violence,"" said spokesman Kim Min-seok. ""But recently the violence has resurfaced. Violence is like a weed, you have to constantly pull it out and some officers probably misunderstood, thinking violence had disappeared."" An army survey conducted in April in tandem with the investigation seems to back up Kim's suggestion the military became complacent about violence. Almost 4,000 previously unreported cases of abuse emerged. A military dictatorship until the late 1980s, South Korea has struggled with decades of bullying within the military. Now, there are calls for more transparency. The defense ministry rejects all accusations of a cover up in this case, the spokesman going so far as to say parents thank them for telling them how their sons died. Bullying culture . Ahn Mi-ja is not one of those parents. Describing how she felt when she saw her son's alleged attackers, she said: ""My skin shook and everything went dark. I couldn't control my mind and I couldn't move when I saw them ... I wanted to do to them exactly what they did to my son."" For Ahn, the most important thing is that her son did not die in vain; that a bullying culture within the military will change -- a culture the military claims starts at school. ""It is pure evil what they did,"" said Ahn. ""A human shouldn't be able to do that. I want a just punishment... I know you can't say something like this will never happen again, but even if it helps a little bit, I hope they get serious punishment.""

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- A baby made his way into the world this week in Indonesia at 19.2 pounds (8.7 kg) -- about three times the weight of an average newborn. The giant baby lies next to a more typically-sized newborn. Muhammad Akbar Risuddin, born Monday, is thought to be the heaviest baby born to date in Indonesia. ""I was very surprised. I thought it was twins,"" said Binsar Sitanggang, the lead doctor in the cesarean-section delivery at Abdul Manan Hospital in North Sumatra. ""It needed a longer time than normal to deliver this baby,"" Sitanggang said. ""He was hardly breathing when we took him out. But, thank God, he is healthy."" His parents, Hananuddin and Ani, who like many Indonesians use only one name, have two other children. Both were big at birth but were not abnormally large. Their new addition is 24.4 inches (62 cm) long. ""We can compare this giant baby with a 9- to 10-month-old baby,"" Sitanggang said. ""Both his parents are tall and big, so there might be a genetic cause for this."" Sitanggang said the baby has already developed a robust appetite, requiring instant milk as well as breast milk. The boy has become somewhat of a celebrity. Curious people streamed into the hospital Friday for a glimpse. Even the mayor came by and had the honor of naming the infant after himself. The world's heaviest baby was born in 1879 in Ohio and weighed 23.8 pounds (10.8 kg), but the baby died 11 hours later, according to Guinness World Records.

"(CNN) -- China and India need to reach agreement on how they will manage water from one of the world's great rivers -- the Yarlung-Zangbo-Brahmaputra -- before it becomes another serious impediment to relations between the two Asian heavyweights. Water scarcity already affects large parts of China and India. As their populations grow and income levels rise, forcing up demand for water-intensive food such as meat, the supply situation will worsen. Inevitably, that means tension over water resources. There is a regional precedent for a bilateral water treaty: bitter rivals India and Pakistan, under prodding from the World Bank, signed the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 to cover water use from the Indus and five other rivers that flow through the two nations. While far from perfect, the treaty has given farmers and other users in both countries a framework on which they can make crop production and hydropower decisions. Infographic: The secret life of drinking water . Already, China's construction of a 540-megawatt hydropower dam on the Yarlung-Zangbo, which flows for 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) across the southern Tibetan plateau before it enters Indian territory and becomes the Brahmaputra, is cause for concern in New Delhi. The dam, known as the Zangmu, is due for completion in 2015. While the Zangmu dam is a relatively small project, there is something much bigger on the horizon: a 38,000-megawatt dam at Motuo, near the river's ""Great Bend,"" which potentially could reduce the volume of water flowing into India and Bangladesh. While China maintains that any dams it builds on its part of the river will have little downstream impact, up to 150 million people living in eastern India and Bangladesh could be affected. Almost half the world's population -- the 3.5 billion people living in Central, South and East Asia -- relies on water from the great rivers that rise in the Himalayas, the Tibetan plateau, and the Tibetan ethnic areas of China. The way the most important of these rivers -- the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween, Yangzi, Yellow and Mekong -- are used carries the potential for conflict as countries struggle with the challenges of rising populations, pressure on farming and food supplies, diminishing water quality and demand for hydropower. China has always been prepared to move mountains and people to achieve its economic and social goals. The $25 billion Three Gorges Project, built in the upper reaches of the Yangzi River between 1994-2011, is testament to that. As many as 1.3 million people were relocated so the dam could be built, both to generate power and as a flood mitigation measure. Its full ecological impact is yet to be determined. Now China is working on its massive $60 billion South-North Water Diversion Project that involves the country's two most important rivers -- the Yangzi and the Yellow -- plus numerous tributaries, canals and other rivers such as the Huai and Hai. It is one of the biggest civil engineering projects conceived anywhere in the world. First formulated by Chairman Mao Zedong in 1952 as a way to move water from the southern half of China to the dry but heavily populated north, the three-part scheme took its first steps forward in 2002 when work began on the 1,155 kilometer (716 mile) eastern route. This part of the project, scheduled for completion in 2013, will take water from the Yangzi River via channels to Shandong province, and then by a tunnel under the Yellow River and onwards to the coastal city of Tianjin. Work on the central route began late in 2003. This 1,267 kilometer (785 mile) diversion is designed to take water from a reservoir on the Han River (a tributary of the Yangzi) along new canals on to Henan and Hebei provinces, and finally to Beijing. A trunk line will also serve Tianjin. Long-term, the western route is the one which causes the most concern, as it involves diverting water from tributaries of the Yangzi, including the Tongtian, Dadu and Yalong rivers, across the Bayankala Mountains to the Yellow River, to supply northwest China. While some experts doubt the western diversion will ever be built because of the massive cost and logistical challenges of tunnelling under a mountain range, China's record in building mega-projects suggests otherwise. In March this year, Vice-Premier (and likely premier in 2013) Li Keqiang told a State Council meeting that drought and water shortages in the north had held back economic development there. As a consequence, he said, the South-North diversion project was ""essential."" In June, China announced it had begun work on a key part of the central route: a $1.4 billion, 45 kilometer tunnel to divert water from the Yangzi river to Beijing. The tunnel should be finished by 2014. China has always moved faster than India; that's why the time for a water treaty is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Geoff Hiscock.","China, India need to agree on water management of Yarlung-Zangbo river .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Five aid workers -- four Europeans and a Kenyan -- were kidnapped from Kenya's vast Dadaab refugee complex near the Somali border, police said Friday. Their Kenyan driver was killed, said Philip Ndolo of the Kenyan police. Two other members of staff were injured and are undergoing treatment at a hospital in the capital of Nairobi, officials said. The abductors got away with a vehicle of the Norwegian Refugee Council, a global humanitarian agency. The vehicle's tracking device indicated that it was still within Kenyan territory. The aid group said the governments and relatives of the aid workers have been notified, but their nationalities will not be revealed. ""In our experience with these types of incidents, the less information we provide on the identity of those abducted, the better,"" said Rolf Vestvik, a spokesman for the aid agency. ""We've also come to this conclusion after being advised by our own security team and after seeking outside security assistance."" The aid agency said only that a convoy ""was involved in an incident"" in Dadaab and that Secretary General Elisabeth Rasmusson and Country Director Hassan Khaire were at the camp but neither was in the convoy. Police have launched a search in the area. They would not say whether the kidnappers were from Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group that is fighting to impose Islamic law in Somalia and controls large parts of the troubled nation. Kenya has blamed previous abductions of tourists and aid workers on Al-Shabaab. In September, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat. She was released months later in Somalia after her family paid a ransom. In October, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s, who used a wheelchair and was believed to be in bad health, from a holiday home on Manda Island, where she lived part of the year. She later died, likely because of the kidnappers' refusal to give her medicine, according to the French Foreign Ministry. Also in October, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers with the medical charity Doctors Without Borders from Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, which houses nearly 500,000 people about 50 miles west of the Somali border.

"(CNN) -- Somalia's president has spoken out against Kenya's military incursion into his country, saying his nation's African neighbor has overstepped its bounds by pursuing Islamic militants beyond its borders. Somali President Sharif Ahmed said Monday that the strike degrades the trust built up between the two countries over the past few decades, and called Kenya's actions ""not good."" His comments contradict a joint Somali-Kenyan communique issued three days after the Kenyan incursion. In that statement, both countries declared the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab ""a common enemy to both countries"" and pledged to work together to stabilize Somalia and cooperate in security and military operations. Kenyan forces entered Somalia on October 15 in a strike on Al-Shabaab, a Somali militant group that Kenya blames for the recent kidnappings of foreigners from northern Kenya. The Kenyan forces are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the United Nations as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab. The United Nations estimates the group collects up to $50 million a year from businesses in Kismayo, about half of its annual income. Somali's frail Transitional Federal Government, aided by forces from the African Union, has itself been fighting Al-Shabaab militants in the capital, Mogadishu, and reported last week that they had largely pushed the group out of that city. On Monday, the state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corporation reported that Kenyan troops were gearing up for an assault of Afmadow in south central Somalia, a key location in the effort to capture Kismayo. Kenyan forces had pushed 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) north into Somalia as of Monday, KBC reported, and were conducting aerial assaults against Al-Shabaab positions in Kismayo. Kenyan officials declared self-defense justifies crossing the border with Somalia, saying the recent spate of kidnappings threatened its security and constituted an attack. ""If you are attacked by an enemy, you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try (to) hit wherever that enemy is,"" Kenyan Defense Minister Yusuf Haji said in a news conference Sunday. Al-Shabaab warned Kenya that it would face repercussions if it did not withdraw its troops immediately. Days later, twin explosions in Nairobi killed at least one person. In response to suggestions that the United States might be aiding the Kenyan assault, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman said Monday that it is not providing any advice or assistance to Kenya. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, reiterated that point Tuesday, saying, ""The United States is not participating in Kenya's current operation in Somalia."" The kidnappings that sparked the Kenyan attack raised the ire of Kenyans and Westerners alike. On September 11, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away aboard the pirates' speedboat. She is believed to have been taken into Somalia. On October 1, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s from the holiday home on Manda Island, where she lived for part of the year. That woman, Marie Dedieu, reportedly died after her capture. And last week, gunmen abducted two Spaniards working for the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) from the Dadaab refugee complex, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the Somali border.","The Somali president calls Kenya's incursion to chase down a militant group ""not good""

"(CNN) -- When it comes to comedy, the Emmys are making room for ""Girls."" ""Girls,"" the polarizing HBO comedy about four twentysomething women finding their way in 21st-century New York, received five nods Thursday when the nominations for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards were announced. Among the show's nominations were picks for best comedy series as well as best actress in a comedy for creator and writer Lena Dunham. ""Girls"" joined fellow newcomer ""Veep"" as well as comedy mainstays ""Modern Family"" -- which led all comedy series with 14 nominations -- ""30 Rock"" (13 nods), ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" among comedy series nominees. ""Family"" won the category last year. Several veteran shows were among the nominees for best drama series, including ""Mad Men"" -- which has won this category four years running -- ""Boardwalk Empire,"" ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Game of Thrones."" PBS' breakout hit ""Downton Abbey,"" which was nominated in the miniseries category last year, joined the crew for best drama, as did Showtime's ""Homeland."" Thanks to the showings of ""Thrones,"" ""Girls,"" ""Empire"" and the movie ""Game Change,"" HBO led all networks with 81 nominations. ""Mad Men"" and the FX series ""American Horror Story,"" which was put in the miniseries category, led all programs with 17 nominations each. ""Downton Abbey"" and the History Channel's ""Hatfields and McCoys"" both earned 16 nods. CBS led broadcast networks with 60 nominations. ""Girls"" has divided both critics and viewers. Some have dismissed the show for its narrow take on New York and young women, noting the lack of African-American characters, its general hip and upscale settings, and Dunham's willingness to make her audience squirm as she follows characters into both bedroom and bathroom. The show's defenders, on the other hand, applaud Dunham for showing her characters in less-than-flattering lights and observe that ""Girls"" isn't the first series to take place in a perceived vacuum. Indeed, ""Sex and the City"" -- to which Dunham's show has been compared -- also showed a thin slice of New York through the lives of four women (and much more glamorously, to boot). The nominations weren't without their perceived snubs. Despite both critical acclaim and a growing audience, Louis C.K.'s FX series ""Louie"" didn't make the cut for comedy series, though the comedian-writer-DIY guy did receive a nod for best actor in a comedy. NBC's ""Parks and Recreation"" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination. NBC's self-referential sitcom ""Community,"" a critical darling that was the subject of heated controversy when the show's creator, Dan Harmon, was forced out as executive producer in May, got just one nomination, for writing. Marquee: The nominees list . However, there were also some surprises. Don Cheadle, whose Showtime series ""House of Lies"" received an uneven reception upon its January premiere, earned a nomination for best actor in a comedy series. ""Homeland,"" about a CIA agent combating terrorism and her own demons, received plenty of attention, picking up nine nominations, including nods for best drama series and stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. ""It's an incredible thrill to be nominated our first year out. When we wrote the pilot, we never imagined that the Television Academy would include us in the company of such extraordinary nominees,"" ""Homeland's"" co-creators Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa said in a statement. And the ageless Betty White (OK, she's actually 90) was nominated for best reality show host for ""Betty White's Off Their Rockers."" (Her comedy series, ""Hot in Cleveland,"" also got recognition, with two nominations.) The prize for best drama series, usually considered the night's capstone, looks to be a wide-open race. Though ""Mad Men"" has won it four consecutive years, AMC's ""Breaking Bad,"" featuring Bryan Cranston's best actor-nominated performance as a chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin, is coming off a strong year, and ""Downton Abbey"" offers a rich and sumptuous take on early 20th-century life. Moreover, ""Thrones,"" based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling fantasy novels, ""Homeland"" and ""Boardwalk"" all have their partisans. The nominations were announced by Kerry Washington, star of ABC's ""Scandal,"" and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel, who stepped in for ""Parks and Recreation"" actor Nick Offerman at the last minute (Offerman suffered travel delays), showed up in pajamas. ""Who are you wearing?"" asked Washington impishly. ""This is from the husky baby collection,"" Kimmel replied. The 64th Primetime Emmy Awards will take place September 23. The show will air on ABC from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.","HBO leads all networks with 81 Emmy nominations .

"(CNN) -- Given the way Serena Williams played in 2013 -- amassing a 78-4 record and picking up two more majors -- she was always going to be the favorite at the Australian Open. She is now even more of a favorite after defeating the reigning two-time Australian Open champion, Victoria Azarenka, to capture the title in Brisbane on Saturday. In downing the world No. 2 6-4 7-5, Williams extended her winning streak to 22 matches and ended Azarenka's 24-match run in Australia. Williams also came through against a tough opponent in the semifinals, seeing off Maria Sharapova in straight sets.

""In Melbourne if I have to face Maria again, I'll know a little bit more what to expect, and same thing with Victoria. If I happen to play against her in Melbourne, I'll know what to do and what to expect."" Williams was never in danger in the opener but had to rally from a 4-2 deficit in the second set against the player who severely tested the American in September's U.S. Open final. Williams -- hampered by ankle injuries in Melbourne the previous two years -- improved to 14-3 against Azarenka. ""I want to play better,"" Azarenka told reporters. ""I'm a perfectionist. ""I can't say I'm satisfied today, but I want to take the positive, what I've done today, and build from here towards the next week.""

"London (CNN) -- Why did Lee Rigby have to die? That's what people around Britain -- its officials, its authorities, its citizens -- asked themselves Thursday, a day after the soldier was hit with a car, then hacked to death on a London street in broad daylight. There's been no indication that the 25-year-old machine gunner, drummer and father of a 2-year-old boy knew the men who attacked him with meat cleavers. One of them who approached a man filming the gory scene in southeast London's Woolwich neighborhood suggested Rigby had been targeted only ""because Muslims are dying daily"" at the hands of British troops like him. Soldier slain in London was a machine gunner, Royal Palaces drummer, father . That man and another who suffered gunshot wounds in a confrontation with police minutes after Rigby's killing spent Thursday in stable condition at separate South London hospitals. Even with those two suspected attackers under guard, authorities pressed for answers -- and to determine if others might have been somehow involved and, if so, why. Six residences have been searched, and two people -- a man and a woman, both of them age 29 -- were arrested Thursday on ""suspicion of conspiracy to murder,"" London's Metropolitan Police said. ""This is a large, complex and fast-moving investigation which continues to develop,"" added police. The attack, which Prime Minister David Cameron and others called an act of terror, stirred anxiety and alerts in Britain not seen since the summer of 2005, when coordinated bomb attacks struck London's public transport network. An additional 1,200 police are now on London's streets to reassure the public, Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Crime and Operations Mark Rowley said, with extra patrols at key locations such as religious institutions and transport hubs. Steps were also taken to further protect military installations and personnel, he added. Abu Barra blamed Wednesday's attack not on his friend Michael Adebolajo -- who he says is the bloody, cleaver-wielding man shown talking in the video aired by CNN affiliate ITN -- but on the British government and predicted there may be more attacks. ""As long as (British) foreign policy is engaging in violence, they're only inviting violence in retaliation,"" Barra told CNN. By sharp contrast, Cameron said ""the fault lies solely with sickening individuals who carried out this attack,"" adding that ""nothing in Islam ... justifies this truly dreadful act."" ""This was not just an attack on Britain and on the British way of life; it was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so much to our country."" London attack: Terrorists targeting soldiers at home again? Suspect knew British Muslim radical leader . It is understood that the two individuals suspected of carrying out the knife attack were known to Britain's domestic security service. They had featured in previous investigations into other individuals, but were not themselves under surveillance. Friends, acquaintances and British media identified the 28-year-old Adebolajo as the suspect seen on the ITN video. The identities of the other man, 22, and the two people arrested Thursday aren't known. A British national of Nigerian descent, Adebolajo converted to Islam and became passionate about his faith, said Barra. British Muslim radical leader Anjem Choudary told CNN on Thursday that he knew Adebolajo, noting that the suspect attended demonstrations and a few lectures organized by Choudary's group Al-Muhajiroun. In fact, an ITN video from April 2007 shows Adebolajo standing behind Choudary at a rally protesting the arrest of men who allegedly made inflammatory speeches inside a mosque. Barra described his friend as a ""very caring"" man who ""just wanted to help everybody."" He was also ""very vocal"" about his feelings that Muslims were being oppressed, injustices he pinned, in part, on the British government. ""I wasn't surprised that it happened,"" Barra said of Wednesday's attack. ""... Britain is only responsible, the government. And I believe all of us, as a public, we are responsible. We should condemn ourselves, why we did not do enough to stop these wars going on in Iraq and Afghanistan."" The Woolwich bloodshed spurred concerns not only about violence by Islamic extremists but also about attacks targeting Muslims by people angry about Rigby's killing. ""People can only take so much. And people will break,"" said Victor Easdown, a construction worker who heard shots ring out in Woolwich as police took on Rigby's attackers. London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier . In Kent, police arrested a man on suspicion of ""racially aggravated criminal damage"" at a religious building. And Wednesday night in Essex, a man with two knives was arrested after throwing a smoke grenade at the Al Falah Braintree Islamic Center and demanding someone come outside to answer to the Woolwich slaying, the mosque's secretary Sikander Sleemy said. Members of the far-right English Defence League clashed with police late Wednesday, with a tweet from its official account touting that ""it's fair to say that finally the country is waking up!:-) NO SURRENDER!"" ""Don't listen to the Government cover ups, The lies about Islam being peaceful,"" read another EDL tweet Thursday. Political and social commentator Mohammed Ansar appealed for ""a sense of calm (and) perspective"" after what he called ""a really, really heinous act of, I would say, criminality, ... not terrorism."" ""What we don't need are knee-jerk reactions ... to really ratchet up tensions and really stoke and inflame anxieties within communities,"" he told CNN. Watch: Terrorism analyst on soldier killing . Paper: Woman says she talked to attacker . The attack may have wide-ranging repercussions in Britain, including possibly enflaming sectarian tensions and leading to more violence. But it's already have an impact on people who live and work in Woolwich -- the working-class, multicultural neighborhood where the mutilation took place -- and witnessed the carnage firsthand. A man who identified himself as James told London's LBC 97.3 radio station that he saw two men standing by the victim, who was on the ground. At first, James thought they were trying to help the man. But then he saw two meat cleavers, like a butcher would have. ""They were hacking at this poor guy, literally,"" he told the radio station. ""These two guys were crazed. They were just not there. They were just animals."" Witness: Attackers 'were just animals' Amid the horror, an individual story of courage emerged Thursday in the person of a Cub Scout leader named Ingrid Loyau-Kennett. Loyau-Kennett told Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper that she had jumped off a bus to try to revive a man -- later determined to be Rigby -- she thought had been hurt accidentally. She swiftly realized the man was dead, and it was no accident. ""When I went up, there was this black guy with a revolver and a kitchen knife. He had what looked like butcher's tools, and he had a little ax, to cut the bones, and two large knives, and he said, 'Move off the body,' "" she told the newspaper. ""So I thought, 'OK, I don't know what is going on here,' and he was covered with blood. I thought I had better start talking to him before he starts attacking somebody else."" Unarmed police -- like most in Britain -- arrived at 2:29 p.m. Wednesday, nine minutes after the first call came in police. Armed officers were on site five minutes later. Witnesses recounted the suspects then ran at the police, who responded with gunshots. Recalling the incident later on ITV, Loyau-Kennett said she wasn't scared when she talked to one of those suspects -- who then had a revolver, knife and cleaver in his bloody hands -- minutes before those shots rang out. ""Better me than a child,"" she said. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote from London, and CNN's Greg Botelho did the same from Atlanta. CNN's Dan Rivers, Jonathan Wald, Carol Jordan, Atika Shubert, Erin McLaughlin, Richard Allen Greene, Ed Payne and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: A woman who talked to a suspect said she felt, ""Better me than a child""

"(CNN) -- Saying he hopes it sets an example for the nation, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy on Thursday signed what advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive gun legislation in the nation. The new law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high-capacity magazines like those used in the Newtown shooting in December that left 20 children and six adults dead. It also requires background checks for all gun purchases. ""This is a profoundly emotional day, I think, for everyone in this room,"" Malloy said at the signing ceremony. ""We have come together in a way that relatively few places in our nation have demonstrated an ability to do."" However, he noted, ""Today does not mark the end of our efforts"" to combat gun violence. With the governor's signature, Connecticut became the third state to pass such tough measures since the December rampage in Newtown. New York and Colorado passed gun-control legislation limiting magazine capacity, among other provisions. Similar legislation appears stalled in Congress despite overwhelming public support for background checks and substantial -- although diminished -- support for major gun restrictions in the wake of the Newtown killings. Connecticut's measure sends a message to the nation, Senate President Don Williams said Wednesday, before lawmakers approved the final draft. ""Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill,"" he added. ""That is a message that should resound in 49 other states, and in Washington, D.C., and the message is we can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress."" Despite disappointment in a provision in the Connecticut bill that allows people who already own high-capacity magazines to keep them, a gun control advocacy group praised the state legislation as historic. ""It doesn't have everything we wanted, but it was everything that could be done within the political reality we were facing,"" Connecticut Against Gun Violence said Wednesday in a statement on its website. Critics have argued the legislation will do nothing to stop someone like Adam Lanza, who carried out the Sandy Hook school killings December 14 with an assault-style weapon and high-capacity magazines. ""In his case, he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage,"" Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, previously has said. ""Limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law-abiding persons, not criminals bent on murder."" Lanza used weapons that were registered to his mother, who he also killed that day. NRA 'plucks the bird' to weaken gun proposals . What the bill does . The Connecticut measure adds more than 100 guns to the state's list of banned assault weapons, limits the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and bans armor-piercing bullets. While the new law allows current owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds to keep them, it requires those people to register the magazines with the state, and forbids owners from loading them with more than 10 rounds outside their homes or while at a gun range. The legislation also creates the nation's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of dangerous weapons. The registry will be available only to law enforcement agencies. It also requires eligibility certificates for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun or ammunition, and significantly increases penalties for illegal possession and trafficking of guns. It also requires background checks for all firearms sales, including at gun shows, and creates safety standards for school buildings. Debate on the legislation was emotional at times. Sen. Beth Bye spoke for five minutes, noting it was the same amount of time that the shooting lasted at Sandy Hook Elementary School. She recalled how parents hoping to be reunited with their children were directed to a building near the school after the shootings, but ""20 of those parents came back with a state trooper and not their child."" Some people questioned whether the law deals enough with the state's mental health system, a reference to the presumed mental condition of the shooter. The legislation allows school districts to require ""mental health first aid"" training for school personnel and creates a task force to examine the state's mental health system. Additionally, it alters state insurance regulations to beef up mental health care coverage. Newtown shooting details revealed . Reassuring gun owners . Republican House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, a member of the bipartisan task force that drafted the bill, reassured gun owners they wouldn't lose their guns or ammunition magazines, ""so long as they follow our rules and register,"" he said. ""Are there tighter restrictions on their use, etc.? Absolutely. We also were able to see as part of this legislation the repeal of early release for violent criminals."" Families of the children slain in Newtown were disappointed the larger-capacity magazines were grandfathered in. They asked had for an across-the-board ban. Malloy had backed the broader ban, saying banning the future sale of high-capacity magazines ""would not be an effective solution."" But Wilson said the magazine limits will have no impact on crime. ""It is ludicrous to expect people that have firearms capable of holding 15 rounds to only load 10 rounds inside of them,"" he objected. ""Do criminals really care about these laws?"" Obama: 'Shame on us' if Newtown doesn't bring new gun legislation . National fight . The move in Connecticut comes as the nation is in a heated gun debate. President Barack Obama has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws, an effort he continued Wednesday in Colorado -- site of two of the nation's most notorious mass shootings, in 1999 at Columbine High School and last year at an Aurora movie theater. ""There doesn't have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights,"" Obama said. Obama is fighting intense opposition from the National Rifle Association, which sees restrictions as unconstitutional and ineffective. Lawmakers in 36 states also have proposed legislation that would negate federal gun control initiatives, according to the non-profit Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group. Despite a spike in support for the strictest gun control initiatives in the immediate aftermath of the Newtown shootings, a CNN/ORC International poll this month found support for major restrictions may be fading. The poll, released March 18, found that while a majority of Americans favored major restrictions shortly after the shootings, that support had fallen to 43%. A survey released Wednesday by MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" and Marist College found that 60% of respondents want stricter laws governing the sale of firearms. Support for broader background checks on prospective gun owners remains overwhelming. The MSNBC poll showed 87% of respondents support expanded background checks, with strong backing from Democrats, independents and Republicans. A poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University pegged support for universal background checks at 91%. That was despite 48% of those polled conceding that such checks could form a database for later confiscation efforts. Opinion: Did we learn nothing from Newtown?

"(CNN) -- A video of a British man and his Saudi wife being assaulted by members of Saudi Arabia's religious police has gone viral across the Arab world. The video, which shows a man in a headscarf leaping off a car to attack another man in a parking lot, was filmed after the couple reportedly used a women-only cashier line at a supermarket in Riyadh. In a statement published on the website of a well-known Saudi writer and blogger, the British man said that while he and his wife were shopping, they noticed three young men who looked ""religious"" following them. As they were going through the cashier line reserved for women and families, he said the men ""started pushing and shoving"" and verbally abusing them. The men followed the couple out to the parking lot, where a crowd of people gathered as the argument continued. The British national said the three men ""attacked"" him after he took a photo of them on his phone, according to the online statement attributed to him. ""While I was on the ground all three of them proceeded to kick me repeatedly in the head and back,"" he said in the statement. He said that his wife got out of the car to defend him and was kicked in the stomach after hitting one of the men. In the short mobile phone video, the British man can be heard screaming, ""Get off of my wife! That's my wife, how dare you!"" He said they called the British Embassy and locked themselves in their car until ""embassy security arrived"" and they were escorted home. The man has been named by Saudi newspapers, but the British Embassy in Riyadh would not confirm his identity. He did not sign his name to the online statement but Ahmed Al Omran, the blog's owner, wrote: ""I know the man and I have met him a couple of times before. He is British, married to a Saudi woman and they have been living in Riyadh for years."" The office of the head of the religious police, officially known as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (CPVP), concluded that the video was authentic and condemned the attack on the couple as ""unacceptable"" in a statement Tuesday. The CPVP's investigation found that the men acted beyond their remit in approaching the couple inside a private shopping center, and that they lied in their accounts of events, according to the statement. Four members of the religious police have been transferred to administrative jobs outside Riyadh. A British Embassy spokesman said they were providing consular assistance to the British national and ""welcome the undertaking taken by the head of the [CVPV] Sheikh Abdullatif Al ash-Sheikh to investigate the incident fully."" The incident has been heavily covered in Saudi and Arab press and generated much discussion online. The YouTube video has been viewed more than 400,000 times. In an apparent reference to the incident, one member of Saudi Arabia's Consultative Assembly, or Shura Council, addressed the ""lack of discipline"" among religious police field workers and their ""flawed judgment"" in a session on Monday, according to the body's official website.","Video shows Saudi Arabia's religious police attacking British man and his Saudi wife .

"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Shoppers who listen closely as they approach Franklin Mills Mall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, can hear the sounds of gunfire from inside. But it's nothing to worry about. Potential recruits play virtual-combat games at an Army recruiting center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The noise is coming from a 14,500-square-foot unit tucked in next to the Banana Republic and Victoria's Secret shops -- the Army Experience Center, a state-of-the-art facility with a Humvee, a Black Hawk helicopter and an Apache gunship. The facility, the only one of its kind in the nation, represents a $12 million, two-year experiment by the Army to boost recruiting numbers. ""Enemy right, enemy right!"" echoes from the Black Hawk simulator room, where new recruits Zach Ziegler and Spencer Elmore grip M4 assault rifles as they fire at the enemy in a virtual war zone. The two 19-year-olds said they like the upscale feel of the center and the fact that the recruiters were not pushy when they came to inquire. ""It helps them recruit people, but it doesn't force them,"" Elmore said. ""You come to play games, and your eye starts to wonder what the Army does have to offer, and maybe it's something for me."" The Philadelphia area has proven difficult for Army recruiters, they said, and they hope this center will increase enlistment. The center and its 22 recruiters replaced five smaller recruitment offices in the area. Four months into the experiment, the center has signed up 37 full-time soldiers and five reservists.  See the Army Experience Center » . The new marketing approach includes 60 computers and 19 Xbox games for a hands-on, virtual reality experience that youth of all ages can participate in. Some come just to play games after school. ""They have all these kids in here that are 13, 14, 15 years old,"" said new recruit Brett Verbich, who signed up to be a Black Hawk mechanic. ""They get more exposed to it now because, you know, they are not going to walk into a regular recruiting station at 14 years old thinking about going into the Army."" Maj. Larry Dillard, a program manager based at the Pentagon, has been intimately involved with the creation of the center. One of its goals, he said, is to help overcome misconceptions about the Army. ""You can get all of your questions answered, and in the Army experience center you're not going to get a pushy, hard sell,"" he said. ""I mean, we really just want people to understand the Army. If you come in and decide the Army's not for you, but you leave understanding the Army better, then from our perspective that's success."" As the U.S. wages wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army has been looking at new approaches to attracting soldiers since a dismal recruiting year in 2005. Other steps have included increasing bonuses, hiring more recruiters and easing some standards. High unemployment tends to be good for Army recruiting, so the latest downturn also has helped sign up more people. The Army surpassed its goal of 80,000 recruits in the fiscal year that ended September 30.","U.S. Army opens a virtual-combat gaming center in a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania mall .

"(CNN) -- Flash floods that slammed parts of the southwestern United States are now blamed for two deaths. A woman in Arizona was swept away by water when she and her husband tried to drive through a flooded area on Monday, and the vehicle was picked up by the water, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said. Both exited the vehicle, and the man, 69, made it to safety, but his wife, 76, was unable to. Another Arizona woman was killed after her car was submerged in floodwaters, the Tucson Fire Department said. Rescuers were unable to reach the vehicle in time. ""Within a minute of us getting there, the car washed away,"" Capt. Barrett Baker told CNN. The waters were up to 12-feet deep, he said, and pushed the car for several blocks. Record-setting rains left up to 200 children trapped briefly in an elementary school in Moapa, Nevada, on Monday. The students at Perkins Elementary school, about 60 miles from Las Vegas, were with teachers and were not in danger, said Highway Patrol Spokesman Loy Hixson. Flash flooding also washed away a portion of Interstate 15 near the community of Glendale, taking several vehicles with it. No one has been injured, but the flooding damaged so much of the highway that it may not be fixed until Wednesday, Hixson said. In Arizona, Gov. Jan Brewer declared an emergency Monday as flooding from the historic rains closed roads and schools in her state. What caused the record-setting rains and flash floods in the Southwest? Blame Norbert, which hit Mexico's coast as a hurricane on Saturday. Now the storm system is moving through the United States, and it's still packing a punch.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Investigators believe ""Sons of Anarchy"" actor Johnny Lewis brutally killed his elderly landlord Wednesday before falling to his death as he tried to escape police whose sirens he heard approaching. It could be weeks before police understand the cause of what they say was a violent rampage by Lewis, 28, that led to the death of Katherine Davis, 81. Davis died from ""blunt head trauma and strangulation,"" according to preliminary findings from the autopsy conducted Thursday, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said. Police suspect drugs were involved, but ""we don't have any hard evidence that says he was on anything right now,"" LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said. Toxicology findings from the autopsy conducted Thursday by the coroner will be crucial to determining if the actor was under the influence of drugs, Smith added. It is expected to take at least a month before the report is done. ""After 'bath salts,' new drugs are coming out all the time and young people try new drugs all the time,"" Smith said. ""That's, of course, one of the things that our detectives are going to look into, whether he was using that or anything else."" Designer drugs on the rise . No one saw what happened inside the house where Davis, the homeowner, was found beaten to death, Smith said. The only witnesses were the man who owned the house next door and a painter, who say they were attacked by Lewis before he fell to his death. Other neighbors told police they heard a woman's screams and glass breaking, Smith said. A large pool of blood where police say Lewis' head crashed onto the pavement remained Thursday in the driveway of the house that has for decades been the temporary home for actors and producers visiting Los Angeles to make movies. The home is in the Los Feliz neighborhood near Griffith Park, on the eastern edge of the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. The first officer responding to a neighbor's 911 call found Lewis dead in the driveway, Smith said Thursday. The house ""appeared to have been ransacked,"" with furniture broken, he said. Davis was found dead on the second floor of the three-level house with her dead cat nearby in a ""gruesome scene,"" police said. Davis, who lived in the home for decades, ""typically rented to people in the movie industry, writers and actors, and they would come up here because it's a wonderful, quiet neighborhood,"" Smith said. David Thoresen, who has serviced the home's garden fountain for five years, said Davis was a small woman, standing no more than 5-feet, 3-inches tall. ""She was the happiest, nicest lady I ever met in my life,"" Thoresen said. ""I loved Kathy."" Lewis lived in the home, which is on a winding, narrow residential street on a hillside on the eastern edge of Hollywood, for about two weeks, Smith said. While Los Angeles Police would not discuss Lewis' criminal history, CNN has obtained records of two arrests in February on burglary and battery charges in Santa Monica, California. No information was available on the status of those cases. Lewis is credited with playing Kip ""Half Sack"" Epps in 26 episodes of the first two seasons of ""Sons of Anarchy"" on the FX Network, according to the Internet Movie Database. His character was killed in the finale of season two. ""Sons"" creator Kurt Sutter, in an extended Twitter posting Thursday, called Lewis' death ""a tragic end for an extremely talented guy, who unfortunately had lost his way."" ""I wish I could say that I was shocked by the events last night, but I was not,"" Sutter's tweet said. ""I am deeply sorry that an innocent life had to be thrown into his destructive path. Yes, it's day of mourning, but it's also a day of awareness and gratitude. Sadly, some of us carry the message by dying."" This week's episode of ""Sons of Anarchy,"" a series based on a violent motorcycle gang with graphic violence, included the death of ""Opie,"" a major character. Sutter's Twitter posting noted ""the sad irony of it happening two days after opie's death is not lost on me."" People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived . Sutter told TV writer Alan Sepinwall in an interview published in December 2009 that ""Johnny wasn't happy on the show."" ""Creatively, he really wanted out of his contract,"" Sutter told Sepinwell. ""We had ongoing conversations, and we decided we'd find some noble way for him to go."" Lewis played Dennis ""Chili"" Childress in nine episodes of ""The O.C."" in 2005 and 2006, according to IMDb.com. His last work was in an independent movie, ""186 Dollars to Get Out,"" which was scheduled to release this month, the IMDb.com listings said. Lewis, whose full name is Jonathan Kendrick Lewis, was born and raised in Los Angeles. He held dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship, according to his IMDb biography.

"(CNN) -- After 100 episodes of alternate universes, monsters and shape-shifters, Fox's ""Fringe"" is coming to an end on Friday night. It's set to receive a proper send-off, too, thanks to the efforts of fans who fought for the show through five seasons of time slot changes and dwindling ratings. Members of the cast, who had been with the show from the first episode, spoke to CNN about their favorite ""Fringe"" moments, their favorite guest stars and those final days on the set. Plus, that all-important question: Will fans be satisfied with the series finale? On filming the finale: . Anna Torv (""Olivia Dunham""): ""We knew it would be our last season, and part of that meant that we were able to appreciate it as we were doing it. There were lots of little moments of reflection throughout the last couple of months."" Lance Reddick (""Phillip Broyles""): ""What caught me by surprise was how emotional I got (shooting the final episode) -- not about the show, per se -- but about the people. So that was kind of intense."" Joshua Jackson (""Peter Bishop""): ""For me it was a feeling of joy -- when they called that final wrap and you see the faces of the people you did four or five years with, you think this is something we all did together. There's what I hope is a really good scene between John and myself in the finale, in the lab, fittingly. And there was a feeling like, 'Wow, that's the last time we will play father and son, in this room that has been such a part of our lives for these last five years.' "" Torv: ""I went down to see John Noble's last scene. He was doing a scene in the lab that I wasn't in. I got to sit back and watch Walter for the last time and that kind of made me sad, because John and Walter were such a beautiful fit. Just to think 'Ah! John is never going to breathe life into him again,' was kind of sad."" John Noble (""Walter Bishop""): ""It's unbelievable to go out on our own terms. Unheard of in this industry to be able to finish a story off in the way that we have. I'm just seriously grateful to the network and studio for giving us the chance."" Jasika Nicole (""Astrid Farnsworth""): ""I have watched way too many shows on television that started out wonderfully and then seemed to continue on a downward spiral once it reached its peak. I am thrilled to have taken part in a show that knew what both its ending and beginning looked like, and never tried to overextend itself."" On lessons learned: . Jackson: ""The whole experience of 'Dawson's Creek' was new to me. I knew intellectually it was a big deal to have a show run for five-and-a-half years. But this time around, I think I had a much deeper understanding of just how difficult it is to get a show to run. This show, in particular, kept on defying all the odds."" On their favorite moments: . Noble: ""The most fun (version of Walter) to play was the simple old Walter who was just a scattered genius with no social graces and completely inappropriate. That was the most fun. I had a lot of affection for 'Walternate,' who was originally very hard to get accepted by audiences and ultimately was."" Nicole: ""My favorite episodes were the ones when all the doppelgangers got to meet each other. I loved how each character had a different experience when they saw their 'other' for the first time. They were beautifully written and beautifully performed."" Torv: ""I was so grateful that they really stuck it out with the different universe. It was so fun, it was like a different show. It was great to play this lighter character (Fauxlivia) after being with Olivia for two years at that point."" Reddick: ""My most memorable scene -- Well, there was the scene where Nina kisses Broyles. That was pretty cool. Blair Brown's a good kisser so that was great -- But my most memorable scene was this season, the reunion scene under the bridge. That moment when I see Olivia again and she calls me by my first name."" Jackson: ""The thing I will miss the most is that father-son dynamic with Walter and Peter."" On the guest stars: . Noble: ""To share the floor with (Christopher Lloyd and Leonard Nimoy) was amazing for me, because they're such iconic figures in themselves. And Orla Brady is an amazing actress, she played my wife."" Reddick: ""The second season, I walk in the makeup trailer and John Savage is right in front of me. I stopped and my eyes bugged out. And Christopher Lloyd, he's done so much brilliant work over the years. With him, it was like having a walking icon on the set. In this business, you often call people by their first name. But for him, it was always 'Mr. Lloyd.' It's funny because he's been on enough times that I forget, but of course, Leonard Nimoy (was a favorite)."" Torv: About Nimoy's response to Torv's impression of Nimoy's Spock in one episode: ""He was very, very kind. Very kind."" On how the fans will receive the final episode: . Jackson: ""A lot of TV, you can just turn off your brain and watch, but 'Fringe' always asked its audience to be more engaged than that, and at our very best, challenged the audience to think about the core ideas that (executive producers Joel Wyman and Jeff Pinkner) were putting into the show. There are experiences along the way that are things that I will probably remember for the rest of my life. It is the passion of the fans that kept it going. Long, long past the time when it made economic sense, and certainly past the time where my cynical-actor-who's-been-around-self looked at it and went, there's no way this show is coming back. If it wasn't for that passion, the show would have died and it wouldn't have the proper ending that it's going to get this Friday. It's because of those experiences and because of those fans that we were able to finish up the show on the right note."" Nicole: ""I think that the ending is beautiful, and perfect, and it couldn't be written any other way. I was surprised at the ending, but even so, I thought it was absolutely excellent. It's a roller coaster ride, and let's just say the ending doesn't exactly bring you back to where you decided to climb on."" Jackson: ""I don't think it's possible to satisfy everybody. I hope that people find the finale satisfying and a just reward for their dedication over the course of the last five years. I was very impressed with the script when I read it. I hope that episode does justice to the people who have been with us from the very beginning. I hope we finished on a strong note. That's the best gift we can give as the people who make 'Fringe' to the people who watched 'Fringe,' is not to go out with a whimper but with a bang.""","""Fringe's"" 100th episode is also its last .

"(CNN) -- As most parents of adolescents know all too well, text messaging has become the preferred method of communication for American teenagers, with one in three teens sending more than 100 texts a day, a new survey says. The survey by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project illustrates the indispensable role that text messaging, and mobile phones in general, play in the lives of today's teenagers. Three-quarters of 12- to 17-year-olds own cell phones, up from 45 percent in 2004, and daily text messaging to friends has increased rapidly in recent years. The research, made public Tuesday, confirms that teens make and receive far fewer phone calls than text messages. They primarily use their phones for voice calling when communicating with parents, although they prefer text messaging when it comes to communicating with their peers. Although teens make or receive about five calls a day, half of them send a minimum of 50 text messages a day, the survey found. ""Texting is so functional and efficient,"" said Amanda Lenhart, a senior research specialist at Pew, when asked to explain the survey results. ""It's convenient and fits into those small spaces in daily life. You're not talking about much, but you're telling people you're connected to them."" How do teens manage to send so many text messages while spending the better part of Monday through Friday in the classroom? Forty-three percent of teens who take their phones to school reported sending at least one text message from class a day, despite the fact that many schools have banned cell phones in class. Lenhart said this just goes to show how important text messaging is to teens. ""Teenagers have been looking for ways to skirt around rules and defy administrators for millennia, whether it's passing notes in class or passing digital notes in class through cell phones,"" she said. And teenage girls are doing most of the texting. Girls send and receive about 80 text messages a day, while boys send and receive only 30. This is not a surprising find, according to Pew, as females also use other communicative tools more than males. Girls will text for social reasons more so than boys will, the survey found. For example, 59 percent of girls text their friends multiple times a day ""just to say hello,"" as opposed to 49 percent of boys who do the same. The fact that girls use their cell phones more than boys might be one reason that of the 64 percent of parents who have monitored their teens' cell phones, the vast majority are parents of 12- to 13-year-old girls. ""It's a historic relationship. ... Parents tend to regulate girls more than boys for a variety of social and gender reasons,"" Lenhart said. Teens are using their phones to record and share their daily experiences, Lenhart said. In addition to texting, 83 percent of teens use their mobile phones to take pictures, and 64 percent of teens share their pictures with others. During focus groups, Lenhart said, she asked teens what they liked to take pictures of with their cell phones. The most common answers: their pets, the people in their lives and the funny things they want to share with their friends. Lenhart said the growth of wireless carriers' unlimited texting plans has made it easier for teens to communicate via text message. ""It's like the all-you-can-eat plan,"" she said. Teenagers ""don't have to worry about cramming everything into 160 characters anymore. ... It doesn't cost 20 cents to send 'OK' to a friend."" The Pew survey was conducted last summer on landline and cell phones, and it included 800 youths ages 12-17, plus one of their parents.","Most teens prefer texting to talking on cell phones, Pew Research Center survey says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Oh, Jules Verne or Peter Benchley, where are you, great writers of deep-sea monsters? For the second time this week, Southern California has seen a rare sea beast washed ashore, far from home waters. This time, it's a saber-toothed whale, better known to live in deep Alaskan waters than in the warm surf of tourist-choked Venice Beach in Los Angeles where it stranded Wednesday. In an extraordinary way even for scientists, the carcass of the nearly 15-foot and 2,000-pound whale was intact -- except for a couple of fresh bite marks from sharks. The whale, a female, apparently was barely alive when it came ashore -- a highly unusual sight because beached whales are often badly decomposed or badly eaten by marine life, a local biologist said. ""It was really humbling and sad to see such a majestic creature stranded this way,"" said Heather Doyle, director of the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium. She rushed down the beach on her bicycle to witness the rarely-seen animal after staff naturalist Brittany Corona happened upon a crowd surrounding the whale on the sand. Such a sighting of the whale up close in California ""is a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" she added. Giant eyeball washes up on beach . Just three days earlier, another rarely observed species -- a sea-serpent-like animal called an oarfish -- was discovered dead at Catalina Island off the Los Angeles coast. Oarfish hide in the deep ocean. The one found in the island's Toyon Bay was so big -- 18 feet long -- that it required 15 people to hold it chest-high in a trophy photo taken by the Catalina Island Marine Institute. ""They're so rare and unusual looking,"" Jim Dines of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles said of the oarfish and the saber-toothed whale. ""They are like sea monsters, and people really pick up on that."" Are their deaths freak events prompted by global warming? ""I think it's just really a coincidence,"" Dines said. ""It's too early to tell. If we were to see a whole bunch of these animal strandings, that would give more evidence of something going on."" Added marine biologist Jose Bacallao of the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium: ""I'm not going to speculate on any wackiness, but I will say you have years of temperature changes and we have had warmer waters.... I'm not saying the water temperature brought that whale or the oarfish here, but it's still a pretty amazing sight to see."" Dine is also a mammalogist who performed a necropsy on the whale shortly after it was found Wednesday. His examination showed no signs of trauma such as being hit by a ship and no signs of disease or parasites, Dine said. The female whale also didn't have any food in her stomach -- aside from ingested plastic or nylon that wasn't enough to kill her, Dine said. The carcass did show two or three fresh wounds from cookie-cutter sharks, whose name comes from how their bites leave a round wound that cuts through skin, blubber and muscle, Dines said. But those bites weren't mortal wounds, he said. In fact, the whale had several dozen scars from such bites, which are common in the species, he added. Dines is waiting on testing results of tissue samples to determine a cause of death. Though the animal's death is unfortunate, scientists such as Dines are excited about its discovery because so little is known about the deep-water animal that lives in the north Pacific. Its strandings typically occur in Alaska or Japan. Its last stranding in southern California was 15 years ago, Dines said. ""There is some speculation that they do migrate in the winter, but it's not certain how far (south) they go,"" Dines said. It's the adult male whale that grows sabertooth-like teeth, used for combat against other males for dominance in breeding, Dines said. The females don't grow the saberteeth. The species is also known as the Stejneger's beaked whale. As a whole, the front of the species' face resembles a goose beak, Dines said. ""It's creating a lot of excitement in the media and the public, but the scientists are just as excited about this because it's a rare opportunity to study the natural history of these kinds of animals that are so rarely observed, even by marine specialists,"" Dines said. Discovery makes a splash: The rarest whale . Though the plastic found in the whale's stomach didn't cause its death, the material's presence in marine life is a growing concern. ""Certainly, pollution of plastics in the ocean is a huge concern and causes I don't know the number of deaths of marine animals,"" Dines said. The discovery of the two animals also occured as Manhattan Beach paddle-boarder Mark Durand captured on his helmet camera a video of an 8-foot great white shark swimming underneath him and grazing his board this week. The series of events has heightened public interest in what lurks within Los Angeles' coastal waters, scientists said in interviews Thursday. What now becomes of the two magnificent sea monsters? Dines took several tissue samples of the whale, and its skeleton will be placed in the museum's collection of 4,000 marine specimens, used for research and exhibition, he said. The 15-foot-long whale is just a little bit short of the 18 feet common for females in the species. As for the oarfish, its 18-foot length was too big for one freezer, so scientists cut it up into small pieces and froze them, said Jeff Chace, program director of Catalina Island Marine Institute. Researchers will later boil off the flesh and reconstruct the skeleton, using photographs taken during the dissection of the deep-sea serpent. Study: Spiders had ancient big-clawed relatives .

"(CNN) -- Nine-year-old Dia'a sat in the back of his father's car on the cool afternoon when a sniper fired a bullet at his heart. His brother Alaa, 15, was seated next to him. Their father sped through the streets desperate to flee shelling that was destroying their neighborhood in Dara'a, in southwest Syria. The father saw a roadblock and decided to turn around. It was then that the sniper pulled the trigger. The bullet pierced Dia'a's chest, missing the boy's heart by millimeters. Then it careened through his left shoulder and ricocheted into Alaa. Dia'a looked to his left and saw his brother slumped over. Nothing could stop him from passing into death. Dia'a bled profusely. He did not feel his torso, only the pain that ""cut my shoulder,"" he said. He was rushed to the border and then to a Jordanian hospital. He had lost more than half of the blood in his body. Doctors pumped him full of several units of blood and closed the wounds. The surgery took an hour. Dia'a's mother, 46-year-old Ameena, thanked God for her son's survival. But in myriad ways, war had sapped her capacity for gladness. It felt like something inconceivable, physically impossible. ""I can't be happy even if Dia'a is still alive,"" she said. ""I've lost [my other] son and I cannot be happy."" Syria's war is killing and maiming the youngest and most innocent members of society. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, some 7,000 children, including 1,600 under the age of 10, have lost their lives. At least one million Syrian children are now refugees. Four million of Syria's population of 20 million has been displaced internally. Half of those are children. Girl rising: No sanctuary for Syria's female refugees . The indiscriminate shelling and bombing of villages and the destruction of schools and hospitals have forced Syrian youngsters and their families to take flight. When they can, the wounded victims straggle across a border to a hospital. The injured, dead and dying pass before doctors and nurses in neighboring Jordan who now have a unique understanding of how war damages and terminates human lives. ""I would say that 50 percent of the injuries we see are caused by shelling. We see crush injuries from falling buildings,"" said Abdulla Ibrahim, a Syrian surgeon working in Jordan whose name has been changed out of fears for his family. ""The other 50 percent are from sniper fire and gunshots."" Lucy Liu: Syria's children deserve chance to be kids again . Dr. Ibrahim becomes emotional when he speaks of young patients he has encountered. He remembers 4-year-old Mohammed, who crossed into Jordan from Syria with two broken legs, a fractured skull, two broken arms and a smashed pelvis after his home caved in during intensive shelling. Like others in Jordan, Ibrahim monitors YouTube channels posted by doctors in field hospitals in Syria. Monitoring potential arrivals allows him to prepare for incoming patients. He had seen the video of Mohammed just after his injury and thought it would be a miracle if the boy survived. After several surgeries Mohammed pulled through and now lives with his mother in Jordan's Za'atri camp. Continued existence is only a first step. Syria's children must learn to survive even their survival. If the removal of painful memories would bring them peace, most survivors of Syria's war would gladly comply. But memory is a silent intelligence that refuses exile. What cannot be said becomes the shadow of that which is spoken. The recollections of children are no exception to this fact. The memory of the moment the rockets rained down on his home comes to 15-year-old Ahmed in ghostlike fragments. He recalls that there were five rockets in total and that after the first landed his instinct was to run out of the house. Ahmed, his brother, mother, aunt and grandfather were outside of their home when the second rocket landed nearby. His 5-month-pregnant mother held his 3-year-old brother in her arms. The shrapnel burned through her torso and killed her instantly. Ahmed lay on the ground bleeding with shrapnel wounds in his leg. Ahmed remembers being in an ambulance with perhaps six or seven other people stacked up in bunks along the side of the vehicle. ""I was in the ambulance. I thought about my family,"" he said. ""I didn't think about my injury at all. I was wondering when my family would come. I knew that my grandfather was there in the ambulance. I wondered where my mother was; where my little brother was."" It is hard for Ahmed to rid himself of these images. They live inside of the wound that has forced him to live on crutches. He no longer wants to grow up to become a photographer or a teacher or a football player. ""I want to be a fighter,"" he tells me. ""I want to join the resistance."" As much as assistance is needed for Syrians, so too is a sense of hope. Twelve-year-old Iman lost the lower part of her right leg after her street was shelled last October in a small village in the Golan Heights. Her two brothers, one older and one younger, died in the incident. Her older sister was injured. Iman cries softly as her mother describes the death of her brothers. To be sure there are times when she explodes into fits of rage after being forced to live her life without her leg. But there is a quiet resilience behind her weeping. She thinks of her brothers, sisters and other family members who have survived. ""I want to be a doctor,"" she says. ""I want to help people who are like me."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Beals.","UNHCR says there are now one million Syrian child refugees .

"(CNN) -- Every four years, U.S. audiences are re-introduced to all manner of lesser known sports: fencing, handball, even ones they may have tried themselves, like trampoline. But there's one sport that many Americans are familiar with that used to be in the Olympics, until it got the boot nearly a century ago. According to the International Olympic Committee, tug-of-war was an Olympic sport from 1900 to 1920, and the United States actually swept all three medals in 1904 when the games were held in St. Louis. These days, most people don't think of tug-of-war as the domain of Olympic athletes. It has the reputation of being a playground pursuit for children or the occasional team-building exercise. But an international governing body, the Tug of War International Federation, has more than 60 member associations worldwide, and annual world championships are held for both indoor and outdoor events. Read more: The 10 strangest Olympic sports . In the United States, while not officially recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee, the sport is enjoyed by a group of devotees in the Midwest. Shelby Richardson, the President of the USA Amateur Tug-of-War Association, says the sport these days is played mostly in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois, though she has been contacted by people all over the country about setting up teams and competitions. There are officially sanctioned events held in the summer months in those states, and a national championship held each year, most recently in Monroe, Wisconsin, on July 21. Teams from the United States have competed well worldwide. In 2004, the U.S. women won gold at the world championships, and Richardson says the current teams continue to be among the best in the world. As for returning to the Olympics, that's a different matter entirely. The most recent discussions between the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Tug of War association were nearly a decade ago, when the organization was told would need to grow considerably in terms of funding and participation. Mark Jones, a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, tells CNN he is not aware of any future plans for the USOC to be involved with Tug of War. As for international competition, Richardson says the IOC is slated to meet with TWIF to reopen discussions about potential inclusion in the Games. That conversation is slated for 2020, and the earliest you would see the sport back in the Olympics is 2024, she says. According to the Tug of War International Federation's annual meeting notes from 2011, officials have had preliminary discussions with the IOC. On the IOC's site, however, it says for a summer sport to be included into the Olympic format it ""must be widely practised (by men, in 75 countries on four continents; by women, in 40 countries and on three continents)."" There is one other obstacle to tug of war -- or any sport being add to the competition. The Olympic charter only allows for 28 sports at the Summer Games. With the re-inclusion of golf and ruby union at the 2016 Games, the program would be full. Some sports federations hoping for inclusion into the 2020 Games will be asked to make presentations to the IOC in 2013.","Tug-of-war was contested in the Olympics until 1920 .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of spectators waved British flags and cheered the arrival Wednesday of William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, at Singapore's new Gardens by the Bay park. The couple's visit is part of a nine-day tour through Commonwealth countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee. What can be expected during the tour? The queen herself made previous state visits to Singapore in 1972, 1989 and 2006 -- and the public housing estate that her grandson and his wife were to visit later Wednesday was named Queenstown in honor of her coronation in 1953. The estate was Singapore's first satellite town outside the urban center and has areas and roads -- Margaret Drive and Strathmore Green, for instance -- named after British towns, institutions and the Royal family. There, members of Singapore's Parliament will greet the royal couple who will watch a cultural performance showcasing Singapore's Chinese, Malay and Indian cultures. After the gardens, the royal couple visited the new Rolls-Royce factory, where they officially unveiled its first operational engine. The factory aims to produce 250 engines a year for aircraft that include the A380 and create 500 new jobs. They will finish the day with a visit to the Rainbow Center, a school and community center for children with special needs, before attending a reception hosted by the British High Commission, according to St. James's Palace in the UK. On Tuesday, the royal couple viewed the ""Dendrobium Memoria Princess Diana,"" an orchid named in honor of the duke's late mother, and the ""Dendrobium Queen Elizabeth II"" at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. In honor of their own visit, the ""Vanda William Catherine"" was named after them. Read more about the orchid named after Princess Diana .

"(CNN) -- When Ahmed Ahmed, an Egyptian-American stand-up comic, started doing comedy tours of the Middle East his friends in the U.S. assumed he was performing at military bases. ""They were surprised to learn that I was performing for Arabs, that they understood English and that people actually laughed,"" said Ahmed. His frustration at the response from his fellow Americans prompted Ahmed to make a documentary film called ""Just Like Us"" about comedy in the Middle East. Ahmed, 40, said he wanted to challenge the American misconception that Arabs have no sense of humor. The film follows Ahmed and fellow comedians on a tour taking in Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. It charts the rapidly growing popularity of stand-up comedy in the Middle East. ""There's always been comedy in the Middle East, but in the form of story-telling or one-man shows, not stand-up in the contemporary American sense,"" said Ahmed. ""Stand-up comedy is relatively new but evolving quickly and is now happening in most Middle Eastern countries."" Ahmed, who was born in Egypt but moved to California as a baby, began doing comedy shows in the Middle East in 2005, but started with small, private functions. Although he had regularly visited Egypt as a child, the 2005 tour was the first time in 20 years he had returned to his country of birth. It was while taking part in the ""Axis of Evil Comedy Tour"" in 2007 that he first saw large audiences. The shows filmed for ""Just Like Us"" had audiences totaling 20,000 people, he said. The theme of the film is that Arab sense of humor is just like that of Americans, although there were some differences in the expectations of audiences. Ahmed said: ""My material in the Middle East is pretty similar to that in the U.S. except for deleting religious or sexually explicit content. The exception is Lebanon where pretty much anything goes. ""We used to be told not to touch Arab politics either, but that's changed since the Arab Spring and people are now keen to hear about politics."" ""Just Like Us"" was filmed last year before the start of the Arab Spring, but Ahmed said the seeds for political change were visible. ""The film was at the cutting edge before the revolution and was pre-emptive of it,"" he said. ""A lot of people who attended our shows were the same people who were marching in the streets."" Ahmed also observed differences between audiences in each of the countries he visited. ""Every Middle East country I've visited had a big sense of humor. It was refreshing and enlightening,"" he said. ""We had the biggest laughs in Saudi Arabia because they have the least amount of entertainment. Because they are so entertainment deprived, they are very ready to laugh at anything."" Ahmed added: ""I love performing in Egypt because it feels like a homecoming. It's my planet. ""Lebanon is another favorite because it's so open and free. You can say whatever you like."" CNN reported in 2010 that stand-up comedy was  doing serious business in the Middle East and that home-grown talent had taken off alongside tours by Western comics. Jamil Abu-Wardeh, a television producer who moved from London to Dubai and helped launch the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour did a TED talk in July 2010 in which he spoke of the ""rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East."" ""Just Like Us"" premiered at the Doha Tribeca Film Festival last year and is currently touring the United States. It won a best documentary award at the Tallahassee Film Festival 2011 and a special mention at Santa Cruz Film Festival 2011, as well as a host of film official selections. It will be shown in Dallas, Texas on June 24 and in Boston, Massachusetts, and Royal Oak, Michigan, on July 8.

"(CNN) -- The husband of a pregnant Texas woman -- who he says has been brain dead for seven weeks -- asked a court Tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator, ventilator and other machines, saying her wishes shouldn't be disregarded just because she is pregnant. Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial. ""Marlise Munoz is legally dead, and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous,"" her husband contends in the motion. Notably, officials at the Fort Worth, Texas, hospital where 33-year-old Marlise Munoz is have not publicly declared her dead (though they have not disputed her husband's assertions either). Erick Munoz -- like his wife, a paramedic by training -- said the doctors told him Marlise ""had lost all activity in her brain stem,"" and an accompanying chart stated she was ""brain dead,"" according to his lawsuit. The hospital referred requests for comment to the Tarrant County district attorney's office, which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit. It is legal counsel for John Peter Smith Hospital ""in a number of civil areas."" Noting it first learned of the legal action just before noon Tuesday, the office said it ""will file a response in due course"" but won't have any further comment now ""because litigation is pending."" The case will be heard by Tarrant County 17th District Court Judge Melody Wilkinson. At this time, no hearing has been scheduled. Hospital spokesman J.R. Labbe said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a Texas law that states that ""you cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient."" And last week, Labbe told CNN that the hospital believed ""the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity, direction and resolution in this matter."" Munoz's husband responds by saying that ""Marlise cannot possibly be a pregnant patient -- Marlise is dead."" Furthermore, he argued that her wishes -- relayed, he said, in conversations but not in writing that she not be on ""life-sustaining"" measures when she is brain dead -- shouldn't be treated differently than a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy. Mom of pregnant woman on life support: Change the law . ""Marlise has a fundamental right to make medical decisions regarding her own body,"" her husband contended in the motion. ""... To take those rights away from Marlise, and force her to be subject to various medical procedures simply because she is pregnant, is a gross violation of her constitutional right."" Last month, Erick Munoz discussed with CNN affiliate WFAA his wife's wishes and how their shared occupation had helped shape her views. ""We'd seen things out in the field. We both knew that we didn't want to be on life support,"" he said. ""We reached a point where you wish your wife's body would just stop."" Lynne Machado, Marlise Munoz's mother, said Tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband, Ernest, agree with Erick that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines. As the lawsuit details, the story began at 2 a.m. on November 26, when Erick found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor. At the time, she was 14 weeks' pregnant with the couple's second child. Soon after that, she was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where Erick Munoz claims he was told his wife ""was for all purposes brain dead."" The family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen. In the lawsuit, he claims subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and, in turn, the state law used to justify them -- amount ""to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family."" ""Marlise Munoz's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance, but by no means should (the hospital) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of 'life-sustaining' treatment,"" according to the lawsuit. Dr. Jeffrey Ecker, director of obstetrical clinical research and quality assurance at Massachusetts General Hospital, works on complicated pregnancies and prenatal diagnosis. He says nothing scientifically in Marlise Munoz' pregnancy is black and white. ""A lot depends, first of all, on how long the patient here was deprived of oxygen, or otherwise compromised. We can certainly use tools like ultrasound and MRI to sometimes see where there has been injury as a result of low blood pressure or low oxygen. But just seeing that things look well isn't the same as saying that things will be well,"" Ecker told CNN. ""Those things can't perfectly predict health and outcome. And there are certainly occasions where as we look as best as we can tell, a fetus seems to be developing appropriately and meeting all its milestones, and yet after after birth, after delivery, there is evidence of profound compromise,"" Ecker said. Tom Mayo, a Southern Methodist University law professor who helped write the applicable Texas law, said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it. ""She's not a patient anymore,"" Mayo said. ""And so I don't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really don't have a patient."" The Texas law states that a ""person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient."" Mayo said, ""The provision they seem to be relying on is called the pregnancy exclusion. More than 30 states have this pregnancy exclusion in their law. ... If they're relying on that provision, I think Texas law in that respect does not compel the provision of life-sustaining treatment."" Mayo believes the lawsuit is a straightforward argument because the law was not written as a vehicle for making ""treatment decisions"" for patients who are dead and therefore beyond treatment. ""If she's brain-dead, then she's already dead, so letting her die isn't really the concept. But can he say, 'Take her off the ventilator'? I believe he can."" But Sunny Hostin, a CNN legal analyst, said that she thinks the state statute as written is ""ambiguous"" and ""vague."" ""When you have these murky areas, you have to go to court, because courts provide clarity, courts provide direction,"" Hostin said. ""And that's why I think the lawsuit is the right thing ... to jump to the conclusion."" When 'life support' is really 'death support' CNN's Elizabeth Landau and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: Tarrant County judge will hear the case, but no date has been set for hearing .

"(CNN) -- Russia risks economic isolation from the West with its intervention into the Crimean peninsular, but trade relationships complicate matters. And, as CNN reveals, it's not just trade in which Russian interests are strongly represented -- it's in some of the most lavish and expensive assets around the world. Below are a selection. Sports . Professional sports team ownership is perhaps the ultimate status symbol for Russia's wealthiest. Mikhail Prokhorov, who made his billions in the precious metals sector, owns the NBA Brooklyn Nets while the Marussia Formula One team is now owned by Moscow-based company. Oligarchs can also be found backing some of the world's biggest football clubs. Uzbeki-born Russian business magnate Alisher Usmanov is one of the major shareholders in England's Arsenal FC, oligarch Roman Abramovich controls Chelsea and Dmitry Rybolovlev is behind the Monaco FC. Property . The wealthiest Russians have long been investing into luxurious properties around the world. Rybolovlev's daughter made headlines as the buyer of Manhattan's most expensive apartment, while Roustam Tariko, billionaire owner of Russian Standard Bank and Russian Standard Vodka, owns one of the most expensive homes in Miami Beach -- a $25.5 million estate on Star Island. Space . A big chunk of the International Space Station belongs to Russia, and is called the Russian Orbital Segment. Since the American space shuttle program was retired, NASA astronauts cannot get to and from the ISS without their Russian counterparts, who now operate the only space shuttles. Tech . Russian millionaires own stakes in some of the most successful tech companies, inculding DST's stakes in Facebook and Twitter. Anti-virus company Kaspersky Lab, co-founded by Eugene Kaspersky and Natalia Kaspersky, is considered to be one of the world's most innovative companies and operates in almost 200 countries. Art . When billionaire art collector Alexander Ivanov opened his Faberge Museum in German Baden-Baden, it was the first Russian privately owned museum outside Russia. An Arab sheikh reportedly offered Ivanov $2 billion for his jewelery collection, but it was declined. The collection includes impressionist paintings, old masters, vintage cars and even dinosaur fossils. Read more: Why the U.S. and Europe are not quite in step on sanctions .

"(CNN) -- Could England be the team which comes from nowhere to win the European Championship finals in 2016? No, probably not. But this 2-0 win over Switzerland should not be scoffed at, especially by those who would have considered England escaping unscathed with a giant bar of Toblerone as an achievement in itself. Chocolate aside, this result will be far more palatable for those who have endured a difficult time following Roy Hodgson's side. England has not had much to smile about in recent months but perhaps it will allow itself time to enjoy a rare moment of success. The World Cup was an unmitigated disaster as England failed to qualify from the group stage for the first time since 1950. Beaten by Italy and Uruguay, it returned home following a goalless draw with Costa Rica and faced a barrage of criticism. As is always the case with England, a period of national introspection followed where every single facet of the game was questioned from the grassroots coaching to the number of English players being able to ply their trade in the Premier League. For Hodgson, the man charged with transforming England's fortunes, this success will at least give him some breathing space. Danny Welbeck, who recently signed for Arsenal after completing a move from Manchester United, scored both goals as England produced an encouraging performance. Hodgson, who has been under pressure ever since the World Cup failure, even managed a smile -- no mean feat given the level of criticism he has endured in recent weeks. ""I thought the way we approached the game from the first minute was exactly what we wanted and we got our reward,"" Hodgson told ITV. ""We pressurized the ball well, but you need that first goal to get people to come out and attack you. ""From then I thought we looked dangerous and we had several chances to aggravate the scoreline before Danny Welbeck's second. ""I think we can improve on how we see out the game, but you have to expect that some players will show a little naivety in that area."" Both goals came as a result of counter attacks with Welbeck finishing off Raheem Sterling's cross on 58 minutes after England had caught Switzerland short in defense. The second owed much to Welbeck's pace and power as he held off his opponent before firing the ball into the corner. Wayne Rooney, the new England captain, said the pace of England's front three was key to his side's success. ""We defended well as a team and took our chances, catching them on the break with the speed we had been hoping to show,"" Rooney told ITV. ""I think we knew the game against Norway was going to be difficult, but tonight was always going to be more important and we were focusing on that. We have worked on springing from defense to attack which you saw tonight. It was a happy performance from us."" After making the Swiss roll, England face San Marino and Estonia in its next round of qualifiers in October. Spain success . Elsewhere, Spain began the defense of its European title with a 5-1 home victory over Macedonia in Valencia. Sergio Ramos opened the scoring from the penalty spot before further goals from Paco Alcacer, Sergio Busquets, David Silva and Pedro sealed the win. ""This team has a lot of quality and excellent players and it was just a matter of time before we scored,"" Valencia's Alcacer told TVE. ""I am very pleased with the match, above all for my competitive debut here at home in Valencia, and the goal and victory."" In Kiev, Ukraine suffered a 1-0 home defeat by Slovakia in with Robert Mak scoring the only goal of the game for the visitors. In Group G, Russia benefited from two own goals as it overcame Liechtenstein 4-0 in Khimki.","England edges past Switzerland in European Championship qualifier .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- At least nine unarmed protesters in Ivory Coast's largest city were shot and killed by security forces Thursday, eyewitnesses told Amnesty International. The violence erupted as troops loyal to the incumbent president and supporters of his challenger confronted each other on the tense and chaotic streets of Abidjan. ""Amnesty International is appalled by this completely unjustified and disproportionate use of force and calls on the Ivorian security forces to stop these killings immediately,"" said Salvatore Sagues, the West Africa researcher for Amnesty, a human rights group. ""Those who opened fire on these people, as well as those who gave the order, will have to account for their acts,"" he said. The demonstrators -- part of mass street protests called by the presidential challenger, Alassane Ouattara -- had been marching from various locations in Abidjan ""in an attempt to seize the state-run RTI"" broadcasting offices when security forces fired on them, Amnesty said. Witnesses told CNN that exchanges of fire also raged outside a hotel that is serving as the headquarters of Ouattara, a former economist and prime minister who ran for president against incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo in a November 28 runoff. The West African nation has been in a political stalemate over the disputed election, in which both men claim victory. The country's Independent Electoral Commission said Ouattara won the runoff, but the country's Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared Gbagbo the winner. Ever since, tension has filled the air in Abidjan. On Tuesday, Amnesty International said, ""Ouattara called for mass street protests to seize state radio and government buildings, still held by officials loyal to Laurent Gbagbo, who is refusing to leave office."" Eyewitnesses told Amnesty International at least six people were shot dead by security forces in the neighborhood of Abobo. ""When we saw security forces near the police station of the 21st arrondissement, we raised our hands and told them that we were unarmed. They refused to answer and threw tear gas grenades. Then immediately they shot at us. I saw dead bodies in the street. I know three of them,"" one eyewitness told Amnesty International. Security forces near the Makassi crossroads shot tear gas and then fired on another group of protesters, killing three people, the human rights organization said. ""A young man, a car washer, who was not participating in the demonstration, was shot dead by two men wearing military uniforms, with hoods. The young man was standing in front of the garage waiting for drivers in order to wash their vehicles when two military (personnel) arrive. One of them tripped him up, he fell down. One of the military who was wearing sunglasses shot at him at point blank with a gun,"" an eyewitness told Amnesty International. CNN witnesses saw at least two dead bodies. One of the bodies was seen in front of U.N. headquarters, where there was a tent for the wounded. Another was seen in a slum near the Hotel Golf. Witnesses said he was a pro-Ouattara supporter who was shot by police because he was armed, but that account could not be confirmed. Heavy gunfire and mortars could be heard for at least an hour and up to three miles away from the hotel, where people protecting the Ouattara headquarters exchanged fire with forces loyal to Gbagbo. Soldiers loyal to Gbagbo were in combat posture, hiding in the bush around the hotel. Ex-rebel forces were trying to free blockades held by the pro-Gbagbo forces on the sole access road to the hotel. Witnesses spoke of confrontation at the RTI building, which has been surrounded by armored vehicles and troops loyal to Gbagbo since the crisis began. Also, police forces fired shots to disperse demonstrators in a pro-Ouattara neighborhood, witnesses said. The United Nations, African Union, European Union and other international bodies and leaders have called on Gbagbo to step down, but he has declined to do so. Read about the deadline set for Gbagbo to leave Ivory Coast . On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that the stalemate could lead to renewed fighting in a country that was wracked by civil war for several years. ""The situation is taking a worrying turn with unfolding events that could lead to widespread violence,"" Ban said in a written statement. The developments include recent threats by some commanders of the national security forces to resort to military options and also clashes on Monday between them and ex-rebels supporting Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of the election. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, told French media that he would prosecute people responsible for any deadly post-election violence. Sagues also warned that Ivory Coast is close to another civil war. ""Every effort must be made to prevent an escalation of violence. There is a very real threat that many more lives will be lost if the security forces continue to shoot at protesters indiscriminately,"" Sagues said.

"(CNN) -- More than 700 infants and 40 health care workers have been exposed to tuberculosis, commonly called TB, at a hospital in El Paso, Texas, according to the city's Department of Public Health. Health officials are not yet saying if any of the people exposed have tested positive for the disease. An employee at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso came to work with an active case of TB some time between September 2013 and August 2014. He or she worked with infants in the nursery and in the post-partum unit at the hospital, the health department says. The hospital has identified 706 infants and 43 workers who were exposed to the disease during that time period. The family of each patient was sent a certified letter and is being contacted via telephone with instructions on how to get tested for TB. Any necessary follow-up care will be provided free of charge by the health department and the hospital. The infected health care worker is no longer working and is receiving treatment, the owner of the hospital, Sierra Providence Health Network, said in a statement. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that generally causes coughing, chest pain and difficulty breathing, according to the Mayo Clinic. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide have what's called latent TB, where the bacteria remain dormant and don't cause symptoms. ""Once in the body, the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active TB,"" the City of El Paso's Department of Public Health said in a statement. ""That is why it is so important to identify people who may have been exposed, screen them, and provide treatment."" The bacteria that cause TB spread through the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, but it's not a highly contagious disease; close contact over a longer period of time is required before another person becomes infected, according to the Mayo Clinic. Only active TB can be spread. The Texas Department of State Health Services conducted an on-site investigation at Providence Memorial Hospital last week and cited the hospital ""for deficiencies that represent immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety,"" said Carrie Williams, the department's director of media relations. Investigators ""found serious deficiencies in the areas of infection control, patient rights and governing body."" The Center for Medicare Services has placed the hospital on a termination track, said David Wright, deputy regional administrator for CMS in Dallas. He said CMS is giving the hospital until October 11 to identify policy changes that need to happen to ensure something like this won't happen again. If the hospital fails to do so, its Medicaid and Medicare funding will be cut off. ""This is one of the largest TB exposure investigations we've ever been involved in, and it involves infants, so it is particularly sensitive,"" Williams said. ""Babies are more likely than older children and adults to develop life-threatening forms of TB."" Patients with TB must take antibiotics for six to nine months. Some strains of TB are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them more dangerous. Without treatment, TB can be fatal, the Mayo Clinic says. There is one vaccine for TB -- Bacille Calmette-Guerin, known as BCG -- that is not widely used in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; it is given more often to children in countries where TB is common. There were 9,582 recorded cases of TB in the United States last year. In October, health officials identified 140 infants who may have been exposed to tuberculosis in a similar incident at a hospital in Nevada. CNN's Matthew Stucker contributed to this story.","Hospital worker in El Paso, Texas, came to work with active case of TB .
