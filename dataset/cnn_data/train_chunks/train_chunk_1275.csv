"Luke Shaw is yet to feature for Manchester United under Louis van Gaal but Jonny Evans has seen enough of the 19-year-old summer signing to believe he'll be a world beater. Evans was at the heart of Van Gaal's first victorious back four alongside Rafael, Tyler Blackett and another new signing, Marcos Rojo, in their 4-0 win over QPR, but while on the bench Shaw wasn't called upon by the Dutch boss. When he is though, Evans says he'll be something special. 'I had the chance to work with Luke in pre-season and there is no doubt he is going to be the best left-back in the world,' Northern Irishman Evans told United Review of his teenage team-mate. Luke Shaw will be the world's best left back, says his team-mate Jonny Evans . Shaw' start to life at Manchester United has included being told he was unfit by Louis van Gaal and injury . Shaw appeared for United during their pre-season tour of the United States, following his £27million move from Southampton, but was soon told by Van Gaal that he needed to get. He was then struck down with a hamstring strain and has since featured only on the bench for his new club. Evans, turning the attention to his end of the park when so much of the talk about United has centered on their star-studded attackers - including new signings Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao - was also impressed by the work of versatile Marcos Rojo on debut. 'I watched Marcos at the World Cup and thought he was excellent for Argentina whether he played at left-back or left wing-back - and he can play centre-back too,' he said.

"Bill Clinton's controversial couplings has reached a new level after he was pictured spending time with prostitutes at a recent charity event. The former President was in Los Angeles on Thursday and photographed with two female attendees who work as legal prostitutes in Nevada. Identified as Ava Adora and Barbie Girl by TMZ, both of the women are known to work at the Bunny Ranch brothel near Carson City. Controversial coupling: Former President Bill Clinton is pictured with two prostitutes- Barbie Girl at left and Ava Adora at right- at the unite4:Humanity charity event on Thursday in Los Angeles . Other famous friends: Clinton posed for a selfie with Robert Kennedy Jr, his girlfriend actress Cheryl Hines (right) and fellow actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus (left) Clinton, who infamously faced impeachment after having an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky while he was still in the White House, is seen grinning ear to ear while posing with the two women. They attended the event with Bunny Ranch owner Dennis Hof and porn star Ron Jeremy. The Bunny Ranch was first opened in 1955 and is legally licensed in the state. The brothel owner also runs the Loce Ranch which is located just a mile away from the original Bunny Ranch. Dates: The women attended the event with Bunny Ranch owner Dennis Hof (center right) and porn star Ron Jeremy (center left) Other looks: Both Barbie Girl (left) and Ava Adora (right) have bio pages on the brothel's website . On her Love Ranch profile, Ava Adora describes herself as a 23-year-olf originally from San Diego. 'Beyond . my physical attributes, I know I can make a great friend, intellectual . and funny companion, and passionate lover,' she writes. Hamming it up: Bill Clinton also spoke at the event and posed for a selfie with Demi Lovato in a relaxed moment . Barbie Girl is far more explicit in her bio page, telling how she specializes in throwing de-virginizing parties. 'I bring my flexibility skills into the bedroom for some crazy fun sex positions and get offs,' she writes. The photo was reportedly taken at the Unite4:Humanity event held in Los Angeles on Thursday in the ramp up to Oscars weekend. Clinton gave the event's keynote address while also receiving the 'Unity Award' as presented by Forest Whitaker. The prostitutes weren't the only ones who snagged a photo with the flirtatious former President. He also took a selfie with Demi Lovato who later shared the photo with her 21 million followers. 'Too excited to filter this... NO BIG DEAL - #Selfieswiththeprez.... @billclinton - so nice to meet you!!!!' she wrote. When it was his turn to say a few words, Clinton paid tribute to one of his own heros. In his address, Clinton mentioned the positive influence of the late Nelson Mandela. He also joked that he was the warm-up act for Sean Penn, who later presented De Niro with the creative commitment in film award and Clear Channel president John Sykes the media social visionary award.

"The Arab Spring and the fall of Colonel Gaddafi have continued to have long-lasting effects across the entire African continent, after agricultural experts warned of swarms of locusts about to move from Libya into neighbouring countries. The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN has warned that following the death of Libya's despot leader, thousands of the pests have been allowed to breed and move across the nation's poorly-monitored borders. Experts believe that croplands in neighbouring Niger and Mali are now at imminent risk after locust swarms moved south from Libya and Algeria. Plague: Swarms of locusts are said to be descending on Mali and Niger following the disintegration of the pest control scheme which ran under Gaddafi's rule in Libya (file picture) The swarm of insects could be disastrous for the economies of Mali and Niger, as desert locusts have the ability to destroy huge areas of cropland is short spaces of time. The two countries which could be affected lie immediately south of Libya and Algeria in North Africa. The deposed Libyan leader was killed by rebel fighters in October last year, with thousands of kilometres of land left vulnerable ever since. The effective and well-controlled pest control scheme used during Gaddafi's reign as leader is said to have disintegrated since his death. The winged insects can eat their own weight in food each day, with the fall of Gaddafi said to be an 'enormous factor' in their spread across North Africa. Keith Cressman, FAO senior locust forecasting officer, told the Financial Times: 'The fall of Gaddafi was an enormous factor, to be honest. Croplands in Niger and Mali are now at believed to be at imminent risk after locust swarms moved south from Libya and Algeria . Muammar Gaddafi was killed by rebel fighters during the Libyan uprising in October last year . 'It depleted the Libyans’ capacity to monitor and respond as they normally would.' The Libyan uprising saw a substantial fall in security along the border between Libya and Algeria, resulting in teams failing to spray affect croplands and prevent locusts. Swarms of desert locusts were said to have formed around Libya and Algeria last month following heavy rain and the resulting growth of vegetation on which the insects feed. The Financial Times reported that local teams have managed to spray pesticide on 40,000 hectares of infested areas in Algeria, and 21,000 hectares in Libya. Despite this, swarms of the insects have been seen in northern Niger, which is currently experiencing a food crisis.","Insect swarms allowed to breed and spread from Libya following Gaddafi's death .

"A victim of domestic violence has been fired from her job as a sixth-grade teacher in California because the private school have deemed it too dangerous to keep employing her. Carie Charlesworth recently received a letter from the Diocese of San Diego informing her that her ex-husband’s ‘threatening and menacing behavior’ was too much of a concern, and they could no longer allow her to work at Holy Trinity School in El Cajon. The shocking decision not only impacts on Charlesworth’s career and ability to earn, but her four children who also attended the school have also been barred from returning. Scroll down for video . Darker days: Second-grade teacher Carie Charlesworth says the Diocese that runs her school called her a liability and fired her because of her menacing ex-husband . ‘They’ve taken away my ability to care for my kids,’ she told NBC7. ‘It’s not like I can go out and find a teaching job anywhere.’ The incident dates back to January when Charlesworth was forced to call police after what she called ‘a very bad weekend with him.’ The next day, she spoke to her principal to warn them about her ex-husband, Martin Charlesworth. Not long afterwards he showed up at the school parking lot - forcing the entire school to go into lockdown. Since then Charlesworth and her four children have not returned to the school. Her ex-husband was jailed on two felony charges, but is due to be released later this month. A letter was sent to parents at the time of the incident explaining what happened and explaining that Charlesworth and her children had been put on ‘indefinite leave.’ In a letter from the Diocese who runs Holy Trinity School, Charlesworth was informed that she and her four kids were barred because her ex-husband was 'too dangerous' Three months later Charlesworth received the letter informing her that she was fired – a move which despite 14 years working in the Diocese means she is now barred from working in any other schools in the area. The letter from the Diocese explained that Charlesworth was being fired because of her husband’s ‘twenty-plus year history of violence, abuse, and harassment of people - mostly women.’ ‘We know from the most recent incident involving you and Mrs. Wright (the principal) while you were still physically at Holy Trinity School, that the temporary restraining order in effect were not a deterrent to him,’ stated the letter. ‘Although we understand he is current incarcerated, we have no way of knowing how long or short a time he will actually serve and we understand from court files that he may be released as early as next fall. Video: Domestic violence victim speaks out . 'In the interest of the safety of the students, faculty and parents at Holy Trinity School, we simply cannot allow you to return to work there, or, unfortunately, at any other school in the Diocese.’ Charlesworth, who says she feels like she’s being treated like a criminal, has hired a lawyer and intends to sue the school. But NBC reports that sseveral parents at the school said the district did the right thing in a no-win situation because they feared for the safety of their own children. There was even a movement to  “pull kids out of the school” if Charlesworth returned. “I mean that’s why women of domestic violence don’t come forward, because they’re afraid of the way people are going to see them, view them, perceive them, treat them,” said Charlesworth. Carie Charlesworth received this letter from the Diocese of San Diego informing her that she was sacked .","Carie Charlesworth has lost her job because her employer is concerned about her ex-husband's 'threatening and menacing behavior'

"Our moon might not be the stationary, boring place some thought it to be. New research suggests our biggest natural satellite may have been rocked by an impact about four billion years ago that changed its orientation. This suggests that the face we see now may not always have been the one pointing towards Earth. It's believed our moon formed when a Mars-sized object struct Earth, but was our largest natural satellite also reoriented by a massive impact event of its own? A team of Japanese researchers say its poles could have been up to 60 degrees different to where they are today . The research, published in Nature Geoscience, was carried out by a team of Japanese researchers. They used data from two lunar orbiters, Jaxa’s Kaguya and Nasa’s Lunar Prospector. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, circling in a slightly elliptical orbit at 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometres) per hour. At this speed, it takes about 27 days to completely circle Earth, which is 240,250 miles (384,400 kilometres) away. Although it doesn't revolve around the sun, because of its size and composition, planetary scientists call the moon a 'terrestrial planet' - akin to Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Unlike the Earth, the Moon does not have a significant magnetic field, and it has no significant atmosphere. This means its unprotected regolith (dust on the surface) is constantly being bombarded by the solar wind. The sun continuously embeds chemical elements, such as hydrogen ions, into the lunar surface. Thus, by studying the surface of the Moon, scientists can learn a lot about the Sun. What they found is that, while it was already thought the moon likely formed when a Mars-sized object hit Earth, the moon may have been hit itself early in its life. To come to the conclusion, the researchers studied 57 different sites on the moon from the two spacecraft. Studying magnetic anomalies at each site, they calculated how the moon’s magnetic field would have looked in the past. They found that many of their field lines clustered, as expected, around the moon’s poles. Like Earth, the moon is thought to have an invisible ‘bar magnet’ running from pole to pole, so the magnetic field lines go in and out of the poles. However, the researchers found a second clustering of magnetic fields about 45 to 60 degrees from the current poles. On Earth, our magnetic poles are known to drift slightly – but on the moon it appears they jumped to their new location rather than drift gradually. This suggests that an impact event made them move suddenly in a short amount of time. The authors of the paper suggest this could have been to internal instabilities, gravitational imbalances in the solar system or a giant impact that literally knocked the moon on its side. The moon takes 27 days to circle Earth, during which time it completes one spin. For comparison, it takes Earth 365 days to orbit the sun but just 24 hours to rotate. In the moon's case it is 'tidally locked' to our planet, which means the same face always points towards us. From the north to the south of the moon is an axis of rotation, just like on Earth, around which the moon rotates. Very close to the north and south poles of the moon are the magnetic south and north poles, through which the moon's magnetic field lines run. The evidence from the researchers suggests, though, that this axis of rotation was not always the same. It appears that the magnetic fields once ran through poles up to 60 degrees away from where they are now. This suggests the moon was once oriented in a different manner with respect to Earth, with its axis of rotation once in a different location entirely. Now and then? On the left is how our moon looks today, while on the right is how it might have looked 4 billion years ago before being hit by in a giant impact event (exaggerated by 30 degrees) that rocked it onto its side .","Japanese researchers have completed a study of the lunar magnetic field .
Using data from two spacecraft they say the moon was once on its side .
They postulate the existence of another set of poles different to today .
A giant impact event could have caused the moon to rock as much as 60° .

"In the searing heat, this was the scene at the Grand Mosque in Mecca today as millions of pilgrims arrived for the annual hajj - a religious journey that is viewed as one of the Muslim faith's greatest acts of worship. The mosque, the focal point of Islam, was teeming with visitors wearing the simple white folds of cloth prescribed for hajj. Almost two million people have so far arrived at the site in Saudi Arabia for the rites, which reach a peak on Monday - and another million are expected.

The kingdom is embroiled in a region-wide contest for influence with Shi'ite Iran, with each side accusing the other of backing Syria's bloody civil war. It has also given Egypt billions of dollars to help prop up the economy and support the generals who in July ousted a government led by Mohamed Mursi, a member of the Sunni Islamist movement the Muslim Brotherhood. Saudi leaders see the organisation as a direct threat to their dynastic rule. As demonstrations by Brotherhood supporters in Egypt are met by a crackdown by government forces, feelings are running high among pilgrims from the most populous Arab nation but they say they do not plan to cause unrest.

'Egypt was never like this: Now within a family you have one brother that supports Mursi and another that supports the army and they kill each other over these differences,' said Mosaad Moahmed Hamed, a 28-year-old pilgrim from Mansoura.

'This night I decided to drive an hour to camp at a little group of sand dunes on the New Mexico - Texas border. 'As I was driving, I did notice some small local thunderstorms forming in the distance. 'This storm was not all that big, but it made up for it in intense electrical energy and light that was just incredible.’ ‘I set up my camera but did not think that much would come of the images because most lightning photos in the past just lacked timing, shape, composition, and drama. 'I was in luck, as this storm was highly concentrated so that the lightning was not all over the sky, but in a very specific area.

"Using an Apple Watch while driving could put you in prison for up to two years, motoring experts have warned. When the gadget is released next year, it will allow users to make and receive calls, check their messages and monitor their health by operating the device on their wrists. But people who use Apple Watch while on the road are at risk of causing fatal crashes and will face the same penalties as those caught on their mobile phones. Scroll down for video . Using an Apple Watch while driving could land you up to two years in prison, motoring experts have warned . This is according to the London-based Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) who has warned that smartwatches will 'significantly' impair driving performance. Existing research by the IAM on smartphone use between 2006 and 2010 found distraction from a mobile phone was a contributory factor in 1,960 road accidents, 110 of which were fatal. As opposed to using a hands-free piece of equipment, the Apple Watch will require drivers to use two hands to operate the device. The IAM claims this will impact speed, lane position and time spent looking at the road, contributing to more serious crashes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one in 10 fatal crashes in the US involves distraction.Meanwhile, statistics provided by the RAC reveal that 20 per cent of Australian drivers involved in crashes admit they were staring at the object they ended up hitting, because they were distracted . When Apple Watchis released next year, it will allow users to make and receive calls, check their messages and monitor their health by operating the device on their wrists. Pictured is Tim Cook showing off the Watch at the launch event in Cupertino last week . Apple Watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone. The 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can be pressed to take user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes. The Glances feature shows information users would like to see, similar to Google Now. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to vibrations users feel on their wrist. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Apple is yet to confirm battery life, but sources suggest it needs to be charged every night. The Department for Transport (Dft) in the UK confirmed that using an Apple Watch while driving will carry the same penalty as using a hand-held mobile phone of three license penalty points and a £100 fine. The DfT told MailOnline it would be down to authorities to judge whether or not drivers are distracted while using their watch – or any other gadget – on the road. According to Crown Prosecution guidelines, where a motorist uses a mobile phone causing death by dangerous driving a harsher sentence of two years imprisonment is enforced. And depending on what state you're driving in the US, using a mobile behind the wheel could land you a $10,000 (£6,100) fine and a year in prison. '[Apple Watch] has the potential to be just as distracting as any other smartphone device,' said Neil Greig, IAM Director of Policy and Research. 'Indeed more so if you have to take your hand off the wheel and your eyes off the road to interact with it.' 'Enforcement will be difficult for the police, but powers exist to seize and interrogate devices in the event of a serious crash. The very device that distracted you also has the power to convict you.' According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one in every 10 fatal crashes in the US involves distraction. Meanwhile, statistics provided by the RAC reveal that 20 per cent of Australian drivers involved in crashes admit they were staring at the object they ended up hitting, because they were distracted. MailOnline has contacted Apple, who has yet to respond. As opposed to using a hands-free piece of equipment, the Apple Watch will require drivers to use two hands to operate the device.

"A mother who wrote a book about her young son's love of 'all girl things' like Barbies and high heels has now revealed that her older son felt that he needed to come out as straight. Lori Duron, who lives in California's Orange County, started writing a blog and later a book about her son C.J.'s affinity for girls' toys and clothing, and used her position as a way to tell other parents how she was creating a welcoming environment for her gender non-conforming son. In a new essay for The Huffington Post, she explained how she was careful use all-inclusive pronouns and never assume that either of her two sons were attracted to girls. Learning curve: Lori Duron candidly details her family's experience of raising six-year-old CJ - described as a 'boy who is a girl at heart' - in a new book titled, Raising My Rainbow . Difference of opinion: While CJ loves pink and dolls, his older brother Chase prefers traditional boys' toys . As a result, her 10-year-old son Chase felt compelled to 'come out' to her as a boy that likes girls. 'I'm careful how I phrase things. I ask my oldest son Chase if he thinks anybody in his class is cute. I leave it open so that he can answer honestly,' she wrote in the essay. After a number of such interactions, she got an unexpected response from Chase. 'Mom, I'm straight. It's time you faced the facts,' Chase said. 'I know what you're doing. You always leave it open, like I could be gay. But I'm not,' he continued. 'OK, but you know that if you were gay or are gay, that is totally cool too, right?' Mrs Duron responded. Happy at play: CJ seen in his bedroom, which is crammed full of girls' toys . Expressing himself: CJ's mother says he loves practicing his 'fashion walk' in the mirror . Many parents of LGBT children have stories of their own moments when their son or daughter was ready to come out as a homosexual or lesbian, but Mrs Duron is one of the few who had a similar experience with a straight child. She writes how her unexpected parenting methods come from her own experience of growing up with a gay brother. Mrs Duron wrote that her mother's reaction to her brother's admission of his sexuality, which happened ' a time and in a place where it wasn't discussed, let alone embraced', encouraged her to be overly cautious and supportive or whatever sexuality her children identify with. Learning process: Lori and Matt Duron said they were confused and concerned about their son at first . Frank account: Mrs Duron's blog-turned-book, Raising My Rainbow hit the shelves today . 'By trying to eliminate the need for a gay son to come out, I created an environment where a straight son felt the need to come out,' she wrote. 'As I try to learn from my mother's mistakes, I may be making some new ones of my own. I guess that's how it goes with parenting.' In addition to the latest essay, Mrs Duron also used a Today Show interview as an opportunity to talk about her younger son's gender identity discovery process.

"Louis van Gaal is a fan of the rotation policy judging by his start to life as Manchester United manager. The Dutchman has spent north of £150million buying stars from across the globe but does not seem so sure how he is going to fit them all in, using 33 players in just five matches this season. And 14 years after Claudio Ranieri, the original 'Tinkerman', was appointed as Chelsea boss on September 18, 2000, it seems fitting that a new Premier League manager is willing to experiment. Louis van Gaal has become the new 'Tinkerman' after fielding 33 different players in five matches this year . Radamel Falcao is one of Van Gaal's new recruits to United this summer, leading to his large squad rotation . Angel di Maria (left) and Ander Herrera (right) also arrived to Old Trafford during a £150m spending spree . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney is one of six different forwards used by Van Gaal this season . Tom Cleverley (left) and Danny Welbeck (right) both featured for Van Gaal before departing United . Claudio Ranieri (pictured), who was appointed Chelsea boss exactly 14 years ago, was branded as the original 'Tinkerman' due to a perceived over-rotation of his squad during his tenure at Stamford Bridge . Manchester United have used 33 players so far this season in just five matches. Louis van Gaal has used one goalkeeper, nine defenders, six forwards and an incredible 17 different midfielders in four Premier League fixtures and one league cup match. Goalkeepers (1): David de Gea. Defenders (9): Tyler Blackett, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Michael Keane, Marnick Vermijl, Reece James, Jonny Evans, Marcos Rojo, Rafael. Midfielders (17): Jesse Lingard, Adnan Januzaj, Ashley Young, Darren Fletcher, Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata, Nani (now on loan at Sporting Lisbon), Antonio Valencia, Tom Cleverley (now on loan at Aston Villa), Anderson, Saidy Janko, Andreas Pereira, Shinji Kagawa (now at Borussia Dortmund), Nick Powell (now on loan at Leicester City), Angel di Maria, Daley Blind. Forwards (6): Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Danny Welbeck (now at Arsenal), Javier Hernandez (now on loan at Real Madrid), James Wilson, Radamel Falcao. United have had four matches in the Premier League and one in the Capital One Cup and have used five more players than any other top-flight side. Crystal Palace are second having used 28 players in five matches, with Hull City third on 27 (although they have played eight games this season). Everton have played the fewest matches (four) and have rotated their squad the least - with just 17 different Toffees have taken to the field - while Chelsea and Southampton have used just 18 players in five matches each, indicating that Roberto Martinez, Jose Mourinho and Ronald Koeman are all happy with their squads. Van Gaal has fielded 26 different players in the Premier League alone, three greater than the next most-rotated sides Hull and QPR. With seven new faces at Old Trafford this summer - including Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria and Daley Blind - Van Gaal has arguably become the new 'Tinkerman' after changing his side drastically for each match so far this season. Anderson is one of an astonishing 17 different midfielders that Manchester United have used this season . Youngsters such as James Wilson (left) have also been used by Van Gaal as he looks for his best side . Crystal Palace have fielded the second highest number of players this year, having used 28 in five matches . Hull City boss Steve Bruce has fielded 27 players this season but they have played a total of eight matches . Claudio Ranieri was the original 'Tinkerman' during his time at Chelsea, where he spent four years as boss . Everton have fielded the fewest players this year (four) but have also played the fewest matches (four) 1) Manchester United - 33 players (five games in all competitions) 2) Crystal Palace - 28 (five games) 3) Hull City - 27 (eight games) 4) Queens Park Rangers - 25 (five games) =4) West Ham United - 25 (five games) 6) Manchester City - 24 (six games) =6) Stoke City - 24 (five games) =6) Tottenham Hotspur - 24 (five games) 9) West Bromwich Albion - 22 (five games) =9) Arsenal - 22 (eight games) 11) Leciester City - 21 (five games) =11) Liverpool - 21 (five games) = 11) Swansea City - 21 (five games) 14) Burnley - 20 (five games) =14) Newcastle United - 20 (five games) =14) Sunderland - 20 (five games) 17) Aston Villa - 19 (five games) 18) Chelsea - 18 (five games) =18) Southampton - 18 (five games) 20) Everton - 17 (four games) *Stats provided by Opta . Ranieri was famously given that moniker for what was perceived as his over-rotation of his Chelsea squad during his four years at Stamford Bridge (2000-04), but it seems that Van Gaal has taken on the mantle. In the Dutchman's defence, United have been ravaged by injuries, and Van Gaal has also tried to give youngsters their opportunity in the first team. Yet he also gave game-time to players such as Nani, Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley and Shinji Kagawa before discarding them and allowing them to leave the club. He has also had a look at relatively unknown players Marnick Vermijl, Saidy Janko and Reece James. Interestingly, the one position Van Gaal has not rotated is his goalkeeper - with David de Gea having featured in all five of United's fixtures in both league and cup. In total, United have used  nine defenders, six forwards and a staggering 17 midfielders, as well as De Gea, in just five matches so far this season. And, with Van Gaal's history of fielding academy players, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that he will continue to blood an even greater number of youngsters as the season progresses. Amazingly, Luke Shaw is yet to make his debut and Michael Carrick has been injured all season, so Van Gaal is almost guaranteed to field at least 35 different players this campaign. And who knows how many more there will be if United repeat the summer spending spree in the next transfer window. Luke Shaw (left) and Michael Carrick (right) are yet to play for United this season so Van Gaal could realistically use more than 35 players during his first season in charge at Old Trafford .

"A tortoise whose front legs were gnawed off by rats as he hibernated in his owner's garden has had his missing limbs replaced with wheels from a model aeroplane. Marginated tortoise Septimus was attacked by rodents as he hibernated underground in the garden of owner Darren Strand in Gosport, Hampshire. When the 23-year-old pet emerged his legs were infested with maggots and vets told Mr Strand that Septimus would either have to have his legs amputated and tiny wheels attached in their place, or be put to sleep. Freewheeling: A tortoise whose front legs were gnawed off by rats as he hibernated in his owner's garden has had his missing limbs replaced with wheels from a model aeroplane . Ordeal: When marginated tortoise Septimus emerged from his hibernation his owners Darren, Tabbie and Fran Strand (pictured) found his legs were infested with maggots . 'He went underground to hibernate and we didn't know whereabouts in the garden he had gone too,' said property developer Mr Strand, 49. 'When he came back up he was in a bad way - his front legs had been gnawed at by rats. 'After taking advice we rushed him to the vets and he had to have his lower front legs amputated. 'You could see the rat's teeth marks under the shell. 'It was the first time the vet had put front wheels on a tortoise as he had only done back wheels before. 'If he hadn't had the wheels put on he would have had to have been put down.' Decision: Vets told the Strand family that Septimus would either have to have his legs amputated and tiny wheels attached in their place, or be put to sleep . Mr Strand's eldest daughter Tabbie, 13, added: 'His legs were full of maggots when dad found him which wasn't very nice. He was very lucky to be alive.' Vets used a type of putty to attach the tiny wheels to the bottom of Septimus's yellow and brown shell. 'He got the hang of moving in it very quickly, although to begin with he was very weak,' said Mr Strand. 'You have to keep an eye on him to make sure he is moving ok. 'Now he can turn himself around and go backwards, something he couldn't do before. 'He's a very sprightly little character and very sociable.' Operation: Vets used putty to attach the wheels to the bottom of Septimus's shell . First time: Although vet Ben Trimmer had attached wheels to the back of a tortoise before, this was the first time he had replaced the front legs . Now, . following his surgery Septimus, who is 23cm long, is back to his old . self, snacking on dandelions, strawberries and cucumber and lives inside . the family home with his mother Margo, 46. 'He . can still pull branches down of our strawberry plant and eats some of . them - you know who the culprit is because he crawls round with red . lips,' said Mr Strand's younger daughter Fran, nine. 'If you put him on freshly cut grass or a path he is really fast. He gets caught up in longer grass and has to battle through.' Vet Ben Trimmer, who carried out the operation at the Downland Vet Group, Emsworth, Hampshire said that rat attacks on tortoises were not particularly common. Recovery: Following his surgery Septimus, who is 23cm long, is back to his old self, snacking on dandelions, strawberries and cucumber and lives inside the family home with his mother Margo . Speedy: With his new wheels, Septimus can travel quickly along a path or through short grass . 'It is usually dogs and foxes who carry out tortoise attacks in hibernation,' he said. 'Sometimes a tortoise can get by with only three legs but where two legs have been infected the choice is either an operation like this or sadly they have to be put down. 'We used fibre glass to attach the wheels onto the shell and chose the wheels from a model airplane because they are right size and shape. 'The tortoise still needs to be able to touch the floor with its head to eat.'","Marginated tortoise Septimus was attacked by rodents while underground in Gosport, Hampshire .

"A fan has spent hours painstakingly recreating the new Star Wars trailer shot-for-shot... with Lego. The first official glimpse of the highly anticipated Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens was released yesterday. And YouTube user Snooperking, a self-taught video editor, worked round the clock to build the sets and props, including the Millennium Falcon, uploading his version  just 14 hours after the 88-second teaser was released. Scroll down for video . Mimic: A fan has spent hours painstakingly recreating the new Star Wars trailer shot-for-shot on YouTube... with Lego. Pictured, new cast member John Boyega races across a desert landscape as a Stormtrooper . Spot the difference: The enthusiast built a desert set using yellow lego and  a figurine to replicate Boyega . Accompanying his clip the U.S. fan, who has created several similar videos, said he was 'excited for the movie'. He wrote: 'I had nothing to do yesterday so I started once the trailer came out. 'I built the Falcon, The X-Wing, the speeder bike thingy, a mini tie fighter, tried to build all the sets, and get all my mini figures put together. 'Then just filming took forever especially the  special effects. 'I tried stop motion in front of the green screen and that was hard and by this time it was 3am so like more than 12 hours (I took a three hour break somewhere) and then finally gave up and used sewing string for the X-Wing and just kind of moved my camera around the Falcon. 'I wasn't as happy with the Falcon shot but I cant work on it at all today, so I had to finish it like four hours ago. 'Now you know everything about how it was made!' On the move: A futuristic robot, similar to the one featured in Abrams' Bad Robot production company logo, urgently races across the desert . Uncanny: A ball is rolled to imitate the robot and Lego bricks have been substituted for  background machines . Here they come: The Stormtroopers are on the attack in the forthcoming seventh instalment of the franchise . Copy: Luckily, Lego sell Stormtrooper figurines - which were lined up to recreate this shot . Opening some 30 years after Return of the Jedi, the teaser kicks off with British actor John Boyega racing across a desert landscape dressed in full Stormtrooper regalia. While returning cast members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are absent from the montage, fans are given a first look at the younger generation of cast members to feature in this, the first of three planned sequels. A parched, disembodied voice tells us of an 'awakening' and reminds us of the dual energies that are 'the dark side... and the light.' British actress Daisy Ridley is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town, while Oscar Isaac is seen as a fighter pilot, looking rather like a young Luke Skywalker when he's headed for the Death Star. The trailer also delivers what was initially suggested during the forthcoming film's development - a clear departure from the over-indulgent use of CGI that blighted parts one, two and three of the science fiction saga. New face: Brit Daisy Ridley - a virtual unknown prior to her casting - also features in the new trailer . Lady Lego: A female figure is used as Daisy Ridley's character, who is rumoured to play Han Solo and Princess Leia's adult daughter in the new film . Remote: Ridley races across a desolate homestead on what appears to be desert planet Tattoine . Sandy: The yellow set makes a reappearance for this shot of Ridley racing off in a hovering contraption . It also confirms the welcome return of the iconic Millennium Falcon, and it is seen dodging laser blasts in a brief battle sequence. A new lightsaber makes its debut, complete with a sword-like hilt, as an ominous cloaked figure marauds through a dark, snow-layered forest setting. With a fresh outlook, a young, visionary director and the return of its original stars, anticipation has been steadily building  since wheels started turning on plans to add three further Star Wars films. The result of an ambitious $4.05 billion buyout that saw Disney acquire complete autonomy over the franchise from LucasFilm in November 2012, the JJ Abrams-directed Episode VII is their first offering as they endeavour to build on the universe originally devised by George Lucas in the mid-70s. The coup followed similar buyouts from Pixar ($7.4bn) and Marvel ($4.2bn) with Disney unveiling plans to release a further three episodic films and an additional standalone film every two or three years - a reaction to 'pent-up demand' from fans. Ready for take off: Oscar Isaac is seen in an X-Wing pilot jumpsuit as he prepares for battle . Identical: The Lego version mimics Isaac's appearance in the teaser, complete with hand movements . Thrilling: X-Wings race past a mountainous backdrop in another brief action shot from JJ Abrams' new film . 'Snooperking' confessed the special effects took forever and he wasn't completely happy with the results . With a proven pedigree in TV and film, Lost creator Abrams signed up to direct the first after initially ruling himself out. Directly responsible for redefining and reinvigorating the Star Trek franchise, Abrams' decision made him the first director to work across two rival universes. A further coup, the return of original cast-members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in their respective career-defining roles as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia further whetted the appetite. Anthony Daniels (C3PO), Kenny Baker (R2D2) and Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) were also confirmed, with all three having previously featured in the Lucas directed prequel series depicting the rise of Darth Vader and ultimate fall of the Jedi counsel. New additions include Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domnhall Gleeson, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and legendary Swedish actor Max Van Sydow – best known for his role as Father Lankester Merrin in 1973 shocker The Exorcist. Something new: A striking. sword shaped lightsaber emerges as the cloaked figure prepares to do battle . Brightly lit: Despite the lack of darkness, the enthusiast built an imitation of the new lighsaber . Welcome back: The Millennium Falcon makes a fleeting return in the maddeningly short first teaser trailer . Painstaking: And it was quickly built by Snooperking, who moved his camera around it to recreate the shot . The old enemy: While Han Solo is absent from the new trailer, his beloved Falcon is at the heart of the action . New replica: The enthusiast said he 'wasn't as happy with the Falcon shot but I cant work on it at all today' Actress Lupita Nyong’o also signed up for a role in the forthcoming film after winning praise for her Academy Award winning role in 12 Years A Slave, telling fans: ‘I’m going to a galaxy far, far away.’ Meanwhile Girls star Adam Driver hinted that he is poised to play a villain in episode VII after co-star Lena Dunham told him to ‘rip a hole in da force’ in a congratulatory tweet posted shortly after his casting. Much like the original trilogy, released between 1977 and 1983,  the bulk of principal photography took place at Buckinghamshire’s Pinewood Studios, with additional location shoots taking place in Ireland and Abu Dhabi - where filming began in June. The dusty set suggested desert planet Tattooine was set to feature, and early shots indicated that Abrams was keen to move away from the heavily digitised prequels that provided a back story to the original trilogy, opting instead move away from the blue screen techniques favoured by Lucas in favour of traditional sets. The new trailer will play in 30 selected cinemas across the United States from Friday until Sunday November 30 - after which it will screen in cinemas across the globe. Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens goes on general release nationwide on December 15, 2015. On board: Lost creator JJ Abrams directs the seventh Star Wars film after originally turning down the offer . A welcome return: A bearded Mark Hamill, pictured outside Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, reprises his career-defining role as Luke Skywalker . Read through: A shot of the principal cast members reading their lines suggested Ridley would play Solo and Leia's daughter. The actress (third right) was seated between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher . How it was: Stars Wars helped define the careers of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. All three actors return for new movie Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens . As Star Wars fans eagerly prepared for the release of Abrams' 88-second trailer the internet became awash with spoof teasers. Ranging from the authentic to the downright absurd, each is reliant on clever editing techniques, computer graphics and a fast-paced montage of shots from the first six films. Bold graphics, a clear narrative and the use of Abrams' own Bad Robot production company logo make this one of the more believable teasers to emerge in the build up to Friday's release. It had many fooled, but the 90 second teaser is a cleverly constructed montage comprised of footage from the previous six films and spin off games. Somewhat less plausible, this fake once again draws from existing footage, but also cheekily steals a shot of Harrison Ford from 2013 science fiction adventure Enders Game. It's impressive, but not particularly convincing. Poorly executed and awash with rich animation commonly associated with the prequels released by LucasFilm between 1999 and 2005. Whatever narrative it attempts to convey is undermined by  the use of old fashioned graphics. Crumbling planets, vengeful Jedi warriors and a galaxy at war makes this another engaging addition to the array of fakes finding their way onto the internet in the run up to Friday's official trailer release.","Fan uploaded his version just 14 hours after 88-second clip was released .

"The invention of the washing machine was a revolutionary moment for women. No longer did entire days have to be dedicated to the tedious and physically exhausting task of scrubbing the family's laundry. However, modern washing machines are far from eco-friendly. So what's the carbon-conscious consumer to do? If you've got a lot of energy, the ‘Laundry POD’, which requires you to physically spin the clothes yourself, could be the answer. The Laundry Pod requires you to do the manual work by spinning your dirty washing in a drum . Grubby clothes are placed in an inner drum - makers say you can wash delicates in the POD too . You add about 1.5 gallons of water alongside a normal detergent, leave to soak, then spin . Now eco-warriors can clean a (small amount) of clothing and simultaneously feel they are doing their bit to save the planet, using what can only be described as giant salad spinner. The concept is simple; you place your clothes (delicates can also be included) into the Laundry POD and add about 1.5 gallons of water along with a small amount of normal detergent. You then secure the lid and leave the washing to soak for two or three minutes. A handle pops up from the lid, allowing you to spin the drum, manually washing the clothes. Midway through spinning you take out the drainage hose and the soapy water runs out. You then have to repeat this process again with fresh batch of clean water to rinse the clothes, and the makers suggest that you ‘spin fast’ to ensure as much of the water as possible is drained off. Clothes can then be hung and dried as normal. The Laundry POD comes in white, green and silver and is available to buy online for $99.95 (about £63). So it's a whole heap cheaper than a conventional washer/drier - and, as it's not plugged into the mains, it won't add to your electricity bills either. Conventional washers use a lot of power . and up to 50 gallons of water with each load, while the Laundry POD uses . less than 5 gallons of water and no electricity. Each wash needs less than five gallons of water, while most washing machines need around 50 gallons . The hose, stored inside the POD, allows for drainage . While it may be a stretch to imagine that men and women will embrace the Laundry POD’s hands-on washing for all their clothes, it is easy to see this revolutionising the tedium of hand-wash only items. Getting your wool and delicate items clean can now be earth-friendly and give you an upper arm workout at the same time! The Laundry POD looks remarkably like a huge salad spinner .","Laundry POD needs under 5 gallons of water per wash and no electricity .

"David Cameron was personally assured the West Coast mainline deal was secure, weeks before the government’s humiliating admission that the franchise competition was riddled with ‘unacceptable mistakes’. The Prime Minister intervened after a public appeal by Virgin Trains’ Sir Richard Branson, who faced losing the lucrative contract to rivals FirstGroup. But there are growing questions about why it was not until days before a High Court challenge that civil servants realised their computer models were wrong. Furious: David Cameron was assured by the Department for Transport that the decision to strip Virgin of the West Coast Main Line franchise was sound . In August Mr Cameron asked for checks to be made . on the winning bid and officials at the Department for Transport . insisted the £13bn FirstGroup bid was sound. However, just after midnight yesterday new Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was forced to admit that civil servants working on the West Coast contract 'failed to take into account the effect of inflation on the bids or the passenger number increases needed to make them viable'. The revelation came ahead of a legal challenge brought by Virgin against the awarding of the contract to First. Mr McLoughlin's predecessor Justine Greening, who was in charge when the contract was awarded, is also understood to have sought assurances. The week before being moved to the Department for International Development, Ms Greening was told there were 'small but non-critical' errors in the contest and she ordered an investigation. Downing Street insists the model used by officials was 'incredibly complex' and it is 'totally unrealistic to expect ministers to have grasped that level of detail'. 'We feel very let down by it all,' said a source. However, ministers still face criticism for failing to insist on full checks being made, which could have established earlier that the model being used was wrong. In a television interview in August, Sir Richard declared that the only ‘who can really intervene to try to get some sense into the Department for Transport is the Prime Minister’. It is understood that Mr Cameron then asked the DfT to carry out a review of its calculations, but it returned the same response. Since then it has been established that the complex model was wrong. Public plea: Sir Richard Branson made a direct appeal to David Cameron to intervene in the decision to award the franchise to FirstGroup . The PM is now said to be furious about the handling of the multi-billion-pound franchise bid. A source said the revelation that the DfT had made serious errors had ‘gone down like a cup of cold sick’ in Downing Street. The decision to cancel the bidding process would cost £40million, but most observers expect the final bill to rise to well over £100million because of potential compensation claims from FirstGroup and the costs associated with a complete overhaul of the franchise system. Downing Street is firmly pinning the blame on civil servants. The DfT’s permanent secretary Philip Rutnam has  suspended three civil servants, two of them senior, connected with the franchise bid. Ms Greening, and Theresa Villiers, who was rail minister before being promoted to Northern Ireland Secretary, both face criticism for failing to uncover the problems sooner. But a government source said: 'Even the harshest critics can understand that we have to rely on the advice we get. 'This is one of those rare occasions where you have to be a management consultant-type person who understands how the 500-column spreadsheet works.' FirstGroup was due to take over the franchise from Virgin Rail which runs services between London and Scotland from December 9. But just after midnight on Wednesday Mr McLoughlin scrapped the deal, laying the blame ‘wholly and squarely’ on civil servants. All change: The competition to run the West Coast Main Line, which runs from London to Scotland, has been cancelled . Today Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs Westminster's powerful Public Accounts Committee, demanded sweeping changes to the way Whitehall is run. ‘It exposes in a very stark way that the present conventions on accountability between civil servants and ministers to Parliament and the public aren't working. ‘It's yet another example ... of where the civil servants themselves have not really captured and taken on the role that is expected of them in today's society.’ She said civil servants should stay in post for longer. ‘The way you climb the greasy pole in the civil service is that you change your job every couple of years,’ she said. ‘That's a disaster.’ Former cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell, who retired last December, admitted the West Coast fiasco ‘does raise some issues about skills in the civil service’. He blamed ‘skills shortages’ and suggested higher salaries would need to be paid: ‘It's not that they're greedy, but pay is a measure of how much they feel they're valued.’ The Institute for Government's director Peter Riddell said the debacle 'goes to the heart of the civil service's credibility and reputation for competence’. He added: ‘At a time when relations between some ministers and some senior civil servants are already strained, the disclosures could hardly be more damaging.’ A Q&A about the West Coast rail franchise fiasco . The Government is also under growing pressure to launch an urgent review its £32billion High Speed (HS2) rail line from London to Birmingham. With the competence of DfT officials now in doubt, former Tory Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan has demanded an ‘immediate review’ of the HS2 scheme while opponents say the revelation will bolster their legal challenge. Opponents of HS2, who have long argued the business case for the line does not stack up, have seized on the revelations as proof that the DfT has got its figures wrong. Ms Gillan, a former Welsh Secretary who left the Cabinet in last month’s reshuffle, has now written to Mr McLoughlin asking him ‘to urgently undertake a complete re-examination of the business case, a re-evaluation of the case for HS2 and the basis on which all decisions have been made by the Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd’. Today the DfT insisted that specific flaws found in the bungled West Coast competition do not directly affect the HS2 case. But as the blame game continues every contract and project signed off by the DfT is under scrutiny. Joe Rukin, campaign coordinator for the Stop HS2 group, said: ‘We have been saying since the start that the passenger forecast which have been fabricated purely to support the case for HS2 are a work of pure fiction. ‘It may not be the same people who have fiddled the figures for the West Coast Mainline, but they have been using the same flawed methodologies to try and justify the case for HS2. ‘There are currently 45,000 people per day coming into Euston, but the DfT and HS2 Ltd have been saying that magically this will somehow get up to 146,000. It is and has always been pure fantasy. ‘We are confident that as the DfT prepare for the legal challenges on HS2 that they will find the same sorts of mistakes are endemic throughout the case for HS2. 'There is rapidly becoming only one option for HS2, to cancel the project as it stands, go back to the drawing board and come up with a genuine strategy for transport and infrastructure.’ A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: 'The technical flaws found in this rail franchise competition process have no bearing on the case for HS2 or the government;s commitment to continuing unprecedented levels of investment in Britain's railway network.' Yesterday Mr McLoughlin acknowledged his department had fatally miscalculated the risk attached to the rival projects. Mr McLoughlin said the decision to cancel the bidding process would cost £40million, but most observers expect the final bill to rise to well over £100million because of potential compensation claims from FirstGroup and the costs associated with a complete overhaul of the franchise system.","The Prime Minister intervened after public appeal from Virgin's Sir Richard Branson to look again at the decision to hand the franchise to FirstGroup .

"'Unwind': Michael Brutsch says he posted sick comments on Reddit to help him relax after work . The man dubbed the biggest troll on the Internet has claimed he only posted vile comments because he wanted to ‘to unwind from my job’. Michael Brutsch said that writing offensive messages and encouraging users to do the same helped him deal with the stress of working as a computer programmer. He also claimed that he got the ‘biggest thrill’ from setting up web forums with sinister names like ‘Chokeabitch’ and ‘Jailbait’, which included sexual images of children. Brutsch was speaking in his first TV interview since being exposed as the man behind the troll name ‘Violentacrez’ which he used for two years to spread filth on aggregating website Reddit. The 49-year-old, who lives in Arlington, Texas, has been told not to come back to work but has wife Dani is apparently standing by him, as are their two children. His employers were sickened at how he encouraged other users to post ‘Creepshots’ online, which were sexual pictures of women and girls taken without their knowledge. Speaking to CNN, Brutsch said: ‘Violentacrez is what I did in my spare time to unwind from my 10-hour-a-day job. ‘That's how I relaxed in the evening. I no longer need to relax, because I no longer have a job.’ He also half-apologised but still claimed he was merely playing to the crowd by naming his Reddit forums things like ‘Rapebait’ and ‘misogyny’. Brutsch said: ‘With the rape and incest Reddits, I have come around over the last few months to understand that some of these things can be harmful to some people. ‘I am to some degree apologising for what I did. Again, I was playing to an audience of college kids.’ Contrast: In his home life, the 49-year-old is happily married to his wife Tori and living in Arlington, Texas . Brutsch was first exposed by Gawker, which claimed that Reddit not only condoned his vile posts but encouraged and facilitated them, aware that the controversy would drive more traffic to the website. He was supposedly close to the staff there and was even given a 'pimp hat' as a thank you for his contributions to Reddit, which now receives more than three billion hits a month. Brutsch told CNN: ‘For those first two years, I had been tasked [by] Reddit admins with making certain that there was no overt or real child porn: no naked children, no naked teenagers, no children in swimsuits. ‘Honestly, the biggest thrill I got was those meaningless Internet points’. The Creepshots forum sparked an online campaign to have it taken down. It featured images of ordinary women on the street, in the gym or even at school who are caught unawares by stealthy 'creeps' with cameras. Controversial: Brutsch was responsible for the Reddit 'Creepshots' forum, pictured . Most shots focus on the buttocks or breasts of non-consenting women going about their daily lives - and users admit that 'at least 40 per cent' of the images are of underage girls. In one alarming thread, a prolific poster appears to be a teacher, posting images of his unsuspecting female students. The user, 'Weagleweaglewde', while posting numerous 'upskirt' images of girls in a classroom setting, claims in at least two posts that he is a teacher at a high school. Another user posted advice which read: ‘Don't be nervous. If you are, you'll stand out. ‘Don't hover too much, get your shot and move on if you can. You'll look less like a creep if you have photos of things other than just hot chicks' a**es.'","Michael Brutsch set up sinister forums to relieve stress of programming job .

"The family of a man who died in 2010 believe he too may have been the victim of the the South West Water poisoning scandal. Campaigners have called for a fresh probe into Britain’s worst ever mass tapwater poisoning incident after it has been linked to the death of Richard Gibbons. Drinking supplies were polluted when tonnes of aluminium sulphate were tipped into the wrong tank at the Lowermoor treatment works in Camelford, Cornwall in July 1988. Last year an inquest ruled that Carole Cross (pictured when younger) possessed abnormal levels of the metal aluminium in her brain when she died aged aged 59 . Last year a coroner said it may have contributed to the death of Carole Cross, 59, who died in 2004. Carole suffered with a rare neurological disease and was found with high levels of aluminium in her brain. Now the family Mr Gibbons say new tests have shown that he had similarly high levels of aluminium sulphate in his brain when he died aged 60 in 2010. They said initial tests were inconclusive but a second set has proved that he had similar levels of aluminium as Ms Cross. Mr Gibbon’s son-in-law Phil Reed said: 'After his death we asked for tests to be performed to establish if there was any evidence of aluminium accumulation in his brain tissue.' 'Initial tests were performed, which proved to be inconclusive for aluminium. 'Unfortunately these tests were performed on small samples of tissue rather than the whole brain. The Lowermoor Water Treatment Works in Camelford (pictured) was the scene of a terrible accident when tonnes of aluminum were accidentally dumped into the local water supply . 'We requested that the test be re-run but using the whole brain to establish if there was any accumulation. 'After the second test it turns out that Richard’s brain did indeed have high levels of aluminium particularly in the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for short term memory. 'The two people tested for brain aluminium levels, Carole Cross and now Richard Gibbons, have shown high levels of aluminium in their brain tissue. 'This evidence shows the need for further study amongst the population exposed in July 1988.' The poisoning occurred when a relief delivery driver inadvertently dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate directly into the unmanned treatment works. The alumininium sulphate was then pumped into the water system to South West Water Authority's customers. There were widespread complaints of stomach cramps, ulcers aching joints and even hair turning green. The incident polluted the supply to 20,000 people but authorities insisted it was safe and even suggested the 'foul' taste could be disguised by mixing it with orange juice. Locals quickly began reporting stomach cramps, rashes, diarrhoea, mouth ulcers and aching joints - some even complained that their hair turned green. Mr Gibbons, of Tintagel, Cornwall, later complained of short-term memory loss, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and kidney damage. He also suffered with decaying finger and toe nails, skin problems and recurring gum and ear infections, which he believed were linked to the contaminated water. A recent study by the Government-appointed Lowermoor Sub Group of the Committee on Toxicity said there was 'no conclusive link' between the leak and the chronic symptoms and diseases reported. But it called for further research to examine the long-term neurological effects on young childrenand babies born in the immediate aftermath.","Last year a coroner ruled that contaminated water may have been responsible for death of Carole Cross, 59 .

"A woman has become head of the CIA's National Clandestine Service for the first time, it emerged today. The unnamed operative was made acting director of the service last month - evoking parallels to fictional female spies from the likes of Homeland and Zero Dark Thirty. For the woman to be given the job permanently, however, officials may have to overlook her controversial background, which included ordering videos of alleged torture to be destroyed. Appointment: A woman has been made acting director of the CIA's National Clandestine Service, evoking parallels to the likes of Carrie from Homeland, left, and Maya from Zero Dark Thirty, right . The senior spy, whose identity is still classified but who is believed to be in her 50s, has been serving as deputy director of the National Clandestine Service, which co-ordinates and assesses all of the CIA's undercover operations, according to the Washington Post. She previously served overseas in Moscow, London and other cities, and also worked at the agency's Counterterrorism Center. After director John Bennett left the Clandestine Service on February 28, the woman was promoted to acting director, and is now considered a frontrunner to hold the position on a permanent basis. She is the first woman to lead the service, which is considered to be a particularly male-dominated branch of the CIA. Dilemma: CIA director John Brennan must now decide whether to give the woman the job permanently . The woman's prominence bears some similarity to Carrie Mathison, the neurotic spy played by Claire Danes in hit TV show Homeland, and Maya, the intelligence operative played by Jessica Chastain who tracks down Osama Bin Laden in Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty. Now CIA director John Brennan faces one of his first big decisions as he deliberates over whether or not she deserves the job full-time. He has asked three senior agency officials to evaluate the candidates for the position, leading a former intelligence official to suggest to the Post that Mr Brennan was 'obviously hesitating' at appointing the woman despite her experience at the Clandestine Service. One reason the operative may face opposition is because she played a central role in the controversial anti-terror policies of the Bush administration. The CIA recorded 90 videotapes of suspected terrorists facing brutal interrogation in a secret prison in Thailand, which threatened to undermine the agency after the interrogation programme began to be deemed illegal by many observers. The woman was chief of staff to Jose Rodriguez, director of the Clandestine Service, as he lobbied to be allowed to destroy the tapes. They were denied permission to dispose of the evidence, but in 2005 Mr Rodriguez and the woman signed an order to destroy the video nonetheless. The Justice Department has investigated the incident and did not charge any CIA officials, but a new 6,000-page report has cast new doubt on the efficacy of the interrogation programme. The woman is named several times in the report, insiders told the Post, which some say could be why Mr Brennan has stalled over her permanent appointment as Clandestine Service director.","Acting director of National Clandestine Service is a woman in her 50s .

"Death rates relating to almost 5,000 surgeons have today been published, with just three doctors falling below the standards expected of them, it has emerged. Data published as part of a 'transparency drive' by the NHS reveals mortality rates across 13 different surgery specialties, including cardiac, lung cancer and vascular surgery. It shows 'almost all surgeons' are 'within the limits expected by the NHS'. Just three surgeons - a vascular, heart and colorectal consultant surgeon - were named as 'outliers', those found to be performing below the limits expected. The NHS has today published death rates for almost 5,000 surgeons across 13 specialties, including cardiac, lung cancer and vascular surgery (file image) Jonathan Hyde, a heart surgeon at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, was among those whose death rates were found to be significantly worse than average, when the data was collated 18 months ago. Mr Hyde performs a vast number of very high risk operations, a spokesman for Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust, told MailOnline. He was found to have a risk-adjusted hospital mortality rate of 6.63 per cent over a three-year period, during which he performed more than 500 surgeries. Dr Stephen Holmberg, Medical Director for Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, said: 'The data shown was taken more than 18 months ago and in the light of these outcomes, we reviewed Jonathan Hyde's practice in detail with the support of an Individual Review from the Royal College of Surgeons. 'The unadjusted mortality rates for his surgery for the period April 2013 to October 2014 was 1.8 per cent, which is within the expected rates. 'We have a track record for accepting very high risk patients including a significant number of patients with active endocarditis for whom even a high surgical risk is seen as offering a better outcome than medical management. Hospital consultants who refuse to publish their patient death rates will be sacked under a transparency drive, the NHS revelaed this week. Cancer units will also have to publish statistics showing how many patients survive their treatment, allowing patients to compare services. The warning came days before a third of the country's consultants were expected to refuse to publish their performance statistics today. Sir Bruce keogh, medical director of NHS England, warned that from next year consultants who do not allow their data to be published will not pass their five-yearly revalidation or be awarded financial bonuses. 'Since the data was taken more than 18 months ago, the unit has reviewed many of its protocols and practices which have been informed and updated by an Invited Review from the Royal College of Surgeons and the effectiveness of these changes is evidenced by unadjusted mortality rates for the unit in 2013 and 2014 of 2.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively, which are within the expected rates.' Jeff Garner, a colorectal surgeon at Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust, was identified as another surgeon with below average mortality rates. Of 50 patients treated by Mr Garner over an 18-month period, six died, giving him a mortality rate of 14 per cent. David Hicks, acting medical director at the trust, told MailOnline: 'This Trust has acknowledged its outlier status and that of one of its surgeons. 'It has confirmed that measures have been taken to improve outcomes with a comprehensive overhaul of the colorectal service in 2012-2013 and close scrutiny of any deaths to identify potential surgical or system failings. 'The cumulative nature of data reporting means that it is likely to be at least another year before the Trust and surgeon cease to be outliers. 'Rotherham Hospital serves one of the more deprived communities in the country and the colorectal service accepts very high risk patients with multiple co-morbidities, which increases the risk of complications following colorectal cancer surgery. 'The investigations at the Trust into each of the six deaths highlighted within the report confirms that they were high risk/complex patients. Just three surgeons were found to fall below the average for mortality rates in their particular areas (file image) 'We have made significant changes to the pre-operative assessment and risk adjustment, prehabilitation and post-operative management of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery, which has resulted in a reduction in mortality at Rotherham Hospital. 'The data published regarding Mr Garner is in excess of 18 months old, but as part of the Trust’s review of Mr Garner’s practice we are able to confirm that from April 2013-August 2014 he has performed 45 colorectal cancers resections with zero mortality.' The third 'outlier' surgeon is Dynesh Rittoo, a vascular surgeon at the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Foundation Trust. He was found to have a risk-adjusted mortality rate of 10.4 per cent over three years for carotid endarterectomies - an operation to reduce the risk of a person suffering a stroke. The national average for the same procedure was two per cent. The trust told the Telegraph: 'The overall three-year rate for Mr Rittoo reflects a series of strokes in 2011. 'The rate of strokes / deaths within 30 days for Mr Rittoo between October 2011 and September 2013 is 6.4 per cent, and this rate is consistent with the outcomes of other vascular surgeons.' NHS England first launched the league tables last year, but extended the data available to cover 13 specialties and an extra 1,000 consultant surgeons for 2014. The data is being published on a new website MyNHS, allowing patients to compare critical data about hospitals, and the professionals who will treat them. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS is 'blazing a trail across the world as the first major health economy to adopt this kind of culture' In a speech today, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is expected to say: 'Transparency is about patient outcomes, not process targets. 'It uses the power of a learning culture and of peer review, not blame. 'Healthcare globally has been slow to develop the kind of safety culture based on openness and transparency that has become normal in the airline, oil and nuclear industries. 'The NHS is now blazing a trail across the world as the first major health economy to adopt this kind of culture.' NHS England's medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh who has championed better transparency in the NHS, said the website will help to drive up standards. 'This represents another major step forward on the transparency journey,' he said. 'It will help drive up standards, and we are committed to expanding publication into other areas. 'The results demonstrate that surgery in this country is as good as anywhere in the western world and, in some specialties, it is better. 'The surgical community in this country deserves a great deal of credit for being a world leader in this area.' At the weekend Sir Bruce said penalties will be enforced against hospital consultants who refuse to publish patient death rates, with around 2,500 believed to not be taking part in the initiative. He told the Sunday Times said: 'We are looking now at a series of inducements, penalties to force that (publishing death rates).' He added: 'We will lose some surgeons. We will, and have as a consequence of this endeavour.' NHS England's medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh who has championed better transparency in the NHS, said the website will help to drive up standards . But critics said the move to publish surgeon's performance data is 'crude and misleading'. John MacFie, president of the Federation of Surgical Speciality Associations, which represents surgeons, said: 'There is now good anecdotal evidence that shows publishing this data has encouraged risk-averse behaviour, which is not in the interest of patients. 'I believe that the data should only be published after any concerns in a surgeon's performance have been investigated. 'In reality very few deaths can be attributed to surgical error alone, and this data only attracts attention away from institutional failings. Put simply, hospitals should not be allowing surgeons to practice unless they can demonstrate their practice is safe.' Work to compile the data has again been led by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), which manages the National Clinical Audit programme on behalf of NHS England.","NHS England has published mortality rates for almost 5,000 surgeons .

"An award-winning bodybuilder supplement has come under fire because it contains a chemical compound similar to the illegal drug methamphetamine. Craze, which won BodyBuilding.com’s New Supplement of the Year award in 2012, contains the substance called N,alpha-diethylphenylethylamine or N,a-DEPEA. The find, which was published on Monday in the peer-reviewed Drug Testing and Analysis Journal, shows that Craze samples from different suppliers have between 20 to 35 milligrams of the drug in one serving size. Award-winning disaster: Craze, a bodybuilder supplement has been found to contain a meth-like substance . Dangerous: Craze was found to contain a chemical compound similar to methamphetamine (pictured), also known as ice or simply meth, which is a powerful and addictive form of amphetamine . Bodybuilder supplement: Craze has been used by people to give them a boost before their workout session . According to the scientists, these dosages suggest it was ‘not a minor contaminant resulting from the manufacturing process’. N,α-DEPEA has never been studied in humans, according to the study. 'Its stimulant, addictive and other adverse effects in humans are entirely unknown. Regulatory agencies should act expeditiously to warn consumers and remove N,α-DEPEA from all dietary supplements,' the study said. Dr Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study, said the drug is a methamphetamine analog, or a ‘cousin’ to meth. Scientists first discovered the new drug approximately three years ago in South Korea. ‘Criminal-chemists start with a known drug - in this case methamphetamine, then in their factor they start making little changes to it,’ Cohen told CNN. ‘Here, they pop a few extra carbon and hydrogen molecules onto it. But the main structure/backbone/skeleton of the drug remains the same.’ Criminal chemists make small changes to the molecular components of meth, which has carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, to create N,a-DEPEA. But the main structure is the same . Same family: Dr Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study, said the drug is a ¿cousin¿ to meth . Craze labels list a different chemical, N,N-DEPEA, as an ingredient, but researchers did not find that substance in the supplement. It is not known whether Craze's manufacturer, Driven Sports, is directly responsible for altering the chemical structure of the drug. The company may have purchased the substance in bulk from a distributor that claimed it was all natural, Cohen said. This isn't the first time Driven Sports' products have come under scrutiny. In July, USA Today published an investigative piece on supplement designer Matt Cahill, ‘a convicted felon who has a history of selling risky dietary supplements, including products with ingredients linked to severe liver injury and at least one death’, the newspaper said. Driven Sports said on its website in response to the allegations that Craze was ‘a legal supplement that provides people with a tool to enhance their workouts, by combining natural extracts to increase their energy’. ‘Craze conforms to all U.S. federal regulatory requirements and is proven safe when used as directed... Driven Sports has commissioned extensive testing of Craze from a reputable, independent laboratory, which conclusively establishes that the product does not contain any illegal stimulants.’ A meth-like substance was found in Craze products. It is not known whether the manufacturer, Driven Sports, is directly responsible for altering the chemical structure of the drug . Another product: N,a-DEPEA was also found in a different manufacturer's supplement, Gaspari Nutrition's Detonate, which helps with fat burning. The product has been removed from their online sales . Bodybuilding.com also posted a message on its website, saying they had ‘conducted product, blood and urine tests on Craze numerous times and all tested negative for amphetamines’. One of the samples used in the recently published study on Craze products was sent to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year, and the study authors' conclusions were sent to the FDA in May. While the FDA is in charge of regulating dietary supplements, manufacturers and distributors are not required to get FDA approval before selling their products. NSF International, a public health organisation involved in the study, also found N,a-DEPEA in a different manufacturer's supplement, Gaspari Nutrition's fat burning drug, Detonate. Detonate has been removed from the company's website and from Bodybuilding.com's website, however it is still being sold on Amazon.","Craze, which won BodyBuilding.com’s New .

"She proved a match for Nazi Germany when she broke Hitler’s codes at Bletchley Park, so Lord King of Bridgwater should have known better than to comment on the advancing years of Baroness Trumpington of Sandwich. The formidable 89-year-old Conservative life peer was unimpressed when her relatively junior colleague gestured towards her to illustrate his point about the extreme age of World War II veterans. Lady Trumpington hit back against his patronising reference with a distinctly unparliamentary gesture of her own - commonly known as the two-finger salute and reminiscent of Winston Churchill's famed V for Victory' sign. Scroll down for video . Two-finger salute: Baroness Trumpington gestures towards Lord King of Bridgwater to show just what she thinks of colleagues making reference to her age . Inspiration? Was Baroness Trumpington mimicking Winston Churchill's . famed 'V for victory' gesture'? The extraordinary scene unfolded while Lord King was making a speech about the passing of the wartime generation during the Remembrance Day debate in the Lords on Thursday. Lady Trumpington appeared to be minding her own business peering down at some papers over her spectacles as the former Defence Secretary paid tribute to veterans of the first World War who had ‘gradually faded away’. Then turning towards Lady Trumpington, Lord King, 78, raised his arm towards her and continued: ‘And then the survivors of World War II started to look pretty old as well. As my noble friend, the Baroness, reminds me.' At this point, Lady Trumpington glared at him with disdain, raised two fingers at him to signal ‘up yours’, and then went back to studying her notes. The exchange instantly became an internet hit with viewers describing the former chain-smoking Lady Trumpington – known by colleagues as ‘Trumpers’ - as a ‘heroine’. Extraordinary: The clash between the two peers took place on Thursday when Lord King was making a speech in a Remembrance Day debate in the Lords . Lady Trumpington, formerly Jean Alys Barker, yesterday claimed that the gesture was not intentional and insisted her hand must have ‘flown up’ accidentally. She told the Daily Mail: ‘I didn’t mean to make the gesture. My hand must have flown up. I have never been offended by Lord King. I don’t remember doing it.’ Born in 1922, Lady Trumpington was also a former Mayor of Cambridge. Between 1989 to 1992, she was a minister of state at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food – which, at the age of 69, made her the oldest woman minister ever. Codebreaker: The Baroness helped to crack Hitler's codes at Bletchley Park during the 1940s . In 2005, she was made a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. As a  Baroness-in-Waiting she was a member of the Royal Household. A former 70-a-day smoker, Lady Trumpington is well-liked by colleagues for her wicked sense of humour and straight-talking. During a debate on equality, Lady Trumpington sent peers into gales of laughter by revealed that booking into a hotel used to give a ‘certain frisson’ as her late husband had to use a different name. When she was a guest on Desert Island Discs, she chose the Crown jewels as her luxury item, in order to maximise her chances of being rescued. Lord King last night insisted that the pair were ‘old friends’ and that Lady Trumpington had been joking with him when she made the gesture. He said: ‘We had been joking together before we went into the chamber. ‘She is a wonderful person and was the only person in the chamber who had been in the second World War and was taking part in the debate. ‘She made some sort of gesture. I think it must have been my reference to her age. But there is absolutely no ill feeling between us at all. She is a very old friend of mine. ‘She went on to make a wonderful contribution to the debate and was on very good form. It is rather frightening that this is now all over the internet. I hope nobody thinks I was offending her.’ Well-liked: The Baroness is popular among her peers for her wicked sense of humour and straight-talking . Lord King served in the Cabinet from 1983 until 1992 and was appointed Defence Secretary under Prime Minister John Major during the Gulf War. He left the Cabinet after the 1992 general election, and returned to the backbenches where he served as Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Select Committee from 1994-2001. He was made a life peer in 2001. One comment on the website Total Politics said: ‘My headmaster's wife way back in the 60s, and a formidable battleaxe back then. Bless her. Lord Blagger - up yours. She's a fine woman who has had an illustrious career in the Lords for many many years.’ Another added: ‘Surely it was a reference to Churchill’s victory gesture?’","Baroness Trumpington was hitting back at comments about her age .

"Inquest: Jonathan Gammon died alongside his pet dog after his Toyota Yaris was overcome by water . The widow of a respected judge has told how he drowned in their car after a satnav directed her into a heavily flooded ford. Jonathan Gammon died alongside his pet dog Gabby after his Toyota Yaris was overcome by water and swept more than 100 metres downstream. His wife Priscilla Turner managed to escape and when she was helped out of the river she told her rescuer: ‘I’ve killed my husband’. An inquest heard yesterday how she had been driving her husband to work when the satellite navigation system sent her into a swollen ford in Headley, Hampshire. Mr Gammon, 52, worked as a mental health tribunal judge and the couple were travelling to the Thornfield Park Hospital, a secure hospital for men detained under the mental health act. His wife said that they had not driven to the hospital before and they had set the satnav before leaving their home in April earlier this year. Although it was sunny on the day of the accident there had been heavy rain in the days before dangerously swelling the normally placid River Enborne. Soon after entering the ford the car became submerged trapping the couple and their pet spaniel inside. Location: The scene approximately two hours after Priscilla Turner drove into a heavily-flooded ford in Headley, Hampshire, while following the directions of a satnav, leading to her husband drowning . Loss: Speaking outside the inquest yesterday, Jonathan's widow Priscilla Turner stands in front of a solicitor . Miss Turner, 55, from Teddington, South West London said: ‘I remember driving into the water but the water looked deceptive to me, it just looked quite shallow. ‘The next thing I recall was water coming into the car. ‘I do not recall whether the car was stationary or was moving. I do recall Jonathan trying his window and it wouldn’t open, he tried the door and it wouldn’t open. ‘I recall him calling the emergency services and he was getting quite frightened. ‘He was a cautious man, he took things seriously, he considered his moves carefully and he would get anxious. I remember saying to him “Stop panicking, I will sort things” and I had a belief I would get us out of danger. ‘The next thing I recall is standing on the bank and looking down on the submerged car. ‘I remember getting into the ambulance as I asked if Jonathan was okay and I remember them saying “They are working on him now”.’ Tragedy: Soon after entering the ford the car became submerged, trapping the couple and their pet dog inside . She added: ‘I just remember Jonathan’s last words, his fear, his panic. ‘I do not know how I got out of the car, I always thought I was pulled out until quite recently.’ The inquest heard how a car can be moved . by just six inches of water and a ford can change depth by up to three . metres in as little as 20 minutes. 'I just remember Jonathan’s last words, his fear, his panic. I do not know how I got out of the car' Priscilla Turner, Mr Gammon's wife . Dorothea Ryan, who lives locally, was walking her dog when she saw the submerged car and Miss Turner standing in the River Enborne. She told the inquest in Alton, Hampshire, that she could see water ‘rippling’ over the roof of the vehicle. Mrs Ryan described how she waded into the water to help Miss Turner. She said: ‘It was a bit un-nerving, I am fit and strong but I thought “What if I go in?”. ‘Priscilla grabbed my hand, she was in an awful state, she had lost a shoe, she was soaked so I got her out of her coat. Accident: His wife said that they had not driven to the hospital before and they had set the sat nav before leaving their home in April earlier this year . ‘She was saying “Oh my god, my husband, my dog, what happened, please tell me it’s a dream”. I said: “No, it’s a nightmare”. ‘The woman was very polite saying “Thank you, thank you”. 'Priscilla was saying ""Oh my god, my husband, my dog, what happened, please tell me it’s a dream"". I said: ""No, it’s a nightmare""' Dorothea Ryan, Headley resident . ‘We just held each other, she was crying, I was comforting her. ‘She was in total shock, she said “I’ve killed my husband”, I said “No, it was an accident”.’ Another resident, Peter Hemmings, who also witnessed the incident, said that drivers frequently got into difficulties at the ford having followed satnav directions. He said: ‘It is an open road, it appears on the satnav as a road without showing the ford. ‘We have to warn people visiting us not to use the road.’ High water level: Although it was sunny on the day of the accident there had been heavy rain in the days before dangerously swelling the normally placid River Enborne . The inquest heard how retained firefighter Jack Bancroft made a ‘dramatic’ rescue attempt by climbing on to the car roof top using a ladder and smashing the windows to get Mr Gammon out. 'What you drove into was quite extraordinary, it’s incredibly deceptive. It’s an appalling set of circumstances, an appalling situation' Andrew Bradley, North Hampshire Coroner . He said: ‘I was able to open the door, it was a struggle and I was using a lot of strength because of the force of the water.’ The inquest heard that the cause of death for Mr Gammon was drowning. Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said to Mrs Turner: ‘What you drove into was quite extraordinary, it’s incredibly deceptive. ‘It’s an appalling set of circumstances, an appalling situation.’ After the accident a sign was placed at the ford stating: ‘Idiots with twatnavs, meet thy doom’, although it has since been removed.","Jonathan Gammon, 52, died alongside pet dog Gabby in Headley, Hampshire .

"Sixteen men and women are facing lengthy prison terms for their convictions for hair-and beard-cutting attacks on fellow Amish in Ohio. The trial focused on an internal dispute and offered a rare and sometimes lurid glimpse into the closed and usually self-regulating community of believers.

Members of the defence team said . appeals were likely and would focus on whether the beard-cuttings . amounted to religious-based hate crimes. Judge Dan Aaron Polster scheduled sentencing for January 24. Prosecutors planned to file a request today to revoke bond and lock up defendants who had remained free pending trial. The judge asked the defence team to respond by Tuesday. Rhonda Kotnik, representing Kathryn Miller, said the verdicts would destroy the Amish community of about 25 families . 'The community is going to be ripped apart. I don't know what's going to happen to all their children,' she said. Samuel Mullet Sr., 66, the leader of the breakaway group, was found guilty of orchestrating the cuttings last autumn. The government said the cuttings were an attempt to shame members of Mullet's community, who he believed were straying from their beliefs. His followers were found guilty of carrying out the attacks, which terrorised the normally peaceful religious settlement that aims to live simply and piously. Prosecutors and witnesses described how sons pulled their father out of bed and chopped off his beard in the moonlight and how women surrounded their mother-in-law and cut off two feet of her hair, taking it down to the scalp in some places.

Two Amish women walk to the US Federal Courthouse . These five men, along with leader Samuel Mullet Sr (right) were arrested by the FBI . and local sheriff's deputies last autumn on federal hate crime charges . Sixteen members of an Amish group led by Samuel Mullet Sr. were charged with committing hate crimes, conspiracy, kidnapping, and . destroying evidence for a series of beard and hair cutting attacks . Prosecutors say they targeted hair because it carries spiritual significance in their faith. All the defendants are members of . Mullet's settlement that he founded in eastern Ohio near the West . Virginia panhandle. The Amish eschew many conveniences of modern life, . including electrical appliances and automobiles, and embrace their . centuries-old roots. Federal officials said the verdicts would send a message about religious intolerance. 'The victims in this case are members . of a peaceful and traditional religion who simply wanted to be left to . practice their religion in peace,' US Attorney Steven Dettelbach said. 'Unfortunately, the defendants denied them this basic right and they . did so in the most violent way.' Members of the Amish community who sat . through the trial hurried into a hired van without commenting, some . covering their faces. Defence lawyers said the defendants were bewildered by the verdicts. 'They really don't understand the court system the way the rest of us . have, being educated and reading newspapers,' said Joseph Dubyak, whose . client, Linda Schrock, has 10 children with her husband, who was also . convicted. The suspects had argued that the Amish are bound by different rules . guided by their religion and that the government had no place getting . involved in what amounted to a family or church dispute. Mullet wasn't accused of cutting anyone's hair. But prosecutors said he . planned and encouraged his sons and the others, mocked the victims in . jailhouse phone calls and was given a paper bag stuffed with the hair of . one victim. The Amish community in Ohio has been shaken by . the investigation into 16 men and women convicted of carrying out hate . crimes by cutting hair . One bishop told jurors his chest-length beard was chopped to within one and a half . inches of his chin when four or five men dragged him . out of his farmhouse in a late-night home invasion. Prosecutors told jurors that Mullet thought he was above the law and . free to discipline those who went against him based on his religious . beliefs. Before his arrest last November, he defended what he believes . is his right to punish people who break church laws. 'You have your laws on the road and the town - if somebody doesn't obey . them, you punish them. 'But I'm not allowed to punish the church people?' Mullet told The Associated Press news agency last October. The hair cuttings, he said, were a response to continuous criticism he'd . received from other Amish religious leaders about him being too strict, . including shunning people in his own group. Community: Amish leave the Cleveland, Ohio federal courthouse . Defence lawyers acknowledged that the hair cuttings took place and . that crimes were committed but contend that prosecutors were . overreaching by calling them hate crimes. Witnesses testified that Mullet had complete control over the settlement . that he founded two decades ago and described how his religious . teachings and methods of punishments deviated from Amish traditions. One woman testified that Mullet coerced women at his settlement into . having sex with him, and others said he encouraged men to sleep in . chicken coops as punishment. Six of the 16 people charged in the case are women, all related to the alleged ringleader . Defence lawyers for the 16 Amish accused of . conspiracy, hate crimes and kidnapping against other members of their . community, say the arguments were over family disputes and not hate . crimes .","Defendants rejected plea .

"Swiss news agency claims Wolfgang Priklopil was killed by his best friend Ernst Holzapfel . Says handwriting specialist determined that Priklopil did not begin to write his . suicide note, but that his friend may have done . Holzapfel was the last person to see Priklopil alive on the day of his death . The man who took Natascha Kampusch from a Vienna street when she was just a schoolgirl and kept her captive for nearly nine years in a secret dungeon - may have been murdered, it was claimed today. Police always said Wolfgang Priklopil ended his own life by lying with his head a railway line when an express train came along in the hours after Natascha escaped his clutches in August 2006. But a Swiss news organisation now claims his decapitated body was 'almost intact' after it was found by police - despite a grille at the front of the train that should have seriously mangled his body - and that his former best friend Ernst Holzapfel was suspected of being behind the death. New revelations: A Swiss news organisation now claims that Ernst Holzapfel (left) was behind the train death of kidnapper Wolfgang Priklop . Traumatic: Natascha Kampusch was snatched from a Vienna street when she was just a schoolgirl and held by Wolfgang Priklopil for nearly nine years . The 20 Minute Website prints details . of handwriting analysed by officials in Austria of Priklopil and . Holzapfel and determined that Priklopil did not begin to write his . suicide note - but that his friend may have done. A . 2009 expert report stated; 'The comparison of the questionable word . 'mummy' with the available specimens of handwriting of Ernst Holzapfel . furnished individual graphic similarities.' Holzapfel . knew of Natascha and often met with her when Priklopil brought her . along to flats that the pair of them refurbished in Vienna for profit. He later told police he thought she was a girlfriend of his. Doubts rasied: The grave of Wolfgang Prikopil, the man who abducted Natascha Kampusch, but there are questions of his death . Holzapfel was the last person to see Priklopil alive on the day of his death - August 23 2006. They met at a shopping centre on the outskirts of the Austrian capital where, according to Holzapfel, his friend was distressed at Natascha's escape and the massive police hunt underway for him. The former president of the highest court in Vienna, Johann Rzeszut, who served on a special Austrian commission analysing police failings into the Kampusch investigation, called the suicide note 'an extremely mysterious piece of evidence which questions the suicide thesis.' He added; 'Doubts about the suicide theory are legitimate. I personally have them too. Holzapfel's version that Priklopil began to write to his mother and stopped after the word mummy is completely implausible to me. 'A 40-year-old man who wants to say good-bye to his mother writes at least or two sentences, in which he can say 'I am done with suffering' or 'thanks for everything' or something in this direction.' He also questioned why the corpse of Priklopil - cremated soon afterwards - did not have its temperature taken at the time of death, or have blood removed from it, both of which are standard procedures at crime scenes. Back in 2009 the Kampusch case chief investigator Franz Kröll said that the death looked 'staged.' House of horror: The house in Strasshof, where kidnapped Natascha Kampusch was held captive . Captive: The entrance and stairway to the cellar where Natascha Kampusch spent so much of her life . His brother Karl told the Swiss news organisation; 'I believe Holzapfel had to get rid of the second culprit him because of things he might have said. My brother said that people who kill themselves do not put their heads on railway lines.' Long suspected of being an accomplice in the kidnapping, Holzapfel was officially ruled out of assisting in her abduction and captivity by Austrian authorities in 2010. His lawyers said he refused to comment about the new allegations swirling around him. The Kampusch case and its aftermath constitute the greatest police and judicial scandal in Austrian criminal history. A probe in 2006 found that there had been ‘massive’ police blunders and failures on the part of detectives which could have seen the girl rescued in the first few weeks after she disappeared. The police investigation was flawed from the start, and many people felt that because she was an only child being being brought up on a sink estate outside Vienna, she had been forgotten by the authorities. Since she gained her freedom she has written a book about her ordeal, become rich from media interviews and now spends weekends at the house where she was incarcerated.","Swiss news agency claims Wolfgang Priklopil was killed by his best friend Ernst Holzapfel .

"A shocking photograph has emerged showing a team of Indian doctors carrying out a sterilisation on a woman using a foot pump designed for a bicycle. Surgeons at a sterilisation camp in the village of Banarpal in Odisha state are understood to have used the device to inflate the abdomen of 56 women to make it easier to carry out the operation. The image emerged just two weeks after 13 women died in a mass sterilisation in neighbouring Chhattisgarh state, where local officials admitted the equipment used by the doctor who carried out the tubectomies had been rusty, and the medicine they were given contaminated. Shocking: Surgeons at a sterilisation camp in the village of Banarpal in Odisha state are understood to have used the device to inflate the abdomen of 56 women to make it easier to carry out the operation . The photograph of doctors using a bicycle pump to inflate the woman's abdomen was reportedly taken at a sterilisation camp in Banarpal village, in the Angul district of Odisha state. Local officials reportedly admitted that the crude technique had been used in a total of 56 tubectomies over the course of the day, according to the Hindustan Times. The newspaper said the doctor who carried out the operations, Mahesh Prasad Rout, told them that the use of a bicycle pump to inflate the abdomen was commonplace in remote parts of India. 'Bicycle pumps are used frequently during sterilisation in camps in rural areas that lack sophisticated surgical equipment used for inflating the abdomen,' Rout was quoted as saying. Local medical officials said they were looking into the incident and will submit a report this week. Tragedy: The bicycle pump photograph emerged after 13 women died and dozens left in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in India, which was carried out with rusty instruments and contaminated medicines . Typically proper medical equipment is used to inflate a woman's abdomen before a tubectomy takes place. The equipment regulates the inflation rate to ensure the pressure generated is steady and safe. Although Rout - who has performed over 60,000 tubectomies in his 10-year, award-winning career - insisted the bicycle pump was sterilised before being placed inside the woman, the potential for human error, violent expansion and an over-inflated stomach makes the practice dangerous. Last week the doctor responsible for the mass-sterilisation Chhattisgarh state which left 13 women dead and dozens hospitalised was accused of using rusty instruments to perform the operations. R.K. Gupta, allegedly carried out 83 tubectomies in just three hours at a state-run 'family planning camp' on November 8. The majority of the women fell ill shortly after their operation, with local government officials saying the equipment used was rusty and the medicines provided to the women contaminated. The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly due to the use of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines.","Surgeons used foot pump to inflate woman's abdomen before surgery .

"Taxpayers face a bill for at least £100million after the competition to run the flagship West Coast rail franchise descended into a humiliating farce yesterday. In an embarrassing U-turn – announced one minute after midnight – Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin pulled the plug on the 15-month bidding process to run trains between London and Glasgow. In a highly unusual move, three officials at the Department for Transport were suspended as ministers sought to blame civil servants for a series of ‘unacceptable mistakes’ in the way the department handled bids by FirstGroup, Virgin and two other companies. Embarrassing U-turn: Ministers have ditched their controversial plans for the West Coast Main Line after Sir Richard Branson challenged their decision in the High Court . Mr McLoughlin said the department was ‘wholly and squarely’ to blame for getting its sums wrong. Bidding on three other rail franchises . was also suspended. The DfT’s permanent secretary Philip Rutnam said he . had suspended three civil servants, two of them senior, connected with . the franchise bid. Labour – which said it would consider . renationalising the railways – claimed ministers bore some . responsibility for the ‘debacle’. David Cameron was said to be furious . about the handling of the multi-billion-pound franchise bid. A source said the revelation that the DfT had made serious errors had ‘gone down like a cup of cold sick’ in Downing Street. The affair also threatened to shred . the reputation of rising Tory star Justine Greening who, as Transport . Secretary, had repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the bidding . process. Fiasco: David Cameron is said to be furious about the handling of the bidding process, which was scrapped in an announcement made by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) at one minute past midnight . Under fire: The affair also threatens to shred the reputation of rising Tory star Justine Greening who, as Transport Secretary, had repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the bidding process . And it is a warning shot to Theresa . Villiers who, as Rail Minister, actually signed off the controversial . deal. She has since been promoted to be Northern Ireland Secretary. Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, whose court challenge forced the Government to examine its decision, welcomed the climbdown. Sir Richard, who branded the DfT’s . initial decision as ‘insane’, told the Mail that his firm, which has run . the franchise for 14 years, faced ‘institutional bias’ from DfT . officials. Comic relief: Pugh's take on the rail franchise debacle . ‘FirstGroup were given information . Virgin was not given. And some of the information was not given to . everyone equally,’ he said. ‘But to the credit of the new minister, he said they were 100 per cent guilty and were dealing with it.’ Sir Richard said it was ‘highly . likely’ he would continue to run the route for the next two years and . would  donate all profits to ‘good causes’ including developing greener . fuels. Virgin complained that FirstGroup, . which offered £2billion more, had overbid for the lucrative franchise . and would be unable to deliver – a claim flatly denied by First. Former cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell, who retired last December, admitted the West Coast fiasco 'does raise some issues about skills in the civil service'. He said civil servants who made mistakes should be held accountable, adding: 'There are civil servants up and down the country doing great jobs, but we are suffering some areas where there are skills shortages, in the commissioning area, in the procurement area.' He added that this results in 'occasional mistakes'. Lord O'Donnell claimed Whitehall must pay higher salaries if it wanted the best staff, telling Today: 'That's part of the answer and we should be prepared to do that. 'Having an arbitrary constraint like the Prime Minister's salary isn't helpful.' Hel added: 'It's not that they're greedy, but pay is a measure of how much they feel they're valued.' He also criticised ministers who attacked civil servants, saying it was 'a mistake' and 'self-defeating'. Yesterday Mr McLoughlin acknowledged his department had fatally miscalculated the risk attached to the rival projects. Mr McLoughlin said the decision to . cancel the bidding process would cost £40million, but most observers . expect the final bill to rise to well over £100million because of . potential compensation claims from FirstGroup and the costs associated . with a complete overhaul of the franchise system. Julie Hilling, a Labour member of the . Commons transport committee, said: ‘They are talking about £40million . but it will be several times that in the end by the time all the legal . issues are settled – it is an utter shambles.’ FirstGroup, which had initially been . told it had won the contract, saw £240million wiped off the value of its . shares as they plunged by 21 per cent on the news. The firm was last . night said to be considering legal action. All change: The competition to run the West Coast Main Line, which runs from London to Scotland, has been cancelled . Mr McLoughlin said he was ‘very . angry’ about what had happened, insisting: ‘I want to make it absolutely . clear that neither FirstGroup nor Virgin did anything wrong. 'The fault of this lies wholly and . squarely with the DfT. Both of those two companies acted properly on the . advice that they were getting from the Department.’ Mr McLoughlin said the mistakes had . been uncovered as the DfT prepared for the Virgin legal challenge. FirstGroup was supposed to take over the line on December 9. Labour leader Ed Miliband branded the . bidding process ‘a disgrace’. He said the Prime Minister – who was urged . by Sir Richard to take personal charge of the affair – bore . responsibility for the disastrous outcome. He also indicated he was willing to reconsider the ownership of the rail network. Asked what form rail ownership might . take under a future Labour government, he told the BBC: ‘It could be . public, it could be private, it could be not for profit franchises. Here are the key dates in the West Coast Main Line franchise saga: . 1997: Virgin Rail, a joint venture between Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains and Stagecoach, begins running the West Coast Main Line after being awarded a 15-year contract following the privatisation of UK railways. 2011: The Department for Transport (DfT) invites bids from companies interested in taking over the franchise when Virgin's contract expires in December 2012. Dutch train operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen, Virgin and First West Coast Limited, a subsidiary of the UK's largest rail operator FirstGroup enter the 15-month long competition process. A joint bid from French transport group Keolis and the country's national state-owned railway company SNCF is also received by the DfT. August 15, 2012: The Department for Transport announces it intends to award the West Coast franchise to Aberdeen-based FirstGroup but is yet to sign the 13-year deal. More than 150,000 people sign an online petition calling for the decision to be reconsidered. August 26, 2012: Sir Richard offers to run the line ""for free"" to give Parliament time to conduct a review into the procurement process. He said Virgin Trains and Stagecoach would run the service on a not-for-profit basis after December if MPs needed more time to look at the matter. August 27, 2012: Labour urges the Government to delay signing the contract with FirstGroup until Parliament reconvenes so the matter can be debated in the Commons. The DfT says there is ""no reason"" to delay the signing. August 28, 2012: Virgin starts High Court proceedings demanding a judicial review into the decision to hand the contract to FirstGroup. Then transport secretary Justine Greening says the government will fight the legal challenge, with the DfT stating it was confident the competition process was robust. Singing of the contract is delayed due to the legal proceedings. September 10, 2012: Commons Transport Select Committee takes evidence from Sir Richard, FirstGroup chief executive Tim O'Toole and DfT officials in the wake of the franchise row. The Virgin boss describes his rival's bid as 'absolutely preposterous'. October 3, 2012: The DfT announces the decision to award the West Coast franchise to FirstGroup has been scrapped following the discovery of significant technical flaws in the procurement process. The Government says the bidding process must be rerun and that it will no longer be contesting the judicial review sought by Virgin. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin orders two urgent independent reviews into the matter.","Government pulls the plug on 15-months bid process in humiliating U-turn .

"Employers could use new personality profiling software on jobseekers' tweets to see if they are right for a role. IBM developers believe they can successfully assess a person's psychological traits by analysing the 140 characters they use on Twitter. The software scans the most recent tweets, be it hundreds or thousands, to develop a personality profile. Software being developed by IBM to analyse whether a jobseeker is right for a role through their tweets . And developers say this technology, which is being tested, could be used by employers to whittle down the number of applicants for a job interview and could eventually be the deciding factor between two candidates. Researchers believe the software can even establish how emotionally resilient a person is. People are classed as one of the five main personality traits - extroversion, agreeableness, . conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness - depending on what they write. Researchers say they can decipher someone's personality trait by the words they use on Twitter . IBM tested the theory by analysing 300 Twitter profiles and getting the users to take psychometric tests. It showed there was a close correlation between their analysis of the tweets and the results of the tests. According to IBM, the two 'highly correlated' more than 80 per cent of the time. Nigel Guenole, research director of IBM company, Kenexa, told The Sunday Times: 'It could have great potential for spotting future high-flyers'. Researchers claim words used in tweets reveal a person's character traits. According to the research, people who use words like perfect tend to be perfectionists. Those . who are deemed more caring use words like 'we', 'friends' and 'family' and people who were seen as more individualistic used words such as . 'words' or 'school'. Longer words are associated with people . likely to get on with their colleagues and conscientious people talk . about their achievements. Michelle Zhou, from IBM’s Almaden Research Centre in California, which developed the software, told Technology Review: 'We want to use social media to derive information about an individual—what is the overall affect of this person? How resilient is this person emotionally? People with different personalities want something different.' The software could also be used to target adverts to people online, as well as in call centres or other customer service roles. In previous studies researchers have shown that to get a reasonable match for someone's personality they need to assess just 50 tweets. However, the research has prompted warnings of the dangers of relying on social data when selecting a candidate. Susannah Clements, deputy chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, told the newspaper hiring people based on their online use 'gives an advantage to people who live and breathe the digital space.'","IBM claim they can determine Twitter user's personality by words they use .

"A male nurse arrested by police hunting a suspected serial hospital poisoner emerged from hiding after seven months today, vowing to clear his name. Father-of-two Victorino Chua, 46, was questioned by murder squad detectives for almost four days after being arrested last January over alleged tampering with medical records at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester. He was freed without charge and bailed but was ordered by police to live at a different address due to fears for his personal safety. No more hiding: Father of two Victorino Chua, 46, returns to his terraced house two months before he is due to be questioned over the scandal . His £105,000 two-up-two-down terraced home in Heaton Norris, Stockport, was boarded up amid fears it might be targeted by a vigilantes whilst Chua went to a secret address with his wife and two children. But Chua has now returned to the address with his wife after workmen were called out to remove the boards. The move comes just two months before he is due to answer his bail and face further questioning over the scandal. Today, Chua arrived at his home holding two bags of shopping. He emerged from the property just moments later to dump a child’s pram with a passing scrap metal dealer but declined to comment on the investigation. A neighbour said: 'Vic had not been back to the house, which was hardly surprising given all the worries there may have been that he and his home could be a target for revenge attacks. 'But we were equally stunned to see him back on the street. We hear he is protesting his innocence and no doubt moving back home is all part of his battle to clear his name. 'Everyone can understand why he has wanted to keep a low profile but we can only assume he feels there is no point hiding himself away anymore.' Chua was initially detained in a dawn raid on his home on Thursday January 5 and accused of administering a noxious substance. Unafraid: Chua is on bail after being arrested over the alleged tampering of medical records at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . Nurses first discovered a chart for another patient had been altered between January 2 and 3 this year. As a result, it is believed one patient was administered more medication than necessary and had to be carefully monitored by hospital staff before being discharged. Police were granted a warrant of further detention to continue questioning Chua on the allegations for a further 36 hours but decided to rearrest him on suspicion of murder. 'Poisoned patients': The male nurse was questioned by murder squad detectives over the deaths of several people who were given contaminated saline solutions . He was quizzed over the deaths of secretary Tracey Arden, 44, retired newspaper photographer Arnold Lancaster, 71, and retired electronics engineer Derek Weaver, 83, who all died after being given contaminated saline solutions. He was also arrested on suspicion of intending to cause grievous bodily harm to 18 other patients including retired journalist Bill Dickson, 82, who passed away on New Year's Eve after being poisoned during the summer. Other deaths being probed are those of NHS office administrator Linda McDonagh, 60 and John 'Jack' Beeley, 73 and Beryl Hope, 70. Seven deaths in total have been linked to an insulin poisoner at the hospital. In total 22 patients are thought to have been deliberately poisoned on wards A1, A2 or A3 - which care for seriously ill patients - between June 1 and July 15 last year. The alarm was first raised nearly two weeks after the spate began, when hospital staff realised a higher than normal number of patients had been reported as having ‘unexplained’ low blood sugar levels. Police have described the investigation as very complex - and are having to examine 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluid. Chua was bailed in relation to all matters pending further inquiries and cannot return to work. Police said further medical and forensic tests are being carried out. Chua - described as a 'doting family man' - has worked at the hospital for two years having moved to England with his wife Marianne, 38, and their two children from the Phillippines about nine years ago. He has been registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council since August 2003 and previously worked at a nursing home. Last year nurse Rebecca Leighton, 27, spent six weeks in jail accused of poisoning the same patients. She was accused of injecting saline solutions with insulin on the wards between 1 June 2011 and 15 July 2011 and was kept in custody due to fears over her safety. But she was dramatically released last September when charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.

"As pressure mounts for a last-minute deal to avoid across-the-board spending cuts, it became clear Tuesday that patience was running thin in the U.S. House of Representatives as Speaker John Boehner lambasted the Senate for not getting 'off their ass' to 'do something' about the looming Friday deadline. Boehner made the terse remark as he complained to reporters that the House has twice passed bills that would replace the $85 billion in spending cuts, which are scheduled to kick in Friday, while the Senate has not acted. 'We should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,' the Republican leader barked. Scroll down for video .

Obama wants to replace the sequester with a package of targeted cuts and tax increases, while Republican leaders believe the savings should come from reduced spending alone . Meanwhile, President Obama traveled to Virginia Tuesday to the state's largest industrial employer, Newport News Shipbuilding, to continue his campaign against the stalemate in Congress. 'You know that if Congress can’t get together and plan our nation’s finances for the long term, that over time some of your jobs and businesses could be at risk,' Obama told the company's employees in remarks that were staged in front of a giant ship propeller. Workers in hard hats were selected to from the crowd to stand around him. 'Over at the Norfolk Naval Station, the threat of these cuts has already forced the Navy to cancel the deployment, or delay the repair of certain aircraft carriers,' Obama said. 'One that’s currently being built might not get finished. Another carrier might not get started at all. And that hurts your bottom line. That hurts this community.' Joining Obama on Air Force One for the trip to Newport News were two Virginia congressmen, Democrat Bobby Scott and Republican Scott Rigell. Obama gave Rigell a shout-out during his remarks, while at the same time, he blasted Republicans for 'holding up' negotiations on a deal to avert the sequester. 'I've got to give Scott Rigell credit,' Obama said. 'He is one of your Republican congressmen who’s with us here today - and that's not always healthy for a Republican, being with me. 'He’s asked his colleagues in the House to consider closing tax loopholes instead of letting these automatic cuts go through. He’s concerned about the deficit, and he’s more than prepared to make some really tough cuts, but he wants to do it in a smart way.'

And that's what's holding . things up right now.' Before Obama's remarks, Rigell said . he expected to take heat from Republicans for appearing with the . president at a public event.

A man with links to radical Muslim preacher Anjem Choudary has been jailed for two years for terrorism offences. Royal Mail worker Mohammed Benares, 45, had terror guides showing how to make a bomb and detonator and how to handle an AK47 assault rifle. Benares, of Saltley, Birmingham, downloaded the terror material from the internet and stored it on three external hard drives. He also had links with another radical preacher, Abu Izzadeen. The documents included online al Qaida magazine Inspire and step-by-step instructions on how to make a bomb ‘In the kitchen of your mom’ using readily-available ingredients. The court heard that Benares had attended a demonstration organised by the Muslims Against Crusades group in central London on September 11, 2011 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Choudary, Izzadeen and Benares all attended the march and analysis of the defendant’s mobile phone found text messages between him and the two radical preachers. Benares had claimed he was not an extremist, that his interest in the material found by police was just curiosity and that he wanted to understand both moderate and extreme Islam so that he could use the information to counter arguments about extremism. When asked why he attended the demonstration, he said: ‘My aim was to highlight the plight of those injured and killed through the drone attacks in Afghanistan and other Muslim countries.’ But sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court today, judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told him: 'Your presence on that march and text messages paint a very different picture. 'They point to you being in fact a fellow traveller with those who had more extreme views and one who is security aware. Associates: Texts between hate preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured, centre) and Benares were found on the defendant's mobile phone . 'I do not accept that you had a merely fleeting interest in radical Islam or that you downloaded that material out of idle curiosity.' Wearing a dark suit and tie with a white shirt, Benares looked unmoved as his sentence was read out. Tanveer Qureshi, for the defence, said in his client’s mitigation: 'This was a misjudgment on his part and a misjudgment which he is going to pay for in a fundamental way.' Police arrested Benares at the three-bedroom terraced house where he lived with his wife in March 2012. His laptop, mobile telephone and three hard drives were seized and later checked. The material gathered by officers included a document called 39 Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad. Southwark Crown Court, where Benares was jailed for three counts of possessing a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism . He was convicted of three counts of possessing a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism following a week-long trial last month. Prosecutor Adina Ezekiel had previously told the court Choudary was 'a spokesman and prominent figure' of an organisation called Al Ghurabaa, which was banned in July 2006. Choudary was also leader of Al Muhajiroun, of which Al Ghurabaa is a splinter group. Al Muhajiroun was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in January 2010. Abu Izzadeen, who was born Trevor Brooks, was an Al Ghurabaa spokesman, the court heard.","Mohammed Benares, 45, given two-year sentence for terrorism charges .

"For 30 years a campaign group has been tirelessly gathering photographs of the 58,286 American servicemen and women who died during the Vietnam War. Based in Washington, D.C. the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund was set up by a group of veterans who wanted to create a memorial from the American people for those who lost their lives during the conflict between 1965 and 1973. The result was the 'Faces Never Forgotten' memorial - also known as The Wall - which shows the sheer magnitude of American casualties and serves as a place where family and friends of those who lost their lives can remember their loved ones. U.S. Army Sgt. Bobby Joe Martinez from N.M., who is honored on Panel 58E, Row 23 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Sgt. Martinez was killed on May, 11, 1968 the province of Quang Tin Province, in South Vietnam . U.S. Marine Corps Pfc. James Michael Moore, from Albuquerque, N.M. Pfc. Moore is honored on Panel 25E, Row 74 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He was killed on August 3, 1967, in Quang Nam in South Vietnam . It has become one of the most visited memorials in the U.S. with an estimated 4.5million annual visitors a year. 'Putting a face to every name is momentous,' said Jan C. Scruggs, founder and president of VVMF. 'These men were real people, who had dreams and aspirations just like the rest of us. When you look at them you can truly humanise what The Wall represents.' The mission of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund is to preserve the legacy of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and to educate people about the impact of the war. Sgt James A Hardman was 21 when he was killed in action in Tay Ninh province in November 1968. The soldier was from Alameda County, California, and is honored on panel 38w, row 36 of the memorial . Captain Jeremiah Frederi Costello is honored on panel 1W, row 117 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He was born in 1943 but was shot down on a combat mission in Cambodia in May 1975. He won a silver star and the distinguished flying cross . Pictured is Thomas Joseph Murphy who died during the Vietnam War. For several years, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund has pursued a 'Faces Never Forgotten' campaign to gather photographs of the 58,286 who died during the war . Ssgt Lester J Brantley from Portsmouth was 33 when he was killed in action in Binh Duong province in August 1969. He is honoured on panel 19w, row 76 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial . The group is still raising money for an education centre which will display more than 400,000 items that have been left in tribute at the base of the wall since it opened. It is hoped the education centre will open in 2015 but in the meantime a searchable database has been created online which features a photograph of every service member who died during the conflict for The Wall of Faces memorial as they come in. A lot of the photographs are military pictures but the group would like family and friends to send in every-day shots of their loved ones. Col. Warren Leroy Anderson, who served in the Air Force, is honoured on panel 6e, row 135 on the memorial. The 33-year-old, from Hillsdale County, in Michigan, was declared missing in action . AMH3 Richard Thomas Pinta was just 21 when he was killed in action in July 1967. The young man from Suffolk County was in the Navy and is honoured on panel 24E, row 39 on the memorial . Sgt Merritt Adams, from Cumberland County, died in action in Binh Dinh province aged just 19. He is honoured on panel 7w, row 51 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial . LTJG David Charles Brostrom was one of only seven members of the U.S. Coast Guard who was killed in action in 1966. The 25-year-old is honoured on panel 9e, row 126 on the memorial . Major Bernard Ludwig Bucher from Woodford County, Illinois, was declared missing in action in Quang Ngai in 1968. He was 46 . SSGT Horace Earle Young from Mercer County, Illinois, served in the U.S. Army and died in 1965 aged 33 . Tim Tetz, director of outreach for the memorial, told The Charlotte Observer: 'That picture tells a different story than the one in his (uniform) on the first day of training. 'It will drive home that that's who served and sacrificed in the war'. It is believed the Memorial Fund has photos for about 32,000 of the 58,286 service members they are looking for. It is its aim to have every photo by the time the education centre opens next year. So far only New Mexico has managed to gather a photograph for every one of its soldiers. SP4 Jimmie W Boggs, of the U.S. Army, from Marlow in Oklahoma, died in action in Long An province in 1968 aged 23. He is honoured on panel 44W, row 14 on the memorial .

Nava is honored on Panel 10E, Row 77 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. He was killed on September 8 1966 in the province of Quang Tri in South Vietnam . It began in 1955 and would continue until the fall of Saigon two decades later.The Vietnam War was a bloody Cold War-era conflict that claimed millions of lives and left countless soldiers and natives traumatised by what they had endured. America's involvement in the region was triggered by one belief: that Communism was threatening to expand across the whole of South-East Asia. This photograph was taken by German photojournalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Horst Faas. It shows hovering U.S. Army helicopters pour machine-gun fire into the tree line to cover the advance of South Vietnamese ground troops as they attack a Viet Cong camp eighteen miles north of Tay Ninh, near the Cambodian border, March 1965 . 1955: In October, South Vietnam declared itself the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), with newly elected Ngo Dinh Diem as president. He would be executed in a coup eight years later. 1960: An opposing faction, The National Liberation Front (NLF) - also called the Viet Cong - was established there. The NLF, along with and Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in North Vietnam - under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh - wanted to impose a communist system over the whole nation. The United States, in an attempt to prevent the spread of communism, trained the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and provided military advisers to help fight Ho's guerillas. 1964: In August, a U.S. warship was attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. Weary: Soldiers from South Vietnam sleep on a U.S. Navy troop carrier following a four-day operation against the Viet Cong . This led Congress to pass the South-East Asia Resolution which allowed President Lyndon Johnson to conduct military operations in the region without a declaration of war. 1965: On March 2, U.S. aircraft started bombing targets in Vietnam and the first troops arrived. 1968: The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong launch the Tet Offensive, attacking about 100 South Vietnamese cities and towns. On March 16, U.S. soldiers killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians in the town of Mai Lai, later known as the Mai Lai Massacre. By December, America's troops in Vietnam reached 540,000. 1969: In July, President Nixon ordered the first of many U.S. troop withdrawals from Vietnam. 1970: In April, Nixon announced that U.S. troops would attack enemy locations in Cambodia. This news sparked nationwide protests, especially on college campuses. Horror: This iconic image shows police chief Nguyen Ngoc Loan about to execute Viet Cong officer Nguyen Van Lem on the street in Saigon . Agent Orange: War crimes are said to have been committed by both sides and one of the most controversial aspects of the U.S. military effort was the widespread use of Agent Orange - which still damages crops and is said to cause disease in Vietnam today. America's military dumped 20million gallons of the dioxin - which has been linked to cancer, birth defects and other disabilities - and other herbicides on about a quarter of South Vietnam between . 1962 and 1971, decimating about five million acres of forest. 1972: After years of fighting and agonising negotiations, Nixon ordered the Christmas bombings. Agony: A wounded paratrooper grimaces in pain as he awaits medical evacuation from base camp in the A Shau Valley . That offensive paved the way for Nixon's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to negotiate the January 1973 peace accords that called for a cease-fire and the release of prisoners, some of whom had been in captivity for nearly six years. 1973: U.S. troops are withdrawn. 1974: After a brief period of peace, North Vietnam recommenced hostilities. 1975: North Vietnamese captured Saigon on April 30, forcing South Vietnam’s surrender and reuniting the country with a one-party communist government. Aftermath: The Hanoi government estimate that in 20 years of fighting, 4million civilians were killed across North and South Vietnam and a further 1.1million communist fighters died. U.S. estimates claim that between 200,000 and 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed and more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died or were missing in action when the final troops pulled out. The war itself gathered heavy opposition in the States and soldiers have since recalled being told by superiors to remove their uniforms before landing back home to avoid being accosted by campaigners. Vietnam finally normalised relations with the U.S. in 1995.","Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund was set up in 1979 to remember the Americans who lost their lives during the conflict .

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Allianz Arena . At £42.5m Mesut Ozil is the most expensive export in the history of German football. After his performance in Munich you wouldn’t pay two-bob for him. There should be something special about returning to the country where it all started for the Arsenal midfielder. Behind those eyes something is going on with Ozil because he is simply not right. VIDEO Scroll down to the bottom to see Arsene Wenger defend Ozil twice . Waste: Mesut Ozil, all £42.5m worth of him, struggled in Munich before being hauled off at half-time . Despair: The Germany midfielder barely got into the game against Bayern Munich . No impact: The German had just 21 touches in the the opening 45 minutes - Thiago Alcantara (right) had 66 . Embarrassing: Ozil's heat map from our Match Zone shows he was barely involved on Tuesday night . The Germany midfielder suffered a hamstring injury in the Allianz Arena and looks sure to miss a series of crucial Barclays Premier League matches, starting with Sunday’s north London derby against Tottenham. He was treated by Bayern and Germany doctor Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt at the break and will have a scan on Wednesday. Ozil was replaced by Tomas Rosicky at half-time and Wenger said: ‘He’s out for a few weeks. It is a hamstring injury and it looks quite serious. I don’t know how long and we hope it’s not so bad.’ In the half that he was on the pitch, Ozil had just 21 touches of the ball. To put that into some kind of perspective Thiago Alcantara, operating in the heartbeat of Bayern’s midfield, had 66. Want more? Bastian Schweinsteiger: 47. Arjen Robben 33. Franck Ribery 33. Ozil, the highest-paid player in the history of Arsenal, is nicking a living. In the Allianz Arena, against the world’s best club side, he had a face on him like a slapped backside until he was substituted at the break. He was lucky to get to half-time. We have been here before with him, notably at Manchester City, when Arsenal lost 6-3, and again in the 5-1 defeat at Liverpool. Withdrawn: A forlorn Ozil (centre) watches the action from the Arsenal dugout . Change: Arsene Wenger waited until half-time to take Ozil off, but he could have done it sooner . Out of sync: Ozil looked lost, lazy and disinterested in the Allianz . All smiles: Ozil seemed happy in the pre-match warm-up, but that didn't last long . So what if he scored the first of four goals in an FA Cup quarter-final at home to Everton at the weekend? That’s a sticking plaster. There is a wider issue here and it is down to Wenger to find out what is going wrong with one of the most talented players in the game. The exuberance has gone, deserting him at a time when his team-mates are looking to the former Real Madrid midfielder for inspiration. His time at the Bernabeu has gone and he can look wistfully at the team who beat Schalke 6-1 at the same stage of this competition all he likes. Opener: Bastian Schweinsteiger fires home to make it 1-0 to the defending European champions . Mooted: Lukas Podolski celebrates after smashing the ball home to make it 1-1 . Bright spark: In contrast to Ozil, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was brilliant for Arsenal . Opener: Ozil scored the first of Arsenal's four goals against Everton, but that's not enough . Good times: Ozil enjoyed a great relationship at Real Madrid with Crisitano Ronaldo - even though he was accused of drifting in and out of games . The days when he drifted in and out of games with Real are behind him. Now he just looks like a lost soul, lazy and disinterested. A week ago, in the Stuttgart Stadion, Germany’s fans were on his back during their victory over Chile in a friendly. He had set up the only goal for Mario Gotze, who started this game for Bayern Munich, but it still wasn’t enough to appease them. Three weeks ago in London, it was all . too much for him after he had missed the chance to put Arsenal ahead . from the penalty spot. On his back: Ozil set up a goal in Germany's game against Chile, but was still subject to jeers from German fans . Advanced: Pep Guardiola saw his Bayern team comfortably take care of Arsenal . It . was there that his great friend Manuel Neuer saved his spot-kick and . after Ozil’s game simply fell apart. He is better than that. This . was another limp contribution, a player simply going through the . motions as Arsenal inevitably went out of the Champions League in the . second round. Stationed . on the right, where he often plays for the national team, his first and . only meaningful contribution was a corner in the 31st minute that was . met by the head of Olivier Giroud. Neuer did well to save. After this, it is down to Wenger to rescue him. Limp: Ozil went through the motions with Arsenal exiting the Champions League .

"Controversial: Mike Hayhurst made the comments at the 17th annual Creston Classic Rodeo . A rodeo clown has landed in hot water after making a racist quip about Michelle Obama over a PA system. Mike Hayhurst of Barstow, California, joked  at the 17th annual Creston Classic Rodeo . about the First Lady should be a National Geographic model, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune. Hayhurst, whose website promises 'good clean family comedy always,' told the audience that Playboy had offered Mitt Romney's wife Ann' $250,000 to pose in the magazine.' He then added that 'the White House is upset about it because National Geographic only offered Michelle Obama $50 to pose for them,' reported Gawker. His remark outraged audience members and the Creston Classic Rodeo board member Mike Barrett, told the newspaper: 'We probably won’t be using his services in the future.' There were reports that several spectators booed at his joke. The . San Luis Obispo Tribune reported that Mr Barrett, who spoke on behalf . of the rodeo’s nine-member board, said they are not responsible for the . joke but will ask Hayhurst for a letter addressing the issue and . offering an apology. Unperturbed: First lady Michelle Obama poses with children from the Girls Place, an after school school program, in Gainesville, Florida . Michelle Obama does a little dance with students in the afternoon school program - she was in Gainesville to attend a campaign rally at the University of Florida . It . was originally reported that the racist joke about Michelle Obama was . made by the rodeo announcer Ed Kutz, but the board later confirmed it . was Hayhurst. Hayhurst was unavailable for comment following the incident as he was in . the hospital, - the reason was unconfirmed but it was possibly due to injuries he sustained during the rodeo when . he was tossed around by a bull. When Kansas City rang . Hayhurst on his phone on Sunday and asked whether he wanted to . apologize for the joke or explain his comment. Comparison: The rodeo clown compared President Obama's wife Michelle to Republican nominee Mitt Romney's spouse Ann Romney . Hayhurst replied: 'I cannot . believe how insensitive you are. I am in the hospital,' before swearing . and hanging up. Last . month a Spanish magazine landed themselves in the middle of a racial . controversy over a Photoshopped picture of First Lady Michelle Obama on . the cover of their latest issue. The picture places Mrs Obama's face . in a 1800 portrait of a slave with an exposed breast, and Magazine de . Fuera de Serie likely knew the image was going to stir up controversy. Controversial: A Spanish magazine digitally altered a French portrait of a slave to include the First Lady's face . The editors may have had a different . message in mind given the historical context of the particular painting, . but that sentiment was overlooked by online viewers who found the . composite offensive and racist. The portrait in question was . initially released 1800, when French artist Marie-Guillemine Benoist . exhibited the painting, titled Portrait D'Une Négresse, at the Louvre's . annual salon. It was viewed as a inspiring image . because the country had abolished slavery six years prior, and the . portrait was thought of as an uplifting symbol of both women's and black . people's rights.","Mike Hayhurst of Barstow, California, joked about Michelle Obama being a National Geographic model at 17th annual Creston Classic Rodeo .

"A cure for marijuana abuse could be on the horizon thanks to a new finding. Researchers found that increasing the levels of a naturally occurring acid in the brain could stop addicts who are trying to give up from relapsing. The scientists discovered that kynurenic acid reduces the kick monkeys and rats get from THC – the active ingredient in marijuana. Researchers found that increasing the levels of a kynurenic acid - which occurs naturally in the brain - could stop addicts who are trying to give up marijuana from relapsing . The researchers, at the University of Maryland, in the U.S., explained that drug abuse is controlled by dopamine and that kynurenic acid influences dopamine, LiveScience reports. The acid is effective because it blocks the receptors that cause the positive feelings inspired by dopamine. THC activates dopamine neurones in the brain which causes cells to release dopamine. Kynurenic acid – which can be produced from bananas and turkey – is thought to cause fewer side effects than other treatments that have been considered because it occurs naturally in the brain. To test the effectiveness of the treatment, Robert Schwarcz and his colleagues gave rats and monkeys a drug that increased their levels of the acid while the creatures self-administered THC. They found the animals were less interested in the THC when they were being given the treatment. The researchers also tried taking the . animals off the THC and then increased their acid levels while giving . them a small amount of THC. Cure for cannabis abuse? The researchers explained that drug abuse is controlled by dopamine - and that kynurenic acid is effective because it blocks the receptors that cause the positive feelings inspired by dopamine . They found that increasing the levels of the acid stopped the rats and monkeys reverting to their previous pattern of drug use. ‘We found that you can reduce dopamine levels and the animals behave differently — they don't have relapse, and don't abuse marijuana,’ Dr Schwarcz told LiveScience. The findings have not yet been tested in people and it is not known whether the treatment would act on other parts of the brain as well. 'A medication that would safely and effectively assist in the treat­ment of marijuana dependence would be an important step forward in dealing with cannabis-use disorders,' he added, writing in the journal Nature Neuroscience.","Naturally occurring acid in the brain could stop addicts from relapsing .

"Accused: Madison High School custodian Jamaal Winchester has accused the school's former vice principal Liz Wilson, pictured, of taking steps to have him transferred because he ended their affair . A high school custodian has accused the former vice principal of having him transferred because he ended their affair. Jamaal Winchester, 33, has filed a sexual harassment complaint against Liz Wilson, saying she stalked him and took steps to have him temporarily moved to another school with fewer working hours as punishment. 'The reason I was transferred was . because I rejected Ms. Wilson's advances,' he wrote in his filing with . the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI). 'She knew I needed overtime hours and knew I . needed my job.' The Oregonian reported the pair worked together at Madison High School in Portland, Oregon. They secretly started dating in January and Winchester moved in with Wilson. He was in a long-term relationship with the mother of his children at the same time. But a month later, the district found out about the affair and the couple were called into the principal's office. That's when Winchester 'left Ms. Wilson’s house and returned to the mother of his children,' the complaint says. But Winchester, 33, alleges his former lover wouldn't let it go, and kept calling, texting and visiting him to get back together. 'Ms. Wilson approached Mr. Winchester nearly every day during work in the cafeteria to tell him that he should reconsider his decision about their relationship,' Winchester claims. 'One evening, Ms. Wilson called Mr. Winchester around midnight and, when Mr. Winchester did not answer, left a voicemail saying, 'What a n*****'.' This is Madison High School in Oregon where Jamaal Winchester claims the sexual harassment occurred . The couple briefly took up their relationship again. Then, in late February, when Winchester went to visit his children, Wilson allegedly followed him in a car. After confronting her, he moved out of her house. But Winchester said his fling continued to make contact, even though he insisted they just stay friends. He claimed Wilson continually approached him at school and claims his supervisor was aware of the 'harassment'. In March, Winchester and the mother of his children encountered Wilson and a friend at a restaurant. Wilson alleges Winchester and his companion yelled at her and called her a home-wrecker, according to The Oregonian. Wilson then filed a restraining order against Winchester. Although the claim was dismissed on April 1, Winchester says the damage was done. He had been transferred to another school and given 20 less working hours a week. Winchester was allowed to return to Madison on August 26. The custodian also alleges the district delayed his return to Madison in retaliation for the initial sexual harassment complaint. Wilson has been transferred to Marysville School, a Southeast Portland K-8 building, where she is  the assistant principal. Winchester said the district painted Wilson's transfer in a positive light, whereas he felt humiliated. BOLI is investigating the case, which was filed in June. In a statement, Portland Public Schools Chief Human Resources Officer Sean Murray said the district 'addressed the matter appropriate to the circumstances with both employees at the conclusion of its investigations.' 'As this is a personnel matter, the district has no further information to provide at this time,' he wrote. Winchester’s attorney, Jon Weiner, said his client believed it was unfair he was being punished for ending the relationship. 'The district really aided and abetted that when the district had an opportunity to make everything right in a timely manner,' he said, according to The Oregonian. Weiner said Winchester will  =pursue a lawsuit unless the district settles.","Madison High School custodian Jamaal Winchester filed a sexual harassment complaint against the Oregon school's former vice principal, Liz Wilson .

"A former Scientologist has claimed on television she was imprisoned for 12 years on board a cruise liner after her family denounced the religion. Valeska Paris says she was held against her will aboard the church's luxury 'cathedral' ship The Freewinds from the age of 18. Ms Paris, who now lives in Australia, alleges she was forced into hard labour and was never allowed to leave the ship without an escort. Valeska Paris says she was held against her will aboard the church's luxury ship . In a statement, the Church of Scientology denied Ms Paris' claims saying it was 'the fabrication of an apostate disgruntled ex-member'. It said: 'She certainly wasn't ""forced"" to be there. She was also never forced to perform labour in the engine room. 'The . Freewinds is a wonderful place, as even Valeska said on numerous . occasions. Her allegation that she could only leave the ship with an . escort is totally false.' Ms Paris had claimed in an interview with the ABC News . Lateline program that Church of Scientology leader David . Miscavige sent her to the ship to stop her family from pulling her . out of the organisation. 'I . was basically hauled in and told that my mum had attacked the church . and that I needed to disconnect from her because she was suppressive,' she said. 'He decided the . ship, and I found out two hours before my plane left, I was woken up in . the morning and I was sent to the ship for ""two weeks"".' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ms Paris said she was on the Freewinds (pictured) for the last 12 years . Instead of the promised two week stay, Ms Paris said she was forced into work on the lower levels of the ship for 12 years. 'It's . hot, it's extremely loud, it's smelly, it's not nice. I was sent down . there at first for 48 hours straight on almost no sleep and I had to . work by myself,' she said. 'I . did not want to be there, I made it clear I did not want to be there . and that was considered bad ethics, meaning it was considered not . right. 'They take your passport when you go . on the ship and you're in the middle of an island. So it's a bit hard . [to escape] and by that time I was 18, I'd been in Scientology my whole . life, it's not like I knew how to escape,' she said. David Miscavige, the leader of the Scientology religion pictured here speaking in London, was accused of being a 'psycopath' Ms Paris was born into a Scientology family in Switzerland, and at . the age of six she moved to Scientology's UK headquarters . in East Grinstead, where she was placed in its then youth wing. At 14 she joined the Church's elite Sea Organisation, signing a contract . binding her for a billion years, a commitment that would override her . bond with her own family. Her mother had denounced Scientology on French TV after her ex-husband Albert Jaquier committed suicide. A self-made millionaire, his last days were spent in poverty, and in a diary he kept, he blamed the Church of Scientology for fleecing him of his fortune. Ms Paris says the church was so worried her mother would take her away that Mr Miscavige intervened, ordering she be taken to the church's cruise ship. She described him as a psychopath and says he should be put on trial. 'It's not right for someone to be running the church and basically take advantage of a church and hiding behind religion to live like a king and abuse people around him. That man doesn't like anyone, he's a psychopath,' she said.

The Freewinds is used as a base to deliver Scientology's highest level counselling course known as Operating Thetan Level VIII. It cruises around the Caribbean docking at small islands.

'She met the man to whom she was married from 1998 to 2005 and who affirms that her claims of being held against her will are utterly false. 'She left the Freewinds hundreds of times to go shopping, for outings with her husband on the islands of St Kitts, Aruba, St Barts and Curaçao, and for numerous other reasons. 'She went on extended trips to the UK, U.S. and Denmark passing through Immigration and Customs when entering and leaving these countries. Her claims are false.

"Trampled to death: Sandra Wiltshire was killed along with dog Bruce by a herd of stampeding cows . The devastated family of a retired account clerk trampled to death by a herd of cows today paid tribute to a 'lovely' woman who died along with her dog in the stampede. Devoted dog owner Sandra Wiltshire, 68, was walking Golden Labrador Bruce, 11, in a field near their home when the cattle spooked and charged. Both were seriously injured in the crush and Mrs Wiltshire - who had walked in the field for 20 years - died at the scene minutes later after suffering a cardiac arrest. Bruce was taken to a vet but his injuries were too severe and he was put down later that day. Today, devastated friends and family paid tribute to Mrs Wiltshire, who had owned rescue dog Bruce for nine years. Grieving . husband George Wiltshire, who lived with Sandra just streets away from . the field in Chippenham, Wilts, described her as 'a wonderful woman'. Retired . lorry driver George said: 'She was lovely. I loved her to bits. She . looked after me brilliantly. I have lost both Sandra and Bruce.' Mrs . Wiltshire and Bruce were discovered by two horrified dog walkers after . they were attacked at around 8.30am on Thursday, October 11. Paramedics who arrived at the scene on the banks of the River Avon were unable to save Mrs Wiltshire. Clive . and Joan Rathband, who were close friends and neighbours with Mrs . Wiltshire, said she probably died protecting her beloved dog. Mrs Rathband said: 'I think she would have died protecting her dog. She would have defended him to the death. 'Bruce was very old and wasn't capable of running. He could just waddle along. 'Sandra was friends to everyone. She loved animals. She was always immaculately dressed, enjoyed singing and was an avid reader. 'She always cared for her elderly relatives.' Mr Rathband, a friend of Mrs Wiltshire for 50 years, said: 'Bruce was the most placid dog I have ever met. Nothing fazed him. 'He was just friendly with every dog he met and every person he met. He and Sandra were absolutely devoted to each other. 'She loved walking and walked Bruce twice a day. Bruce loved the river.' Best friends: Bruce was being taken for a walk by owner Sandra Wiltshire when the cows struck, and he was later put down . The fields where Mrs Wiltshire died are on the banks of the River Avon and an official footpath runs through the top. But the lower part of the fields by the side of the river - where Mrs Wiltshire was - are not a footpath but are popular with walkers. Friend Chris Jones, who has two boxer dogs, lives close to Mrs Wiltshire and has known her for the last 20 years. Mrs Jones said: 'Sandra visited the fields twice or sometimes three times a day. That's the first serious incident that has been there. 'She was brave and not stupid. There was no way Bruce was antagonising those cows. He was a plodder. If anything happened to Bruce Sandra would have rescued him.' Wiltshire police are investigating the circumstances of Mrs Wiltshire's death on behalf of Wiltshire Coroner David Ridley. It is not yet clear exactly what happened to cause the cows to trample the pensioner and her dog. She was able to tell walkers who found her what happened before passing away. Mrs Wiltshire's distraught mother, Brenda Beint, 91, who lives in Calne, Wilts., with husband Leonard, said her daughter was 'lovely'. She said: 'We are in absolute shock. I cannot tell you how much I miss her. Sandra was a lovely, bubby personality and she and I always enjoyed our time together so much. 'We tried to get out to have lunch together at least once a fortnight or three weeks and we went out last Wednesday. 'It was lovely and I am so glad that we did that.' Tragedy: Blackbridge Road in Chippenham, close to where yesterday's accident took place . The owner of the cows involved in the incident - which have since been removed from the land - is believed to be Brian Mifflin, of Grove Farm, Langley Burrell. Mr Mifflin was not available for comment. A pair of horrified dog walkers . discovered Mrs Wiltshire and her pet and rushed to a nearby street to . call emergency services, yesterday. Paramedics . from Great Western Ambulance Service rushed to the scene but were . unable to save the woman, who had suffered a cardiac arrest. She died at the scene. Her dog is being treated at a local vets for multiple injuries, including fractured hips. Wiltshire Police say the woman's injuries were consistent with being trampled . After the tragedy the wife of the cow's owners, who would not reveal her name, said: 'It is very sad and very unfortunate. 'She was found in our field where our cows with the calves were. 'I think there should be more publicity in the vets and pet shops so people would be aware that you take a risk. 'I would not go into a field with cows and calves with a dog.' She . added: 'We are so shocked. My husband and son went down there. People . walk where they think they will. And there is nothing you can do . anything about it. It is a sad accident. 'They are our cattle. Anybody who knows their country code would not walk in a field with cows and calves.' Claire Usher, spokeswoman for Wiltshire police, confirmed that officers were investigating the incident. She . said: 'We can confirm that officers were called to assist paramedics in . a field near to Riverside Drive, Chippenham, shortly before 9am this . morning. 'On arrival the body of a lady believed to be in her seventies was found. 'There . do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding her death . at this stage and an investigation will be commenced on behalf of HM . Coroner for Wiltshire. 'Formal identification has not yet been carried out and officers are in the process of informing her next of kin.' An inquest into Mrs Wiltshire's death will be held at a later date. In a separate incident, a 46-year-old man was rushed to hospital in Shropshire the following morning when he was trampled by cows while walking his dog. The victim, who has not been named was in a field in Whittington at 9.15am when the . animals set on him. After knocking him to the ground, the cows repeatedly kicked him before he managed to scramble to safety and dialled 999. Tragic: Sandra Wiltshire was trampled by cows while out walking her dog in the countryside (stock photo) A . West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: 'The 46-year-old man . was next to the field being cared for by passers-by when crews arrived. 'The . man had been walking his dog across the field when the cows suddenly . charged, trampling and kicking him before he managed to escape. 'Crews assessed the man and found he had sustained facial, chest and leg injuries. 'The . man was given pain relief and oxygen before being taken by land . ambulance to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital for further assessment and . treatment.' Meanwhile in June last year,  farmer Alexander 'Sandy' Banks, 64, was killed by a stampeding cow that he just given birth in Halkirk, Caithness, Scotland. He had been . helping the newborn to suckle and, as is common practice, had tied a . rope around the mother’s neck and his own waist. The cow suddenly bolted, dragging him for some distance across his farm and trampling on him. Mr Banks, an experienced farmer, died of . multiple injuries, according to a written submission made public . yesterday following a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) which was held in . August. Wick Sheriff Andrew Berry said it was 'a sad and tragic accident'. Commenting . on the findings, a spokesman for NFU Scotland said: 'This is a tragic . accident that acts as a sad reminder to all livestock farmers and their . staff that we work in a hazardous and dangerous industry. 'A . small number of deaths and injuries related to handling cattle are . recorded each year but each incident has implications for family and . friends.' The spokesman . added: 'Increasingly, those working with cattle are doing so in . isolation and many farmers are aware of times when the unpredictable . nature of stock, the availability of handling facilities and the risks . involved have not been given due consideration. 'The tragic circumstances around Mr Banks’ death should make us all think a wee bit more about these things.'","Sandra Wiltshire was trampled by the herd in Chippenham, Wiltshire, while walking her Golden Labrador .

"Hundreds of thousands more patients are being forced to wait longer than four hours for emergency care as A&E departments across the country struggle due to closures and staff shortages. Official NHS data reveals a growing crisis in England’s A&E wards with one in every three patients now waiting four hours or more for emergency treatment in the worst affected areas. The figures, released by the Department of Health on Friday, show that during the week up to April 7, 33,225 patients were forced to wait longer than four hours compared with 13,081 in the same week last year, a rise of 250 per cent. Official NHS data has revealed one in every three patients in England's A&E wards now wait four hours or more for emergency treatment in the worst affected areas . An additional 146,000 patients waited more than four hours to be seen in casualty in the six months between October and April compared with the same six-month period during the previous year. The shocking picture of emergency care – described as the worst in nearly 20 years – is based on information submitted by all hospital trusts across England. The pressures have been blamed on the reorganisation of NHS services in recent weeks, a programme of A&E closures and a massive shortage of frontline staff. Since 2011 when the Government scrapped a target introduced by Labour that 98 per cent of A&E patients must be seen within four hours, claiming it had ‘no clinical justification’, waiting times have gradually risen from what had been an all-time low. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘We have repeatedly warned Jeremy Hunt about the intense pressures on A&E and urged him to get a grip. His failure to face up to this problem cannot continue. ‘England’s A&Es are struggling in a way not seen since the bad old days of the mid-Nineties. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) with Watford MP Richard Harrington (left) and Samantha Jones (centre), chief executive of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, last week . ‘There are two principal causes of this increasing chaos. First, hospitals are continuing to make severe cuts to frontline staffing levels, with many operating below recommended staffing levels. ‘Second, deep cuts to council care budgets mean patients can’t be discharged from hospital beds. ‘With no free beds on the wards, A&E staff can’t admit patients, and with A&E full, paramedics can’t hand over patients. So we see long queues of ambulances outside hospitals as the pressure backs up right through the system. ‘These problems are well known but they have been neglected as for months the NHS has been distracted by the biggest-ever top-down re-organisation. Standards of care are deteriorating across the country as the NHS is dragged down by David Cameron’s toxic mix of cuts and reorganisation.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has said: 'England's A&Es are struggling in a way not seen since the bad old days of the mid-Nineties' Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘With fewer nurses and rising demand, emergency departments are now at risk of being overwhelmed. The chaotic closure of NHS Direct also risks sending more patients to A&E unnecessarily. This situation could become very dangerous over the coming months.’ A&E units are now supposed to treat 95 per cent of patients within four hours, but the NHS figures show this target has been missed most weeks since December. In some of country’s biggest emergency units the national target has not been met since September last year, while in some hospitals the figure has dipped to just 60 per cent. A Mail on Sunday campaign to save A&E services has already revealed that the pressure on casualty wards is set to worsen with the proposed closure or downgrade of 34 more A&E departments over the coming months. The latest revelations also coincide with the introduction of the Government’s much-criticised 111 non-emergency phone number, which has already been blamed for increasing the number of emergency call-outs and trips to A&E. The latest performance report on the 111 service reveals patients in 30 areas across the country waited for more than an hour for a call-back during the Easter period – and one waited for 11 hours. The new figures show that in one of the worst affected areas, Coventry and Warwickshire, A&E services are ‘close to collapse’. One in every three patients arriving at A&E at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust waited longer than four hours, according to the figures. The Trust said doctors have already cancelled hundreds of operations and appointments to free up beds. Elsewhere, at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, two in five people waited more than four hours. At Weston General, Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, North West London and Leicester, a third of patients spent four hours or more waiting for treatment, while at Kettering, Wrexham, Bath, Bristol, Worcestershire and Milton Keynes, long waits affected one quarter of all arrivals. A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘Our A&E departments are seeing increasing numbers of patients, meaning they are having to run harder just to stand still, and the NHS deserves a great deal of credit because broadly speaking it has kept waiting times under control. ‘We are taking action to help improve performance in future. There will be fines where there are delays of 30 minutes or more in ambulance handovers and we have set a minimum standard so that no patient should experience long  trolley waits.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt spent a morning working at Watford General Hospital’s A&E as part of an initiative to give health Ministers and officials frontline experience last week. Mr Hunt took on various roles including cleaning and portering on Thursday.","In just one week, 20,000 more face long delays than same time last year .

"Islamic terrorists hijacked a bus at gunpoint in Kenya yesterday and executed 28 passengers – including nine women – who failed a ‘Muslim test’. The killers, who belong to the Somali group Al Shabab, ordered the passengers to recite verses from the Koran. Those who could not were shot. The militants fired a rocket- propelled grenade to stop the bus. The terrified passengers were ordered to get off in remote countryside 19 miles from the town of Mandera in northern Kenya, near the border with Somalia. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . The bodies of 28 non-Muslims who were executed today by Islamic Shebab lie on the ground in Mandera, before being taken to a nearby hospital . The 60 passengers were separated into groups. Somalis were told to move to one side. Witness Ahmed Mahat said that the non-Somalis were then ordered to declaim the requisite verses from the Koran. ‘Those who failed were ordered to lie down. One by one they were shot in the head at point-blank range.’ Mr Mahat, a teacher from Mandera, said some Somali men were also shot after pleading with the gunmen to spare the non-Muslim passengers. The bodies were left at the roadside while the terrorist gang tried to drive the bus away from the scene. When it got stuck in mud they fled on foot. Teacher Douglas Ochwodho described how he was forced to watch helplessly as his wife was shot dead beside him. Among the victims were several children, who were shot in the head at point-blank range alongside the other victims . Rescue workers walk near the Nairobi-bound bus that was ambushed outside Mandera town . From his hospital bed in Mandera he said: ‘When my turn came, the militiamen started arguing and by some miracle they passed me by. My wife’s blood was all over my body. In her way she saved my life. By luck I escaped through the bush with two other men after the gunmen left the scene.’ Many of the passengers, travelling overnight to the capital Nairobi, were civil servants and teachers going on annual leave. Police said they were ‘in pursuit of the criminal gang’ that carried out the attack, but local officials have slammed security agencies for failing to guard routes known to be targeted by terrorist groups. Municipal chief Abdullah Abdirahman said: ‘This is not the first time the government has totally ignored us and you can see now how many precious innocent lives have been lost.’ Police are said to fear being ambushed if they set up roadblocks to protect travellers. Yesterday it was left to Kenya’s Red Cross Society to retrieve bodies from the scene. Security officers gather around the bodies of those who were killed at the scene of the attack . The killings took place after extremists hijacked a  bus in Mandera, north Kenya, before separating the Muslims from the non-Muslims . Al Shabab, which is aligned to Al Qaeda, boasted of its killings in a statement by spokesman Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage that read: ‘By the grace of Allah, the Mujahideen successfully carried out an operation near Mandera early this morning which resulted in the perishing of 28 crusaders as revenge for the crimes committed by the Kenyan crusaders against our Muslim brethren in Mombasa.’ The militants have stepped up their deadly campaign against Kenyan security forces in the past few weeks in response to the mosque raids and the bombing of Al Shabab camps in Somalia by African Union and Kenyan troops. Al Shabab had also warned of vengeance over the killing of their spiritual leader Ahmed Abdi Godane in a US airstrike two months ago. He had praised the attack on Nairobi’s Westgate shopping mall in 2013 in which 67 people were killed. The gunmen hijacked the bus (pictured), which was on its way to Nairobi, before killing the 28 victims . Officials unload the bodies of the dead passengers at the Churomo Mortuary in Nairobi .

"A teacher has been stripped of her classroom duties after a protest by furious parents who discovered she had been accused of - but not prosecuted for - pushing a child's head into a desk. Accused Deborah Fergin-Mavaega, 51, was given a role outside of the classroom after families interrupted San Fransisco's Sherman Elementary's board meeting last week, complaining to district officials about her position at the school. The furor began when Ms Fergin-Mavaega was transferred to the school in the first week of the new school year, replacing a fifth-grade teacher - but parents had not been informed about the change, SFGate reported. The accused teacher - who has not faced criminal charges - has been removed from classroom duties (picture posed by models) But the row grew when already incensed parents learned that she had allegedly pushed a 5-year-old child's head into a desk at Bret Harte Elementary School in 2009. Ms Fergin-Mavaega has not faced criminal charges for the accusations. The criminal charges against Ms Fergin-Mavaega, a district teacher since 1991, were dropped by prosecutors when she agreed to a pretrial diversion program, the website reported. The child's family were paid $30,500 by the district after they filed a civil lawsuit. But after returning to the classroom in 2011, another Bret Harte pupil, 4, accused the teacher of grabbing her arm and bruising her. The district and law enforcement investigated the incident and filed no charges, but a civil case is pending, SFGate reported. District officials said there was no reason to sack the teacher or forbid her from the classroom. Gentle Blythe, district spokeswoman, said in a statement reported by SFGate: 'Teachers have a right to due process. An accusation does not establish guilt. Row: Parents kicked up a fuss at Sherman Elementary School, pictured . 'SFUSD follows the requirements of the Education Code, the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and our contract with the teachers union in determining whether or not there are grounds for dismissing a teacher and/or removing a teacher from the classroom.' But a letter sent to parents said she had been removed from the classroom and assured them the original teacher the accused Ms Fergin-Mavaega replaced will return to the class. Union officials backed the under-fire teacher and branded the accusations of abuse groundless. Susan Solomon, executive vice president of the United Educators of San Francisco, said that the teacher had been taken out of the classroom to suit everyone involved. 'The teacher is being assigned to a nonteaching position ... to do what's best for the students and the teacher, which is to let the students get on with their education, and the teacher to perform needed work for the district.' A lawyer for the children's families disagreed. 'I'm glad they took her out of the classroom. She shouldn't be there,' said Cheryl Ruggiero, the attorney for the plaintiffs in both civil cases against the teacher and district.","San Fransisco teacher accused of, but not prosecuted for, banging child's head into desk .

"A topless painting of the late actress Bea Arthur - famous for her role as Dorothy in the TV show ‘Golden Girls’ – sold for nearly $2 million at a Christie’s auction in New York on Wednesday night. Controversial artist John Currin painted ‘Bea Arthur Naked’ in 1991, it features the elderly star wearing a blank expression and sagging breasts. Arthur never actually sat for Currin, who derived the work from a photograph of the actress with her clothes on. Sexist or empowering? John Curran's 1991 painting 'Bea Arthur Naked' has fetched $1.9m at auction . The oil on canvas painting was purchased by an anonymous phone bidder for $1.9 million. There had been expectations the painting might fetch as much as $2.5 million in the post-war and contemporary art sale at Christie's. After the painting was unveiled in the early 90s, it was described as sexist and misogynist by critics. Others have since argued it is actually a feminist statement about confidence and age. A Christie’s spokesman called the painting 'visually lasting.' During her career, Arthur won acclaim for her comic timing and deadpan delivery in roles such as Maude, right . 'It’s historically significant - it’s . radical to sexualize someone people think of as asexual,' spokesman Koji . Inoue told The New York Post. Currin’s work is now widely acclaimed and hangs in museums such as the Whitney. He once said he considered Arthur 'more of a maternal figure than a feminist icon. I watched ""Maude"" all the time when I was a kid. She's a genius. She's funny because she's so much smarter than everyone around her.' Arthur, famous for her Emmy-winning roles in the 1970s and '80s television series ‘Maude’ and ‘The Golden Girls,’ died of cancer in 2009 at age 86. Born Beatrice Frankel in New York on May 13, 1922, Arthur began . performing in college and appeared in Broadway and off-Broadway roles, . winning a Tony Award opposite Angela Lansbury in Mame. Golden Girls: Arthur, far right, with her co-stars in the 80s TV show Betty White, left, and Rue Mcclanahan . In the . early 1970s, she appeared on the groundbreaking television comedy . 'All in the Family' as Edith Bunker's fiercely liberal cousin Maude. Producers who saw gold in her comic timing and deadpan delivery quickly devised a spinoff for the . character. Maude debuted on CBS in 1972 and became one of the top-rated sitcoms on U.S. television during its six-year run. In . a two-part episode that aired in November 1972, the show stirred . protest and controversy when Maude decided to have an abortion because . of her age. The procedure was legal in New York state, where the show . was set, but not nationwide. Two months later, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Arthur followed with Golden Girls, an unlikely hit from 1985 to 1992 that featured four female retirees living together.","The painting of the former 'Golden Girl' was called sexist and misogynistic when first unveiled in the early 90s .

"It sounds like a plot lifted from a sci-fi disaster movie. A Russian scientist has said a Soviet-era ballistic missile system dubbed 'Satan' should be put back into use defending the earth from asteroids. Senior rocket researcher Sabit Saitgarayev - who spoke out after a meteor burst over Russia's Ural Mountains earlier this year damaging thousands of buildings - said the old 1960s missiles were ideally suited to destroying any potential threats streaking towards the planet from space. Back in use? The scientist suggested the old Soviet-era SS9 ICBM missiles should be put back to work protecting the earth from meteorites . Threat: The researcher said the missiles - named Satan by NATO - were well suited to 'fighting suddenly discovered small [space] objects' Powerful: The meteor left a 50-foot hole in the frozen surface of a lake as it crashed down in Russia's Chelyabinsk region . Mr Saitgarayev, from the State Rocket Design Center, highlighted the havoc caused when the meteor burst over the Urals on February 15, leaving around 1,200 people injured. It created a sonic boom that shattered windows and damaged thousands of buildings around the city of Chelyabinsk. 'Well-suited': The Soviet-era missiles could intercept a falling missile with a mere 20 minutes' warning, Mr Saitgarayev claimed . The researcher said the missiles, which use standard liquid fuel based on hydrazine, were 'well-suited' to fighting 'suddenly discovered small [space] objects, according to a report on news.com.au. He pointed out that the missiles could be kept poised and ready to launch for up to a decade. It means a missile could be launched against an approaching asteroid with a mere 20 minutes warning, in contrast to modern missile systems, which require several days of preparation ahead of a launch. Hurtling from space: The missiles could intercept a meteorite like the one that streaked across the sky over Chelyabinsk in February before it crashed into the earth, the scientist has claimed . Defence: The scientist referred to the meteor that streaked across the skies over Russia's Ural Mountains earlier this year, causing sharp explosions . Damage: The exploding meteorite left the roof of this zinc factory in Russia's Chelyabinsk region in ruins . Scientists claimed the meteorite that exploded over the Urals was the biggest space rock to hit earth in more than a century. The enormous meteorite weighed an estimated 100,000 tons and measured around 55ft in diameter. Mr Saitgarayev claimed Satan missiles would be capable of destroying objects with a diameter of up to around 300ft. If equipped with a booster, the 1960s missile would be able to destroy a space object hurtling towards earth while it was still five to six hours away, he said. Satan missiles can be used for destroying small space objects with a diameter of up to 100 meters threatening the Earth, if the missile is equipped with the third stage. If reequipped with a booster, the missile will be able to destroy space objects five-six hours before their collision with the Earth, he said.","Claims Soviet-era missiles could destroy meteorites hurtling towards earth .

"The Obama administration official closest to the disastrous rollout of Healthcare.gov dodged questions from a congressional committee chairman – eight separate times – about how many Americans have signed up for coverage through government-run marketplaces. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner refused to provide hard numbers to House Ways and Means Committee chair Rep. Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, saying only that 'We'll have that information available until mid-November.' That practiced phrase would come back time and time again. Yet 'we have a system that's working,' she told dumbfounded House Republicans on the panel. 'It's just not working at the speed that we want and at the success rate that we want.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in the wake of the troubled launch of the Healthcare.gov website, but provided few answers . Legacy in the balance: President Barack Obama has been left to white-knuckle it out, hoping that his deputies can persuade Americans to participate in the Obamacare system as key deadlines approach . Rep. Paul Ryan demanded answers Tuesday about how the Obamacare website verifies whether applicants are eligible for subsidies -- money they will be expected to pay back if the IRS later determines it was improperly awarded . CMS has promised a mid-November release of October enrollment totals. Tavenner said Tuesday only that 700,000 Americans nationwide have filled out applications for coverage, the first step toward enrollment. 'Then they go into the shopping experience where they can look at plans,' she said. Tavenner also would not say how many of those 700,000 applicants were seeking Medicaid coverage, instead of a traditional medical insurance policy with paid premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Some media reports have estimated that as many as 80 per cent are lower-income applicants signing up for Medicaid, a taxpayer-funded, poverty-targeted program whose upper income limits were expanded under the Affordable Care Act in states that choose to take advantage. Tavenner also said Congress and the public won't know until mid-November how many applicants are actually hoping to enroll in insurance policies. She said the same about statistics that would show how many young people have applied to participate. Next up: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will be on the hot seat Wednesday when she faces congressional questions about the Obamacare rollout and what it means for health insurance consumers . The Obama administration needs approximately 7 million Americans enrolled in the Obamacare scheme in order to make its books balance. That includes 2.3 million young and healthy people, whose monthly premiums are required to fund the skyrocketing medical costs of the old and sick. In the face of withering questions . about the Obamacare website which is failing by every standard, Tavenner . urged Americans to apply instead by mail, by phone, or through 'people . in their communities.' That's a reference to the 'Navigator' program . that has come under fire in some states for failing to background-check . its participants. Trouble: Tavenner told a congressional panel that Obamacare's website is 'fixable' 'I want to apologize to you that the website is not working as well as it should,' she said, while simultaneously insisting that 'there are more methods' for submitting applications 'than just the website, and that's important.' The White House has focused on those other methods, including a phone line, paper applications and the Navigators, since the glitch-prone website itself became the subject of late-night comedians' jokes. But the Navigators typically guide consumers through the website, and lack any other way to interface with the Obamacare system. The firms processing paper applications, too, enter their data into the website. And phone operators tell callers that when the website is down, they're powerless to help. Ultimately, Tavenner insisted, 'this healthcare.gov site is fixable.' Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady demanded to know why the website wasn't ready on time. 'You have had nearly four years to get it ready,' Brady sniped. 'Why should the American people believe you now?' 'My constituents are frightened,' he said. 'They are being forced out of health care plans they like. The clock is ticking. The federal website is broken. Their health care isn’t a ""glitch.""' Camp was equally unimpressed. 'No amount of website fixes can make right the president's broken promises that health care costs will be lowered by $2,500,' he said, 'or that Americans will be able to keep the plan they have and like.' Sen. Lamar Alexander demanded HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' resignation on Tuesday, saying that at least 1.5 million Americans are losing their health insurance because their policies are not legal under Obamacare . One contentious exchange between Tavenner and Wisconsin Republican rep. Paul Ryan highlighted what may be a loophole in the Obamacare website's application process. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp needled Tavenner over and over about the Obamacare system's enrollment success rates, but got the same rehearsed answer each time . Top brass at the IRS, Ryan said, have testified that they won't be able to confirm until 2016 whether consumers are eligible for health insurance subsidies in 2014. The Obama administration's decision to delay for 1 year the so-called 'employer mandate' under the law has created a 12-month during which companies aren't required to provide information about which of their workers are covered by group insurance plans. Also of particular interest are those under 26 years old who are covered by their parents' insurance policies, Ryan said. Neither group is eligible for subsidies. But it's unclear whether healthcare.gov is capable of verifying an applicant's 'yes' or no' statement about those scenarios. 'Are we really verifying at the front end whether a person is eligible for the subsidy or not?' he asked. Tavenner pointed to 'help instructions' and reminders that applicants are filling out online forms 'under penalty of perjury.' under the Affordable Care Act, Americans who wrongly receive subsidies will be charged for them when they submit a tax return that claims a refund, an outcome that Ryan called 'a rude awakening.' Obamacare call center employees like these in Rhode Island depend on the healthcare.gov website to walk consumer through the Obamacare application process, rendering them less-than-helpful when the site is down . In the Senate, two key Republicans lashed out on Tuesday. 'It's getting harder to tell the Obamacare headlines from the Obamacare punchlines these days,' quipped Senate minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 'Paper applications, 800 numbers, applying by fax; Obamacare appears to be leading us boldly into the 1980s.' And Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who is the GOP's ranking member on the Senate health committee, called openly for the resignation of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. 'No private sector CEO would escape accountability after such a poor performance,' said Alexander. 'Expecting this secretary to be able to fix in a few weeks what she has not been able to fix during the last three and one half years is unrealistic. It is throwing good money after bad.'","Marilyn Tavenner provided few answers in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing Tuesday .
'We have a system that's working,' she boasted .

"Floyd Mayweather Jr has claimed he was justified in talking about his ex-fiancee's abortion on social media because they are too famous to have privacy. Shantel Jackson, the undefeated boxing champion's former fiancee, filed a lawsuit claiming Mayweather had publicly humiliated her by posting a sonogram picture of her pregnancy online and claiming they broke up because she had an abortion. In legal documents, Mayweather lays out his defence, saying: 'Both parties are public figures. Abortion is a public issue.' Scroll down for video . Floyd Mayweather says he was justified in discussing ex-fiancee Shantel Jackson's (pictured with Mayweather) abortion on social media because they were a famous couple . Miss Jackson is suing Mayweather over the post as well as claims he beat her and threatened her at gunpoint . Earlier this year, Miss Jackson sued Mayweather for assault, battery, defamation and invasion of privacy, TMZ reported, but he is now attempting to have some of these claims dismissed. Legal files submitted by the boxer say: 'At age 37 I am an undefeated boxer. I have been the world champion in five different weight divisions.' He adds that when he met Miss Jackson 'she asked me to help her become famous' and that her own claim to fame was appearing in seven music videos. Because of his high profile, Mayweather says he was entitled to post details about every aspect of the relationship, including the break-up, on social media. He adds: 'Both parties are public figures. Abortion is a public issue. 'A public figure involved with another public figure in a public relationship can expect publicity, not privacy, about why it ends.' As well as the offending Instagram post, Miss Jackson claimed Mayweather also threatened to post naked photos of her on social media if she didn't take down a picture she posted of herself with rapper Nelly at a basketball game in April. Miss Jackson said her boyfriend of seven years had embarrassed and humiliated her with the Instagram post . She also claims that Mayweather threatened her at gunpoint and demanded she take her engagement ring off . Mayweather (pictured fighting Marcos Maidana) says the pair are 'public figures' and abortion is a 'public issue' In a tearful statement in September, Miss Jackson said: 'I have been embarrassed and humiliated more than I can ever imagine by Floyd, whom I once called my best friend and fiance.’ She added that she finally left him after seven years because she concluded he was abusive and would not change. Mayweather served two months in jail in 2012 after pleading guilty to reduced domestic battery charges stemming from a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack on his former girlfriend, Josie Harris, while two of their three children watched. Miss Jackson stood by him through the case and visited him in prison, but after he was released she was physically assaulted, her attorney Gloria Allred said. The champion boxer allegedly twisted his girlfriend's arm, choked her and snatched her phone. The lawsuit alleged that in April 2013, the 37-year-old star athlete assaulted his fiancée once again and 'bent her arm, restrained her, and pointed a gun at her foot asking ""Which toe do you want me to shoot?""' The husband-to-be then allegedly demanded that Jackson take off her 17-carat engagement ring at gunpoint. The lawsuit also accused Mayweather of arranging to have over $1million worth of Jackson's property taken from a storage unit.","Floyd Mayweather Jr defends discussing his ex-fiancee's abortion online .

"Five years ago she was a seemingly ordinary housewife, living in a modest house on a suburban street. Last night, British mother-of-two Lindsay Sandiford was languishing in a Bali jail cell after being arrested for allegedly smuggling £1.6million of cocaine. She has already faced the shame of being paraded before the media, bowing her head and hiding her tears with her hands. But the 56-year-old single mother's eventual fate could be far worse. Cocaine smuggling on such a scale - police claim they caught her with 4.7kg of the Class A drug - is punishable by death by firing squad. Back on the street that she once called home in the genteel town of Cheltenham, her former neighbours did not seem entirely surprised. One branded her the 'neighbour from hell' while others said her two boys, both now adults, were out-of-control. Scroll down for video . Distressed: Alleged drug trafficker identified as Lindsay Sandiford in front of the huge pile of cocaine at the Customs Office in Denpasar, Bali . Humiliated: The British housewife covered her face with her hand yesterday as she is paraded in front of the media. She was arrested at Bali's international airport after alighting from an aeroplane . Strict laws: Smuggling drugs on to the Indonesian island can result in a maximum penalty of death by firing squad . 'Neighbour from hell': Sandiford lived at this £275,000 property which she had rented in Cheltenham . 'They made a lot of racket with their coming and going. When they were kicked out, the house was empty for seven months. I think the boys were playing golf in there. 'She gave the impression when she first moved up here that she had friends in high places, and people like that were friendly to her but after a while that disintegrated and she went downhill.' Sandford is currently understood to be living in Redcar, Cleveland. She was picked up after entering Bali from Bangkok with the drugs in the lining of her suitcase, according to police. 'Conspirators': A younger British woman, centre, and three others suspected of being on hand to receive the drugs were arrested and dressed in prison uniforms with their faces covered by black balaclavas . Paraded: Three Britons and an Indian national were seen dressed in ill-fitting orange outfits and flip-flops after their arrests . Shamed: The suspected smugglers are lined up in front of the media, all with their faces covered aside from Mrs Sandiford . Another British woman and her husband, as well as a second British man and an Indian national were arrested later after Sandiford reportedly agreed to set up a sting operation. Police today partially identified the other members ofthe alleged syndicate as British nationals Julian A, his wife Rachel D and PaulB. They said Julian was the alleged boss of the syndicate. The Indian national arrested with them was identified as Nanda Gophal. Sandiford is understood to have taken part in a 'controlled delivery' at an undisclosed location on the paradise island. Balinese police yesterday paraded all five suspects at two press conferences in the capital city of Denpasar. Sandiford, who had allegedly been caught with 4.7 kilograms (11 pounds) of cocaine, covered her head and appeared to weep as she sat behind the Class A haul. She was dressed in a standard-issue orange T-shirt and still wearing her glasses and jewellery. Customs official Made Wijaya told reporters that Sandiford's innocent demeanour was just an act. 'Despite what you see as a seemingly unassuming appearance, we believe that she has been part of a international narcotics syndicate for a long time,' he said. 'This is a big international network.'. The package was cut open with a knife during the press conference to reveal white powder. The other four suspects were 'shown off' separately by police.  However, they had their faces covered with balaclavas. On show: The suspect accused of hiding 4.7kg (11lbs) of cocaine in her luggage is led through a custom office in Denpasar, Bali . All were dressed in orange prison uniforms while one wore shorts and green flip-flops under his overalls. The married couple, who own a villa in Bali, according to the The Jakarta Post, have only been identified as JAP and RLD. RLD shouted angrily, 'It's a fit-up', and indicated that the evidence had been planted. Sandiford was arrested on May 19 at Denpasar airport after arriving on a  Thai Airways flight from Bangkok, according to Mr Wijaya. Lindsay Sandiford appeared in her local newspaper, the Gloucestershire Echo, in July 2004 after a row with her local education authority over her troubled son Eliot, then 14. He was left without a school place after being suspended from Cheltenham Bournside School 16 times and eventually sent to a 're-integration unit'. After the story appeared Gloucestershire County Council quickly found Eliot a place at Coln House School. In July 2007 Sandiford appeared in the same newspaper after Eliot's £400 Xbox stopped working. She complained that the Game store in Cheltenham would not replace it - but she had no proof of purchase and claimed she paid for it in cash. The drugs were in the lining of her suitcase covered by water bottles. They were found after security staff put the luggage through an x-ray machine. When Sandiford was interviewed by police she broke down and claimed that her children, who live in the UK, had been threatened and that was the only reason she had agreed to smuggle the drugs. She subsequently consented to take part in the sting operation and delivered the cocaine to JAP, who was arrested. He directed officers to his villa in Tabanan where police discovered 48.94g of cocaine hidden in a black bag and arrested his wife, RLD. Using information extracted from these two suspects, police were able to capture the other two suspects the next day, kompas.com reported today. They arrested NA, the Indian national, in a villa in Badung, where they found 78 plastic bags filled with ecstasy. They arrested PB in a villa in Kuta with 3.36 grams of hashish. Police said they will continue to use Sandiford to lure out other members of the alleged Bali drug syndicate. Arrests: Sandiford was detained at Denpasar Airport on the paradise island of Bali, Indonesia . Island paradise: Bali was once a haven for drugs but in the past ten years the authorities have cracked down on the importation of narcotics and anyone found with more than a few grams of Class A drugs faces death . If convicted, all five face a maximum penalty of death by firing squad. Mr Wijaya said that Bali was working hard to stop international smugglers who brought drugs on to the island. Indonesia's drug scene is seen as something of a contradiction - as there is relatively high levels of illegal drug use and some of the strictest laws against them. The Indonesian authorities are ready to make an example of foreigners who use illegal drugs in their jurisdiction, with Bali's Kerobokan Prison housing plenty of non-Indonesians. Divided into three groups, category 1 drugs are recognised as 'therapeutically useless with a high potential for causing addiction'. They include cocaine and heroin. Sentences are the most strictest - with life imprisonment for possession, and the death penalty for convicted drug traffickers. Group 2 drugs, such as morphine and methadone, are seen as 'useful for therapeutic purposes, but dangerous due to their high addictive potential'. Possession is punishable by 3 to 10 years' imprisonment, and fines of around £40,000 to £400,000. Trafficking is punishable by 4 to 12 years' imprisonment and £60,000 to £600,000 fines. Group 3 drugs, such as codeine, are seen as 'therapeutically useful and moderately addictive'. Possession is punishable by 2 to 7 years' imprisonment, and a fine of £30,000 to £280,000. While trafficking is punishable by 3 to 10 years and fine of £40,000 to £400,000. 'If this woman, and anyone else who is subsequently charged, is found guilty, the punishment will be the death penalty,' he said. Bali regularly parades suspected drug smugglers - and their wares - in front of the press in a deliberate effort to shame them . Indonesia has extremely strict drug laws and convicted smugglers can be executed, with more than 140 people currently on death row, a third of them foreigners. Bali was once a haven for drugs but in the past ten years the authorities have cracked down on the importation of narcotics and anyone found with more than a few grams of Class A drugs faces death. One of the most famous Western detainees is 35-year-old Australian Schapelle Corby, who was convicted of smuggling 9.2lbs of marijuana on to the island. She is serving a 20-year sentence, which has been reduced in recent months, and she hopes to receive parole by 2015. Last November, a 14-year-old Australian boy was sentenced to two months in a brutal jail on the holiday island for alleged possession of marijuana. Two members of Australian drug smuggling gang the 'Bali Nine', arrested in 2005, are on death row, while seven others face lengthy jail terms. In February, 53-year-old Jack Walker from Greater Manchester, was given a reprieve when he was told he would not face the death penalty after allegedly being caught with a large quantity of crystal meth. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the arrest in Bali, and we stand ready to provide consular assistance.'

"It may come down to which he values more - his marriage or the future of the Today show. NBC host Matt Lauer's wife is said to have threatened him with divorce if newsreader Natalie Morales - who he is rumored to have had an affair with - takes Ann Curry's seat when her departure is announced at the end of the week.

'Walk-out': Natalie Morales on the Today show, left, is rumored to be threatening to quit if she doesn't get Ann's job, while Matt Lauer's wife Annette, both right, has threatened him with divorce if this happens . A source close to Lauer's wife Annette Roque told the The National Enquirer: 'When . she heard about Ann getting the boot, the first thing she told Matt was . that she didn't want him cozying up any closer to Natalie. 'In fact, Annette drew a line in the sand and said if he pushed show bosses to make Natalie his new co-host, she'd divorce him. 'Annette knows Matt is the key to the Today franchise and his bosses will put whoever he wants in the co-host chair.' Ms Morales has been with Today since 2006 and was . mentioned as a possible replacement for Meredith Vieira when she . stepped down from her co-anchor post last year. A source told the New York Post: 'This will be the second time [Ms Morales] has been passed over for the top job. And she’s not happy.' A NBC Universal representative had no comment on Ms Curry or her replacement, but said the talk of Ms Morales, 40, being disgruntled was 'totally untrue'.

Lauer, who is said to have signed a $25million deal earlier this year to stay with Today, was accused of having an affair with Ms Morales when they were covering the Winter Olympics in Italy in 2006. Though he denied claims, they were enough to prompt a then-pregnant Annette to file for divorce - which she later withdrew. However two years later, rumors abound that Lauer was the father of one of Ms Morales' children. She is married to Joe Rhodes and the couple have two children together. Annette lives in the couple's $3.5million house in the Hamptons with their three children. Lauer only sees them at weekends. Ms Curry, meanwhile, is expected to leave Today imminently, after a year on the job. During her time as co-anchor, the programme’s ratings have dropped - falling below those of ABC rival Good Morning America at times. NBC bosses are currently said to be locked in round-the-clock talks over the final details of Ms Curry’s exit.

"Break the cycle: Northants PCC Adam Simmonds claims the plan will help reoffenders stop crime . Feckless families should be put through ‘two years of hell’ in boot camps to turn their lives around, a crime tsar has urged. Layabout parents – like the characters in hit TV show Shameless – would undergo an ‘intensive’ programme to keep them out of crime and unemployment, says Adam Simmonds, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Northamptonshire. He said derelict Army bases could be used to house them while they were taught basic household skills, ordered to stop drinking and smoking, and given basic job training. Their children, meanwhile, would be educated properly. ‘You’ve got to break the cycle, tackle that poverty of ambition,’ Mr Simmonds told The Mail on Sunday. The PCC – whose pioneering plan to merge police and fire services won praise from Home Secretary Theresa May – insists his idea would be cheaper than repeatedly sending career criminals to jail and taking their offspring into care. An adult prison place costs £40,000 a year while it costs an estimated £140,000 a year to keep a young person in a children’s home. The Tory PCC said that in Kettering, Northants, police believe that just ten families are responsible for the majority of burglaries. He added: ‘The kids don’t go to school, none of them are in work. They cause the bulk of the problem – they go to prison, come out, generation after generation. ‘I’d like to take them out of Kettering, put them somewhere else to retrain the family. ‘We’ve got to be more radical than sending social workers to get mum and dad out of bed. Sending them to prison hasn’t worked so what else do you do?’ Under his plan, the most troubled . households would be told they could escape the cycle of reoffending and . unemployment by agreeing to go into a new residential programme. Disused Army bases would be redeveloped to house the families. He added: ‘The people who run this are going to put them through hell for two years. Layabouts: The hit TV show followed benefit scroungers. Plans would put people like this on a work programme . ‘There’s something in the idea of discipline, doing it in a different location and doing it as a family. Tell the man, you’re going to get up, have breakfast, go for a run, quit smoking and drinking.’ But criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher said: ‘It would be extremely difficult to administer and manage, and it may run counter to the European Convention on Human Rights.’ The Tory Government of the 1990s introduced boot camps for young offenders but research suggested they did not cut reoffending and were too costly.","Disused Army bases would be redeveloped into housing for families .

Northamptonshire PCC Adam Simmonds claims it will 'break the cycle'"
"Dr Helen Roberts's first reaction on discovering that her twin sons had chickenpox was to consider the logistics. The scenario will be familiar to lots of working parents: children with chickenpox are meant to stay at home until all the spots have crusted over and they  are no longer contagious, as the disease is dangerous to pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems. As the disease is often passed from sibling to sibling, this can mean a parent taking several weeks off work. The twins 5 days before Will (left) died as a result of contracting chickenpox when he was just two and a half. Will's twin brother Peter (right) also became critically Ill but survived . In fact, Helen's sons, Will and Peter, then aged two-and-a-half, had contracted the virus at the start of a family holiday on the Isle of Wight, which was a relief as it meant neither she nor her husband would need to take time off work to care for them. But while her otherwise healthy twins coped well for the first two days of their illness, on the third day Will developed a persistent high fever and started to vomit. 'He was just not himself, grizzly and saying he was hot and didn't feel well,' says Helen, a GP from Surrey. Strongly suspecting Will was seriously ill, she took him to hospital. 'When I arrived they told me they didn't want a child with chickenpox there and I should take him to the GP. 'It's the only time I've ever done it, but I said: “I am a GP, and I am worried about him.” The staff were really off with me, put me in a side room and left me there.' GP Dr Helen Roberts watched as doctors tried to save her son . Nearly four hours later, Will was seen by a consultant, who immediately realised the severity of his condition. The little boy was given anti-viral drugs via a drip, but as he was being prepared for transfer to a larger hospital in Southampton, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he died just as he was about to be put into an ambulance. 'They'd said they thought it would be nicer for him to be asleep for the transfer so they gave him an anaesthetic,'  says Helen. 'I'd told him he was going to have a little sleep and that when he woke up we would be home. He just said “Night, night, Mummy” and for that moment he seemed much brighter. 'It's a comfort to me because he was obviously not frightened. But it was shortly after then that the doctors realised they were losing him. I was in the room and watched as they tried to save him.' Will died from encephalitis - swelling of the brain - a rare complication of chickenpox that happens when the virus reaches the brain. It might have been treatable had he been given anti-viral drugs when he'd arrived at hospital. Helen, her husband John and their two older children's grief and distress was further compounded because the same day Will died, Peter became critically ill with encephalitis, too. 'There can't be many worse situations to be in as a parent,' she says. Peter survived, but for the next seven years suffered fits as a result of the damage caused by scarring to his brain. Now 16, he's not had a fit for six years and is a bright and sporty teenager. Helen still has no idea why her twins reacted so badly to the virus, but her experience was far from unique. 'After Will died I wrote a piece for Pulse, the GP magazine, to raise awareness of how serious chickenpox can be and got inundated by people who had their own horror stories,' she says. 'Until then, I thought we had been really, really unlucky, and then I realised it wasn't just us.' There are vaccines against chickenpox. Indeed, many experts argue in favour of vaccination - something that has been routine for children in the U.S. for 20 years. And no one is a more staunch supporter than Dr Roberts. While she's keen to stress that for the majority of children chickenpox is a mild illness, she feels people should know that for some youngsters it can be life-threatening, even fatal. However, the chickenpox vaccine is not available on the NHS for otherwise healthy youngsters, and can be done only privately, at up to £250 for each child. The Government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation last considered introducing the jab on the NHS in  2010, but ruled that it was not  cost-effective as so few children become dangerously ill. A  2007 study estimated chickenpox caused serious complications - including encephalitis, pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections - in fewer than one in 10,000 children.The researchers from Health Protection Scotland and the universities of London and Bristol found 112 children who had serious complications of chickenpox. Six deaths were reported. But excluding one baby that died in the womb and four that had existing chronic health problems, such as HIV or cerebral palsy, it seemed only one healthy child died, out of a total population of more than ten  million. Helen, however, argues that the real figures are likely to be much higher. 'I think there's a huge amount of under-reporting,' she says. 'My little boy's death certificate had ""viral illness"" written on it, so he wouldn't have hit the statistics even though it was entirely caused by chickenpox.' In her GP practice, she  typically sees two serious cases of chickenpox a year, slightly more than meningitis. The twins (Will on right) on holiday with sister Harriet, brother Lewis and mum . Last week an inquest into the death of seven-year-old Nicole Murphy from Stourport in Worcestershire heard how the otherwise healthy child may have died from a fit triggered by chickenpox just 24 hours after she broke out in spots. Another argument against widespread vaccination is that it could lead to a rise in the number of elderly people developing the often- debilitating condition shingles, where nerves and the skin around them become infected. This happens because the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox, remains in the body after you've had the illness. While most people won't get chickenpox again, it can be reactivated as shingles - commonly in old age or when your immune system is compromised. Little and frequent exposure to the . varicella-zoster virus through being around those with chickenpox keeps . the body primed to fight it. But if this is eliminated because of  widespread vaccination, the theory is that shingles will become more common. A persistently high fever of above 38.5 degrees. Vomiting , which is a sign the brain may be affected. Significant coughing, an indication the infection has spread to the lungs. Often these symptoms come four or five days after catching chickenpox. This is disputed by Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at Bristol University, specialising in invasive infections in children and clinical trials of vaccines. 'In the U.S., because of vaccination . chickenpox is virtually unheard of now and studies have revealed . that while shingles has increased a little, it is not nearly as much as . was predicted.' For Professor Finn the answer to whether to vaccinate against it is a straightforward 'yes'. 'It's . a horrible disease,' he says. 'Many of my colleagues - paediatricians - . bring their own children to my clinic to be vaccinated because they've . seen how it can be.' However, . Dr Richard Halvorsen, a GP and author of The Truth About Vaccines, . believes chickenpox is simply not serious enough to warrant a . vaccination programme. The twins at play (Will on right) about to reach their second birthday . He says the chickenpox jab is more sought after because it's an inconvenience for parents to take time off work. He does offer the chickenpox jab at his children's immunisation clinic BabyJabs, but admits: 'It would be low in my priorities. It's up to you, but it's generally a mild illness and your child is unlikely to come to any serious harm.' He believes natural immunity from . having a disease is always better and longer-lasting than from the . vaccine and says while protection from the chickenpox jab should last at . least ten years, it potentially just pushes the illness into an older . age bracket. And chickenpox can be very nasty for adults. Professor Finn disagrees: 'There are no advantages to getting it naturally.' As . for chickenpox 'parties' - where mothers encourage their children to . socialise with youngsters with chickenpox so they catch it - Helen . Roberts is far from convinced. 'I . try not to frighten mums who come to see me, but you just don't know if . your child is going to be the one who reacts in the way Will did.' Helen says she tries not to frighten mums who come to see her, but you just don't know if your child is going to be the one who reacts in the way Will did .","Dr Helen Roberts' twin son Will died of chickenpox when he was just five .

"Not so long ago, jams, pickles and sauces were simply stored in the kitchen cupboard. No one ever seemed to get ill, despite jars of marmalade, mustard and ketchup remaining at room temperature for months on end. These days, the very same products come with clear instructions to refrigerate them immediately after opening. Scroll down for video . Cool idea? Do you need to keep all condiments in the fridge? Has something radical changed in their formulation, something so drastic we're risking our health if they aren't kept chilled? Or are we falling foul of yet another example of today's overzealous health-and-safety culture? Here, microbiologist for Initial Hygiene Dr Peter Barratt gives his verdict on just how chilled out we can be when it comes to keeping our condiments in the cupboard. Times have changed: Ketchup has less salt than in the past . Instructions: After opening, refrigerate and eat within eight weeks. Dr Barratt says: 'No one kept tomato ketchup in the fridge a decade ago, but then it contained more salt. In recent years, food manufacturers have had to cut the amount of salt, a natural preservative, because of its links to high blood pressure. 'Sodium benzoate, a preservative that used to feature in some brands of ketchup, has also been dropped by manufacturers because of its links to hyperactivity in children. 'The vinegar and tomatoes in ketchup give it a high level of acidity, which slows down bacterial growth. 'However, while ketchup could keep safely in the cupboard for a couple of weeks, it's best kept in the fridge and eaten within the stated eight-week period.' VERDICT: Refrigerate. Instructions: Once opened, keep in the fridge and use within six weeks. Dr Barratt says: 'The acidity of vinegar preserves pickles and chutneys by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. However, this pickle seems to take a belt-and-braces approach to preservation by using two different vinegars, lemon juice and salt - even the apple is preserved before it is added. 'The instructions to refrigerate and use within six weeks are unnecessary in my opinion. 'Pickle should be fine at cool, but ambient, temperatures for six weeks, and probably longer, especially if you use the squeezy bottle version, which minimises the potential for contamination. 'Refrigeration isn't necessary, but if chilled it could last for up to 12 weeks.' VERDICT: Store in the cupboard. Jam is safe at room temperature for six months after opening . Instructions: Refrigerate after opening. Dr Barratt says: . 'Thanks to their fruit content, jams and marmalades are naturally . acidic. This helps  to inhibit the growth of any bacteria that might . cause a mild stomach upset or allergic reaction. 'Moulds are more resistant to acidity, however, which is why fungi sometimes grow on opened jam. 'Normally . jam does not need chilling if it is consumed within three to six . months. However, always use clean utensils to remove jam from the pot. 'Dirty . knives or spoons can spark mould growth - which, even if removed, can . diffuse into the jam beneath, leading to stomach upsets or, in some . cases, an allergic reaction.' VERDICT: Room temperature, but eat within six months. Instructions: Best-before date but no storage instructions. Dr Barratt says: 'Soy sauce often contains potassium sorbate preservative, which inhibits yeasts and moulds from forming and ruining the product. 'It also contains lactic acid, which stops bacterial growth. For an item like this not to have a recommendation to use within a few months of opening seems a little careless, however. 'Once it has been opened, over time micro-organisms such as Staphylococcus bacteria, which can cause a mild upset stomach, or even an allergic reaction, will grow. 'I would be happy to use this within three months of opening if it had been kept in a cupboard - six months with refrigeration. VERDICT: Refrigerate. Always use a clean utensil to remove jam and peanut butter from jars to prevent contamination . Instructions: Store at room temperature. Dr Barratt says: 'This spread contains largely natural ingredients - peanuts, oil, sugar and salt. 'As it's not packed with preservatives, the peanut butter could start to degrade, ruining the product and risking tummy upsets. 'This is unlikely to be a cause for concern if it is used within three months of opening. 'It does not need refrigeration - but, as with jams and other spreads, always use a clean utensil to remove the peanut butter from the jar to avoid contamination. VERDICT: Room temperature, but eat within three months. Instructions: Refrigerate after opening and use within three months. Dr Barratt says: . 'This is made from simple ingredients - water, mustard flour, sugar, . salt, wheat flour and spices. Some citric acid, a natural preservative, . has been added to hinder bacterial growth. 'The . storage advice is sensible, and as mustard is often eaten with meat it . is important to always use a clean serving utensil. Dipping into the jar . with cutlery covered in meat juices could lead to bacterial growth in . the mustard and, in the worst cases, food poisoning.' VERDICT: Refrigerate. Instructions: Keep refrigerated for three months after opening - do not freeze. Dr Barratt says: 'The long list of ingredients, in particular eggs and cream, indicate it would never be sensible to store this at room temperature. 'Acidity, in the form of lemon juice, has been added to slow bacterial growth, but eggs and cream can spoil quickly and cause severe problems if they become infected. 'The maker's instructions should be adhered too strictly.' VERDICT: Refrigerate. Instructions: Store in a cool, dark place - it doesn't have to  be refrigerated. Dr Barratt says: 'Just three ingredients here - vinegar, red pepper and salt. The only preservatives are vinegar and salt, which are adequate. 'I would err on the side of caution and use this within eight weeks if unrefrigerated, or  within six months if  kept in the fridge, because, over time, some bacteria can tolerate and grow in acidic and salty conditions. 'The label says the colour can change with no impact on the sauce, but this means chemical changes are occurring, so the sauce is not the same as when it was opened, even though it may be safe to consume.' VERDICT: Refrigerate.","In the past, most condiments were stored in cupboards .
But they now come with warnings to refrigerate immediately after opening .
Is it overzealous health and safety?

"Sir Richard Branson's Caribbean island home that was destroyed by fire in a suspected lightning strike two years ago has been rebuilt and is now ready to welcome its first guests. Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet had to carry Sir Richard's 90-year-old mother, Eve, to safety when flames tore through The Great House on Necker Island in August 2011. Now the house, which Sir Richard lets out, has been re-modelled on the original design, with some new innovations and a 1,500 sq ft master suite.

'The . brand new Great House is the heart of the island and I'm thrilled with . the results. This signals a new dawn for Necker, which I'm very excited . about.' Set in the . Caribbean, Richard Branson's holiday home is a by-word for luxury and . has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities and royalty. The . private island house, which Branson has owned since 1979, boasts eight . guest rooms, each with a balcony, king-sized bed and en-suite bathroom. The master suite has been . specifically designed to give panoramic views of the Caribbean, the . Atlantic Ocean and neighbouring islands. It includes a two-person Jacuzzi, stand-alone outdoor bath and a kitchenette area with a fully-stocked fridge. The resort can be hired exclusively for . up to 30 adults but this kind of luxury comes at a price per night that . few people earn in a year. Nice if you can get it: For those that can afford to rent the island, guests have the use of the swimming pool . Opulent: As well as sleeping 20 people in the Great House, guests also have access to the beach houses (pictured) Romantic: For even more privacy, guests can choose to stay in the secluded beach house on the 74-acre island that straddles the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean .

An exclusive week's rental, that includes six individual Bali Houses dotted around the island and two tennis courts, costs around £270,000. The . Great House was gutted by the fire on August 22, 2011, which was . believed to have been caused by lightning from Tropical Storm Irene. Kate Winslet, who has since married Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll, was in the house at the time and helped carry the business tycoon's 90-year-old mother Eve. He told ITV News shortly after the fire: 'She [Winslet] said it was like being on . a film set where you’re waiting for the word 'cut’, but it just didn’t . come.' The Virgin boss said guests, including his son Sam and daughter Holly, were woken at about 5am after hearing loud bangs as gas canisters exploded. He said: 'It was terrifying for me . because my daughter and nephews, nieces, friends were all in the house, so I just ran, naked, towards the house to try to . make sure I could get people out.' Phoenix from the ashes: Sir Richard Branson, pictured with his wife Joan, and daughter Holly, said he is 'thrilled' with the refurbished house . Devastated: The Great House was totally gutted in the 2011 blaze that is believed to have been caused by a lightning strike .

The rest of the island has remained open to visitors since the fire. New . features include an expansive outdoor terrace with hammocks and sofas . and a large dining table for guests to eat together al fresco. There is also a fully-stocked bar for cocktails and a crow’s nest on the roof has amazing views. Branson was only 28 when he bought the island for £180,000 and turned it into the superstar resort. Necker Island - aptly for the Virgin boss - is located in the British Virgin Islands. It is a surrounded by turquoise . waters, coral reefs and white sandy beaches and as well as celebrity . guests is also home to diverse wildlife including flamingos, iguanas, . lemurs and giant tortoises. Powerful friends: Sir Richard Branson has known to have hosted Prince Harry and Tony Blair at Necker Island .

Prince's favourite: Prince William (centre) and Prince Harry (right) arrives at Necker Island by boat during the 1989 trip . Over the years, it has attracted royalty such as Princess Diana, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, who visited during her split from Prince William, who took advantage of the privacy the island provides. The list of megastars from Hollywood and the world of sport to have holidayed there is seemingly endless and includes Harrison Ford, Robert De Niro, Oprah Winfrey, the Rolling Stones and the likes of John McEnroe and Novak Djokovic. More surprisingly, it has also been a haven to some of the biggest names in politics such as Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair. Sir Richard Branson, pictured with his infant son Sam on Necker Island in 1986, bought it when he was just 28 . The 74-acre island of Necker is part of the British Virgin Islands and sits on the boundary of the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean. It was named after the 17th century Dutch squadron commander Johannes de Neckere but remained uninhabited during the early 20th century. It was bought by Sir Richard Branson in 1979 after he heard some of the Virgin Islands were being sold. Branson was just 28 - and only six years after starting the Virgin Group. He offered a very low bid of £100,000, which was rejected, but eventually secured the paradise island for £180,000. He was forced to build a resort within five years of taking ownership, otherwise the government said it would be taken back by the state. According to reporters, Branson spent about £6.5million creating the luxury resort over the next three years. It has played host to an array of the world's most powerful, rich and famous. Princess Diana chose the island for her holiday with Prince William and Prince Harry. It was also a haven of privacy for the Duchess of Cambridge when she fled Britain during her temporary split from Prince William. Google founder Larry Page even chose it for his wedding to Lucy Southworth in 2007. It was also the site of Sir Richard's daughter Holly Branson's wedding to shipbroker Fred Andrews just months after devastating fire. Her wedding was on the same spot as that of Sir Richard and his wife Joan Templeman's in 1989 when Holly was eight and her brother Sam was four. In April 2011, Branson offered the island to his close friend Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for the royal couple's honeymoon.","Actress Kate Winslet rescued Sir Richard's 90-year-old mother from blaze after apparent lightning strike in 2011 .

"A woman paralyzed from the neck down and her able-bodied husband have opened up about their loving 31-year marriage that has withstood bouts of depression and most recently, breast cancer. Joni Eareckson from Agoura Hill, California, who has been wheelchair-bound since the age of 17, joked that she knew Ken Tada was the one when he willingly changed her urine bag on the first date. Recalling the incident, she told True Woman: 'As Ken was emptying my bag on [a] tree . . . he started humming this little ditty: ""Where Joni goes, nothing grows."" Right away, I thought, Here is a man I could like. [He] had a real sense of humor about my disability.' Making it work: Joni Eareckson Tada, who is paralyzed from the neck down, and her able bodied husband, Ken, have opened up about their loving 31-year marriage . Mr Tada, 66, said that he also felt instant attraction. He told the Christian Post: 'I have to say I had dated some women in the past, I mean prior to meeting Joni. Joni was different. There was a deepness to our conversations that I can't explain. 'It just was there and I fell in love with her: her outward appearance, but her interior beauty was well.' After a whirlwind courtship the couple tied the knot in 1982 and a special ramp was built in the church enabling Mrs Eareckson Tada to get up to the alter. But not everything has been rosy since, however, and in their new memoir, Joni & Ken: An Untold Love Story the couple detail some of the darker moments. Newlyweds: The couple celebrate their wedding in 1982 with a piece of cake . Indeed, Mr Tada explains that a year into married life he realized that being a full-time carer while working as a high school history teacher was exhausting and mentally challenging. At home he had to remove his wife's make-up, help her with routine toileting and turn her in bed at night because she couldn't do it for herself. He also had to cook, clean and do the all of the shopping. 'I fell in love with her: her outward appearance, but her interior beauty was well' 'I still loved Joni, but one night I sat . down on the bed and just said, ""Joni, I'm feeling trapped. I'm feeling . like all of this is just coming down on my shoulders here,""' he told the . Christian Post. Mrs Eareckson Tada, 63, said that she was angry at first, but understood why he felt 'trapped'. 'I knew when Ken said that he wasn't saying that he didn't like me, that he no longer found me appealing or it was that he didn't want to be with me,' she said. 'It's just the circumstances connected with my disability were so overwhelming. 'I lived in this wheelchair . . . and I know what it feels like to be overwhelmed by this disability. I know what it feels like to just want to disappear, to feel trapped.' Strong bond: The couple's marriage has withstood bouts if depression and most recently breast cancer . Split-second decision: On July 30, 1967, Ms Eareckson Tada dived headfirst into Chesapeake Bay in Maryland but misjudged the water depth and severed her spinal cord . They worked things through and agreed to get additional help. As a teenager, Ms Eareckson Tada's hobbies included riding horses, hiking, tennis, and swimming. But on July 30, 1967, she dived . headfirst into Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and severed her spinal cord after misjudging the water . depth. The accident left her . completely . paralyzed. During two years . of painful rehabilitation she began the long process of adapting to her . wheelchair-bound life. 'I still loved Joni, but one night I sat . down on the bed and just said, Joni, I'm feeling trapped' Despite experiencing anger, . depression, suicidal thoughts,and religious doubts, she managed to push . through, even learning how to paint with a brush held . between her teeth. To . date, she has written over forty books, recorded several musical albums, . starred in an autobiographical movie of her life, and is an advocate . for disabled people. In her early thirties, after being single for a decade, Ms Eareckson Tada met Mr Tada during a 'boring' sermon at a local church. From there they kept running into each other and eventually arranged to meet-up. 'I was nervous when I met him,' Ms Eareckson Tada told Today. 'I had lived enough years as a single girl. I was traveling a . great deal and enjoyed my freedom. No one had ever asked me out on a . date.' New skills: After her injury Mrs Eareckson Tada learned how to paint and draw with tool held between her teeth . But the date went without a hitch and less than a year later they got engaged. 'I was blown away with this good-looking . guy who was strong and handsome and shared the same values and . convictions as I,' Mrs Eareckson Tada recounted. 'I readily said yes.' Her disability has not stood in the way of . their physical intimacy, she said - 'but we understand that there is . more to romance than what happens below the waist.' She tried unsuccessfully to become pregnant early on in their marriage. 'I was blown away with this good-looking . guy who was strong and handsome and shared the same values as I' The Tadas' new book is not arranged in chronological order and starts with Ms Eareckson Tada's battle with Stage III breast cancer. She was diagnosed in 2010 after discovering a lump on her chest and went through a mastectomy and months of chemotherapy. Mr Tada explained that the cancer bought them closer together and he saw his wife as 'a real warrior and a fighter.' They say that they are troubled by the fact that so many marriages fail today. Celebrating the bond he has with his wife, Mr Tada concluded: 'Joni is my biggest supporter. 'She is in my corner and my best friend. She always looks out for my interests and makes me love her that much more.'","Joni Eareckson from Agoura Hill, California, has been wheelchair-bound since the age of 17, after severing her spinal cord in a diving accident that left her completely paralyzed .

"Award-winning actress Samantha Morton, pictured, has spoken out for the first time about sexual abuse she suffered while in care as a teenager . Award-winning actress Samantha Morton has spoken out for the first time about sexual abuse she suffered while in care as a teenager. The Bafta and Golden Globe winner told how she was aged just 13 when she reported abuse by two men, both residential care workers in Nottingham, to both police and social services but neither authority formally investigated. She said she decided to waive her right to anonymity in the wake of a report detailing sexual exploitation of 1,400 children over a period of 16 years in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Speaking to the Guardian, the 37-year-old said she fears the issue is more widespread, calling for investigations in other places, including in her home town. 'I just wanted to go public with this, to say, we know it's rife but why are there not further investigations into other areas? It isn't just Rotherham, I'm sure it's not just Rotherham,' she told the paper. 'There was no support, no offer of counselling, no wanting to delve deeper ... Maybe they just assumed I had been abused already, or was being, anyway. 'A lot of people who abused my friends were people in very, very top jobs within the social services. Nottingham in the 80s was rife with that.' The actress revealed she had recently spoken to Nottinghamshire Police about her original complaint and was told the report contained only a reference to 'frolicking' and no sexual abuse. Nottinghamshire Police Superintendent Helen Chamberlain told the paper she had spoken to Morton about the allegations but they had not amounted to a criminal offence and the actress had not reported them as one. Meanwhile a Nottinghamshire County Council spokesman said they were hoping to speak to her about her concerns. In 2009 the double Oscar-nominee, who also starred alongside Tom Cruise in Minority Report, backed a Government campaign to recruit social workers in the wake of the Baby P scandal.

"City officials say a woman who has called 911 thousands of times should be given a tax-payer funded home carer because it would be cheaper than sending an ambulance to her house every time she has an 'emergency.' Martha Rigsby collapsed to the ground for the first time in 1977 and called 911 for help. Over a period of more than 35 years, she's phoned the emergency line thousands of times. Despite the constant calls, Rigsby has insisted in court that she doesn't need an at-home carer. Prolific: Martha Rigsby talks with her lawyer Vickey Wright-Smith in Washington, DC. Officals have filed guardianship petition to take over the medical affairs of Rigsby, the most frequent 911 caller in the history of the city . 911 Emergency: Ms Rigby has called the emergency services around 7,000 times over a period of 35 years . Rigsby's constant dialing of the . three-digit emergency number for help puts a strain on services that . are already stretched to the limit. City officials say Ms Rigsby should instead be given a tax-payer funded aide to calm her medical worries. According to the Washington Post, it would still be cheaper than sending an ambulance each time she has one of her 'episodes'. In the past year alone she has called on 226 occasions and been taken to hospital by ambulance 117 times. Even the fire-fighters in her district know her date of birth and Social Security number by heart. Ms. Rigsby has become the most frequent 911 user in Washington D.C. history and has been dubbed a ‘super user’. Now city officials have met to try and figure out a way to curb her behaviour. The situation has led to the first known attempt in the city to seek guardianship for a serial 911 caller. The Department of Behavioral Health believe that Ms. Rigsby, 58, is bipolar and borderline personality disorder. Hypochondriac? In the past year alone she has called on 226 occasions and been taken to hospital by ambulance 117 times . These are ‘uncharted waters,’ said David Miramontes, medical director of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department. Public documents reveal not only the extent of her 911 habits and medical problems but they also reveal the concern shared by Washington D.C. officials on the impact of one woman’s troubles. Despite being covered to some degree on insurance policies, she has an outstanding balance of $61,366.33 owed to the D.C. Fire and EMS for ambulance transports. Each trip, over the last five years works out to be around $478. Over the last two weeks, the D.C. superior court has been deciding whether Ms Rigsby is able to care for herself. The city would like to see a health aide look after her and taking responsibilities such as filing prescriptions. However it might still not solve the problem of calling 911 because the aide would not be a live-in carer. Oh it's you again! The operators at the 911 call center know Ms. Rigby's address and even her social security number off by heart she calls so regularly . After a court session this week, Ms Rigsby seemed taken aback by a question about her calls to 911. ‘Well, I don’t do it on purpose,’ she responded. According to testimony during the court hearings, Ms Rigsby’s calls follow the same general pattern. She feels faint and collapses. About 40 per cent of the time, she dials 911 on her own. Other times, she’s out in the District when passersby see her fall and call for help, the testimony indicated. About 55 per cent of the time, she refuses to be transported in an ambulance and signs a waiver allowing emergency responders to leave. Court proceedings won’t resume until January, when Rigsby will have had a neuropsychological assessment, attorneys in the case said. Several mental-health experts have already been called to testify. Fear: Ms. Rigby calls because she feels she needs to go to hospital, but the real worry is that an ambulance could be diverted away from a call from someone who is seriously ill . According to court records, Abayomi Jaji, a psychiatrist with the city’s Department of Behavioral Health, said that Rigsby continues ‘to place herself in real danger of bodily injuries from falls under the claim of ‘seizures’ or ‘Narcolepsy,’ which have never been correlated with medical findings.’ Jaji also said that Rigsby lacks the mental capacity to take care of herself as evidenced by ‘almost every other day calls to 911.’ Rigsby first remembers passing out in 1977. She thinks the spells ‘could be stress,’ according to the examiner’s report. ‘There will come a time when one of these [frequent 911 callers] will call and they will cost someone else their life,’ said Jim Dunford, the emergency medical director for San Diego and a known expert on frequent 911 callers told the Washington Post. ‘All cities are going through a similar experience of how do we deal with this small subset of people,’ he said. Officials with the District’s fire and EMS department have not done any studies of whether Ms Rigsby’s calls have led to problems for other callers, nor have they examined her financial impact on the system. When Ms Rigsby calls 911, the reported symptoms ‘generally prompt the highest level of response,’ including the first available paramedic and a separate ambulance for transport, testified Rafael Sa’adah, the fire department’s battalion fire chief for emergency medical services. ‘Our default assumption must be that she is suffering from a life-threatening medical condition,’ Sa’adah said. Although Ms. Rigsby has been known to paramedics for decades, city officials increased their focus on her in December after she called 911 and threatened to harm herself, according to court testimony. Even after a group involving representatives from several city agencies suggested Ms Rigsby should have a home health aide or even use a wheel chair, she declined their offers. Now she has an added worry – that the volume of calls might lead to criminal charges. She has been handcuffed before. ‘I’ve been through a lot,’ she said. ‘I’m surprised they haven’t put me in jail by now.’","Martha Rigsby has called 911 thousands of times over three decades .

"Jurors on Monday were shown the horrific moment a 76-year-old Dallas grandmother and convenience store clerk was doused in lighter fluid and set on fire during an early morning hold-up. On the first day of the capital murder trial of Matthew Johnson, one member of the jury covered his mouth and another rubbed his hands together as they watched Nancy Harris frantically try to extinguish the fire that would ultimately kill her. The shocking surveillance footage came as Harris' distraught son, Scott Harris, described in testimony the heartbreak he felt as he was told while getting ready for church that his mother had suffered burns to 40 per cent of her body in the senseless attack. She died several days later. Scroll down for video . Horror: Jurors were today shown the horrific moment a 76-year-old Dallas convenience store clerk Nancy Harris, pictured, was doused in lighter fluid and set alight during a hold-up . He said Harris - who had three other children - didn't want to be kept alive if she couldn't live as she had, so she was taken off life support and died five days later. 'She could not communicate,' Scott Harris said, adding that his mother was sedated. Johnson, 38, has confessed to the senseless slaying of the mother-of-four on a Sunday morning in May 2012, Garland police say. Prosecutors are pushing for the death sentence in the disturbing case. Death penalty: Matthew Johnson, 38, is on trial for capital murder in the slaying . The footage, from a surveillance camera at the Fina Whip-In at the corner of Broadway and Colonel Drive in Garland, shows Johnson pour lighter fluid from a water bottle over Harris' head. Before he set her alight, he stood behind her taking cigarettes and a lighter as she opened the cash register. However, as she struggles to open it, Johnson attempts to pull a ring off her right hand but it won't budge. He licks his finger and tries again but it still won't move. He tries once more, this time successfully. He is then seen walking away from the store as an orange glow becomes visible behind him. The video shows Harris on fire for more than two minutes, according to Dallasnews.com. She desperately tries to put out the fire in a sink but when she cannot she walks outside to call for help. According to testimony, two police officers who spotted the blaze and heard Harris' screams used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire. When paramedics arrived a short time later, the woman begged them to administer aid, 'help me, help me, help me,' she told them. Incredibly, she was able to describe her attacker. Johnson was arrested shortly after in . a nearby neighborhood when residents began to call 911 to report that a . man was trying to break into their homes. Harris' ring was found in . Johnson's pocket, police said. Facing death: Johnson, 38, pictured in court on Monday, has confessed to the senseless slaying of the mother-of-four on a Sunday morning in May 2012, Garland police say . Crime scene: The footage, from a surveillance camera at the Fina Whip-In at the corner of Broadway and Colonel Drive in Garland, pictured, shows Johnson pour lighter fluid from a water bottle over Harris' head . Prosecutors showed a second video to jurors on Monday, with Johnson sitting in the back of a patrol car shirtless and behaving erratically. Officer Billy Coffey, who is driving Johnson to jail, tells Johnson that he is accused of capital murder, to which the suspect responds. 'Capital murder? What you talking about, man?' Johnson asks int eh video. 'Capital murder on who, man?' According to Dallasnews.com, Johnson later tells Coffey that the police only caught him because he wanted to be caught. Harris suffered burns over 40 per cent of her body.

"Complaint: A woman has accused physiotherapist Mark Jones, pictured, of sexually touching her during a massage in a Welsh hospital . An NHS physiotherapist massaged a woman until she reached a sexual climax before telling her: 'Now you're really relaxed', a disciplinary hearing was told today. Mark Jones, 41, is accused of sexually stimulating the woman when he was massaging his patient - who had only gone in with a sore neck and shoulder pain. The woman lay on his treatment table as he massaged her intimately for 30 seconds until she reached orgasm. The tribunal was told Jones then remarked to her: 'Now you are really relaxed.' The patient, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to police the same day to complain about her treatment. She said she felt 'numb' after the assault in a busy hospital - and didn’t know why she hadn’t told him to stop. The woman, who appeared via videolink, said: 'I felt trapped and uncomfortable. I didn’t know what to do and I couldn’t believe what was happening. 'He came into the cubicle and this time he went straight for my pubic area - there was no messing around at all. 'I did climax and he was aware of that because my body physically moved. That is when he said: “Now you are really relaxed”. I didn’t know what to do. 'I was just so frightened of making a fuss and making a scene. I didn’t know if I screamed what his reaction would be. 'I trusted him and I trusted the fact that I was in a safe public space with someone I had been referred to by the NHS.' But she was persuaded by police not to take Mr Jones to trial because the stress of giving evidence in court would be too great. Presenting officer Chloe Binding said: 'Detective Constable Gary Watts said it was her word against his and the process of giving evidence in a criminal trial would be difficult. 'The patient said she felt unable to continue with the police complaint and signed a document saying she would not go further with it.' The Health and Care Professions Council hearing in Cardiff was told the woman suffered from fibromyalgia - which causes muscle pain across the body. She was referred by her GP for physiotherapy treatment with Mr Jones at Ystradgynlais Community Hospital, near Swansea, in South Wales. The woman, who appeared via videolink, said she was persuaded not to take Mr Jones to court after police said giving evidence would be difficult coming from a small rural area. She said: 'I went to see DC Gary Watts in the police station and he said that a second complaint had been made by another patient. 'Trusted': The alleged incident took place at Ystradgynlais Community Hospital, near Swansea . 'He told me the identity of the other woman and I couldn’t understand why he did that. 'He told me that the interview with her would not be valid evidence in court and so therefore it would be my word only against Mark Jones. 'The CPS were willing to take the case on and I had to go through with the decision to face Mr Jones in court where I would probably find it very stressful. 'I was advised that details would probably be made public - that there would be a chance that I would be made to look like I was compliant. I was advised that living in a very small community can have an effect. I decided that I couldn’t go through with the stress of going to court.' The hearing was read the end of woman’s police statement written up by DC Gary Watts. It ended by saying: 'All things considered I don’t think I am strong enough to go through a court case. I maintain that Mark Jones sexually assaulted me.' The woman had been treated by Mr Jones for six months before the alleged sex attack in January 2012. She said she went with neck and shoulder pains but as her treatment sessions went on Mr Jones began to focus more on her 'pubic area'. The woman said Jones had got 'more and more confident' during the treatments until he sexually assaulted. The HPCP conduct and competence hearing was told Jones was accused of three sexual offences and a catalogue of other charges related to poor practice and record keeping. Jones denied any sexual touching took place but admitted a series of failings in his physiotherapy practices and record keeping. The hearing continues.","Woman, unnamed for legal reasons, says she was touched in hospital .

"A 26-year-old who was desperate to have children was killed by her IVF treatment just weeks after getting pregnant. Emma Draper, from Dagenham in Essex, had been trying for a baby for two years with husband Peter so they were delighted when the IVF worked almost immediately. Four days after the good news, however, she was taken to hospital with stabbing chest pains and died from thrombosis in hospital when several of her organs failed. Devastated: Emma Draper's husband Peter said he did not even want to live after her death . At risk: The 26-year-old had a pre-existing blood condition, which left her in danger of life-threatening clots . Her devastated widower Peter, 33, said: 'When she died, I kissed her on the forehead and said, ""I love you so much. I always will."" 'I felt as if my life had ended too - I didn’t want to live without my Emma.' Tests later revealed that the death of the former personal shopper was . triggered by complications with medication she was taking for a . pre-existing blood condition. Mr Draper claims they were never warned of the danger and he is now taking legal action against the doctors involved. The couple began IVF treatment on a GP's recommendation at St Bart’s . Hospital in London in June 2010, after struggling to conceive, even . after Mrs Draper lost five stone in a bid to improve their chances. She received an embryo transfer on June . 11 and the couple were over the moon when a pregnancy test came back . positive 14 days later. Fatal stroke: Mr Draper is taking legal action against doctors because his wife died after switching blood-thinning drugs in the hope of a safer pregnancy . The young woman had suffered all her life with anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), which makes the blood prone to dangerous clotting. Her family claim she was never warned that complications in IVF can prove fatal in sufferers of APS. She had been taking anti-coagulant drug warfarin since she had a clot in her lung in . 2001. Warfarin is known . to have a damaging effect on a developing foetus so she was switched to a heparin drug for the duration of her pregnancy. This, however, was not as effective as Warfarin at thinning her blood. Just four days after the positive pregnancy test, Mrs Draper was admitted to specialist heart hospital Papworth Hospital in Cambridge. She slipped into a coma, her legs turned blue and she suffered a massive stroke, which left doctors no choice but to turn off her life support machine on July 10, 2010. Happy times: The Drapers had been trying for a baby for two years before turning to IVF on the recommendation of her GP . An inquest in February 2011 ruled that a combination of antiphospholipid syndrome and IVF meant Emma developed the very rare catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome - a chance of less than one in 100. The coroner at Poplar Coroner’s Court ruled: 'Emma Louise Draper died from Natural Causes, which presented as a rare complication of pre-existing disease and fertility treatment.' Mr Draper, a van driver who is still coming to terms with the death of his wife, added: 'I can’t help feeling angry. 'Blood specialists warned us there was a risk of clotting from changing Emma’s medication, but nobody told us that IVF could be life-threatening. The personal shopper died from thrombosis after going to hospital with chest pains and falling into a coma . 'It’s meant to be something that brings life into this world, not takes it away. 'Emma was sensible - she would never have had IVF if she’d known that there was a chance she might die. 'We would have adopted.' St Bart’s Hospital said in a statement: 'This is a tragic case and our thoughts are with the Draper family at this difficult time. 'An inquest held in February 2011 found that Emma died from natural causes, which presented as a rare complication of pre-existing disease and fertility treatment.'","Emma Draper, 26, was taken to hospital with stabbing chest pains .

"Fated: Anya Ponorovskaya and civil-rights lawyer Wylie Stecklow 'married' on a Mexican beach in 2010 in front of 100 guests . A Manhattan wife claims her husband tricked her into thinking they were married and now wants to kick her out of their $2 million apartment. Noted fashion designer Anya Ponorovskaya and lawyer Wylie Stecklow married on a Mexico beach in 2010 and a few months later the couple bought a $1 million home in Tribeca, in New York City. Ponorovskaya paid part of the mortgage, but Stecklow said that she shouldn't worry about her name not being on the deed because they were legally married. However, when Ponorovskaya, 44, filed for divorce in 2013, she was stunned to learn that her marriage was possibly a sham and that her money was locked into the apartment - which Stecklow will not sell. Now the . couple are both living in the same apartment in War of the Roses style . acrimony while Stecklow, 48, tries to evict his ex-wife. 'He tricked me into removing my name from the deed. He said we’re married and it doesn’t matter,' she said to The New York Post. 'I . spent years renovating and almost drowned my own business. With the . amount of physical labor I put into this loft, it would make me a slave . to just walk away.' Ponorovskaya's lawyer, Rita Warner, tried to argue in court last month that the marriage is legitimate. Stecklow's cousin, who is an Internet minister, officiated at the Jewish-style ceremony that had a chuppah canopy and the ceremonial breaking of glass by the groom. 'He’s very, very greedy,' Ponorovskaya said about her husband's alleged trickery. Angry couple: Michael Douglas and Kathleen turner in the iconic chandelier scene from the divorce horror story 'War of the Roses' about a once-happy couple who refuse to each leave the home they built together . However, a Manhattan judge ruled that the Mexico marriage was not legally binding because the couple didn't even get a basic marriage license. 'The law would undoubtedly come as a surprise to all those couples who patiently wait on the long lines at the Marriage License Bureau . . . to learn that, despite the instructions they were given, a marriage license is not really a requirement for marrying after all,' the judge wrote. Undeterred, Ponorovskaya is arguing that Stecklow was cruel in his deception and that she should at least have her investment returned. 'He used influence over me to try to gain a Tribeca apartment that is skyrocketing in value by the day,' said the owner of two high-end boutiques in New York and one in Miami to The New York Post. Stecklow’s lawyer, Dave Thompson, said to The New York Post, 'In the absence of a marriage, the courts generally do not, and should not, get involved in the parties’ private affairs.'","Noted fashion designer Anya Ponorovskaya, 44, and lawyer Wylie Stecklow, 48, 'married' in Mexico in 2010 .

"Tens of thousands of employees at John Lewis and Waitrose will receive compensation from a £40 million pot after an error with holiday pay was discovered. The John Lewis Partnership said 69,000 of its 'partners' were receiving the additional sums in this month's wages - representing an average £580 per employee - after the miscalculations dating back to 2006. The employee-owned retailer said the mistake was spotted during a review earlier this year. An employee had also pointed out the error at around the same time. Payout: Tens of thousands of employees at John Lewis and Waitrose will receive compensation from a £40 million pot after an error with holiday pay was discovered . Today's announcement relates to the . majority of the 85,500 partners who work at John Lewis department stores . and the group's supermarket arm Waitrose. Most of those affected work on shop floors, call centres or in distribution warehouses. The business said individual payments . would vary according to pay and shift patterns, with more than half of . recipients being given less than £120, but some receiving a few thousand . pounds. Those who have left through redundancy, illness or retirement will also be contacted by the group, it said. But workers who voluntarily left the . company may feel aggrieved after the company decided it would not . compensate them even if they had been employed by John Lewis Partnership . until recently. The problem related to employment legislation, which means that when calculating holiday pay, sums ought to be based on an average weekly wage including any premiums such as extra cash for Sundays or bank holidays - rather than just on normal hours. Compensation: The John Lewis Partnership said 69,000 of its 'partners' were receiving the additional sums in this month's wages - representing an average £580 per employee . The group said that after the review it became clear that some partners had not been paid correctly. The John Lewis Partnership said the one-off cost would be reported in half-year results in September, although it would not be deducted from this year's partnership bonus pool. Future pensions liabilities are expected to rise by £7 million as a result, while pay systems have been updated to ensure all future holiday payments are correct - adding around 0.5 per cent to annual pay costs. Tracey Killen, director of personnel, said: 'As soon as we established that we were not implementing the Working Time Regulations correctly, we worked quickly to make the repayments to our partners in a way that is both fair and responsible.' The regulations go back to 1998, but John Lewis decided to cut off the start of the compensation period at April 2006 when its accurate digital records began. Sources at the group believe its effort to address the discrepancy 'goes beyond what other companies would do'. The John Lewis Partnership operates 39 John Lewis stores across the UK as well as 295 Waitrose shops and has annual gross sales of more than £9.5 billion. Its payment blunder is a particular embarrassment because its structure of employee ownership is often held up as an example by politicians of how to run a business.","The John Lewis Partnership said 69,000 staff would receive extra money .

"Positive signs: Nelson Mandela is 'showing great improvement', according to his ex-wife . Nelson Mandela is responding to touch and trying to open his eyes, his daughter said today, adding: 'He's still there.' The former South African president is said to be on life support after his condition deteriorated over the past few days, but a government spokesman said that he 'improved' overnight and is now 'stable'. His eldest daughter Makaziwe said that when she went to see him in hospital this morning he was still responsive and conscious. 'I won't lie, it doesn't look good,' she told SABC. 'But if we speak to him, he responds and tries to open his eyes. He's still there. He might be waning off, but he's still there.' Mr Mandela's granddaughter Ndileka said he was 'stable', and thanked the well-wishers from around the world who have sent their support. The whole family was said to be summoned to his bedside today, and president Jacob Zuma was believed to have been seen entering the hospital. 'I cancelled my visit to Mozambique today so that I can see him and confer with the doctors,' Mr Zuma said in a statement. 'He is much better today than he was when I saw him last night.' In the Eastern Cape . province, where Mr Mandela grew up, a traditional leader said that the time was . near for the former leader, who is also known by his clan name, Madiba. 'I am of the view that if Madiba is . no longer enjoying life, and is on life support systems, and is not . appreciating what is happening around him, I think the good Lord should . take the decision to put him out of his suffering,' said the tribal . chief, Phathekile Holomisa. 'I did speak to two of his family . members, and of course, they are in a lot of pain, and wish that a . miracle might happen, that he recovers again, and he becomes his old . self again,' he said. 'But at the same time they are aware there is a limit to what miracles you can have.' Scroll down for video . Vigil: Well-wishers hold candles as they pray outside the former president's hospital on Wednesday night . Touching: Children light candles as they take part in a candlelit vigil for Mr Mandela . Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj . told the state broadcaster: 'Over the past 48 hours, the condition of . former president Madiba has gone down.' A South African newspaper has also reported the icon is on life support, citing numerous sources close to the family. The Citizen newspaper says Mr Mandela has a team of doctors supporting him at a Pretoria hospital. One source was quoted as saying that his family had the option to switch off the ventilator. Consolation: Mr Mandela's daughter Makaziwe, pictured right outside the hospital, said he was 'still there' but admitted that his condition 'doesn't look good' Family: The leader's granddaughter Ndileka arrived clutching a large bouquet of flowers . Mr . Zuma cancelled a trip to neighbouring Mozambique, intensifying . speculation about the deterioration of Mr Mandela's condition. The president made his decision not to leave the country after visiting the 94-year-old late yesterday in the Pretoria hospital where he has been receiving treatment for a lung infection for nearly three weeks. 'Clearly the issue of seriousness has been such that President Jacob Zuma has cancelled his trip,' Mr Maharaj told Talk Radio 702. He declined to comment on reports that Mandela was on life support, saying: 'I cannot confirm any clinical details.' Peaceful: 95 children released balloons outside the hospital in honour of Mr Mandela, whose 95th birthday falls next month . Admiration: Two people look at the tributes to Mr Mandela left outside the hospital where he is being treated . CNN also reported that the former president could no longer breathe unaided, quoting an official who 'had been briefed in detail on his condition'. George Bizos, one of Mr Mandela's closest friends and his former lawyer, told The Daily Telegraph that they had never discussed his wishes towards the end of his life. 'We . can only hope for the best, and that is what the doctors decide to do,' he said. 'I am sure that the members of the family are discussing the . matter with the doctors but it should probably be primarily the doctors . in consultation with the family if the situation is critical.' Last night a leading clergyman visited Nelson Mandela's bedside to offer prayers for his 'peaceful, perfect end'. Thabo Makgoba, the Archbishop of Cape . Town, issued an emotional statement asking that the former president of . South Africa, who is in a critical condition, be released from pain and . suffering. Tributes: A woman and her young child look at prayers left by well-wishers outside the hospital . Support: A girl holding a teddy bear stands in front of the wall of tributes left to the anti-apartheid icon . However, Mr . Mandela apparently opened his eyes and smiled when he was told about . Barack Obama's forthcoming visit to the country, according to his . daughter. Mr Makgoba posted a message on Facebook asked for courage to be granted to . Mr Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, and others who love him 'at this hard . time of watching and waiting'. He added: 'May your blessing rest upon Madiba now and always. Grant him, we pray, a quiet night and a peaceful, perfect, end. 'Uphold all of us with your steadfast love so that we . may be filled with gratitude for all the good that he has done for us . and for our nation, and may honour his legacy through our lives.' Visit: Barack Obama holds his daughter Sasha's hand as the he and his family land in Dakar, Senegal . Waiting: The balance of Obama's Africa trip could hang on the health of Mr Mandela . The statesman was able to . show his pleasure at hearing of the U.S. President's visit. Mr . Obama is believed to be keen to meet Mr Mandela, but given the delicate . condition of the African leader he will not do so unless he is invited . by the Mandela family. That prospect appeared to be more . likely after Mr Mandela's daughter Zindzi described how she . told her father that Mr Obama would be touring South Africa. After she told him 'Obama is coming,' she said, 'He opened his eyes and gave me a smile.' Visit: Mr Mandela's ex-wife Winnie, centre, and daughter Zindzi, right, arrive at the hospital yesterday .

He said that the anti-apartheid campaigner had helped inspire him to enter politics with his bravery and self-sacrifice. 'I think he's a hero for the world,' Mr Obama said. 'And if and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages.'

As fears for Mr Mandela's health worsen, well-wishers have flocked to the hospital to leave letters, cards and flowers along the outside of the building. Among . the cards were handwritten notes from schoolchildren thanking the . inspirational leader who helped bring an end to apartheid in South . Africa. Tributes: A police officer places flowers for former South African President Nelson Mandela outside the Medi-Clinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria, where the former anti-apartheid leader is being treated for a lung infection .

"Krokodil Victim? Justin McGee died in November last year and now authorities in Oklahoma suspect that he may have perished as a result of his use of krokodil . Worried authorities are working to determine if the flesh eating drug krokodil has claimed its first victims in America, after the gruesome death of an Oklahoma father-of-four and his friend. The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics suspects that Justin McGee, 33, died as a result of complications from his use of the potent new drug that eats the body from inside out. Both McGee and his unidentified friend had such horrific skin damage that they were treated in the hospital burns unit their deaths said Dr. William Banner, director of the Oklahoma Poison Control Center. If it is confirmed that McGree perished using the terrifying new drug, which is responsible for thousands of deaths in Russia and is made from codeine and gasoline, it will represent a serious escalation for the spread of krokodil which is being dubbed the 'poor man's meth'. 'We were reluctant to publish it,' Dr. Banner tells The Verge. 'But now that it’s out there, we really want the message to be, ‘This is an end game move. This is going to kill you.’ McGee was admitted to hospital in Oklahoma City in November and died of a heart attack, but his autopsy results revealed evidence of krokodil use - including the tell-tale symtom of missing and rotting scaly, reptilian-like skin - hence its name. 'His skin was missing,' said McGee's friend Chelle Fancher to Koco.Com. Watched a friend die: Chelle Fancher said the drug killed her best friend, Justin McGee . 'The doctors say it ate him from the inside out. It wasn't until the next day that they told us that is was krokodil meth. 'Everything that touched him took his skin off.' Initially, McGee's condition was a mystery to doctors who airlifted him from his hometown of Duncan to a larger hospital in Oklahoma City. 'They said, ‘Chunks of his skin are falling off and they can’t get an IV in,' said his sister-in-law Lesia McGee to The Verge. Krokodil, which is similar to heroin and originated in Russia 10 years ago, turns users into zombies and the homemade concoction can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline or oil. The drug is made of readily available ingredients such as codeine, iodine and toxins such as gasoline, industrial cleaning oil, lighter fluid and paint thinner. Users filter and boil ingredients together, then inject the drug. The results are catastrophic. Spreading: There have now been at least eight cases of the skin-rotting Russian drug krokodil reported in the US, according to medical professionals and at least two resulted in death . The autopsy on McGee showed he was positive for desomorphine, the active ingredient in codeine, but doctors also found morphine, methamphetamine, and amphetamine. However, at his funeral, McGee's friends, one who has since also died because of suspected krokodile use, told Lesia that they were indeed using krokodil after finding the recipe online. 'It’s manufactured very similar to methamphetamine and that's where some people may call it krokodil meth, but what it is, it’s an opiate similar to heroin,' said Mark Woodward of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics (OBN). The OBN has been looking into the drug since Quincy’s death last November. 'It’s possible right now that we have two deaths, and those could be just two that we are aware of,' Woodward said. Officials with the OBN confirmed both of those victims were men from Duncan, Oklahoma. Fancher said the two men were friends. She said Quincy was a father of four young children. 'Their dad is gone because someone chose to make an evil drug,' Fancher said. 'I was there when he took his last breath. No family member should ever go through what we saw him go through.' This Russian man is suffering the side-effects of Krokodil use. Doctors say there are users of the drug in Chicago just weeks after first known cases in U.S. were reported in Arizona . Gaping wounds: This heavily blurred image shows the effects of krokodil on users leaving skin rotting hanging off their body . Continual use of krokodil, Russian for crocodile, causes blood vessels to burst, leaving skin green and scaly and eventually causing gangrene. In Russia around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year. It is thought abouta quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison. Despite this, Dr. Banner told The Verge he believes the drug to be 'self-limiting' - addicts will likely die within two years, not spread the drug and warned against any scare-mongering of an epidemic. 'This is a poor man's drug,' said Dr. Banner. 'It is kind of the end of the road. They run out of money, they’re horribly addicted. They cook it, inject it, get high, wake up and want more.' While the Drug Enforcement Administration is not confirming any cases of deaths of usage of the drug, they have admitted they are aware of investigations in Oklahoma, Arizona, Utah and Illinois. And in another sign the drug is spreading across the nation, following reports of  krokodil abuse in both Arizona and Chicago, Illinois, the drug is now believed to have hit New York. A source has claimed that the drug is being sold in at least two nightclubs in New York City’s hip Meatpacking District. Krokodil fears: Unconfirmed reports suggest that the drug has spread to New York City after previously being reported in Illinois and Arizona . The Verge reports that Sal Ramirez, who witnessed the effects of krokodil while serving in the Peace Corps in Kazakhstan, saw a man being throw out of Le Bain for selling the drug, and was approached by a deal at Westway, who reportedly tried to sell him krokodil and clean syringes in the bathroom. The announcement comes after a worrying wave of some victims injecting themselves with krokodil because they think it is heroin, doctors said. The first instances of its use in the U.S. were recorded in Arizona last month. It is already widely used in Russia. Three cases have now been reported in Chicago and doctors say two of the women did not even know they had been sold the drug. The victims were all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle-class backgrounds. Pictures and videos of users in Russia show blackened fingertips, large open wounds, and even exposed bone where skin has fallen off. Prolonged or even short-term use can damage blood vessels, muscle, cartilage, and bone, and amputation is frequently the only way to save a patient’s life. Doctors have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug, which is said to give a more powerful high than heroin. The flesh rotting that is specific to the drug occurs directly at the injection site, often leaving users with wounds to their feet or arms.","Justin McGee of Duncan, Oklahoma died in agony in November after a suspected case of krokodil overdose .

"The logo of the Serious Organised Crime Agency which has compiled a list of 98 clients which has been handed to the Information Commissioner's Office . Prrivate companies who are linked to rogue private investigators will face a new inquiry, the data protection watchdog announced last night. The Information Commissioner’s Office launched a probe after it was belatedly handed by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) a list of 98 companies and individuals who are connected to the private eyes. It represents a major development in the so-called blue-chip hacking scandal – after months of criticism by MPs that nothing was being done. Soca, which has come under huge pressure over its failure to investigate the firms, finally succumbed to public pressure and handed the list over at the end of last week. The ICO will now write to the celebrities, law firms, banks and other prominent companies on the list and quiz them about what they knew about the activities of the investigators. It will examine at least 20 files of material to see if any were aware that private investigators had been instructed and whether they knew that the four private eyes who were jailed last year after a police probe were breaking the law. However, the ICO admitted that up to a quarter of the firms allegedly involved may have been based outside the UK, raising fears many could escape prosecution. The ICO insisted it could push for investigations by its counterparts in other countries. Soca has for months refused to hand over the list to the ICO on the grounds that it could damage an ongoing police investigation. But in the end, it withheld only nine names which are the subject of a separate Metropolitan Police probe, Operation Tuleta, which is looking at computer hacking. The blue chip hacking list was drawn up during a Soca inquiry, Operation Millipede, which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year. Home Affairs Committee Chairman Keith Vaz has called for the list to be published for the sake of the victims and because 'innuendo is always worse than full disclosure' Its existence only emerged during an investigation by MPs. Soca, . the agency dubbed ‘Britain’s FBI’, refused to publish it on the grounds . it could breach privacy laws and damage commercial interests. Soca . have also said it would be unfair to taint these companies with . criminality since there is no evidence. Soca director general Trevor . Pearce said: ‘I repeat the point we are not alleging that the . individuals or companies named on the list have or even may have . committed a criminal offence.’ The . agency said it always intended to pass the list to the ICO once the Met . investigation was concluded. But its change of heart came after growing . pressure from Parliament over a scandal that has been described as . ‘worse than phone hacking’. Critics . have condemned the police for doing nothing to investigate the . blue-chip clients of companies linked to private eyes while media . organisations faced unprecedented scrutiny. Last . night the ICO said it had received more than 20 files of material from . Soca, including correspondence between clients and the private . investigators and receipts for payments. The initial phase of the . investigation is expected to take several months. Last . month the Mail revealed that 22 law firms feature on the list, . alongside several insurance companies, financial services groups and two . celebrities, among others. In . reply to James Clappison, a member of the Home Affairs Select . Committee, Soca also admitted there were up to 100 individual victims of . the private investigators. Mr Pearce is to appear before the committee tomorrow, with Soca’s interim chair Stephen Rimmer. The committee’s chairman, Keith Vaz wants an explanation as to why it has taken Soca so long to pass the information to the ICO. He . said it is ‘deeply concerning’ these files were only passed to the ICO . 24 hours before Mr Pearce’s appearance before the committee. Mr . Vaz added: ‘It is particularly puzzling given that Mr Pearce told the . committee that he would be passing on the files to the ICO once . Operation Tuleta, scheduled to continue until at least April 2015, was . finalised.’","List of 98 clients compiled by the Serious Organised Crime Agency .

"Overhaul: Education secretary Michael Gove suggested exams could be graded one to ten rather than by A* to C . GCSE grades could be ditched in favour of a number-based system, Michael Gove suggested yesterday. The Education Secretary said the top grades of A* and A could be replaced by classifications ranging from one to four. If this were applied all the way down to the lowest grade of G, pupils could end up with a score of between one and ten. Mr Gove, who is overhauling GCSEs in 2015 by replacing modules with end of course exams, said the new system would help ‘re-fix the level at which people recognise outstanding attainment’. If introduced, it would end the grading system that was first used for O-levels and A-levels in 1965. Mr Gove was giving evidence at an education select committee hearing when he was asked how he would avoid a ‘collapse’ in the number of top grades as pupils and teachers adjusted to the new exams. ‘The plan that’s likely, though not definitive, is we’d change how exams are graded,’ he said. ‘So that, for the sake of argument... you might have 1,2,3,4 cover a band of achievement that’s currently A* and A.’ He denied planning to make it harder for pupils to get top marks after years of grade inflation, adding: ‘It’s not my explicit aim to reduce the number of people who receive a particular mark. ‘It’s my aim to ensure, working with [exam regulator] Ofqual, that people can reliably feel once you have new examinations that they will keep their standards over time. ‘You’re going to have new examinations and, I hope, a new approach moving on from where comparable outcomes were.’ Change: Mr Gove said he wants to overhaul GCSEs to 're-fix the level at which people recognise outstanding achievement' However, there were doubts yesterday over whether Mr Gove’s proposal marked a genuine departure from the grades system. Graham . Stuart, the Conservative education select committee chairman, said the . numbers would help make it clear a new system had been introduced but . they were ‘not a fundamental change’. ‘Given nearly everyone at the top . goes on to do A-levels you could say it doesn’t matter that much,’ he . added. Chris McGovern, of . the Campaign for Real Education, said the plan was ‘overcomplicated and . unnecessary’. ‘This is an example of exam currency being inflated,’ he . said. ‘They should go for a percentage mark that is readily understood . by parents, employers and children.’ The . body operating Cambridge University’s three exam boards including OCR . last week suggested a radical overhaul of GCSEs by replacing grades with . scores that ‘could range from 600-900’. Cambridge . Assessment said this would remove the ‘arbitrary’ categories under . which pupils with similar marks can end up with different grades or . those with quite different marks receive the same grade. An Ofqual spokesman said: ‘We will be consulting soon on arrangements for the new GCSEs, and this will include a range of proposals for how they should be graded.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We have consulted on a new accountability system for secondary schools and are considering how to change it. ‘The new more rigorous GCSEs will include more demanding assessment structures. Ofqual is considering how we can improve the current A* to G grading system. This is one option.’ Mr Gove also told MPs he still wanted to move away from tiering in GCSEs, where pupils can be entered for a foundation paper with a maximum C grade or a higher paper depending on their ability.","Education secretary top grades could be replaced by score of one to four .

"Images showing an ISIS magazine being circulated in Indonesia have emerged, with reports that the magazines and accompanying brochures are being handed out at mosques in the province of Java. The third edition of Malay language publication Al Mustaqbal was released last month by the jihadist group, and is based on the theme of 'Islamic State Undercover', according to the magazine's website. The site, when translated to English, says the latest edition - which features a man waving the ISIS flag high above his head on the cover - 'explores history, development, creed and manhaj (the Islamic methodology by which truth is reached). Photographs showing Malay language ISIS magazine Al-Mustaqbal being circulated in Indonesia have emerged . It also says the magazine is recommended for 'those who really want to know about ISIS', pledges to 'answer the myriad of questions and the rumours' circulating about the group, and talks about ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. However the inside pages of the magazine are much more grim, and feature spreads of photographs of ISIS militants in battle, fighters taking out executions and rows of what look to be the dead bodies of children. Pictures of world leaders such as former President of the United States George Bush and former Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr also appear. The publication is in its third edition, and is based on the theme of 'Islamic State Undercover' The inside pages are splashed with photographs from the front line and pictures of world leaders . Many images of soldiers armed with heavy weaponry are also printed in the magazine, along with numerous photos showing dozens of ISIS members waving the black and white flag they are often seen with. According to the Jakarta Globe, the Central Java Government recently discovered a chapter of ISIS which had been active in Malang, in the East Java Province of Indonesia, for over a month. They have reportedly been using a village mosque in Sempu as their headquarters, and are calling themselves Ansharul Khilafah. The Al Mustaqbal magazine's website says the publication is for those who want answers to the 'myriad of questions and the rumours' circulating about ISIS . The front cover shows an ISIS member proudly waving the group's black and white flag above his head . A man from Malang told Jakarta Globe he was alerted to a meeting held by the group where the magazines were being distributed via social media. 'I was tagged about the establishment [of Ansharullah Khilafah] on Facebook, so my friends and I went [to the mosque]. There was a video screening and a sermon about ISIS. 'They handed out Al Mustaqbal magazines, brochures and vouchers for fried chicken,' Aji Prase told the Jakarta Globe. This comes as Abu Bakar Bashir, who is currently imprisoned in Indonesia and has links to terrorist groups Al Qaeda, has apparently pledged his allegiance to ISIS. Parallels between the publication and Inspire magazine which is circulated by al-Qaeda can be drawn . Late last month the latest edition of ISIS's English language propoganda magazine Dabiq was released, and according to Business Insider Indonesia was full of self justification of the extreme ideology the group follows. It reportedly compares itself to a version of the story of Noah's Arc and the flood, and says in the way in which people had no choice but to believe in God to survive, people should turn to ISIS if they wish to survive. These publications all draw similarities with Inspire, the English-language online publication of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. All use the power of the online world and social media to connect with their audiences and drum up support within their followers.","Malay language magazine released by jihadist group ISIS .

"Gareth Colfer-Williams was one of more than 1,200 infected by measles in the Swansea area . A young father who was not inoculated against measles as a child died from the disease during an epidemic in Swansea. More than 1,200 people were infected by the virus in the South Wales outbreak. The epidemic last November hospitalised more than 80 young people who had not had the vaccine at the height of the MMR scare. An inquest at Swansea Coroners Court heard how Mr Williams died after he had complained of suffering from a rash on this body, fever and hallucinations, to doctors. He had been advised by . doctors to rest at home, take paracetamol and stop taking . detoxification medicine he had started, in case he was reacting to it. Mr Colfer-Williams was concerned about his four-year-old daughter Dakota and made sure she had the jab. He was said to be vulnerable to infection as he had begun a detox two weeks before his death after suffering from alcohol problems. Consultant pathologist Dr Maurizio Brotto said at 5ft 8in, Mr Colfer-Williams was 'very underweight' weighing just 7st 7lbs. Mr Colfer-Williams' death in April came seven months after the outbreak of the disease last year. A major vaccination programme was launched during the outbreak as parents were warned children could suffer anything from an eye disorder to deafness, brain damage, or death. Mr Colfer-Williams was not inoculated against the disease as a child. He and his partner Cairo Oneim (pictured right) ensured their 4-year-old daughter Dakota was protected against infection .

"Archaeologists have unearthed an ancient bathtub in a first-century mansion that could have belonged to one of the priests who was responsible for Jesus' death, while another expedition has found a town where Jesus is believed to have stayed following the feeding of the 5,000 miracle. The mansion, which houses the bathtub and is situated on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, would have belonged to wealthy owners, signified by its size and features such as intricate carvings, a luxurious oven and the bathtub, which is similar to others found in King Herod's palace and a priest's residence. Archaeologists believe the mansion, which was built close to the walls of the Second Temple erected by King Herod, could have been home to one of Jesus' archenemies - a man belonging to the Sadducees class, which was typically wealthy, powerful and allied with the Romans. Archaeologists have unearthed an ancient bathtub (pictured) in a first-century mansion. The bathtub is the biggest clue as to who lived in the house as two similar tubs were unearthed in Herod's palaces at Jericho and Masada , while a third was located at a priestly residence also in Jerusalem . The building is an example of an early Roman period mansion, which historians hope will yield plenty of domestic details abut the ruling classes of Jerusalem at the time of Jesus. James Tabor, who specialises in early Christian history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, told NBC News: 'We might be digging in the home of one of Jesus' archenemies.' Shimon Gibson, who is leading the expedition, believes the house could have belonged to the high priest Caiaphas or Annas but they were both members of the ruling priest class. These ruins could be a mansion that was inhabited by one of the priests that condemned Jesus to death, according to archaeologists. The ruins are located on Jerusalem's Mount Zion close to the walls of the old city . The bathtub is the biggest clue as to who lived in the mansion as two similar tubs were unearthed in Herod's palaces at Jericho and Masada, while a third was located at a priest's house also in Jerusalem. It is buried in a vaulted chamber adjacent to a large underground ritual cleansing pool called a mikveh and is only the fourth bathroom of its kind to be found in Israel. Dr Gibson said: 'It is only a stone's throw away, and I . wouldn't hesitate to say that the people who made that bathroom probably . were the same ones who made this one. It's almost . identical, not only in the way it's made, but also in the finishing . touches, like the edge of the bath itself.' The location of the mansion is a strong indication of a high-status resident. The bathtub was found in a vaulted chamber adjacent to a large underground ritual cleansing pool called a mikveh (pictured). Little is known about the daily lives of priests at the time and archaeologists hope to build up a better picture of their lives from the newly-discovered mansion . Dr Tabor said: 'Whoever lived in this house would have been a neighbor and would have been able to pop into the palace. 'If this turns out to be the priestly . residence of a wealthy first century Jewish family, it immediately . connects not just to the elite of Jerusalem – the aristocrats, the rich . and famous of that day – but to Jesus himself. 'These are the families who had Jesus . arrested and crucified, so for us to know more about them and their . domestic life and the level of wealth that they enjoyed, would . really fill in for us some key history.' The team hopes to learn more about the household activities that might have been undertaken by priests at the time, as there are very few historical reports about their activities outside the holy temples in Jerusalem. Dr Tabor also believes that the details of the first-century Jewish ruling class could provide fresh insights into New Testament history. The mansion would have belonged to wealthy owners, signified by its size and features such as intricate carvings and a luxurious oven (pictured). Archaeologists believe the mansion could have been home to one of Jesus' archenemies - a man belonging to the Sadducees class . He said: 'Jesus, in fact, criticises the wealth of this class. He talks about their clothing and their . long robes and their finery and in a sense, pokes fun at it. So for us . to get closer to understanding that, to supplement the text, could . be really fascinating.' The archaeologists also found plenty of animal bones and cooking pots inside a cistern some 10 metres deep, which could have become a makeshift hiding place for Jewish residents during the Roman siege that led to the City's destruction in 70AD. A Roman historian said over 2,000 bodies were found underground in similar cisterns and many of the occupants had died of starvation. Dr Gibson said: 'We still need to look at this material very carefully and be absolutely . certain of our conclusions, but it might be that these are the remnants . of a kitchen in use by Jews hiding from the Romans -- their last resort . was to go into these cisterns. The archaeologists also found plenty of animal bones and cooking pots inside a cistern some 10 metres deep, which could have become a makeshift hiding place for Jewish residents during the Roman siege that led to the City's destruction in 70AD . 'It was a common practice, but this . conclusion is theoretical. It makes for a very good story and it does . look that way, but we’ve got to be certain.' Archaeologists believe this particular residence survived because of its location after the city was ruined. Mount Zion was left unoccupied until around 400 AD and the beginning of the Byzantine period, when people simply built on top of older walls. Around 200 years later Dr Gibson believes what remained of the house was covered with landfill material from the construction of a church called Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos near the site. He said: 'The area got submerged. The early Byzantine reconstruction of these two-story Early Roman houses then got buried under rubble and soil fills. Then they established buildings above it. That's why we found an unusually well-preserved set of stratigraphic levels.' The Ginosar Valley in Israel. Archaeologists found pottery remains, tesserae and architectural fragments indicating a town flourished in the area from the second or first century BC. They think Jesus could have rested after performing the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 at an ancient town near this site . A separate group of Archaeologists have uncovered an ancient town on the northwest coast of the Sea of Galilee, which they believe was where Jesus rested after performing the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, where he is said to have fed a large group of people with less than seven loaves of bread and two fish. The town is 2,000-years-old, situated in Israel's Ginosar Valley and is thought to be 'Dalmanutha', which is described in the Gospel of Mark as the location of Jesus' next journey after the miracle, Live Science reported. The town is only mentioned once in the Gospel of Mark, which states that after feeding 5,000 people Jesus sailed to Dalmanutha, where he was questioned by the Pharisees and aked to provide a sign from heaven. Roman column fragments lying on the side of a road in the modern-day town of Migdal are thought to be part of a newfound ancient town. Locals use artefacts  as garden ornaments in the modern town . Ken Dark, of the University of Reading, who led the archaeological team, believes the town was prosperous in ancient times due to the vessel glasses and amphora discovered. The team said a 2,000-year-old boat found in 1986 on a shoreline nearby, adds to the picture of a thriving town. Writing in the journal Palestine Exploration Quarterly, he said: 'stone anchors along with the access to beaches . suitable for landing boats and of course, the first-century boat…all imply an involvement with fishing'. The team thinks the town survived for a number of centuries as hundreds of pieces of pottery from as early as the first century BC as well as later pieces from the Byzantine Empire were scattered between the modern town of Migdal and the coast. They also found cubes called tesserae associated with Jewish practices in the early Roman period, suggesting a Jewish community lived there, as well as basalt ashlar blocks used as garden ornaments in the modern town, which they believe were found in the local area and probably the newly-discovered town. Key finds include Corinthian column pieces and a pagan altar made of light grey limestone.","Archaeologists from the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, have found a bathtub and ritual pool in a ruined mansion on Jerusalem's Mount Zion .

"Water still laps at the foot of the elevators in the elegant atrium. A piano stands eerily intact, seemingly ready to be played. These haunting pictures show the remarkably preserved interior of the doomed Costa Concordia. Images were released yesterday showing the cabins and passageways of the wrecked luxury ship as work began to refloat the vessel in the largest maritime salvage operation in history. The 114,500-tonne Concordia, longer than the Titanic, was one of the most glamorous cruise ships to sail the ocean and boasted a casino, spa, several bars and dining areas. But now wires hang down over the empty stools in the bar areas while the paint has been stripped off the walls of the once elaborately and colourfully decorated hallways. Scroll down for video .

Authorities expressed satisfaction that the operation to float the Concordia had proceeded without a hitch. Franco Porcellachia, the engineer in charge of the salvage, said at a news conference around seven hours after the operation began that the hulk had been raised two metres out of the water. Tug boats attached cables to the ship then started shifting it away from the shore. It was hoped to be re-anchored some 30m away. Mr Porcellachia said: 'I would say we are halfway through our plan to move the ship.'

"'Moral responsibility': Barbara Hewson, a prominent barrister, suggested some victims may be partly responsible for being raped . Rape victims can be partly responsible for what happened to them, according to a leading lawyer. Barbara Hewson, a human rights and civil liberties barrister at London's Hardwicke Chambers, challenged the idea that 'the victim is utterly innocent and the victimiser is utterly guilty'. Miss Hewson, who describes herself on Twitter as 'not for the easily offended', suggested that people who are raped can have a 'moral responsibility' for the crime, even though the law says that rape is only ever the fault of the rapist. She also questioned whether 'claims of victimisation must always be respected', according to The Daily Telegraph. Miss Hewson, 52, made the comments during a debate with other legal professionals at the London School of Economics on Wednesday, entitled 'Is Rape Different?' She said: 'We need to make a distinction between legal responsibility and moral responsibility. 'The . law does not attribute any responsibility now to the victim of rape . whereas traditionally we know the judge would say when they came to . sentence ""well she was contributorally [sic] negligent"" or something . like that.' While outlining what she views as the received wisdom when discussing, Miss Hewson dismissed the idea 'that it's morally absolutely unambiguous, . the victim is utterly innocent and the victimiser is utterly guilty and . this is infinitesimal. And finally that claims of victimisation must . always be respected, anything less is victim-blaming.' Miss Hewson compared a rape victim to somebody who falls over whilst drunk to demonstrate that people can put themselves in a situation where they are more likely to fall victim to a crime. She also attacked a culture around rape which encourages people to 'realise' they have been raped, and added that some victims go on to blame their ordeal for everything that goes wrong in their life. Debate: Miss Hewson made her comments at a London School of Economics event entitled 'Is Rape Different?' Rape Crisis spokesman Fiona Elvines condemned Miss Hewson's argument, telling the Telegraph:  'Barbara Hewson shows how out of touch she is with the realities of sexual violence. As a society, we have moved on from the rape myths she continues to propagate.' Miss Hewson, a Cambridge graduate who has worked as a barrister since 1985, has courted controversy on sexual offences before, by attacking the decision to double the sentence for broadcaster Stuart Hall. His original sentence of 15 months in prison for 14 counts of indecent assault was increased to 30 months after a public outcry. She has also previously called for the age of consent to be lowered to 13 and criticised the 'witch-hunt' of ageing celebrities accused of sexual abuse. Miss Hewson was unavailable for comment this morning. Barbara Hewson has made a name for herself both as one of the country's most respected lawyers, and as someone not afraid to ruffle some feathers with her outspoken views. A member of the prestigious Hardwicke Chambers, Miss Hewson, who was called to the bar in 1985, is regularly ranked in the Legal 500 directory. She has won a Barrister of the Year award from The Lawyer magazine after she fought for the rights of pregnant women against compulsory treatment. The Chambers UK guide has variously described her as ‘bright, committed and passionate’, ‘well-respected’, ‘highly diplomatic’ and ‘a tough opponent’. She writes on legal issues for the Spiked website, and is often highly critical of the establishment. Miss Hewson has stepped into the firing line on numerous occasions in the past. Responding to the controversial case in which a judge described a 13-year-old sex attack victim as ‘predatory’, she tweeted: ‘It takes two to tango. Disgusting tho' these men are, frankly the girls are often not much better - and no shrieking martyrs.' She has also said that operation Yewtree, into sex abuse linked to Jimmy Savile, ‘has got out of hand’ and was hijacked by ‘moral crusaders’. A storm of criticism met that suggestion, and she has also angered the NPCC by suggesting at the same time that the age of consent be lowered to 13. At the time an NSPCC spokesman said: ‘To trivialise the impact of these offences for victims is all but denying they have suffered abuse at all.’","Barbara Hewson questioned whether rape victims are 'utterly innocent'

"A mother and her 21-year-old son from Albuquerque, New Mexico were arrested after posting a picture of a puppy in a freezer bag on Facebook. The photo shows Mary Snell, 44, holding an 8-week-old puppy in an open plastic bag. Investigators from the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office said Snell then posted it on her son, James Engel's, Facebook page. Both face charges of animal cruelty. Danger of suffocation: Investigators say the dog could have easily have died because it wasn't able to lift its head up to breathe fresh oxygen . 'They got a new puppy and were trying to show how small the dog was in comparison to a Ziploc bag. The dog was moving around and to restrict its movement. Ms. Snell thought that it would be a good idea to put the dog in the bag,' Sgt. Aaron Williamson said. Snell placed the pup, called Baby into a Ziploc bag to show how small he was while her son took the picture. Investigators said the dog was positioned in a way that it could have suffocated because the dogs head was stuck in the corner of the plastic bag. 'She did admit it was wrong, but she couldn't get the dog to sit still, so she did it anyway,' Williamson said. 'A young puppy doesn't have the ability to move its head to a fresh supply of oxygen.' Arrested: Mary Snell, 44, and her son James Engel, 21, have been arrested and charged with animal cruelty . Investigators found out about the photo after it was forwarded to them by someone who was concerned about the welfare of the puppy. A neighbor said that the family treats their pets well. 'I've seen them outside with their animals and they do pretty good,' said a neighbor who didn't want to be identified. The puppy was taken to a vet to be looked at and was apparently dine. Baby is now is being taken care of by one of Snell's relatives.","Mother and son placed dog into plastic bag to measure its size and took a photo to put online .

"A toddler born with a rare condition that made her feet run out at right angles has taken her first steps. Sophie Parker was born with dislocated hips due to a rare condition called Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH). This meant she couldn’t straighten her legs, stand on her own, or walk. The toddler, from Redhill, Surrey,  had to have both of her . legs broken and metal bolts inserted to rebuild her hips. Sophie Parker (with parents Lee and Laura) was born with a rare condition that made her feet turn out at right angles . Diagnosis: Sophie was suffering dislocated hips due to a rare condition called Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) Recovery: Sophie can now walk properly for the first time thanks to surgery . Without the surgery, it is likely that . Sophie, now two,  would not have been able to walk properly, and she would have had . further hip problems in the future. Her mother Laura picked up on her condition when she noticed her feet were sticking outwards. Mrs Parker, 31, said: 'Her feet were pointing at right angles, from the age of just eight weeks old. 'I was a first time mum and I didn’t know if Sophie was developing correctly. 'Doctors reassured me there was nothing wrong, but it just didn’t look normal.' She . said: 'Had her condition been picked up earlier, it could have . potentially been rectified with a less invasive procedure, involving . what is known as a Pavlik Harness where the hips are held in place to . encourage them to grow around the socket. 'We’re relieved that we pushed to have further scans or we may still not know about Sophie’s DDH today. I think it was a mum’s instinct.' As Sophie began to crawl, Laura and her husband Lee noticed Sophie was dragging her legs along the floor. 'It looked as if she had wonky hips. It was clear that she had a problem with her stability.' said Mr Parker, 36. A further scan revealed that Sophie didn't have fully formed hip joints and both were severely dislocated. This meant she couldn’t straighten her legs or stand on her own. During surgery, both of Sophie's legs were broken and metal bolts were inserted to rebuild her hips . Recovering: Without the surgery, it is likely that Sophie, now two, would not have been able to walk properly, and she would have had further hip problems in the future . At 14 months old, Sophie went through the first of two procedures to try and reposition her hips. This . involved breaking one of her femurs each time and reducing the hip . socket around the top of her leg, before bolting them back into the . correct position. 'Just . hearing what they were going to do to her was terrifying,' said Mrs . Parker. 'It sounded frightening but we we told by the surgeon that it . was the only option.' Following the surgery, Sophie had to wear a full body cast, which stretched from her chest to her . ankles, to allow her hip sockets to grow back around the bones. She was strapped into the cast for 24-hours a day, to hold her hips in place. This meant Laura and Lee had to . re-learn how to change nappies and buy her a range of specialist medical . kit, including a customised £250 car seat. Lee, a TV reporter, said: 'It was a bit of a struggle because we couldn’t look after her in the ways we were used to. 'But we just had to do what was necessary. If it meant Sophie would be able to walk properly, it was worth it.' Just weeks after the second operation, her cast was removed and Sophie began to try and pull herself up on furniture, and move around the house in her walker.  She can now walk, but tires easily . Road to recovery: Sophie will have more surgery later in the year when she will have the metal pins removed from her hips . Just weeks after the second operation, her cast was removed and Sophie began to try and pull herself up on furniture, and move around the house in her walker. 'She had very little balance and her confidence was badly knocked, so we had to keep encouraging her to keep going,' Mrs Parker, a finance assistant said. 'But she slowly began to get the hang of it. She was very scared at first and so were we but we had to do what was best for our little girl. 'She can now walk, but she gets tired quite quickly and then tries to revert back to crawling. She’s getting there though. 'The operation took a lot out of her and it’s amazing that I’m finally getting my little girl back.' Sophie will have more surgery later in the year when she will have the metal pins removed from her hips. Had Sophie's condition been picked up earlier, it could have potentially been rectified with a less invasive procedure, say her parents . For the first six weeks, she will have holes in her femurs, leaving her at risk to breaks while she heals. Her father said: 'A lot of adults would . complain if they had to go through this, but she’s been fantastic . throughout all of her treatment. We are so proud of her, she’s a superstar. 'Providing everything stays where it should, there is nothing to say Sophie won’t live a fully mobile life.' Sophie's parents are now battling to raise awareness of the rare condition, which affects one to three per cent of newborns but which often isn’t picked up until later in life. Sophie's parents are now battling to raise awareness of the rare condition, which often isn't picked up until later in life . Laura has since organised a walk for Sophie and other children with DDH to raise awareness of the condition. All of the children who took part in the ‘little steps’ event were 2-3 year-olds who have had surgery because of DDH or are children who wanted to support their friends. 'We just wanted to make DDH a condition that all new parents are aware of,  as early diagnosis is key.' The walk, which was held yesterday, was for the charity ‘STEPS’ which has helped the family through their tough time. STEPS support families who are affected by lower limb conditions, helping them to make confident and informed decisions about treatment and guide them through what is often a confusing and difficult time.","Sophie Parker was born with dislocated hips and her feet began sticking out .

"Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley told an NHS conference in Manchester tomorrow's doctors' strike is 'pointless' Just eight per cent of doctors working for the NHS in England went on strike today, the Department of Health has claimed. But despite only 11,500 doctors taking part in the action over the Government’s controversial pension reforms, patients will feel the impact after their appointments and operations were pushed back. One in 10 patients and a quarter of GP practices were affected by the action, with about 2,000 surgeries having at least one member of staff taking part. A Department of Health spokeswoman said that about 2,700 non-urgent operations were cancelled and 18,750 outpatient appointments had to be rescheduled as a result of the action. In some areas of England, 37 per cent of GP surgeries would see only those patients in urgent need of care as doctors took action for the first time in almost four decades. Figures from strategic health authorities across England showed the action affected services at 24 per cent of practices. The figures, an early indication of the effect the action is having across England, show that there are varying levels of support around the country. In some places up to a quarter of GP surgeries are affected by the action. But in other areas 'only a handful' of doctors are taking part. Details of the scale of industrial action taking place in individual regions are shown below. The numbers emerged after Andrew Lansley today attacked striking doctors, saying the pension deal they are fighting for would come at the expense of lower-paid NHS staff. The BMA's demands would undo efforts to ensure porters and nurses do not lose out on their fair share of pensions, the Health Secretary said. Earlier he urged doctors not to participate in today's 'pointless' strike, warning them it will achieve nothing. The comments followed his revelation last night that pension contributions for doctors have cost the taxpayer £67billion. Doctors themselves, thousands of whom . are expected to be on strike today over reforms to their pensions, have . only paid £17billion towards their retirement, the Health Secretary . said. Mr Lansley revealed that the . public were funding 80 per cent of doctors’ pensions, and the total cost . of the pension pot of all working and retired doctors is a massive . £83billion. Doctors have been told a £68,000-a-year pension is the Government's final offer (file photo) Patients who fall ill . today were urged to seek advice on the internet or ring an NHS helpline . instead of trying to see a doctor. With thousands of GPs and hospital . doctors on strike, the public have been warned they may be turned away . unless their condition is life threatening. Last night the Department of Health . told patients to trawl the NHS Direct website if they felt unwell, or . call its helpline if they were still worried. A NHS Direct spokesman admitted staff . were ‘preparing for the worst’ and said extra workers had been laid on . in preparation for an unusually high number of calls. Meanwhile A&E departments across . the UK were bracing themselves for the thousands of patients who could . descend on hospital waiting rooms after being turned away from GP . surgeries. Today’s strike, . organised by the BMA, has led to the cancellation of up to 30,000 . operations, ranging from hip replacements and cataract removal to . heart-bypass surgery. Another 1.25million GP appointments have been . postponed along with up to 58,000 hospital tests and scans. The BMA has threatened to organise . further strikes if the Government does not reconsider its reforms. Ministers want to increase the amount doctors contribute from their . salaries and raise the retirement age. But the BMA claims this is unfair . as they already pay a higher proportion into their pensions than others . in the public sector. Speaking on ITV’s Daybreak, the . Health Secretary accused the BMA of pushing for a deal that would be . unfair on lower-paid NHS staff. Mr Lansley said: 'We needed something that was . fairer for other NHS staff as well, the contributions do need to be . properly progressive and they do need to reflect the highest paid paying . a greater proportion into their pensions overall. 'We had a pension scheme in the NHS . where, quite often, the highest paid got twice as much back, by way of . pension benefits, than lower paid. I did set out to make sure that low . paid and medium paid staff in the NHS did not lose out and that meant . that the higher paid paid more. 'I’m afraid we are in a position . where the BMA are out on their own and what they seem to be aiming for . is to try and change things back so they get more and nurses and porters . and others in the NHS get less.' Last night the Prime Minister urged . doctors to put their patients first. Speaking from the G20 summit in . Mexico, David Cameron said: ‘I don’t think it is the right thing for . them to do. I have huge respect for our GPs. My family and I have really . benefited from that first-class service and we should be very proud of . what we have in Britain. ‘Our primary-care GPs are well paid, they deserve to be well paid. They get good pensions, they deserve to get good pensions. ‘Even . after these reforms, they will have the sort of pensions many people . working in private-sector companies can only dream of. So I don’t . believe they should be on strike.’ Health Secretary Andrew Lansley also made a last-ditch plea to doctors to reconsider. Addressing health service managers at . the NHS Confederation conference in Manchester, he said: ‘The strike is . pointless. It will achieve nothing. I want to call again on doctors to . think again before taking part in a strike that will be damaging for . patients.’ But the BMA has stressed its members do not want to jeopardise their relationship with patients . The union's chairman of council Dr Hamish Meldrum said that the doctors’ fight is not with patients but with the Government. Mr . Meldrum said he hoped that after today’s day of action the union could . reopen negotiations with the Government, adding that 'nobody wants a . repeat of this'. A survey by the Daily Telegraph suggests support for the strike is lacking in hospitals and surgeries across the country, casting doubt on the BMA's claim that it has a 'strong' mandate for today's action. It found: . He told Daybreak: 'I hope (the action) is not pointless and futile because we are very anxious to seek a resolution to this dispute and if this helps to highlight the problem and to get to that resolution then I hope it will have some point to it. 'Nobody is happy about taking any sort of action that impacts adversely on patients. There has been a lot of soul-searching at the BMA but we have to represent our members’ views and nearly three-quarters of those who voted wanted to take this sort of action because of what was happening to their pensions.' Meanwhile, Sir Bruce Keogh, the head of the NHS, has written to the most senior doctors at every hospital in the country urging them to ‘act in a way that ensures the health, safety and well-being of patients’. It is not yet known exactly how many doctors are taking part in today’s strike or how many surgeries will refuse to treat patients who are not seriously ill. To avoid patients being turned away, the Department of Health is advising them to use the NHS Direct website or call the helpline on 0845 4647. It urges them not to use A&E units or dial 999 as a substitute for a GP appointment. Lisa Potter, of NHS Direct, said: ‘We are planning for a worst-case scenario. We expect it will be extremely busy. We are encouraging patients to use the symptom checker on our website to keep the phone lines free to people who really need to speak to someone.’ Dr Vincent Argent, from Worthing Hospital, said: ‘We are anticipating it will be a lot busier than usual. Doctors from other departments may be required to help in A&E.’ The BMA announced the action after a ballot of more than 100,000 doctors showed a clear majority in favour of protests on a high turnout of 50 per cent. In the last few days, however, it has emerged that many doctors are having second thoughts about the protest. Early polls suggest as few as 22 per cent of doctors will be participating, while yesterday two surveys revealed that up to three quarters of surgeries could be running as normal.","Up to 30,000 operations cancelled and 1.25million appointments pushed back - but BMA says doctors' fight is with the Government, not patients .

"Hapless: Florin Constantin, 28, was caught red-handed with 10 mobiles phones in Norwich . A Romanian thief who wore specially-adapted leggings under his trousers to hide 10 mobile phones he stole from a gig has been jailed. Florin Constantin, 28, was caught red-handed when the owners desperately called their phones and they started ringing. The crook had only been in the UK for six weeks when he drove to Norwich specifically to steal phones from the Waterfront bar. The Eastern European immigrant had . already received a caution from the Met Police in London for going . equipped to another music venue. Staff alerted by outraged victims . nabbed Constantin in Norwich after hearing loud ringing from his . trousers, a court heard yesterday. District judge Peter Veits jailed the . villain at the city's magistrates' court for 12 weeks. Judge Veits told . Constantin: 'You have come to this country with no means of support, no . job to come to. 'Unfortunately, like many other . people, you have then got pressured into criminal offences in order to . live. I don't see you as the prime mover in this offence, but you still . have taken part quite willingly.' He added: 'If you were going to change . your ways, you would have taken the chance after you were cautioned by . the Met less than a month ago. 'But you came to Norwich specifically . to steal these phones. There was no other reason for you coming here. I . hope when you are released you will think about how to live in an honest . way.' Constantin, using an interpreter, yesterday admitted 10 counts of theft on Tuesday. He gave his address as a road in . Romford, Essex, but the court was told that he was of no fixed abode as . he was not known at that address. Phil Charnley, prosecuting, said: . 'He's a Romanian national and has only been in this country six weeks. He received a caution from the Met Police on February 8 for going . equipped to a music venue. 'He had worn adapted trousers to conceal stolen items. He travelled with others to Norwich. He went to the Waterfront, was noticed by staff as being out of place.

Ten phones were returned to their owners, with a total value of £2,620. The Waterfront bar in Norwich where Constantin was caught red-handed . 'In interview he said he'd been approached by another Romanian at an internet cafe in London, asking if he wanted to earn some money by helping in the theft of mobile phones. 'This man provided him with leggings to wear under his jeans and they drove to Norwich. The other man stole the phones, but the defendant concealed them in special pockets in his leggings. 'The theft of mobile phones from music venues is a national problem and security staff have been specifically trained to look for attendees who don't fit the profile for the event.' 'He's a Romanian national and has only been in this country six weeks' Phil Charnley, prosecuting . James Burrows, defending, said: 'He confessed at the police station at the first time of asking and also pleaded guilty at first time of hearing here. 'He came to the UK six weeks ago looking for work, but there's no work. He has not yet managed to get a National Insurance number needed to work here lawfully. 'As for the rest, you don't really need to hear. He was used by others. He was a labourer in Romania and came here on the premise that the grass was greener.' Detective Sergeant Vicky Flatt, of Norfolk Police community safety team, said: 'We know that clubbers and people attending music venues are targeted by thieves, as nightspots provide ideal hunting grounds. 'People in large crowds are less likely to notice someone tampering with their bag or taking something from their pocket. 'Full credit must go to the staff at the Waterfront for their vigilance and swift action which ultimately led to Constantin being arrested.' Police have worked closely with venues and staff to highlight phone thefts after a similar incident at last year's Sundown Festival in Norfolk.

"A retired church worker has revealed how John F Kennedy took her virginity during a debauched 18-month affair while she was a teenage White House intern. Mimi Alford says she felt powerless to resist the late U.S. president as he pulled her into ‘Mrs Kennedy’s room’ and seduced her on his wife’s bed. Other claims in her newly published autobiography include that he made her inhale a sex drug during a party at Bing Crosby’s ranch and coerced her to perform a sex act on an aide while he looked on. Alleged affair: Former U.S. President John F. Kennedy, left, and Mimi Alford, right, as a . teenager when claims she had an 18-month affair with the leader . When she thought – wrongly – that she . was pregnant by the president, that same aide arranged for her to see an . abortion doctor, even though abortion was illegal at the time. Mrs Alford’s claims are the most in-depth account of their liaisons so far published. They reveal how Kennedy never kissed . her and ignored her whenever his wife was around. She never even called . him ‘Jack’, always addressing him as ‘Mr President’ – even when they . were in bed together. Their affair began in the summer of . 1962, lasting until Kennedy was assassinated the following November. Mrs . Alford, then just 19 years old and with the maiden name Beardsley, had . begun a job in the president’s press office. After meeting Kennedy she . says he asked to give her a personal tour. Personal stories: Mr Kennedy reached out to Miss Alford following the death of his infant son Patrick Bouvier Kennedy with his wife Jacqueline (pictured), whom he shared received letters of remorse with . With his staff drinking cocktails just . down the corridor, she claims he led her into Jackie Kennedy’s room . where he took off her clothes without saying a word. When she momentarily resisted his . advances, Kennedy asked: ‘Haven’t you done this before?’, to which she . replied: ‘No.’ He continued anyway, she says, adding: ‘On the ride home, . it kept echoing in my head, I’m not a virgin any more.’ Mrs Alford, now a 69-year-old . grandmother, also tells of a party at the ranch of Crosby. When a . reveller passed around a tray of sex drug amyl nitrate, she writes that . the president asked her if she wanted to try it. ‘I said no,’ she recalls, ‘but he just . went ahead and popped the capsule and held it under my nose. I ran . crying from the room.’ As to why she allowed the affair to . happen, she admits: ‘The fact that I was being desired by the most . famous and powerful man in America only amplified my feelings to the . point where resistance was out of the question.’ Published: Miss Alford's new book, Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath, provides a never-before told story of life in the White House with the president as his mistress . Alford, who ironically went to the same Miss Porter's school as JFK's wife Jackie, described Kennedy as 'playful', the sex as 'varied and fun' and said he could be 'seductive and playful'. She said they spent a lot of time 'taking baths' and that if they spent the night together, she would wear his own soft-blue cotton nightshirts. But she also revealed complications in the relationship, saying they never kissed, and that she was often subjected to a 'waiting game' where she was told to stay in her hotel until he called for her. There is also a dark undertone to some of Kennedy's actions in the book, such as when he 'forced' her to sniff amyl nitrate, commonly known as poppers, during a Hollywood party at Bing Crosby's desert ranch. She said: 'I was sitting next to him in the living room when a handful of yellow capsules - most likely amyl nitrate, commonly known as poppers - was offered up by one of the guests. 'The president asked me if I wanted to try the drug, which stimulated the heart but also purportedly enhanced sex. 'I said no, but he just went ahead and popped the capsule and held it under my nose. He didn’t try it himself. This was a new sensation, and it frightened me. I panicked and ran crying from the room.' She also tells of how JFK asked her to 'take care' of his friends Powers who 'looked a little tense' while they were swimming in the White House pool. 'It was a dare, but I knew exactly what he meant. This was a challenge to give Dave Powers oral sex. I don’t think the president thought I’d do it, but I’m ashamed to say that I did... The president silently watched,' she said. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile . Crisis, where the U.S. and USSR had a nuclear stand-off, he reportedly . told her that: 'I’d rather my children red than dead.' And . Alford, then Mimi Beardsley, also tells of how she erroneously believed . at one point she was pregnant with JFK's child, and another moment of . when her lover reached out to her following the death of his infant son . Patrick Bouvier Kennedy. 'Best friends': Dave Powers, pictured with JFK in 1963, and alone in the Cabinet Room in 1962. The new book claims the former President 'dared' Alford to perform sex acts on Mr Powers while he watched . She wrote: 'I had never seen real grief in my relatively short life. He invited me upstairs, and we sat outside on the balcony in the soft summer evening air. There was a stack of condolence letters on the floor next to his chair, and he picked each one up and read it aloud to me... Occasionally, tears rolling down his cheeks, he would write something on one of the letters, probably notes for a reply. But mostly he just read them and cried. I did, too.' Alford said she saw President Kennedy for the final time at The Carlyle hotel in Manhattan on November 15, 1963, just a week before his assassination in Dallas. At this point she was due to be married to her college sweetheart, Tony Fahnestock. 'He took me in his arms for a long embrace and said, ""I wish you were coming with me to Texas."" And then he added, ""I'll call you when I get back."" I was overcome with sudden sadness. ""Remember, Mr President, I’m getting married."" '""I know that,"" he said, and shrugged. 'But I’ll call you anyway.'""","Former White House intern Mimi Alford says JFK 'took her virginity'

"Most parents would be delighted if their 11-year-old son was always laughing and smiling. But for James Edgar's mother Rachel, his constantly happy nature is a simply a reminder of the difficulties life may hold for him. James was born with Angelman syndrome - a chromosome disorder which causes severe learning difficulties. And the rare neurological condition has a . side-effect that means sufferers tend to be easily excited and are left . almost permanently laughing or smiling. Happy: James Edgar, with mother Rachel, suffers from a rare neurological condition which means he cant stop smiling or laughing . So while the youngster, from Caernarfon, North Wales, appears to be the happiest child in the world, he actually experiences intellectual and developmental delay, seizures and jerky movements. Fewer then 1,000 cases of Angelman syndrome have been reported in the UK. James's mother, Rachel Martin, said: 'James is such a happy, lovable, cuddly child. But he needs constant supervision as he is not aware of danger. 'He may appear happy, but he does feel other emotions, even if he doesn't show it. 'That's not to say there aren't moments when he's challenging, but he's such a pleasure to be around.' Communicating:  While James is unable to talk, he is able to express himself through his iPad and uses apps tell stories to family and friends . James was diagnosed when he was 17 months old after doctors had monitored him because of his lack of progression. His mother said: 'When he was diagnosed, we were upset  - although not entirely surprised as we had thought that James had a disability for some time. 'When you receive confirmation that your child had a disability, all your plans for the future change instantly. 'As a parent you have subconscious expectations for your child that are not going to be realised, and some parents go through a period of loss, almost like grieving, for the child they thought you were going to have.' James is unable to talk, but he is able to express himself through his iPad. Rachel says he uses several apps to tell stories at school and also bring stories home to share with family. She said: 'The iPad is amazing - it has helped him so much. 'His favourite site is YouTube, he can spend all day on it. He particularly loves the Disney Parades and Chapstick video. 'He has brought immense joy and happiness to our family and while I would happily take away the challenges he faces in life, I wouldn't want to change him. He is who he is - just James!' James lives at his home with his . siblings Alexandria, 15, Zac, seven and Beth six, who, says Rachel, are . all very good at helping. Rachel is the chair of the Angelman Syndrome Support Education and Research Trust. One in a million: James's mother Rachel said he she would happily take away the challenges he faces in life, but would never want to change his personality . She said: 'Since James was diagnosed I've been involved with the trust. 'It allows families to meet and learn about the syndrome and gives national support to those involved.' Now, the Newlife Foundation, an organisation set to help disabled children, is fundraising to help the youngster. They hope to raise £5,000 in addition to the £2500 already donated to fund a specialist bed for James to control his complex behaviours. For more information visit www.newlifecharity.co.uk. Angelman Syndrome is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a British doctor, Harry Angelman. Dr . Angelman had noticed similarities between a small number of previously . undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem. After . seeing a painting in the Castelvecchio museum in Verona, Italy, entitled . A Boy with a Puppet he was inspired to write a medical paper entitled . Puppet Children. The . syndrome - originally called 'Happy Puppet Syndrome' because of the . characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children . - was renamed Angelman Syndrome in 1982. Although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified, in recent years much more has been learned. During . the 1980s advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose . increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause. In simple terms, it is a chromosome disorder that causes severe learning difficulties. Angelman . Syndrome is not a disease, it is a neurological disorder that causes . severe learning difficulties, and although those affected have a normal . life expectancy, they will require looking after throughout their lives.

"A thug who shut his terrified cat . in a tumble dryer and put it through three spin cycles is being hunted by the RSPCA after users of a web forum reported him when he posted footage of the abuse online. Officers are trying to identify the cat owner who posted the sickening film under the alias Nitroazza on a site for radio controlled car enthusiasts. The man, who listed his location as Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, joked that his pet Princess was 'the new Mr Tumble' and asked viewers to rate the disturbing video. Miraculously, the cat survived its ordeal and emerged from the tumble drier alive but very shaken. The cute cat Princess is pictured before her terrifying ordeal . A Cambridgeshire RSPCA spokeswoman said: ‘The matter has been passed on to our acting chief inspector.’ She said they wanted to hear from anybody who has the cat attacker’s real name and address. ‘The video is really horrible. ‘We were quite shocked,’ said the furious spokeswoman. ‘The door to the tumble dryer was opened and closed three times.’ Princess miraculously survived her nightmare attack, but the RSPCA said the poor cat would have been ‘very distressed’. If caught, the person responsible could be jailed for up to six . months and fined up to £20,000 for animal cruelty under the Animal . Welfare Act 2006. The owner films himself forcing the cat into the tumble dryer . The cruel owner is seen shutting the door with the cat inside . A still image of the footage uploaded online shows 'Princess' the cat trapped inside the tumble dryer. The video has now been taken down. The sickening cruelty, posted on Modelsport UK’s internet . forum, was downloaded and forwarded to the RSPCA and a local newspaper by outraged . forum member Karl Stockley, who captured screen shots of the arrogant perpetrator’s . web comments. The uploader, whose profile says he is 22 and married with a baby son, wrote: ‘Like cats? ‘Check out my cat, the new version of Mr Tumble.’ He finished off his stomach-churning ‘joke’ with a smiley face before asking fellow members to comment and rate his video. In later posts he told viewers his cat was called Princess and that she should be shot. Horrified forum members blasted the vile video, which has now been removed from the website. One forum member posted: ‘There is something . not right here, I was trying to figure out if it was real or not. ‘I certainly hope not.'

"A mother-of-one believes she’s a better mother thanks to her 32G breast implants. Tamsin Wade, 19, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, hated her deflated and uneven 32AA bust. As her confidence plummeted, she refused to leave the house, meaning her son, Finley, 2, couldn’t attend play dates and after school clubs. Tamsin took a loan of £5000 to pay for surgery to increase her breasts from 32AA (left) to 32G (right) Tamsin, pictured with boyfriend Joe and son Finley, first became anxious about her flat chest when she gave birth in April 2012 . The beautiful blonde wasn’t able to do anything with her son without feeling shy and embarrassed about her appearance. But realising the affect her low self esteem was having on little Finley, Tamsin took out a bank loan to pay for the £5,000 surgery, and now believes she’s a better mother thanks to her new assets. Tamsin said: 'Since having my boob job I have been so happy. 'I was unable to go swimming with Finley as I felt so self-conscious. 'I was forced to wear baggy clothes to hide my figure and getting into a bikini made me feel so uncomfortable that me and Finley had never been swimming. 'I started to shy away from going out at all as I just felt so bad about myself.' Tamsin, pictured after surgery, says before her breast implants her mood and confidence were low, affecting both her life and her sons . But since having the surgery Tamsin has got her confidence back, allowing her to hit the pool and join new toddler groups with her son. She said: 'After the surgery I felt so much better and immediately started joining mum and baby groups for me and Finley. 'He loves them and I love spending quality time with him. Since her surgery, Tamsin, here with boyfriend Joe and Finley, says she has regained her confidence and now has signed up to numerous mother and son playgroups . 'My loan repayments are around £140 a month and it hasn’t stopped me from doing anything with my boys, if anything we do more now than ever. 'I feel comfortable to take him abroad now too as I won’t mind wearing skimpy clothes and bikinis - it’ll be great to go on holiday with him. 'We will probably go on a last minute holiday. 'Finley has always been my number one priority, but now I don’t let anything hold me back from being the best mum I can be.'

Tamsin said: 'Before I had Finley my boobs were a 32D but the aftermath of being pregnant left me with double A’s. Tamsin is convinced that her new bigger cleavage (left with her old white bra and new pink one) has made her a better mother to Finley (right, playing with her) 'So I lived in baggy clothes despite only being petite because I didn’t want anyone to notice my boobs. 'It just really knocked my confidence as my body had changed so much, I wasn’t used to it. Tamsin’s confidence was so low that she was unable to take Finley to the beach, swimming classes, even taking him down to the shops had become a struggle. She said: 'My general mood was low, I had no confidence and felt myself hiding away. 'I knew I couldn’t carry on feeling like this as it was affecting my entire life. 'I wanted to do more with my son, he is my world and I felt as though I was restricting him too.' Tamsin started looking into getting a breast enlargement online. She said: 'I started researching the best cosmetic surgery groups. 'After meeting up with numerous surgeons I finally went to a consultation with MYA. 'They were amazing, they made me feel really relaxed, I couldn’t wait to book my surgery in with them.' Tamsin says that despite monthly loan repayments of £140 she now does more with Joe and Finley than ever before . Since Tamsin’s transformation she and her boyfriend, Joe Johnson, 26, have started looking forward to the future. She said: 'We can now look forward to a family holiday’s together. 'It has drastically improved my relationship with Joe as I’m no longer shy about getting changed in front of him. 'He is thrilled with the results too.' Tamsin hasn’t said no to having more surgery in the future, although she loved the experience with MYA Cosmetic Surgery Clinic. She added: 'I would think about getting a nose job but it doesn’t bother me that much.'

A further 40 people were injured in the blast outside an office for anti-Taliban tribal elders that destroyed local shops and nearby parked cars. The strike in the town of Darra Adam Khel is the latest to hit the troubled area near the Afghan border showing militants still pose a threat to the stability of Pakistan despite government offensives against the Taliban and their supporters.

Destruction: Pakistani security officials inspect the wreckage of a destroyed vehicle at the site of a bomb attack in Darra Adam Khel . Rubble: Forty people were also injured in the blast that destroyed numerous shops and cars . No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the Pakistani Taliban have staged similar attacks in the tribal region of Darra Adam Khel to punish elders for backing security forces in offensives against militants. The explosives-laden car was parked near the office of one of the so-called peace committees that have been formed by local elders trying to rid the area of militants. Regional government administrator Fakhruddin Khan said it was unclear how many people were in the office at the time but those killed included tribal elders and passers-by.

"It is where Prince Charles  conducted his illicit affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. Now Anmer Hall in Norfolk is reportedly being lined up as a  country home for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Despite the obvious poignancy that Prince William will know it was a place where his father betrayed his mother, the Queen is said to be ready to gift the property to him and Catherine as they prepare to welcome their first child. Scroll down for video . Country pile: Anmer Hall is a late Georgian country house which sits in . the grounds of the Sandringham estate and is just two miles east of the . Queen's Sandringham House . Charming: The Duke spent much of his childhood holidays exploring the Grade II listed house, pictured . The late-Georgian country house is just two miles east of the Queen’s  Sandringham House, where the Royals celebrate Christmas. The Duke spent many of his childhood holidays exploring the ten-bedroom Grade II-listed property and its grounds, which have been part of the Sandringham estate since 1898, and is said to have fond memories of it. However, it was also one of the country houses where Charles and Camilla used to enjoy secret trysts, when the Prince of Wales’s friend Hugh van Cutsem rented  the property. Sprawling estate: The royal couple are expected to be given the country house by the Queen . Couple: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured last month as the Duchess left hospital after a severe bout of morning sickness. The couple are currently based in Kensington Palace, West London . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh stay at Sandringham every Christmas with the rest of the Royal family . It was claimed yesterday that Anmer Hall has been ‘earmarked for William and Kate’, and was described as a perfect country bolt-hole in the picturesque village of Anmer. However, it is unlikely the couple would be able to enjoy it for another four years, when their son or daughter would be three years old. Anmer Hall, which was lived in by the Duke and Duchess of Kent between 1972 and 1990, is leased until March 2017 to James Everett, who owns a kitchen and timber company. He moved into the property in 2000, but would not comment on whether he planned to stay. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, currently living in a rented farmhouse on Anglesey, are also waiting for renovation work on their London home in Kensington Palace to be completed. When they are not on Anglesey, they live at Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace in West London, which has just one bedroom and has been described as ‘cosy’. However, later this year they will move into the newly  renovated Apartment 1A inside the palace itself, which was Princess Margaret’s home, while Prince Harry will have the cottage. The new apartment will suit the couple’s growing family, as it boasts five bedrooms and three reception rooms. Renovation work is being paid for out of the public purse, although the Royals are covering the cost of the interior design. Last year it emerged that the Queen was planning to give her grandson one of the cottages on the Sandringham estate to mark his 30th birthday. She owns around 150 properties on the estate but it is not known which cottage was chosen. The Duke is thought to be particularly pleased about the Norfolk cottage because he and Kate spent their first Christmas as husband and wife at Sandringham in 2011.

William has always enjoyed close ties with the Sandringham estate. His close friends the Van Cutsem family used to live at Anmer Hall and the Prince regularly stayed there as a young boy. Anmer Hall was bought by the Royal Family in 1862 and was lived in by the Duke and Duchess of Kent between 1972 and 1990. It is considered  one of the Queen’s most charming properties and sits at the end of a gravel drive close to Anmer Church . The village of Anmer lies between King’s Lynn and Hunstanton, on the edge of the Sandringham estate.

"More than 90 per cent of doctors defied union orders to strike yesterday – deciding their patients must come first. Thousands of GPs and hospital medics who had initially voted for industrial action appeared to back down on the day. In the end only 11,500 took part in the British Medical Association's protest over changes to pensions. Call for action: Hamish Meldrum, chairman of The British Medical Association said doctors' fight is not with patients but with the Government . But fears of more widespread support meant tens of thousands of operations – ranging from cataracts to hip replacements and heart bypass surgery – were needlessly cancelled in advance. As it turned out, many patients given a postponed date could have been treated yesterday. Some have been told they will now not go into theatre for another three months. The BMA insisted it had tried to 'minimise' the impact on patients and that anyone whose condition was life-threatening or urgent would be seen. Figures from the Department of Health revealed that the strike led to the cancellation of 2,700 operations and a further 18,750 consultations. The protest also meant a quarter of GP practices – 2,000 surgeries – refused to accept patients unless it was urgent. Campaigners accused doctors of being 'incredibly callous' for causing distress to patients. The strike snub suggested that thousands of doctors who had voted to take part subsequently had second thoughts. More than 80 per cent of those who responded to the BMA's ballot last month backed industrial action. Strike action: Only 11,500 took part in the British Medical Association's protest over changes to pensions . But, as not all doctors voted – and many don't even belong to the union – this works out as about 40,000 of the 150,000 doctors in England. If only 11,500 took part in the strike, nearly 30,000 who initially said yes appear to have changed their minds. In recent days even senior members of the BMA admitted that doctors had been 'struggling with their consciences'. Dr Mark Sanford-Wood, chairman of the union's GP branch in Devon, said some of his colleagues had been having 'second thoughts'. Despite the low turnout, patient groups remained highly critical of the strike. Concerned: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: 'We asked doctors to recognise that their quarrel was not with patients but with the Government.' Roger Goss, director of Patient Concern, said it was a 'very sad day' for the profession. 'The protest has been motivated by greed and selfishness,' he said. 'I cannot understand how a profession who are meant to be so bright can be so stupid. They are incredibly callous. 'It's shocking that people will have to wait three months for surgery because of this. People get extremely wound up and upset about operations which, in some cases, are potentially high risk.' Katherine Murphy, of the Patients' Association, said the protest would impact on 'quality of life', adding: 'This industrial action will have implications long after doctors go back to work.' And Dean Royles, director of NHS Employers, said: 'We genuinely feel for and share the distress of the thousands of patients that have been affected. This action is not fair on them.' Patient Tony Cooper, from Somerset, was meant to be having spinal surgery yesterday at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. He was told the day beforehand that it was cancelled. 'I didn't realise how subconsciously I had prepared myself mentally for the operation,' he said. 'It's major surgery, there's a lot of risks involved. 'What's most frustrating is apparently my surgeon would have been prepared to do the surgery. However, he was unable to find an anaesthetist who wasn't a member of one of the unions to knock me out. 'So somewhere in one of the hospitals in Bristol there's a very highly paid, very clever surgeon unable to carry out his work properly because of the arrogance of the anaesthetist.' Dr Hamish Meldrum, the head of the BMA, defended the disruption. He said: 'Our intention has not been to maximise the impact on patients, but to communicate the scale of doctors' anger and to encourage the Government back to the table.' He also claimed the true turnout for the action was far higher. 'The Government's figures need to be treated with extreme caution,' he said. 'Doctors have sent a strong message that a fairer approach must be found.' Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: 'We asked doctors to recognise that their quarrel was not with patients but with the Government. 'I am pleased that a significant majority of doctors have done just that and maintained services for their patients. But let us not forget that the consequence of the BMA's decision to ask doctors to go on strike has been that thousands of patients who expected to have an operation or an appointment today have been inconvenienced. 'It is extremely regrettable if any patients have suffered unnecessarily.' The BMA was protesting over Government changes to doctors' pensions which will see them contribute more and retire later. But John Ralfe, a pensions expert, said consultants' annual pensions of £48,000 a year were 'very generous'. A typical consultant earning £120,000 a year contributes a lower proportion from their salary than a nurse – despite earning five times more. By DAVId WILKES and NICK MCDERMOTT . For BMA chairman Hamish Meldrum, yesterday was all about taking industrial action in a bid to protect enviable pension pots. But GPs at his former practice were instead using their valuable time to put their highly trained minds and vital skills to rather more constructive use – treating patients. None of the five doctors at the Bridlington Medical Centre, where Dr Meldrum worked from 1978 until retiring in March last year, went on strike. Mr Meldrum said yesterday was all about taking industrial action in a bid to protect enviable pension pots . 'We are busy. We are working normally,' said a receptionist at the practice in East Yorkshire. Nor were they alone in putting medical care before concern for feathering their own nests. Around 6,000 – or 75 per cent – of GP surgeries across the country provided routine appointments yesterday, according to Department of Health figures. Fears of being turned away by their GP failed to materialise for the vast majority of patients. And with many deciding to stay away, all too aware of the well-publicised strike, waiting rooms were less crowded. 'It was wonderful. We were looked after really well,' said mother-of-one Sanjam Bajaj, 34, who brought her eight-year-old daughter Cherisse to the Temple Fortune Health Centre, in north-west London. Bridlington Medical Centre in East Yorkshire, which remained open despite the industrial action . 'Normally we have to wait between 30 and 45 minutes to be seen, but today we were straight in to see the doctor.' Another patient there, charity worker Naomi Goldstein, 32, a mother of one, said she was given an early morning appointment 'straight away' after calling in with tonsillitis. The clinic is headed by another BMA bigwig, Dr Laurence Buckman, the chairman of the General Practitioners Committee. On a normal day, he would see up to 50 people, but by lunchtime yesterday he had only seen two. 'It has been incredibly quiet,' he said. 'What we are doing is seeing urgent and emergency patients, anyone who says “will you see me”, the answer is “yes”.' In Cardiff, Dr Andrew Dearden, Treasurer of the BMA and, until the end of last year, chairman of its pensions committee, was not at his surgery. He has not worked there on Thursdays for the past ten years due to his BMA commitments, but kept in contact with colleagues yesterday. During morning 'open access' sessions at the practice in Roath, more than 100 patients are normally seen by four to six doctors. Yesterday it was less than a third of that. Dr Dearden said: 'Interestingly, it appears a lot of our patients have not come in today because they know their conditions are not acute. 'Everybody has had the opportunity to come in and be assessed but we have been treating emergency and urgent patients only.' Asked if the strike had been a damp squib, he replied: 'Today has been about taking industrial action while making sure patients are not a risk. I think that is what we have done.' Asked if it had diminished trust in doctors, he said: 'Over the past 20 years doctors have been the most trusted profession in this country while MPs and ministers have been among the least trusted. 'So when the medical profession takes industrial action because it can't tolerate something which it says is unfair, who do you think a member of the public is going to trust?' At the practice of the BMA's GP committee deputy chairman Dr Richard Vautrey, Meanwood Health Centre in Leeds, patients praised the doctors for carrying on as normal. Trevor Haslam, 67, said: 'I called earlier to see if there was any problems but they said it was business as usual.'","In the end only 11,500 took part in the British Medical Association's protest .

"Comedian Chris Rock made a memorable appearance on NBC’s Today show on Monday as he jokingly suggested introducing a rather desperate measure to improve ratings. Once promotional duties for his latest movie, Top Five, were out of the way Rock couldn't resist cracking a couple of jokes about the show’s on-going battle for supremacy with Good Morning America. The funny man started by offering his congratulations on securing an exclusive interview with Janay Rice, the wife of disgraced running back Ray Rice who had his NFL ban lifted on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Comedian Chris Rock made a memorable appearance on NBC’s Today show on Monday as he jokingly suggested to Matt Lauer that he get sick like GMA's Robin Roberts to help boost ratings . Lauer covered his face with his hand as comedian Rock joked about him getting sick to improve viewing figures . ‘Today show, you guys are doing good,’ Rock said. ‘You got Ray Rice's wife on, man. You'll show Good Morning America. We got the wife on!’ ‘This is one of those times I should have gone to the commercial about thirty seconds ago too late, my bad,’ joked host Matt Lauer, to laughs from the crew off camera. ‘We'll show you Robin Roberts,’ Rock continued. ‘Matt Lauer is going to get sick next,’ he joked as the host covered his face with his hand and shook his head. Good Morning America host Roberts is fighting fit now following a breast cancer scare in 2012. GMA was accused by critics of exploiting Roberts' illness for ratings after featuring countless updates on her condition including filming her undergoing a bone marrow transplant in September 2012 . The show was accused by critics of exploiting her illness for ratings after featuring countless updates on her condition including filming her undergoing a bone marrow transplant in September 2012. That particular update included her colleagues Diane Sawyer and Sam Champion wearing surgical masks and singing songs of encouragement. 'It's a fine line between educating the audience and bringing them up to date, and crossing over and turning that into a ratings booster or an audience grabber,' said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center at the time. While TV critic Tom Shales accused GMA of using Roberts’ serious illness as a 'promotional opportunity'. 'ABC has managed to turn the very serious illness of co-anchor Roberts into a huge promotional opportunity for GMA,’ he said. In Top Five Rock plays a stand-up comedian who hit the big-time and is forced to spend the day with a New York Times' journalist played by Rosario Dawson, right . However Roberts, who returned to GMA in February 2013, received a 2012 Peabody Award for the program. The Peabody credited her for ‘allowing her network to document and build a public service campaign around her battle with rare disease’ and ‘inspiring hundreds of potential bone marrow donors to register and heightening awareness of the need for even more donors.’ Rock’s remarks were edited out of a version of his interview that was posted on the Today website on Monday. Rock has written, directed and stars in Top Five which hits cinemas this week. In it he plays a stand-up comedian who hit the big-time and is forced to spend the day with a New York Times' journalist played by Rosario Dawson.

"Guilty: Lee Howett, 26, was jailed for two and a half years for stabbing a man with a pair of hairdressing scissors . A gay hairdresser has been jailed for two and a half years after he stabbed a man with a pair of scissors in revenge for making a homophobic comment. Lee Howett snapped after a passenger waiting at Basildon rail station, Essex, abused him over his sexuality during a series of skirmishes. The 26-year-old then took a pair of hairdressing scissors from his bag and stabbed him close to his right shoulder blade. Judge David Owen Jones told him: 'People who use scissors as a weapon in a public place to stab somebody must face imprisonment.' Howett, of Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, was in an emotional state after confronting an ex-partner, Basildon Crown Court heard. He lashed out at a man who was with a group of people enjoying a night out, the court heard. Howett had been drinking heavily and was sitting on a bench waiting for a train to arrive at Basildon station when a group of three men carrying pints of beer joined the platform at around 11.15pm on Sunday, June 24. The trio had been celebrating after one of them found out he was set to become a father for the first time. But Howett became annoyed with their rowdy behaviour and shouted at them to shut up. Two separate scuffles broke out, during which a homophobic comment was made by the victim, who also sustained a bite mark from Howett. Howett then went back to the bench and took a pair of hairdressing scissors out of his bag before approaching the group for a third time and stabbing the victim close to his right shoulder blade. The court heard how the defendant was emotional after a confrontation with his ex-partner in a Basildon pub. The couple had broken up just two weeks before the incident following a volatile relationship. Crime scene: The stabbing took place at Basildon train station - after . Howett told three 'rowdy' men to shut up . Chris Whitcombe, mitigating, said: 'Having been abused by his ex-partner it is right to say that his emotions were running high. 'By the time he got to the train station the situation was extremely raw and whilst that doesn’t excuse his behaviour it puts it into context. 'Howett has been subjected to homophobic abuse since his school days. He has been an openly gay man since his teenage years. 'He would normally get up and walk away and had never confronted anybody before, but whatever had taken place previously was the catalyst and he reacted extremely badly.' Following the attack Howett waited at the train station for police to arrive and made a full admission. He pleaded guilty to one count of wounding with intent. Judge David Owen Jones sentenced Howett to two and half years in prison. Addressing Howett, he said: 'It may be and I accept it probably was the case that one of the young men made a homophobic comment towards you. 'That must have been hurtful but unfortunately you reacted very badly when it would have been easier to distance yourself from the group.'","Hairdresser Lee Howett, 26, snapped after a man made a homophobic comment about him .

"A new endorsement in an Italian newspaper is bringing the rumors that New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan could become the next Pope to new heights. Dolan's name has been rumored to be among the top picks for weeks, but the latest push for an American Pope comes from the Italians. Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who is deemed one of the most powerful from the home country's delegation, is quietly working behind the scenes and lobbying others to push for Dolan. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Commenting on the rumors: New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan is widely seen as one of the frontrunners in the race to become the next Pope after Benedict steps down next week . Given his prominence, Dolan has been questioned about the prospect repeatedly, brushing it off each time. 'You know, listen, all the cardinals are really embarrassed to talk about that, and we’d be uncomfortable talking about it, so I’ll leave it at that,' he said on Wednesday. Another uncomfortable issue is that Dolan has been criticized in the past for his connection to the sex abuse scandal that has rocked the Roman Catholic church in the United States for the past decade. He faced questions from lawyers in New York on Wednesday about his handling of allegations that priests in the Archdioceses of Milwaukee had abused children. Dolan led the archdioceses from 2002 until 2009. Hanging over his head: Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, answered questions about how he handled the priest sex abuse scandal while he oversaw the Archdioceses of Milwaukee . Man of the people: Dolan, seen here offering communion to residents at a nursing home, is widely admired and well-known in the United States . His tenure in New York has been dogged by lawsuits from 575 alleged victims of priest abuse in Wisconsin. Their lawyers have accused him of stalling and keeping the allegations quiet until the statue of limitations expired. The general consensus in America is that Dolan is the most likely U.S. Cardinal to be chosen to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who shocked the world last week by announcing he would step down at the end of the month. However, the National Catholic Reporter newspaper says Rome is buzzing about a different American: Cardinal Seán Patrick O'Malley, the Archbishop of Boston. O'Malley, 68, has a reputation as a humble monk, who prefers wearing the simple brown robes of his Capuchin Order and insists on being called 'Cardinal Seán.' He is widely seen - in both the U.S. and in Rome - as having successfully cleaned up the Archdiocese of Boston after he took over in 2003 following some of the most shocking allegations of sex abuse and official cover-up. He also speaks Spanish and has worked extensively in Latin America and the Caribbean - two of the new strongholds of the Catholic faith. Big in Rome: Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the Archbishop of Boston, is being mentioned by Italian Vatican-watches as a possible successor to Pope Benedict XVI . He's also media savvy and uses his blog and Twitter account to connect with parishioners and appeal to non-believers. 'Right now, it's tough for an American journalist to walk into the Vatican Press Office without fielding questions from colleagues about him,' National Catholic Reporter columnist John Allen writes. While O'Malley is garnering praise from top Vatican-watchers in the Italian press, Cardinal Roger Mahony, another prominent American, is being urged not to attend the papal conclave in Rome next week that will choose the next Pope. Mahony, the retired Archbishop of Los Angeles, is accused of shielding priests accused of child molesting from prosecution. He has long been vilified by advocacy groups over allegations that he quietly kept pedophile clergy in the church - allowing them to continuing abusing children. Groups on both sides of the Atlantic are urging Mahony not to attend the meeting of Cardinals. He has said he plans to go anyway. Disgraced: Cardinal Roger Mahony, the former Archbishop of Los Angeles, has been accused of actively shielding priests accused of sex abuse . Both Dolan and O'Malley will attend the papal conclave, as well. Mahony is expected to give a deposition to lawyers representing abuse victims later this week. He is scheduled to be questioned Saturday in a lawsuit over a visiting . Mexican priest who police believe molested 26 children in 1987. The Rev . Nicolas Aguilar Rivera fled to Mexico in 1988 after parents complained. Rivera has been ousted from the priesthood but remains a fugitive. Though Dolan, 63, has worked to build a reputation as a reformer amid the sex abuse scandal, questions remain about his tenure as the Archbishop of Milwaukee. The Milwaukee Archdiocese faces allegations from 575 people. Archbishop Jerome Listecki, the current Milwaukee church leader, sought bankruptcy protection in 2011, saying the process was needed to pay victims fairly while ensuring the archdiocese could still function. Milwaukee is the eighth diocese in the U.S. to seek bankruptcy protection since the abuse scandal erupted in 2002 in Boston. Vatican intrigue: The announcement last week by Pope Benedict XVI that he would step down at the end of the month has led to furious speculation about his successor . Frank LoCoco, the lawyer for both the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Dolan, said in a phone interview that the Cardinal . was asked about his decision to publicize the names of priests who . molested children. 'The names were published so that people would come forward, share their . story and begin what Cardinal Dolan and all those involved would be a . healing process,' LoCoco said. Additional church officials deposed in connection with the bankruptcy . and lawsuits include another former Milwaukee archbishop, Rembert . Weakland; a retired auxiliary bishop; an archdiocese official who helps . victims; the archdiocesan chancellor; and others, according to LoCoco . and a spokesman for the Milwaukee archdiocese. The Milwaukee Archdiocese recently said it was going broke. Its legal . and other fees have reached nearly $9 million, according to court . filings. Advocates for victims have accused the archdiocese of trying to . shield assets by transferring millions of dollars separately into a . cemetery trust fund and a parish fund several years ago. Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the New York Archdiocese, said Dolan . had long-awaited the chance to discuss his decision to publicize the . names as part of his efforts to help victims. 'He has indicated over the past two years that he was eager to cooperate . in whatever way he could,' Zwilling said in a statement.

"Len McCluskey, Unite's firebrand general secretary, has also tried  to dictate who Mr Miliband has in his Shadow Cabinet . The majority of Labour’s candidates picked so far for the 2015 General Election are linked to unions, it emerged yesterday. Of the 42 candidates selected, 23 have union links. Of those, 16 won their candidacies with direct backing from unions while a further seven are union members. Unite – Labour’s biggest donor – sponsors a quarter of those who have made it this far. Among those picked to battle for parliamentary seats are a campaigns officer from Unison and two former GMB officials. Union donations still account for 81 per cent of Labour’s funds – pouring in £20million to the party since their votes helped Mr Miliband secure the party leadership ahead of his brother David in 2010. The influence of trade unions over the party’s would-be MPs undermines Mr Miliband’s attempts to throw off his ‘Red Ed’ label, and new rules mean that in future it is even more likely that candidates will be drawn from union backgrounds. They now have to give up their jobs for at least nine weeks before an election – up from four weeks – and they also have to prove they have more spare cash to cover campaign costs than before, according to Peter Watt, Labour’s former general secretary. He described the union’s involvement in the selection process as a ‘stitch up’ earlier this month and senior Labour sources are concerned that this means only those with union sponsorship will be able to afford to fight for a seat. Len McCluskey, Unite’s firebrand general secretary, has also tried  to dictate who Mr Miliband has in his Shadow Cabinet. Yesterday he issued threats to the Labour leader, telling the New Statesman magazine that he will be ‘cast into the dustbin of history’ if he is ‘seduced’ by the Blairites in his shadow cabinet, such as Jim Murphy, Liam Byrne and Douglas Alexander. Mr Miliband's (pictured campaigning in Worcester) attempts to throw off his 'Red Ed' label, and new rules mean that in future it is even more likely that candidates will be drawn from union backgrounds . Unite has also openly declared it wants to stop more moderate candidates being selected by the party for plum seats. In minutes from its December meeting, the union claimed it had ‘changed the Labour Party rule book’ to ‘end discrimination against working-class candidates’. The union said that without its support, candidates from the Blairite ‘Progress’ branch of the party ‘or other right-wing candidates’ would have been selected. The rules now decree that all candidates have to be a member of a trade union ‘and contribute to the political fund of that union’. Labour has tried to distance itself from Mr McClusky’s statements, saying: ‘[He] does not speak for the Labour Party. This attempt to divide the party is reprehensible.’ Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said last night: ‘The attack on Len McCluskey is just cosmetic spin. If Ed Miliband is so outraged, he should hand back the £8million he’s poured into Labour coffers and stop taking money from his union paymasters.’ Labour denied it was drawing its candidates from too narrow a field. A spokesman said: ‘We are proud to have selected a wide range of candidates with varying backgrounds. ‘Our affiliates’ support does not get them any undue influence over our candidate selection process.’ Nearly 80 per cent of the Shadow Cabinet has received money from trade unions since the last General Election, according to figures which reveal their grip on the upper echelons of the Labour Party. Labour leader Ed Miliband, his deputy Harriet Harman – who is married to former trade unionist and Labour MP Jack Dromey – and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls have all received union sponsorship, the Electoral Commission register reveals. Mr Miliband raked in a £100,000 and a £15,0000 payment from Unite, as well as money from the GMB union and UCATT, which represents construction workers. Labour’s business spokesman Chuka Umunna received cash from the GMB and Community unions. Out of 29 MPs who can attend Shadow Cabinet, 23 have accepted union donations. While Mr Umunna used the cash to pay for staff, the money can be used for a variety of causes including campaigning. High profile Shadow Cabinet members not to have accepted union money since 2010 are Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves, and Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary.","Of the 42 candidates selected, 23 have union links, it has emerged .

"It has shed two million viewers compared to last year, was beaten into second place in the ratings by BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing and rumoured in-fighting between the judges has seen the new look X Factor plunged into crisis. Phone votes have plummeted as fans desert the show and it seems Simon Cowell's huge . gamble to leave his signature reality show to launch in the . U.S., may have put the show in crisis. Slump: Boy band Nu Vibe were voted off last night's X Factor live show which saw viewing figures and phone votes plummet . Despite gaining 9.6 million viewers during Saturday's . live shows, X Factor was beaten in the ratings by the BBC's Strictly Come . Dancing, which had 9.75million tuning in despite its barely revamped . format. Sunday night's results show rose to . 11.4million viewers but compared to 13.4million for the same stage of . the competition last year, it's clear that the new format is not quite . yielding the much-hoped for results. And today, ITV is expected to discover that phone votes for the first public eviction have also plummeted as newspaper reports today suggest that viewers have lost faith with the acts, which would mean a major drop in income for ITV and producers. But despite the falling ratings, a drop in phone votes and reports of unrest behind the scenes, an upbeat Cowell insists he is very happy with the way the show is going. A source told MailOnline: 'Simon's . really happy with the show here in the UK. He has deliberately left the UK show to run without him and he absolutely trusts the team to do a . great job. Happy: Simon Cowell, seen here on the US X Factor last night, is pleased with how the UK show is going - and is said to have already spotted an act that he believes is a 'stand out star' By PAUL CONNOLLY . Say what you like about Simon Cowell - and I have often - but he knows how to put together a talent show that draws in the viewers. True, The X Factor has always been about as reflective of the vibrancy of the UK music scene as EastEnders is of British TV drama, but it's always been entertaining and slick. Without the book-haired Cowell at the helm, however, it's falling apart. Louis Walsh, whose knowledge about pop music would fit comfortably on a grain of rice, is demonstrably out of his depth without his old mucker Cowell to guide him across the musical road, while Tulisa has been anonymous and Kelly Rowland domineering and annoying. But it's Gary Barlow who's been the biggest disappointment. What's with that beard? He's obviously going for the boyband Clooney look but he just ends looking like one of The Wurzels. With his droopy eyes and. Deliberate. Way. Of. Speaking. He's clearly trying to project gravitas but instead he looks as though he's trying to remember where he left the keys to his combine harvester. Oh, and the acts. Nu Vibe's cover of U2's With Or Without You was like watching kittens singing Land Of Hope And Glory - compelling, undoubtedly, but for all the wrong reasons. The styling hasn't been much better. I've not seen since awful, mismatched outfits since the Royal Wedding. This farrago would never have happened under Cowell's watch. But with the US X Factor suffering too can he really spare the time to save his original money-spinner? 'Simon is very happy with how they are all doing and thinks . all the judges are doing a fantastic job too. Not only that, Simon has . already spotted an act on the show who he thinks is a clear standout . star.' Saturday night’s programme was watched by an average of 10.1million people, compared with 12million in the corresponding episode of the previous series. In contrast, its BBC1 rival, Strictly Come Dancing  beat the X Factor for all but five minutes of the half-hour period when the two programmes overlapped. It also had a larger audience share. Fans of the show also took to their . social networking pages in droves last night during the sing-off between . the bottom two acts, boy band Nu Vibe and Frankie Cocozza, slamming . their 'tuneless' performances. But according to reports today, it's not just the falling ratings and phone votes that have hit the show, but unrest behind the scenes, with judge Kelly Rowland at the centre of the reports. According . to the Sun, the Destiny's child star, 30, has been throwing her weight . around and bossing  fellow judge Tulisa Contostavlos and telling Louis . Walsh's acts to ditch his ideas. An insider claimed that instead of focusing on her own acts, the girls, she has been meddling with the other acts. Speaking . to the paper, they said: 'Kelly is trying to turn this into The Kelly . Show with her meddling - and it's really putting people's noses out of . joint. 'The contestants love it as they're in . awe of her but the judges hate it. Tulisa has properly fallen out with . her after Kelly went to speak to her about the styling and songs and . vocals for Rhythmix.' Doing a great job: Cowell is pleased with the line-up of judges this year which include regular Louis Walsh and newcomers Tulisa Contostavlos, Kelly Rowland and Gary Barlow . Safe: Frankie Cocozza made it through to next week's show after the sing-off with Nu Vibe but was slammed on social networking sites for his 'tuneless' performance . The paper also claimed that Tulisa . felt the force of the producers' wrath after arriving for rehearsals . looking hungover and exhausted, having spent the night before cheering . on her axed act Amelia Lily who performed at London club G.A.Y, and who . Tulisa surprised with a birthday cake for her 17th. A source said: 'She looked a wreck and spent most of the time just sitting behind the judging desk with her head slumped on it.'

"Published: Texas vet Dr Melba Ketchum has finally published the results of her study she claims to conclusively prove Bigfoot's existence . A Texas-based vet who claimed to have found DNA evidence of Bigfoot has finally published her findings - in a journal she set up. Melba Ketchum hopes her 'proof' of the existence of the elusive hominids will be the first step towards recognising them as an undiscovered Native American group. Although she first announced her claims in November, the publication of her full results was delayed because no peer-reviewed scientific journal would accept her study. Instead, Dr Ketchum, from Nacogdoches, Texas, apparently finally self-published her findings on Saturday in the so-called DeNovo Scientific Journal. She is selling the study - entitled Novel North American Hominins, Next Generation Sequencing of Three Whole Genomes and Associated Studies - for $30 through the journal's website. Her rejection by mainstream journals and choice to self publish has, inevitably, raised eyebrows. Dr Ketchum, a veterinarian-researcher claims to have discovered genetic proof which shows Bigfoot is in fact a human hybrid, descended from human women who mated with men of 'an unknown hominin species.' She has said that mitochondrial DNA in her samples, apparently obtained from leftover blueberry bagels eaten by a family of 10 bigfoot's who live in Michigan, show clear evidence of genetic mixing. 'Genetically, the Sasquatch are a human hybrid with unambiguously modern human maternal ancestry,' she said in a statement published last November. 'Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a ""license"" to hunt, trap, or kill them.' The findings are apparently the result . of five years of work by Dr Ketchum's firm DNA Diagnostics. The study . concludes that Bigfoot is a missing link that arose approximately 15,000 . years ago. It is the first . study which claims to have offered any kind of DNA analysis of the . legendary mountain men, also known as Sasquatches. We are people 2: Dr Ketchum hopes her 'proof' of the existence of the elusive hominids will be the first step towards recognising them as an undiscovered Native American group . But Dr Ketchum's decision to self-publish her findings, and charge for them, has raised suspicions in the eyes of many observers. Robert Gonzales wrote on science website i09: 'The site claims to be ""open access"", but charges 30 bucks to access the Bigfoot genome paper. 'It bears mentioning that the Bigfoot genome paper, at the time of this posting, is also the only paper in Vol. 1, Issue 1 of the new journal. 'Seeing as ""open access"" clearly does not mean what these researchers think it means, you’ll forgive us if we remain skeptical when they say their data ""conclusively proves that the Sasquatch exist as an extant hominin"".' A frame of the famous footage purporting to show Bigfoot filmed by former rodeo rider Roger Patterson . According to Fox News, scientists have already issued 'universally scathing reviews' of the paper. The U.S. network said that it appears that Dr Ketchum 'apparently views herself as less of a Bigfoot researcher than a valiant protector of a peaceful, vulnerable, and undiscovered native people'. It points to another of Dr Ketchum's sites, The Sasquatch Genome Project, where it is claimed that '[t]he Sasquatch people are more like us than they are different.' The site goes on: 'The Sasquatch people have their own language, traditions, and rituals. They live in family units, they order their lives according to the laws of their people, and they bury their dead. 'Yet the Sasquatch people are captivating because of their physical, genetic, and cultural differences. 'Sadly, these special traits also make them uniquely vulnerable to those who would see in their unusual lifestyle or appearance a justification to harass, trap, or even kill them. 'Your compassion and understanding will be vital to protect the Sasquatch people.'","Texas vet Melba Ketchum hopes to establish Bigfoot as a protected Native American population .

"A heartbroken family has paid tribute to a teenager who died after becoming the first young person in Britain ever diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Saffron Pedroche, 17, developed goblet cell carcinoma, an aggressive form of lymphatic cancer that normally only affects the elderly. Doctors said they only knew of eight previous cases in the world where the killer disease had struck someone so young. Scroll down to hear from Saffron's mother . Heartbreak: Saffron Pedroche, 17, has died after becoming the first young person in Britain ever diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . Saffron and her boyfriend Dan. The teenager was told at the end of September she had just two weeks to live, but fought on until last month . Despite being told last September she only had two weeks to live, Saffron, a student, bravely held on and fought for four months after being given the terrible news. She died last month with her mother and sister at her bedsideand over 300 people attended her funeral in her home city of Bristol. Saffron had been a normal, healthy . teenager until last August when she went to the doctors with a swollen leg . after fluid started mysteriously collecting. A series of tests came back with the . devastating news that she was in advanced stages of the cancer which had . spread from her stomach to the rest of her body, . At the end of September she was given just two weeks to live. In the elderly, the cancer spreads . slowly, and turns into an easily operable tumour, but because Saffron . was so young, her body tried to fight the disease by creating a mass of . fluid. The painful fluid build-up actually gave the cancer chance to spread to her other organs which resulted in her death. Saffron's mother Donna Sidoli, 48, said: 'She was so strong and brave. When they told us she had incurable cancer I was really shocked and devastated, but Saff just seemed to know her fate. 'The doctors said she was the first young person in the Britain to get this cancer. 'It usually affects the elderly and doctors said they only knew eight other teenagers in the world that had got it and they were in America. 'They didn't know how to treat her - they did their best, but there was no real method for treating an old cancer in a young body.' Ms Sidoli, a cleaner and artist, added that her daughter always had a smile on her face, right up until the end. Worried: Saffron went to her GP after she developed a build-up of fluid in her leg in August. She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lymphatic cancer that normally only afflicts the elderly . 'Always smiling and happy': Saffron's  mother Donna, sister Jade and nephew Danny paid tribute to her . She said: 'She always cheered people up. In every photo she had a smile on her face and she even had a smile on her face when she died. Goblet cells line the internal organs and make mucus. The name refers to the fact they are shaped like miniature wine goblets when examined under a microscope. Goblet cell carcinomas start in the appendix and are a type of neuroendocrine tumour (NET). They typically affect people over the age of 50. The first symptom is appendicitis, or sometimes prolonged pain and an unusual lump in the lower right side of the abdomen. Around 75 per cent of people diagnosed with a goblet cell tumor are alive five years after their diagnosis, highlighting how aggressive Saffron's case was. An important predictor of survival is the initial  size of the tumour and whether or not cells have spread from its original location to other parts of the body. 'She was always looking out for others and was always happy.' Saffron's sister Jade Hackwell, 25, added: 'She was one of life's natural beauties. 'She was so brave through all the messing and treatment. She really did have the right attitude.' Saffron underwent two rounds of chemotherapy but her third course of radiotherapy had to be cancelled because a massive amount of fluid had built up in her body. Her sister added: 'She was carrying so much fluid she looked like she was pregnant - it was so hard around her stomach and legs it felt like wood. 'Her skin was tight and she was quite clearly uncomfortable, but she never complained. 'They put a line into her stomach through her back and drained ten litres of fluid - and did the same from her lungs as well.' Ms Sidoli added: . 'She was a dancer and used to do break dancing, liked DJing and used to . do a lot of rapping. She was a very spiritual person. 'She had a boyfriend called Dan who stuck by her all the way through. 'Most 16-year-old boys you wouldn't trust to stick around through thick and thin, but Dan was brilliant.' Saffron spent her final weeks at St . Peter's Hospice in Brentry, Bristol,  before returning to her home in . Clifton, where she died. Her mother added: 'She was a dancer and used to do break dancing, liked DJing and used to do a lot of rapping. She was a very spiritual person' Goblet cell carcinoid, also known as crypt cell carcinoma, is a rare stomach tumour that ravages the lymphatic system of sufferers. It is a very aggressive form of cancer and usually treated with surgery but because Saffron was so young, the cancer had not formed into a visible lump. Ms Sidoli is now planning to set up a charity to help young cancer sufferers. Saffron's father Juan Pedroche has applied for permission to have a memorial bench for Saffron on picturesque Brandon Hill, which overlooks Bristol.

"She was named after Jamacian singing legend Bob Marley. Some say for her dreadlocks while others argue the Devon long-haired sheep was given the name because her trainer can't get her off the grass. The reggae star's namesake, Bobbie Marley the sheep is one of the top attractions at a unique farm in Devon, dedicated to celebrating the animal. It's Bob Baaa-ley. Adorable Marley the sheep, star of the show at The Big Sheep attraction in Devon, was named after the legendary singer Bob Marley . The colourful ribbons strung through Marley's long curly dreadlocks, is only one of the similarities she shares with the No Woman No Cry singer, who died following a battle with cancer in May 1981. Strutting her stuff in the ring, the seven-year-old sheep mimics his stage presence, relishing her chance in the limelight and performing twice a day at the farm's popular Sheep Show. Trainer Wes Richards, said: 'She's not called Marley because of her dreds, it's because we can't keep her off the grass.' But Anne Tattersall, spokeswoman for The Big Sheep in Bideford, Devon disagrees. She said: 'She was originally named Marley because of her colourful dreds but it has become a running joke that it's because we can't keep her off the grass. 'It gives the adults something to laugh about during the show.' Write caption here . And she said the ewe is a hit with the children in the audience. The marketing manager, who has worked at the attraction for 10 years, said: 'Marley is adorable. 'The kids love her in the shows and when the showman reveals the different theories about her name, it does give their parents a good giggle, while going right over their heads. 'With her long dreadlocks, she looks a bit like a tiny pony. She is really sprightly and loves getting the ribbons in her dreadlocks changed each week.' Mrs Tattersall said Marley is one of a flock of 10 Devon long-haired sheep at the farm. In total there are around 25 different breeds from around the world on show, all bred specially by the team, who celebrated their 25th anniversary this summer. Sprightly Marley relishes her time in the spotlight, performing twice a day at The Big Sheep's daily attraction in Devon . Mrs Tattersall added: 'The Sheep Show is so popular it runs twice a day during the summer. 'All the sheep come out to different music to make it fun and the showman spends time talking about the different breeds, so it is educational and fun at the same time.' She added: 'It is a wonderful place to work, the type of place that makes you not want to work anywhere else.' Mrs Tattersall added: 'At the annual shearing session, the shearer made sure he left her pure wool dreadlocks complete with colourful braids. It's who she is.' The rare Devon long-haired breed produce more wool per sheep than any other breed. They are on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust's watch list, listed as a vulnerable breed. Marley is one of 10 Devon long-haired sheep at the farm.

"A Lithuanian truck driver did a U-turn on the motorway in the middle of the rush hour - because he couldn't pay an £11 toll. Police have released horrifying video footage of the incident last month on the M6 Toll in Staffordshire after the 51-year-old driver narrowly avoided jail for his actions. Leonid Papachin had only been working in Britain for two months when he swung his 40-tonne lorry the wrong way up a slip road at junction T5, near Lichfield. Crazy trucker: This is the moment a Lithuanian lorry driver did a U-turn on the M6 Toll - because he had been unable to pay the £11 fee to leave the motorway. The incident last month was in the middle of the rush hour . Cannock Magistrates' Court heard he had tried to leave the toll motorway at 5.30pm on October 23, but his cash card was not accepted in a payment booth. The Russian speaker attempted to use an intercom but could not make himself understood. Eventually he opted to turn around and drive back up the exit slip road. The Central Motorway Police Group saw the incident unfold on CCTV cameras and officers brought the lorry to a stop a short time later. Papachin appeared in court with a Russian interpreter where he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving last month. Footage: CCTV controllers could only watch as Leonid Papachin's white lorry turned back from the toll booths - where his payment card had been rejected - and drove back up the exit slip road onto the motorway . Approaching danger: The truck comes into sight of the motorway - though it remains on the hard shoulder . Perilous: Papachin, 51, takes his chance to swing out into the road as he attempts to turn his 40-tonne truck . Papachin, who lives in Lithuania, narrowly avoided jail over the incident and was handed a 15-week suspended sentence instead. He was also banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay £85 costs. Chief Inspector Jed White, the manager of the regional motorway patrol, said: 'Unfortunately this type of incident is all too common on the motorway network, especially the M6 Toll, where drivers attempt to avoid charges for using the road. 'On this occasion the driver should have contacted motorway police immediately to help him manoeuvre safely. 'We will always prosecute offenders and, as this case demonstrates, the penalties can be quite severe. 'Our CCTV systems cover the majority of carriageways and are monitored 24/7, so there is no hiding place. 'I hope that it serves as a deterrent to anyone who thinks they can put other motorists in jeopardy by ignoring motorway regulations.' The M6 Toll opened in 2003 to relieve congestion in Birmingham and remains the only privately-run motorway in Britain, with fees ranging from £3 for a motorbike to £11 for an HGV. Feat: Other drivers look on in horror as the lorry makes its manoeuvre across two of the three lanes of traffic . Success! The lorry pulls back into the lane - but it will be just minutes before he has a visit from traffic police . Penalty: The driver admitted dangerous driving and was banned from being behind the wheel for 18 months . Cheeky: The M6 Toll opened in 2003 to relieve congestion in Birmingham and remains Britain's only privately-run motorway. Police said it is common for drivers to try and evade the charges, which range from £3 to £11 .","40-tonne truck veered across lanes after going wrong way up slip road .

"Glowing in the evening sunshine, expectant mother Xynthia Hawke looks ecstatic to be on the verge of motherhood. But days later, the 28-year-old Briton was killed by a doctor, who was reported to have been drunk and to have botched her care during childbirth. Miss Hawke’s devastated parents are believed to have flown to the South of France – where she had been living an idyllic life with her partner – to help him care for the baby boy, who survived and has been named Isaac. Devastated: Yannick Balthazar must now raise his son alone after his partner, Xynthia Hawke, was killed by in a botched caesarean section by an anaesthetist who is said to have been drunk at the time . Fighting back tears outside the home where they settled a few months ago, her French partner Yannick Balthazar, 33, said: ‘It is a very difficult time for us. We are in mourning. I am looking after my family, my son, that is what is important to me now. We need to be with family now. I am going to let justice do its job.’ Miss Hawke required a caesarean section after going into labour last month in Ustaritz, the village in the French Pyrenees where she had moved with Mr Balthazar. After their healthy baby boy was delivered at a private maternity clinic in Orthez on September 26, a resuscitation procedure went horribly wrong. Anaesthetist Helga Wauters, 45, allegedly inserted a tube into Miss Hawke’s oesophagus instead of her windpipe. Miss Hawke was starved of oxygen, had a heart attack and went into a coma. Botched care: Belgian Helga Wauters, 45, has been charged with aggravated manslaughter and faces up to five years in prison . She was taken to the nearby Centre Hospitalier in Pau, where she died on September 30. The doctor, who has admitted a ‘pathological problem with alcohol’, now faces five years behind bars after being charged with aggravated manslaughter. Wauters, who is Belgian, was working despite difficulties with ‘expression, comprehension and reactivity’, according to a local prosecutor. Staff said she was slurring her words to the extent that she ‘could not be understood and she did not seem to understand what people were saying’, a source added. Happy couple:  Ms Hawke and Mr Balthazar pose for a selfie (left) and the pregnant mother-to-be shops in a market just weeks before her death . Beaming: The mother-to-be regularly updated friends on her pregnancy and was ecstatic about having a baby . When questioned on the day Miss Hawke died, Wauters was found to have 216milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood – the equivalent of four bottles of wine. The legal driving limit in the UK is 80milligrams. Miss Hawke grew up in North Petherton, Somerset, where she excelled at her comprehensive, Haygrove School, and won a prize for outstanding achievement in GCSE French. She holidayed in France with her parents Fraser and Clare, now 61 and 56, and her older sister Iris, 30, before moving to Paris to study at the University of London Institute.

Miss Hawke, who worked as a recruiter for businesses looking for multi-lingual employees, updated friends on her pregnancy using social media. Pictures show her beaming during her recent travels through France. In one, she smiles widely in front of a setting sun with a fan cooling her face. Wauters’s lawyer, Florence Hegoburu, warned against any ‘hasty conclusions’, adding: ‘My client will assume her responsibilities in relation to the facts that she recognises, but she is not solely responsible. There are grey areas here, and the investigation will make them clearer.’","Xynthia Hawke, 28, killed by 'drunk' doctor who botched childbirth care .

Shauna Ewing Morgan, 43, were also ordered to pay $13,500 in restitution and were banned from ever owning another pet. The couple was charged with animal cruelty in March after Keith Morgan handed the severely abused 17-year-old dog to an animal shelter, saying he'd found him on the roadside. Police later learned the pair were the dog's owners. Scroll down for video . Cruel: New Jersey's Keith Morgan, 56 (right) and Shauna Ewing Morgan, 43 (left) were sentenced to six months jail yesterday for abusing their dog Sammy . Inhumane treatment: Sammy couldn't walk when he arrived at Red Bank Veterinary Hospital because his fur had become so matted . Neglect: Sammy, short for Samurai, had to be fed by the vets because he was so malnourished . Municipal Court Judge Robert M. LePore said he issued the maximum sentence to deter future animal abuse, according to Asbury Park Press. 'The lack of care in this case is inexcusable. There has to be a deterrent to animal cruelty,' he said. 'This court believes that a message . needs to be sent not just to these defendants, but to all of society . that animal cruelty is a national and global problem and must be . addressed and deterred.' On March 14, Keith Morgan took Sammy to the Associated Humane Societies in Tinton Falls, claiming he saw a driver dump the dog in a plastic bag on Wall Rd. Sammy was malnourished and he couldn't walk because his matted coat was covered in urine and feces. For 24 hours, Keith Morgan was touted as a hero after giving a television interview about how he found the dog. But the next day, police learned from a source the couple had owned Sammy for at least nine years. They charged the Morgans with animal cruelty as Sammy recovered at Red Bank Veterinary Hospital in Tinton Falls. A foster family has cared for the poor pooch since April. Animal lovers, who have been advocating for tougher sentences for animal abusers, cheered in court when the Morgans were sentenced for neglecting Sammy the dog .

An online petition calling on . prosecutors to ask for the maximum sentence for the Brick couple . received nearly 33,000 signatures. More than 100 Sammy supporters, wearing T-shirts with the dog's picture, cheered in court when the couple were sentenced, even though the couple apologized for their actions. Keith Morgan said his poor judgement stemmed from his health issues, which included diabetes, kidney disease and depression. He said he was suicidal at one point. 'I . was in a bad time in my life. I was depressed … because my wife left,' Keith Morgan said, according to NJ.com. 'I apologize, I didn’t mean for this to happen.' Shauna Morgan said she wasn’t . at the home for several months before the incident. 'I . should have foreseen that Sammy wouldn’t have been safe with my . husband, but I didn’t know he was going to get so sick. … If I had . foreseen it I would have taken Sammy with me,' she said. 'I’m sorry it turned out the way it did.' The couple had another dog named Ady who was reportedly in good condition. He is in a foster home. The Morgans intend to appeal the sentence which included a $1,000 fine, $13,500 in restitution to Red Bank Veterinary Hospital, and 30 days community service, in addition to jail time. The judge granted a motion for a stay to allow the Morgans to remain free for the appeal process. Keith Morgan was a hero for 24 hours after giving a TV interview (pictured) claiming he found Sammy, nearly dead, by the side of the road . 'This is what we wanted, this is what . was deserved and it was justified,' Monmouth County SPCA Chief Victor . Amato said. 'This judge did the right thing.'

"Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was showing improved liver function though he remains in critical condition, hospital officials said today, as he was visited by his elderly mother. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a statement on Tuesday saying Mr Duncan is on a ventilator and is receiving kidney dialysis. The hospital said his liver function improved after declining over the weekend but warned that his condition could vary in the coming days. His mother, Nowai Korkoya, arrived in Dallas today after being driven 15 hours by family members from her home in Charlotte, North Carolina to see her desperately ill son. Scroll down for video . Nowai Korkoya (pictured left) traveled from North Carolina to Texas on Monday to be near her son Thomas Duncan (right) who is fighting Ebola . Nowai Korkoya, center, mother of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, is wheeled by the Reverend Jesse Jackson after her family visited her son at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital today . The Reverend Jackson prayed with the family of Ebola patient Thomas Duncan on Wednesday in Texas . Nowai Korkoya prayed with family members and the Reverend Jesse Jackson on Tuesday. Reverend Jackson revealed that the family had asked for his help and his aim was to make sure Mr Duncan was receiving the best possible care. A prayer vigil will be held at the Dallas hospital tonight, Jackson said, as he spoke in Dallas on Tuesday alongside the mother, son and other relatives of the 42-year-old Ebola patient. The civil rights leader also called on the public to show compassion to Duncan and his family, not to ostracize them. Mr Duncan has been receiving doses of an experimental anti-viral drug since Saturday after his condition took a turn for the worse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. In a video message filmed for her son with NBC last week, Mrs Korkoya said: 'I love you. I pray for you to get well. My whole thinking is on you.' Mr Duncan is receiving the drug Brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the disease. The drug, developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix, is approved for the treatment of the herpes virus. His doctors were granted permission by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use the drug after his condition worsened. The FDA grants emergency access to unapproved drugs on a case-by-case basis, usually when a patient faces a life-threatening condition for which there are no alternatives. The agency has not approved any drugs or vaccines to safely and effectively treat Ebola. Mr Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas last Tuesday after recently arriving from Liberia. He flew through Dulles International Airport in Virginia. Two other experimental drugs developed specifically for Ebola have been used in American patients, though it's unclear if they had any effect. The small supply of one drug, ZMapp, was exhausted after being used on a few patients. A second drug, TKM-Ebola from Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, has been used in at least one patient and is said to be in limited supply. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are monitoring 48 people who came into contact with Mr Duncan while he was exhibiting Ebola symptoms. None are showing signs of the virus which has develops between and one and 21 days after an individual has contact with the disease. Ashoka Mukpo, the NBC News cameraman who was diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia last week, arrived on Monday at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, one of four special treatment centers for infectious diseases in the U.S. Mr Mukpo is in the early stages of the disease, doctors said, and is set to receive an experimental treatment. Mr Duncan's family members were seen arriving in Dallas, Texas on Monday to support him as he continues to fight Ebola in a quarantine unit at Texas Presbyterian hospital . Federal officials say they are confident they can stay on top of any more cases that arrive. President Obama on Monday announced that his administration was working on ways to screen travelers for Ebola before they enter the U.S. in an effort to prevent any other people with the virus from entering the U.S. Currently, travelers are only screened in West Africa before they leave the Ebola-stricken nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that he is 'very confident' that America's largest city could quickly contain an outbreak of Ebola. New York has had at least two Ebola scares from ill travelers from West Africa, but lab tests show the patients did not have the disease. Ashoka Mukpo, an American journalist who contracted Ebola in Liberia was flown to Nebraska on Monday and transferred to hospital wearing a full body suit and face mask . Physicians had initially said that his body couldn't handle anti-viral drugs in critical condition and that they were providing only 'supportive care'. Duncan will not be receiving the 'miracle drug' ZMapp that cured American missionaries Dr Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol because there are no more doses of the serum left. The drug takes months to manufacture even very small quantities. Based on early-stage research by the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, brincidofovir has shown that it kills the Ebola virus in the same way it fights the herpes and smallpox viruses. Chimerix and the FDA are working to finalize protocols to begin a clinical trial to determine whether the drug will work in Ebola patients. There is no proven cure for Ebola and currently the disease has a mortality rate of nearly 50 per cent. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved an emergency order allowing the drug to be given to Ebola patients. Tagged and bagged: Workers brought out several items from the apartment.

"California's Hispanic population is slated to become the state's majority ethnicity by the end of this year according to a new report by the governor's office. New ethnicity trends outlined in Gov Jerry Brown's 2013-14 budget proposal revealed the state's expected new majority while reasoning the state’s declining birth rates and increasing migration as causes. As early as July Hispanics are expected to be equal in size to non-Hispanic whites before outpacing them, according to the report, with both demographics in that month reaching 39 per cent of the population. It's a swap that comes earlier than experts had expected. New majority: By the end of 2013 Hispanics are expected to be the new majority demographic in the state of California . Gov Brown, responding to the outlined future of his state, has since proposed shifting more school funding to those schools with more students in poverty and/or don't speak English. Currently 40 percent of the state's students are living in poverty and 20 percent are non-native English speakers he said. With the report having also found the state's Hispanics being predominantly younger than whites - with 19 percent of Hispanics over the age of 50 compared to 43 percent of whites - he said 'this is an aging society and inequality is growing.' Nationally, Hispanics are already the fastest growing demographic, with their demographics seen increasing by 3.1 per cent since 2010. State's future: The new report also finds that the state's Hispanic population is predominantly much younger than whites . More than half of the country’s Hispanic population live within just three states, however, of California, Texas and Florida. State wise, New Mexico has the . highest percentage of Hispanics among their entire population, seeing . 46.7 per cent in last year's census figures. White non-Hispanics make up 40.2 per cent. Among the state's overall figures released, by July . the state's total population is expected to top 30 million after adding . 300,000 or 0.8 percent more than last year. That figure is . uncharacteristically slow for the nation's most populous state, with the . report reasoning a sluggish economy stifling the historically . fast-growing state's population.

"A father discovered his only son had died in a car accident after he first tried to text and then called the 18-year-old's cell phone - which was eventually answered by a cop at the scene of the crash. Johnathan Leonard, 18, was a backseat passenger in a vehicle which crashed on the outskirts of Lexington, North Carolina just three days before Thanksgiving. The accident happened less than a mile from Leonard's home and the boy's father Jeffrey had desperately tried to contact his son after hearing about the crash to check that he wasn't involved. Scroll down for video . Johnathan Leonard, 18, was killed last Monday in a car crash in North Carolina. His father Jeffrey heard about his son's death after an officer at the scene answered Johnathan's cell phone . Backseat passengers Johnathan Leonard, left, and Kayleigh Campbell, right, were both killed instantly following last Monday's crash . After hearing about the crash Jeffrey Leonard texted his son to check that he was okay . 'It's like a nightmare you don't wake up from,' Jeffrey Leonard told WFMY about the death of his only child. His son Johnathan was one of four teenagers driving home from North Davidson County High School when 16-year-old driver Jordan Deal's 1988 Toyota car veered off the road, hit several  trees and flipped over. He was over the speed limit at the time. Backseat passengers Leonard, 18, and Kayleigh Campbell, 15, were both killed instantly. Campbell's older brother, Denzel Caige Campbell, 17, was in the front passenger seat and remains in hospital with critical injuries. Driver Deal suffered only minor injuries and is out of hospital. The crash occurred close to Johnathan Leonard's home and he and his father Jeffrey had been texting just prior to the accident. After hearing about the crash Jeffrey Leonard texted his son to check that he was okay. When Jeffrey Leonard didn't hear back from his son his sent another text urging him to let him know that he was alright . The accident happened less than a mile from Johnathan Leonard's home and the boy's father Jeffrey had desperately tried to contact his son after hearing about the crash to check that he wasn't involved. ‘Where are you?’ read the first message. Three minutes later, he sent another message: ‘John answer me right now. There has been a very serious car wreck below the church... air care is here now... I want to know it isn't you.’ After getting no response, Jeffrey Leonard called his son, and after the second call a police officer picked up the phone and told him the terrible news about his son. ‘In reading the texts, I could tell the father knew something was wrong,’ Sgt. R.C. Abernathy of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol told PEOPLE. ‘I picked up more or less to ease the father's pain of the unknowing.’ Crash scene: Driver Deal allegedly told the police he was driving with the window down and his hair blew in his face, which caused him to miss a turn in the road . Deal has been charged with two counts of misdemeanor death by motor vehicle, careless and reckless driving, a seatbelt violation (because Kayleigh Campbell wasn't wearing a seat belt) and a limited provisional license violation – because North Carolina law states that 16-year-old drivers cannot have more than one unrelated passenger in their car. He is due in court in January to face the charges against him, which are all misdemeanors. Deal allegedly told police that he was driving with the window down and his hair blew in his face, which caused him to miss a turn in the road. According to WFMY, neither grieving family is blaming Deal for the crash, instead calling it a tragic accident and asking the public to pray for all involved. Bambi Torrence, a friend of Kayleigh and Caige's mother, said she was ‘holding up, the best she can’ since the accident.

"The attorney for a 17-year-old girl charged with murder for her involvement in the shooting death of a Utah police officer earlier this year says that his client was forced to participate in the crime by her boyfriend, who was killed in a shootout with police. Meagan Dakota Grunwald's attorney says she was forced by her boyfriend, 27-year-old Jose Angel Garcia-Jauregui, to drive her truck at high speeds after he fatally shot Utah County Sheriff's Sergeant Cory Wride as he sat in his patrol car after he noticed the couple's truck was parked on the side of a highway south of Provo. Wride, who thought the couple's truck had broken down, had stopped to help when prosecutors say Garcia-Jauregui opened the truck's back window and opened fire on Wide. Smiles: Meagan Grunwald has been charged with murder in the death of Utah Sheriff's Sergeant Cory Wride and grinned in court on Thursday . Life: Grunwald is 17, which makes her ineligible for the death penalty. If she's convicted, she faces up to life in prison . According to Grunwald's attorney, Dean Zabriskie, Garcia-Jauregui then ordered his 17-year-old girlfriend to drive. 'Her choices were reduced to either comply or give up her own life,' Zabriskie told reporters on Thursday. Zabriskie claims his client is also a victim of Garcia-Jauregui, who forced her to participate in the crime. Authorities, . however, believe Grunwald was an active participant in the vicious . murder and have charged her with 12 crimes related to the death of . Sergeant Wide and the attempted aggravated murder of Deputy Greg . Sherwood, who was wounded in the attack. Unprovoked: Utah County Sheriff's Deputy Cory Wride was shot dead by Grunwald's boyfriend after trying to help the couple he thought was having car troubles . Crime couple: The chase ended when sheriff's deputies shot Jose Angel Garcia-Juaregui (left) in the head and his girlfriend Grunwald (right)  was arrested. Garcia-Juaregui died the following day in the hospital . Mourning: Family, friends and fellow police officers attend the funeral of Cory Wride in Spanish Ford Cemetery on February 5 . Tragic loss: Wride's wife Nanette (right) is comforted by her son Shea at the funeral . Court document shed light on the dramatic crime spree that ended in death on the I-15 roadway. Wride stopped to help Grunwald and her boyfriend around 1pm because he thought they were having car trouble and wanted to help. Grunwald . was driving the car with her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. She . gave Wride her driver's license but Garcia-Juearegui gave the officer a . false name. Wride went . back and forth between the pick-up truck registered to Grunwald's mother . and his squad car three times, trying to figure out Garcia-Juaregui's . actual identity. It was while sitting in his squad car that Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear window of the truck's cab and started shooting at the officer -- which is when his girlfriend sped off. Wride was killed on the scene. His body wasn't found until 45 minutes later - when a deputy was sent out to check up on him. Deputy Greg Sherwood tracked the couple's truck down around 3pm and attempted to pull the couple over. But Grunwald wouldn't stop, and actually 'aggressively applied the brakes' to shorten the distance between the two vehicles while her boyfriend started shooting. Garcia-Juregui hit Sherwood in the head, critically injuring the officer. Sherwood eventually recovered from the injury and returned home after spending 19 days in the hospital. Chained: Grunwald was handcuffed and shackled at Thursday's court appearance for the preliminary hearing . Attempted murder: Garcia-Juaregui also shot at Deputy Greg Sherwood (pictured with wife Gina above), and critically injured the officer . Recovery: Sherwood spent 19 days in hospital but was finally allowed to go home on Tuesday . After hitting Sherwood, the couple hit another roadblock when their truck crashed after hitting spikes laid on the road near Nephi, Utah. Instead of surrendering to police, Grunwald helped flag down a minivan for her boyfriend to carjack from a woman who was on her way home from a parent-teacher conference. This is just one of the instances prosecutors are using to argue that Grunwald was not being forced by her boyfriend to take part in the crime spree. After abandoning the truck, prosecutors say Grunwald 'on her own accord, follows Mr Garcia-Juaregui after leaving the vehicle without appearing to be coerced by him'. The couple didn't get far with the hijacked car and crashed again on a second strip of spikes. After hitting the spikes, police say Grunwald crossed into traffic and tried to strike another vehicle on purpose. End of the road: The hours-long chase finally came to an end when the couple's hijacked car hit a second set of spikes and they crashed . Juab County sheriff's deputies were finally able to stop the couple when they shot Garcia-Juaregui in the head. Justice: Grunwald has her first hearing scheduled for next Monday. She is being held on $1million . While he was lying on the ground, Grunwald yelled at officers: 'You f****** shot him.' The officers kept the couple separated as they arrested Grunwald and prepared her boyfriend to be taken to the hospital, which displeased a dying Garcia-Juaregui. 'You not going to let me kiss my girl with my last dying breath,' he asked. He died the following day at the hospital . Friends who knew the couple told investigators that Grunwald was carrying Garcia-Juaregui's child and the two planned to marry in August when she turned 18. On her Facebook page, Grunwald posted a . cover photo which reads:' I'm just a girl who is in love with the most . annoying, cutest, funniest, nicest, and completely perfect guy in the . world'. After their . marriage, the couple planned to move to Mexico. They had been living at . Grunwald's mother's home in Draper 'for several months'. Grunwald . had allegedly been buying meth for her boyfriend and tested positive . for the drug after her arrest. Prosecutors have not yet said whether . Garcia-Juaregui had meth in his system during the car chase but drug paraphernalia was found in the truck. Grunwald is due back in court in May. If convicted, she faces up to life in prison. Because she is a minor she isn't eligible for the death penalty.","Megan Grunwald is facing more than a dozen charges for a fatal car chase last month .

"The economic crises in Italy appears to have hit the Mafia because there are fewer businesses to extort.

"Mocking the accents of visitors from India and shouting at Japanese tourists is the kind of service you might only expect from the terminally tactless Basil Fawlty. But now tourism chiefs think Britain’s real-life hoteliers need to be taught how to avoid making such gaffes with foreign guests. VisitBritain, the taxpayer-funded body that promotes the UK overseas, has devised a list of dos and don’ts for the tourist industry. Out of step: Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, couldn't stop himself goose-stepping and referencing the Second World War when he had German guests . Some - such as the warning not to poke fun at Indian accents – border on the blindingly obvious. Others are downright bizarre, with tour operators instructed to avoid putting people from Hong Kong in historic houses or four-poster beds because they are superstitious and may fear ‘a ghostly encounter’. VisitBritain, which receives almost £30 million of Government funding annually, included the advice in research it produces for the tourist industry. Yet, despite their efforts to promote cross-cultural understanding, the quango’s own use of generalisations, such as ‘demanding’ Germans and ‘sarcastic’ Aussies, could be interpreted as offensive. Evoking the famous 1975 episode of BBC comedy Fawlty Towers, in which a goose-stepping Basil repeatedly references the Second World War in front of German visitors, several of the tips relate to acceptable topics of conversation. The guidance says Chinese visitors will not tolerate discussions about money, while Belgians dislike any attempt to talk about their country’s politics or language divisions. Quango: The logo of Visit Britain, which receives £30million from the Government every year . VisitBritain also warns that Australian visitors have a tendency to be sarcastic and their jokes about ‘Poms’ are meant to be endearing. The advice includes tips about body language, with anyone interacting with French tourists urged to avoid excessive eye contact. It also states that Indian visitors are ‘in the habit of shaking their heads’ and instructs hosts to be ‘intuitive’ when determining whether the gesture ‘signifies assent or objection’. Attitudes towards service vary significantly, the guide warns. Indian tourists are described as ‘amiable’ but with ‘a tendency to change their minds’. Holidaymakers from Austria and Germany, meanwhile, are labelled ‘straightforward and demanding’ to the point of sometimes seeming ‘rude and aggressive’. But the most demanding visitors, according to the tourism agency’s guidance, are the Japanese, who expect their every need to be catered for - and anticipated without them saying anything. They also prefer ‘nicer alternatives’ to the word ‘no’. Attitudes to accommodation are also presented as varying widely. Russians are said to be ‘a tall nation’ and tour operators are advised to provide rooms with high ceilings and doorways, while Chinese visitors are said to dislike small rooms far away from the reception area. The advice also warns that Canadians will be offended if they are described as ‘American’. A spokesman for Visit Britain said its profiles of overseas markets were designed to ensure Britain’s hotels, tour operators, visitor attractions and entertainment establishments offer the best service. Joss Croft, marketing director at VisitBritain, said: ‘Our market intelligence reports provide an unrivalled source of information on inbound tourism, allowing British businesses to gain an invaluable insight on key markets globally.’ Tips: The advice given by Visit Britain to members of the tourism industry .","Taxpayer-funded Visit Britain published guidance for the tourism industry .

Dunbar standing on the roof of the vehicle before he fell near Bramley Road in Worthing, East Sussex, and was taken to . hospital by helicopter on Sunday night. Father Ben Dunbar, 26, is fighting for his life in hospital after being critically injured in a 'car surfing' stunt in Worthing, Sussex. A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving following the incident . The van’s driver, a 27-year-old man from Goring, East Sussex, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of drink-driving, driving without due care and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was later bailed until June 24 pending further inquiries. The accident took place outside Mr Dunbar's aunt and uncle’s home. His uncle was said to have been one of the first people on the scene. He realised it was his nephew when paramedics cut off his clothes to reveal Mr Dunbar’s distinctive tattoos of two pistols on his waist. A neighbour said: ‘It appears he was hanging on the side of the van when it came round the corner and was flung off. An officer inspects a Volkswagen Transporter at the scene in Worthing, Sussex. It is thought Mr Dunbar fell off the road when the driver hit the brakes . Paramedics tend to Mr Dunbar after the horrific incident. He is fighting for his life in a coma . Medical staff are said to have spent half an hour with Mr Dunbar before he was taken to hospital . The dangerous craze - which started in the US - sees people attempting to ride on top of vehicles as they speed through the streets. It has swept the UK after videos of car surfers went viral online, and has claimed at least three British lives in recent years. The first recorded UK death was when Andrew Travers, aged 18 years, died after falling from a car in Chesterton, Warwickshire, in June 2007. Seventeen-year-old Chris Findlay died while car surfing on the Isle of Stronsay in Orkney in May 2008. The following year, Stuart Barnes, aged 21 years, and 20-year-old Swedish friend Jimmy Nylund were killed instantly after clinging to the luggage rail of a car as it crashed into a tree on the Swedish island of Munso. ‘The driver of the van was the first one to attend to him. He was on his phone. ‘He was lying in the driveway of one of my neighbours. 'The paramedics were working on him for ages - they were working really hard, trying desperately to save him.’ Paramedics spent more than half an hour with Mr Dunbar, before he was flown to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. Another neighbour in Bramley Road said: ‘It sounds like it might have just been a silly prank that has ended with a young man’s life hanging in the balance.’ Surfing on top of vehicles is a craze which first swept the U.S. before moving to the UK as car surfers posted videos online. Sussex Police have previously warned against the car surfing craze. In . 2011, a 17-year-old boy and 21-year-old man were banned from driving . after being caught on CCTV car surfing in Midhurst, West Sussex. In . 2009, a 19-year-old girl was seriously injured after car surfing at the . sports park in Piddinghoe Avenue, Peacehaven, East Sussex. A . spokesman for Sussex Police said they were still trying to establish . why Mr Dunbar was on the roof of the van - but could not rule out car . surfing as the reason. Sergeant . Stewart Goodwin, of the Arundel road policing unit, said: ‘We would . like to hear from anyone who saw what happened or who may have . information about exactly where the casualty was prior to being . injured.’ The 26-year-old was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital on Sunday night .

"Hotel staffers in North Korea have revealed that Dennis Rodman was drunk, uncontrollable and destructive during one of his recent trips to North Korea. The first public sign that his known substance abuse problems had appeared again came during his caustic interview on CNN but new reports from South Korean papers reveal that people who dealt with him during his trip in December had been keeping earlier problems quiet. 'Rodman was drunk the whole week of his stay. And the night before he left for the U.S., he was drunk unconscious, and vomited everywhere he turned. He even urinated and emptied the bowels in the hallway,' a source told Free North Korea Radio. Path of destruction: Dennis Rodman stayed in the Koryo Hotel in Pyongyang during his December 19 visit to North Korea and now a South Korean paper has released anonymous comments about his behavior . The former NBA star has visited the country four times now and these latest claims- which were published in South Korea- refer to his time at the Koryo Hotel. He was pictured at that hotel during his December trip where he helped train the basketball team, but it was reportedly his drinking during the January visit that prompted him to enter a rehabilitation facility after returning to the U.S. It comes as little surprise that the unnnamed sources told the South Korean paper that Rodman's supposed antics not only reflected poorly on him but also on the country's feared leader. 'The stench was just horrible and people are criticizing not only Rodman, but also Kim Jong-un saying that ""No one in a right mind would be a friend with Rodman. An animal that he is,""’ the source said. He supposedly was given a warning when he left- though it is unclear who issued the warning- saying that he would not be welcomed back until he cleaned up his act. 'Never will you be welcome here without the completion of your alcohol abuse treatment program,' the source told the paper. Earlier reports from Rodman's friends said that the athlete was 'plied with alcohol' as soon as he landed in the rogue state on a subsequent visit, which was timed to coincide with Kim Jong Un's birthday on January 8. Gift: A bottle of vodka with illustrations of Rodman and the North Korean leader was presented to the athlete . Treatment: Dennis Rodman checked into rehab after a trip to North Korea, where he was presented with bottles of vodka decorated with a picture of him and Kim Jong-un . Upon his arrival that time, he was . greeted with personalized bottles of vodka that had pictures of Rodman . and Kim Jong Un drawn on them. Rodman checked into a rehabilitation program after returning to the United States. This is not the first time that Rodman, 52, has received treatment for his addiction to alcohol, having gone through the process in 2008, in 2009 as part of his time on Celebrity Apprentice and a second time later that year as part of the show Celebrity Rehab With Dr Drew. Since entering the New Jersey facility, Rodman gave an interview to CNN's Chris Cuomo where he apologized for his comments during the North Korean trip where he faulted American missionary Kenneth Bae for his imprisonment. Judgment: The anonymous sources cited by the South Korean paper said that Rodman's behavior reflected poorly on the feared North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un . 'I have sympathy - I don't want anyone in any country or anywhere in the world to be hostage for something maybe they did or did not do,' Rodman said in Friday's interview. 'I would do anything ... if they said, ""We'll take Dennis Rodman and we'll let Kenneth Bae go,"" you know what? I'd do that, straight ahead. Take me. I would do that.'","The former NBA star checked into rehab after returning from North Korea to the U.S. in January .

"Sitting on the steps of the now infamous Ivy Apartments in Dallas this is the woman who Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan flew to the States to marry. Seen here for the first time, Louise Troh, 54, is pictured next to her nephew Jeffrey Cole, who arrived in Dallas from Liberia just days before Mr Duncan. Now both Ms Troh and Mr Cole are in quarantine along with her 13-year-old son and a friend. While 42-year-old Mr Duncan's life continues to hang in the balance, District Attorney Craig Watkins has revealed that his office is actively investigating whether or not Mr Duncan will face criminal prosecution should he recover. A spokesperson for the Dallas DA has told MailOnline that he could face the charge of Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon – with the Ebola virus as that weapon. If convicted this carries a jail term of two to 20 years. Prayer: Louise Troh, 54, the 'wife' of Thomas Eric Duncan sitting on the steps of her apartment before with nephew Jeffrey Cole, who is also now in quarantine with her . Hope: Ms Troh told her pastor that she broke down in prayer on hearing Duncan is getting a new drug . Debbie Denmon said, 'We are investigating whether Mr Duncan exposed the public to a deadly virus knowingly which would be criminal intent. We are looking at what he said on record at the hospital and to the people he was with and around.' Ms Denmon revealed that the DA had received several complaints from members of the public angry at the revelation that Mr Duncan allegedly lied on exit documents which asked if he had been exposed to the dreaded virus. Meanwhile, it also emerged that a gofundme site set up to raise money for Duncan and his medical treatment had only seen $50 donated (of a target $100,000) in the six days it has been active - despite the huge publicity his case has raised and the terrible fight for survival he finds himself in. The day before he was due to travel he carried a pregnant woman home when she was desperately sick with Ebola and had been denied treatment at a Liberian hospital. She later died of the illness. Ms Denmon said that this was something the DA was taking 'very seriously'. She said: 'It's the District Attorney’s role to keep the public safe and you just can't have people circumventing procedures and thinking that they can just hop on a plane, lie on documents, from Liberia and just enter the country here in Dallas county thinking that there are no consequences'. Prosecution: Officials told MailOnline that Duncan faces a charge of aggravated assault with a  deadly weapon if he recovers because he lied on forms to come into the country. Pictured here arriving on US soil . The DA has previously successfully prosecuted an HIV positive man who had unprotected sex, while knowingly infected, with the charge currently being considered in Mr Duncan's case. But Ms Denmon added ‘On a humane level we're saddened that somebody is fighting for their life. Here’s someone who tried to help a pregnant woman and your heart does go out to him. 'It would be inhumane to prosecute someone on their deathbed so we're treading very lightly on this one. We're weighing all of that. It's a very delicate matter'. Mr Duncan’s condition remains critical though his family have drawn hope from the fact that he started receiving experimental drug treatment on Saturday afternoon. George Mason, Senior Pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church, where Ms Troh is a member, is in daily contact with the stricken woman as she and her family wait out their 21 days of isolation,. He said: 'I can tell you that Louise just began to thank God and broke out in praise when she heard that they were giving Eric the experimental drug. 'She was so deeply relieved that they could begin that. It has cheered her tremendously.' Earlier Pastor Mason told MailOnline of the family's relief at having been moved from the Ivy Apartments – which Ms Troh describes as an 'apartment of sickness' – to a secret location within city limits. Ms Troh, who has a 19-year-old son by Mr Duncan, left Liberia more than a decade ago after a falling out saw the couple split. It has been reported that they renewed their relationship following a visit by Ms Troh to Monrovia earlier this year. But, although they spoke of marriage Pastor Mason said that they had only actually reconnected recently over the telephone. Support: Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, is comforted by Jesse Jackson who arrived in Dallas today after an invitation from the family to help them . Plea: A gofundme page set up for Duncan has only raised $50 in six days. Many commentors on the page are angry over Duncan's false claim that he hadn't been exposed to the virus before traveling to the US . Care: Duncan's mother, Nowah Gartay, was driven 15 hours from Charlotte, NC, to be by Duncan's bedside . He said: 'Louise hasn't been out of the country in a long time. When they reconnected it was over the telephone. Their relationship had never led to marriage in Liberia but that is what they were talking of when Mr Duncan came here.' Pastor Mason and his congregation have shown nothing but compassion for Ms Troh and her family during their ordeal with the faith community funding their stay in this new location and providing meals and support. But a GoFundMe page set up by Mr Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, has shown a different face to this crisis with just $50 donated since October 1. It reads: 'Mr. Eric Thomas Duncan is the first diagnosed case of EBOLA within the United States. He came to visit with his son and watch him graduate high school. Eric needs your help to assist with the costs incurred by medical treatment. He is fighting for his life in an isolation unit in Texas. Please support his cause in donating to this noble charity. Thanks for your consideration!' Instead of raising funds it has seen criticism heaped upon Mr Duncan by members of the public angry at the alleged lie that allowed him and his deadly virus, into the country. Commentors have largely been unkind and lambasted the 'audacity' of the page. One states that Mr Duncan should be 'charged with attempted murder if he survives'. For now his survival depends entirely on the treatment he is receiving at Texas Presbyterian Hospital. And just who is footing the medical bill that has already run to tens of thousands of dollars remains unclear. MailOnline has put the question to Texas Presbyterian Hospital and is awaiting a response. Meanwhile, Mr Duncan's mother has traveled to be close to her son as he fights for his life against the deadly virus. Nowah Gartay, was driven 15 hours by family members from her home in Charlotte, North Carolina to Dallas on Monday where she hopes to find a way to talk to her son. In a video message filmed for her son with NBC last week, Mrs Gartay said: 'I love you. I pray for you to get well. My whole thinking is on you.' Today Rev Jesse Jackson Sr embraced Weeks and Gartay after he landed in Dallas to help the family. Rev Jackson landed in Dallas this morning having come, he tweeted, ‘Upon request of family #ThomasEricDuncan…to bring comfort& to seek best humanitarian relief America has to offer.’ He spent the morning with community leaders at the South Dallas Café and will lead a prayer vigil outside the hospital at 5pm this afternoon. A spokesman for the hospital said on Tuesday afternoon: 'Mr. Duncan remains in critical condition. His condition is stable. He is on a ventilator and receiving kidney dialysis. His liver function, which declined over the weekend, has improved, but doctors caution that this could vary in coming days. He will continue to receive the investigational medication brincidofovir.' Speaking to MailOnline Dallas City Councilor Jennifer Staubach Gates who represents District 13 in which Vickery Meadows is located complained about the negative stigma that the case has brought the area. She said: 'I've had 15 men come to me today, turned away from their jobs. I've referred them to lawyers through legal aid. They work at various Dallas based companies and have been told not to come back for 21 days unless they can provide a note from the Health Department.' Ground zero: The final clean up of Troh's apartment has been carried out. Duncan was staying there . Safety: Troh and three others who were in the apartment are now at an undisclosed location donated by others . Ms Gates stressed that none of these men were being tracked or traced by the CDC and that none were considered in any way 'at risk'. She said that addressing the fundamental misunderstanding and fear that governs such decisions was her priority in ensuring that an already vulnerable community did not suffer further. She said: 'In order to understand what’s happening you have to understand the community. Vickery Meadows is 3 square miles and 25,000 people living in 94 multi-family complexes. 'It’s a high-density population and the average income is very low. There is a high number of immigrant families and a lot of agencies place refugees there because of the affordable houses.' She said that the cultural diversity which meant that an estimated 40 languages and dialects are spoken in this small area presented real challenges when trying to disseminate vital information. Ms Staubach Gates was instrumental in pushing for the family at the center of the crisis to be relocated from their cramped and contaminated apartment. She said she has spoken to an 'enormously relieved' Louise Troh on Friday shortly before she was relocated. That apartment has now been decontaminated in two phases and at an estimated cost of $65.000. Ms Staubach Gates said she did not know whether the family would ever return to the apartment and that the details of what might happen once their ordeal is resolved have not yet been discussed.","Thomas Eric Duncan could face the charge - which carries a sentence of up to 20 years - if he survives and is charged .

"It is only two by two-and-a-half metres and made entirely from recycled material, but James Galletly is hopeful that someone will call his tiny project home. The multi-purpose space - which features a single bed, a desk and storage shelves, all of which fold neatly away – was inspired by the growing tiny house movement in the United States which is slowly gaining momentum across Australia. 'We made all the furniture fold up and fold down - the backbone of tiny space designing is to make sure everything can be used for more than one thing,' Mr Galletly told Daily Mail Australia. James Galletly plans to auction of the tiny house he built in partnership with The Bower, a recycling centre in Sydney's inner-west . The building is two metres wide by two-and-a-half metres long and will be sold on September 20 . 'So if you flip everything up, you have a space which can fit about four or five people.' The tiny house, which is made from discarded materials including cupboard doors and has lighting that is run by both solar panels and an old car battery, will be auctioned off at The Bower, a recycling centre in Sydney's inner west, on September 20. With the opening bid set between $10,000 and $15,000, Mr Galletly said he originally saw it being used as a studio or bedroom. 'I would like to see it used for a practical use on a day to day basis. I originally envisioned it to be used as an extra bedroom for a family that has outgrown their house,' Mr Galletly said. It features a table, shelves and a single bed - all of which fold away to make room for about four or five people . Mr Galletly said he envisioned the room would be used as a bedroom by a family which had outgrown the house . 'But, I've had a lot of interest from artists and writers that want to use it as their creative space.' The builder constructed the room atop a trailer as a prototype for his next project – a fully functioning tiny home complete with a bathroom and kitchen that won't leave the owners with a hefty mortgage. 'There are more tiny houses to come just after this one sells, and next time I'll make it twice as long with the same width so we can get a kitchen, bathroom and double bed in there, 'Mr Galletly revealed. He said the building project was a prototype for his next job - a fully functioning tiny home with a kitchen and bathroom . 'It's a good alternative housing model that I'd like to see pushed out into the public as viable option,' Mr Galletly said . He hopes that like the movement in the US, home-buyers will be encouraged to live in a less materialistic way while also giving a larger number of people the opportunity to have a roof over their heads. 'It's a good alternative housing model that I'd like to see pushed out into the public as viable option,' Mr Galletly said. 'I'd love to see that idea taken up in Australia. I don't see it as an option for everyone, but it definitely fills the niche for a lot of people that enjoy living in a small space and the simplicity that it has to offer. 'It can also give people who are struggling with some freedom from monetary issues.'

"Cable network HGTV has cancelled reality series Flip It Forward before it even airs after the presenters were exposed as right-wing extremists. Twin brothers David and Jason Benham are the sons of controversial evangelical minister Flip Benham and have a history of preaching against homosexuality, abortion, divorce and Islam. The network, home to a range of home improvement shows, acted after Right Wing Watch reported on the twins' extreme views on a host of issues and David Benham’s stance as an anti-gay activist. Scroll down for video . Twin brothers David and Jason Benham have had their upcoming HGTV show cancelled after their extremist views on issues such as homosexuality were revealed . In 2012 David Benham had led a prayer rally outside of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, NC, in which he told conservative radio host Janet Mefferd that America’s Christian majority must repent for tolerating ‘homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation’ and ‘demonic ideologies tak[ing] our universities and our public school systems.’ He also said his brother had joined him in the prayer protest. YouTube footage also shows David leading protests outside of abortion clinics. On Thursday morning HGTV released a short statement which said that the network had decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers' series. The show had been due to debut in October. The network had announced that it was working with the Benhams on the home-flipping series at a launch in L.A. last month. In 2012 David Benham led a prayer rally outside of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, NC, and spoke out against 'homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation' ‘After a decade of flipping houses for profit, brothers David Benham and Jason Benham now help families buy the homes they never thought they could afford,’ said HGTV when announcing the show. ‘In each episode, the guys help a deserving family find a fixer-upper and transform it into their forever home - with a healthy dose of sibling rivalry between the brothers along the way.’ Ironically at the same presentation, HGTV also announced that it had also given the green light a design competition show from Ellen DeGeneres. The brothers responded to HGTV's announcement with a statement in which they said that they don’t ‘discrminate against people who do not share our views.’ ‘We were saddened to hear HGTV's . decision. With all of the grotesque things that can be seen and heard on . television today you would think there would be room for two twin . brothers who are faithful to our families, committed to biblical . principles, and dedicated professionals. If our faith costs us a . television show then so be it.’ Ironically at the same time as HGTV announced the launch of Flip It Forward, it had also given the green light a design competition show from Ellen DeGeneres . David Benham is married to Lori and has five children, while Jason is married to Tori and has four children. Both brothers live near Charlotte in North Carolina. Their father Flip is leader of the abortion-clinic protest group Operation Save America, which split from the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue in the late 1990s. He baptized Norma McCorvey – the plaintiff in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision – and has protested outside mosques while shouting ‘Jesus hates Muslims’ and blamed the Democratic Party for promoting a ‘culture of death’ that caused the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. He was convicted in 2011 of stalking a Charlotte abortion provider and was sentenced to 18 months probation. Speaking out about the current controversy, he told LifeSiteNews that his family had not been notified about the cancellation before the network's public announcement. ‘We have some contractual obligations to the people we are helping right now,’ he said. He also called the homosexual activist lobby ‘the biggest bully in the country.’ The twins are the sons of controversial evangelical minister Flip Benham, who has been active in the pro-life movement since the early 1980s . ‘There's no one who dares oppose them,’ he said. ‘No corporation would dare stand up to this juggernaut of the homosexual agenda.’ He said his family did nothing to hide their views from the network, which is distributed to 98 million U.S. households. ‘We knew – and so did HGTV – that this was a possibility,’ he said. He was sorry his sons had to pay for the actions of their father. ‘I think of my sons, who have to suffer for the fact that their dad speaks up about the Gospel of Jesus Christ,’ he said. But he held firm: ‘Homosexuality is not a good thing. It destroys those who practice it and nations that approve of it.’ In 2012 while speaking at a North . Carolina rally for a constitutional amendment that would define marriage . only between a man and a woman, David Benham said: 'We have no-fault . divorce; we have pornography and perversion; we have homosexuality and . its agenda that is attacking the nation; we have adultery … while the . church sits silent and just builds big churches.’ Video: David Benham leads protests outside an abortion clinic .","The network has cancelled the upcoming series Flip It Forward after it was revealed that presenters David and Jason Benham have extreme views .

"A former police officer involved in the 1992 arrest of notorious paedophile Peter Righton claims letters found at his home pointed to a child abuse network involving public officials and clergy. Terry Shutt, a former detective constable with West Mercia Police, said five suitcases stuffed with letters found at the property in Evesham, Worcestershire suggested Righton was in touch with an extensive network of individuals who wanted to abuse children. Righton, who died in 2007, was a social work expert and founder member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, who campaigned to decriminalise sex with children. Scroll down for video . Claims: A former detective constable involved in the 1992 arrest of notorious paedophile Peter Righton (pictured) says letters found at his home pointed to a paedophile network involving public officials and clergy . Mr Shutt was working as a detective constable when officers raided the home of paedophile Righton - who was once considered to be one of the country’s most respected authorities on child care. As well as images of child abuse, they found five suitcases full of letters, which Mr Shutt says pointed to be him belonging to a much wider paedophile network. ‘In amongst all the other documentation, there was a definite link to establishment figures, including senior members of the clergy,’ he told BBC’s Today programme this morning. ‘So for me there was a definite feel that this was something bigger than we were looking at locally and that it should have been investigated further,’ he added. Yesterday campaigner Peter McKelvie said he told police in 2012 that West Mercia Police were storing seven boxes of potential evidence about Righton . The Metropolitan Police did investigate the letters, but the now retired Mr Shutt says many of the most important leads were not followed up. He claims it was seen to be more important to protect the establishment. A confidential Hereford and Worcester Social Service report from the 1990s said the letters from Righton’s home suggested links to clergy, civil servants, social services and and education staff, according to the BBC. The Met Police last night it couldn’t comment on the case, but a police source told from the time told the BBC that claims the investigation was deliberately shut down were ‘nonsense’. Yesterday Peter McKelvie, a campaigner who first raised the alarm about prominent individuals engaged in child sex abuse two years ago, said he told police in 2012 that . seven boxes of potential evidence about Righton were being stored by . West Mercia Police. He claims he told officers these boxes might contain evidence of further . abuse by senior members of the establishment.

"Created: . 20:03 EST, 13 April 2014 . Susannah Birch remembers the day her mother prepared her for a ritual Old Testament sacrifice, cutting her throat with a kitchen knife and preparing to roast her in the oven of the family home in the small Queensland town of Dalby. It was the Australia weekend in January 1989, when Birch was two years old and the only child of parents John and Linda Andrew who were Seventh Day Adventists. John knew that Linda had lately been . praying more, but he was utterly unaware his wife was slipping into her . first psychotic episode. Survivor: Susannah Birch wore a tracheostomy on her neck (above) from the age of two until she was 13 years old after her own mother slit her throat and prepared to roast her in the family oven as a a sacrifice in an Old Testament ritual after 'voices' told Linda Andrew to kill her child . Miraculous: Susannah still remmebers her mother 'boiling the knives' for her ritual sacrifice and then coming at her to slit her throat. Father John Andrew (pictured, above, with Susannah in hospital) tearfully recalls seeing her for the first time after the attack when she wrapped herself around him 'like a koala' Linda had apparently been reading the Old Testament book of Genesis, and in particular the verses in which Abraham is instructed to sacrifice his only son, Isaac. 'I can remember her boiling the knives,' Susannah, now 27, said of the fateful day 25 years ago. Her mother had dressed the toddler in clean pyjamas, 'anointed' her in oil as per the Bible passage, and laid her out on a sheepksin rug on a tea chest in the kitchen. 'I remember the knife coming down towards my face and I remember putting my hands up to stop it,' Susannah told ABC Radio National. Linda cut right through her daughter's laryngeal nerves which connected to her vocal cords. As per the Bible story in which Abraham prepared to make his son Isaac a 'burnt offering' on a wooden altar, Linda was preparing to put her daughter into the oven. 'She told me that she’d held Susannah’s head till Susannah turned blue, which was about 40 minutes,' John Andrew said. The voices had told her that it was an impure sacrifice and to put her into the oven straight away. '[But] there must have been part of the sanity still there because she argued with those thoughts and said ""No. She’s not dead yet – I can’t put her in the oven until she’s dead"",' Mr Andrew said. 'She understands that she came out of that psychotic episode and realised – but wasn’t really sure – that she’d done something wrong. So she rang the Dalby police station and said, ""I think I’ve done something wrong – I’ve just cut my daughter’s throat"",' he said. 'I ... remember being on the ambulance bed outside our house,' 'It was a very sunny day and I just have this vague memory of looking down at myself.' Mr Andrew rushed home to find his wife being carted off by police and his daughter to hospital in an ambulance to Dalby Hospital where, luckily, a skilled medical team had been summoned. The police said 'your wife just slit your daughter's throat. [They] asked about my religion and the Lindy Chamberlain case.' Police later 'hushed up' the attack, fearful of attracting the storm of negative publicity which had accompanied the 1980 case in the Australian outback, when a dingo took the infant daughter of Seventh Day Adventist couple Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, and Lindy was jailed (and later exonerated) for 'sacrificing' her baby Azaria. They also wished to protect the family's privacy. Susannah's oesophagus was repaired and she was given a tracheostomy, in which an exterior tube is inserted to allow her to breathe. Despite the excellent medical care which saved her life, Susannah was not expected to talk again. John Andrew still weeps as he recalls the moment he got to see his daughter, who had been flown to Brisbane for treatment. 'The nurse said, ""look, here's your Dad"". She shot round and her arms went straight around me and she latched on like a koala bear and wouldn't let go. She just wanted her Dad.' Susannah can still recall the blue stitches in her fingers, on the defensive wounds when she held up her hands against her mother descending with the knife. 'Six weeks later, at the nurses station, this little squeaky voice started yelling, ""Dad, Dad"",' Mr Andrew said. 'We had no idea she as ever going to talk again. 'For the next three months, I visited Linda and Susanna. I found that very hard, someone you'd known and loved for years and was totally different. 'I was called into a staff meeting and they explained schizophrenia and bipolar and whatever.' As a three-year-old, Susannah began speaking with her father about the incident, saying 'Mum cut my neck' and, with a psychiatrist's encouragement, John Andrew increasingly talked with his daughter about what had happened. After a year in the mental hospital, Linda Andrew returned home. Her husband was told she could make a full recovery. Social services were involved in the family's rehabilitation and Susannah was not left unsupervised with her mother. 'While I was growing up, I wasn't allowed to talk about it,' Susannah said, 'I was too busy playing... at home on my own. I loved reading. I loved learning.' Between the ages of ten and 13, Susannah watched her mother slip into further psychotic episodes and gain the realisation that the attack 'could be her fault and maybe she owed me an apology'. When she was 13 years old, Susannah's parents divorced and she began to open up about what had happened. 'I began telling everyone what my mother did,' she said. Family even joked about it, saying, well at least she didn't roast you alive. 'For a long time I felt I owed my mother something because she was sick and if I didn’t help her, that would make me a bad person,' Susannah told Amanda Gearing of The Courier-Mail. '[Then] I realised I had to look after myself, I kept repeating to myself, ""there's nothing I can't do"".' Susannah had laser surgery to remove her tracheostomy. Prior to that, her father would have to change the tube as often as every three days. The operation allowed her to go to school for the first time. Susannah is now 27 years old. She has a faint scar across her neck and a catch in her voice, testimony to the hard won regaining of her speech, which she did using the top of her oesophagus to generate sounds. She became a writer, operating several blogs and Facebook pages, advocating the right of people who live with those who have mental health issues. In 2005, she met her husband, David, and they now have two young children. It is only now she has been able to speak out publicly about the attack which changed her life, and say that her mother's decision not to take medication for her disorder was her own, not Susannah's responsibility.. 'After 2007, I stopped seeing her [my mother]. Our paths cross, but it's rare. Basically all I wanted her to say sorry. 'It wasn't till I had my own children, I realised I had issues. 'I have a knife phobia and hyper-vigilance, which is similar to paranoia. I'm always looking around me for issues including knives or things close to my face. 'One of the biggest realisations I've had, is if you've every suffered abuse or mistreatment at the hands of a parents, they don't change necessarily ... but it's the best choice for you [to get on with your life].

"More than 100 British Army medics will be sent fight Ebola in Sierra Leone, it has been announced. Personnel from the 22 Field Hospital have been undergoing an extensive training exercise in preparation for their deployment to West Africa. As part of the training they have been wearing full protective suits, treating simulated casualties in make-up. The medics will staff a field hospital established specifically to treat other doctors, nurses and health workers who have caught the disease. Scroll down for video . More than 100 British Army medics will be sent to fight Ebola in Sierra Leone, it has been announced . Personnel from the 22 Field Hospital have been undergoing an extensive training exercise in preparation for their deployment to West Africa . Army Lieutenant Colonel Alison McCourt, right, briefs staff of 22 Field Hospital before the start of training for Operation Gritrock, the humanitarian mission to West Africa . British military doctors and nurses try on the protective equipment they will be wearing to treat Ebola patients at the new hospital . Conditions inside the hangar at Strensall in Yorkshire have been adapted to replicate the conditions medics will face. Army personnel are training in high temperatures wearing protective gear to acclimatise . Their role will not involve treating members of the general public. It is expected they will be sent on their humanitarian operation within the coming weeks. The exercise at Strensall Barracks, York, saw a hangar converted into a mock-up field hospital. Staff from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, will operate a 12-bed facility to treat health care workers. The exercise which is expected to last two weeks has been running for 13 hours every day. Casualties with symptoms or suspicion of the Ebola virus, complete with realistic make-up and prosthetic veins, present themselves to the teams who are dressed in full protective plastic suits and face masks. The lost: A grave marker stands over a new cemetery for Ebola victims outside an Ebola treatment center  near Gbarnga in Bong County of central Liberia . Grave diggers prepare for new Ebola victims. The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa . A U.S. Army soldier watches as a burial team prepares new graves. The United States currently has 348 military personnel in Liberia and Senegal working on combating the spread of Ebola . An Army spokeswoman said: 'They are going through all their procedures and getting atuned to wearing their personal protective equipment, working in quite hot temperatures. 'The training centre, which was geared up to be a replica of Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, can vary the temperature and it is warm in there today. 'The casualties come in and the medics test their procedures and working through using their protective equipment.' International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the Government is continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review after a Spanish nurse tested positive for the Ebola virus in the first known transmission outside West Africa. This woman was so overcome by grief in Waterloo, some 30 kilometres south-east of Freetown, Sierra Leone, she fainted . A woman reacts while volunteers  take away from a nearby house the body of a woman who died of Ebola . The end: Volunteers in protective suits carry  the body of a person who died from Ebola . Volunteers in protective suit bury the body of a person who died from Ebola in Waterloo . A T-shirt with an Ebola awareness inscription is  put to dry with other clothes in Waterloo . Ms Greening told BBC News: 'It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK... but what it does show is why we're right to be working with governments as we are in Sierra Leone to help them combat this disease where... it's spreading so rapidly now.' She added: 'Well, obviously the Spanish authorities are now looking at how this case happened. 'We certainly have incredibly stringent procedures here in the UK; obviously we had our own experience treating Will Pooley and the precautions that clinicians had to take in helping him get back to full health.' As part of the training they have been wearing full protective suits, treating simulated casualties in make-up . The medics will staff a field hospital in Sierra Leone established specifically to treat other doctors, nurses and health workers who have caught the disease . A member of the team tests blood samples during training for Operation Gritrock . And medics donning protective equipment, label their disposable aprons, to aid identification of colleagues . British nurse Mr Pooley, who has been cured of Ebola, is back from a life-saving mission to the U.S. where he gave blood to try to help a victim of the virus. The 29-year-old, from Suffolk, became the first Briton to contract the virus after working as a volunteer nurse in Sierra Leone, which is one of the worst-hit countries of the current outbreak. He was flown back to Britain on August 24 and recovered after being treated at an isolation unit at London's Royal Free Hospital. Ms Greening said it was key to expand the support being provided. A Spanish nurse became the first person to contract the deadly virus outside of West Africa, after she was diagnosed last night. Her husband and three others have been quarantined as a result . She said: 'The UK is helping to build treatment beds, so that we can provide more treatment for more patients... working in communities so that we can catch patients and isolate them at an earlier stage helping the Sierra Leonean government and their ministry of health and their own health system to be able to cope with this disease. The researchers at Northeastern University, in Boston, calculated the countries most at risk in the short term, are: . 'Then additionally we are working with the many NGOs who are on the ground, like Medecins Sans Frontieres to help them do the most that they can do to be part of tackling this disease. 'But, as we are seeing at this point, the disease is continuing to spread and what we need to do is get those transmission rates back under control, but until that happens we will continue to see more infections and a growing number of infections over the coming weeks.' On the possible need for tighter travel restrictions, she said: 'Public Health England has issued Border Force's extremely clear cut guidance on the steps they need to take. 'The World Health Organisation has also issued very clear guidance on the screening that needs to happen for people exiting West Africa, so I think the authorities know what rules are in place, but we continue to keep all of those areas under review constantly.' Leading charity Save the Children warned recently Ebola is spreading at a 'terrifying rate' with the number of recorded cases doubling every week. Speaking at a conference in London co-hosted with Sierra Leone last week, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for more financial aid, doctors and nurses. Scientists have warned that the deadly virus could spread across the world infecting people from the U.S. to China within three weeks. There is a 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the UK by October 24, a team of U.S. researchers have predicted. A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks . Using Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world. They estimate there is a 75 per cent chance Ebola will reach French shores by October 24. And Belgium has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14 per cent each. Professor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research, said: 'This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities – but those probabilities are growing for everyone. 'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky. 'Air traffic is the driver. 'But there are also differences in connections with the affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), as well as different numbers of cases in these three countries - so depending on that, the probability numbers change.'","Personnel from 22 Field Hospital in York in training for humanitarian mission .

"When Alysia Montano, 28, crossed the finish line in an 800m race last Wednesday, the crowd gave her a standing ovation. As I watched them leap to their feet to cheer the Olympian, the fastest 800m runner in the U.S., I was baffled by their applause. Montano is 34 weeks pregnant, her unusually small bump crossing the finish line in front of her. Afterwards, the mum-to-be said she 'deserved' to take part in the race. Her medical team had approved of her decision, which she claimed was all about empowerment. Baby on board: Alysia Montano taking part in an 800m race when 34 weeks pregnant . But as I watched her stride confidently around the track, all I felt was horror. Watching her race was almost as shocking as seeing a pregnant woman light a cigarette. Instinctively, I felt that this was a selfish act. Where will it all end? Pregnant heli-skiing? Pregnant  sky-diving? Bump-tastic Strictly Come Dancing? And how does it make other pregnant women feel? The non-superwomen among us who can't make it to the third step of the stairs in our first trimester without an arm to lean on and a fresh supply of nibbles? Can we bear any more Alpha females to measure ourselves against? Any more giant shadows to walk in on our path to motherhood? Super mum: The U.S. athlete shows 'running like a girl' means being strong . Sprint 800m six weeks before giving birth? I struggled to get my flip-flops on in less than an hour when I was pregnant. But maybe my instantly negative reaction was wrong. Maybe I was judging Alysia harshly when, actually, I should praise her, if only to smooth the path through life of my three daughters, who I hope will one day be mums, too. Now that my eldest is nearly 12, I'm beginning to imagine her as an adult - and it's terrifying. Only ten minutes ago I was blowing raspberries on her chubby baby thighs and sniffing her soft, gingery head as she slept on me. I would hate other women to criticise any of her future decisions. After all, Montano is a career athlete; she was simply doing the job she has trained for all her life. It's her body and her baby (her husband backed her up), so surely I shouldn't even question her decision as aggressively as I did? I was still contemplating this later in the week when a video called 'running like a girl' became a news story. My moody pre-teen daughter and I watched it together, given that it was doing the rounds at her school. Business as usual: Montano, right, pictured running in the 2012 Olympics, has grown up doing sport . The three-minute film shows how the phrase 'like a girl' turns from being a positive description for any female under 13 to an insult for anyone over that age, undermining the confidence of a generation of young women. It showed pre-teen girls racing their hearts out to demonstrate what the phrase meant and older girls performing some form of parody of Alan Carr prancing about on stage. 'I do everything like a girl because I am one,' my daughter said, a little confused by the debate. What a shame we have to keep reminding ourselves that being a girl does not mean being weak. If you made a film called 'giving birth like a girl', it would be pretty obvious how far from feeble women really are. So I have reversed my opinion of sprinter Alysia Montano. She has become a hero in our overwhelmingly female household for giving new meaning to the phrase 'running like a girl'. Although Mr Candy did point out that pregnant women are prone to making inexplicable and unusual decisions. He used the phrase 'unstable', which I chose to ignore on this occasion. 'If you recall,' he continued, with no thought for his own safety, 'you spent the last week of your first pregnancy up a stepladder painting a ceiling until the early hours, or checking the skirting boards for holes in case a rat could get in and steal our baby. 'You put the phone in the fridge every day, left your keys in the front door several times and once walked to the shop without your shoes on. If someone had asked you to run an 800m race, you may well have said yes, too.'","I was initially concerned when I saw pregnant Alysia Montano running .
She completed an 800m race when 34 weeks pregnant .
Now I've realised what a hero the U.S. Olympian is .

"Americans have started to use the word 'queue' instead of 'in line' - and its all because of Netflix. Queue, widely used in Britain, is also common in the technology community in both countries. Now Netflix, an American company which has 33million members who stream movies and TV shows on demand, has chosen to use the word to describe the line-up of videos, it has started to cross into the vernacular. List: Netflix members have to upload a movie or TV programme into a 'queue' when they want to watch it . The reason stems from the sites system where, if a user wants to watch a video, they have to upload it in a 'queue'. Before, Americans referred to a queue as a 'line' and referred to people queuing as people 'waiting in line'. Almost the only time they would have encountered the word previously would be in technology, such as a printer queue. Lynne Murphy, a reader in linguistics at Sussex University said: 'There is more of a trend towards British words being used in America. 'The Netflix queue, like a printer queue or a queue on a phone is a virtual queue, and that usage is pretty well established in computer jargon. This looks like an extension of computer jargon.' Despite sharing a common language, Britain and America sometimes do not use the same words when talking about one thing. Here are some examples: . Dumpster (US) v skip (UK) Truck (US) v lorry (UK) Trunk (US) v boot (UK) Grading (US) v marking (UK) - exams/papers . Hood (US) v bonnet (UK) Pacifier (US) v dummy (UK) Diaper (US) v nappy (UK) Stroller (US) v pram (UK) Trash (US) v rubbish . Tank top (US) v vest (UK) Vest (US) vs Waistcoat (UK . According to New Republic, in Google searches in the U.S. since 2004, the word most commonly associated with 'queue' is 'Netflix,' Orin Hargreaves, lexicographer at the University of Colorado Boulder told the site: 'A lot more words travel back and forth and get established in the other dialect than they ever did before, mainly because of media and the Internet.' Hulu, another streaming site, has introduced its own 'queue' function, and Amazon has adopted the term, too, inviting users to advertise the books they plan to read in a 'Book Queue.' In the media the New York Times has used 'queue' in reference to Fort Lee traffic, SXSW registration, and patrons of a San Francisco restaurant. The Washington Post also used it to refer to check-in lanes at Reagan National Airport in. Reporter Lori Aratani wrote, the 'long narrow hallway' at Terminal A 'limited the number of passengers who could queue for screening.' Drama: The site has attracted 33million members since it was founded in 1997 and has produced its own shows including American political drama, House of Cards . Star-studded: The series, starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, was given four Golden Globe nominations, the first major accolade for an online-only series . Orange Is The New Black was also released exclusively on Netflix. It is a comedy based on a woman's experience in prison . Netlfix have renewed the programme, which stars Taylor Schilling, for a second series and is due to start later this year .","What used to be a 'line' in the US is now being referred to as a 'queue' which is used in the tech world and by the British .
Users of the online video service, not used to the word, would ask: 'What is my kway-way'
American use of the phrase was largely limited to the technology community beforehand .
Oxford English Dictionary says the word dates back to 1837 ."
"Aston Villa keeper Brad Guzan sprang to the defence of manager Paul Lambert despite the Scot coming in for the heaviest criticism he has received yet from Villa fans. Chants of ‘We want Lambert out’, ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’ and ‘We want our Villa back’ emerged during this desperate display at Leicester. But Guzan believes the players deserve to take the flak, not Lambert, due to their performances which have yielded just 11 goals in 21 Premier League games. Aston Villa keeper Brad Guzan, in action on Saturday, has sprung to the defence of manager Paul Lambert . Villa fans appeared to lose patience during Saturday's loss with some chanting 'We want [Paul] Lambert out' ‘When you go through difficult times everyone has got to take their criticism,’ he said. ‘The manager has been brilliant in defending us but we are the ones who have to score goals. He can’t go and score for us and the coaching staff can’t score for us. ‘Us players have to take responsibility and I know the fans are unhappy, we hear them during the game, but they need to realise it’s a difficult moment for the players and fans but we need to stick together. ‘Regardless if they are unhappy with the manager or situation, we need to stick together and work hard in training because it’s about the club. Christian Benteke, riding a challenge during Saturday's defeat, has struggled with injuries this season . ‘We are trying to score goals. We’re not purposefully going out there saying, “Let’s just keep the ball and forget about trying to go forward”.’ Paul Konchesky’s goal in first-half stoppage time was enough to condemn Villa to defeat. They could have conceded many more but Guzan was sensational in goal. At the other end, Villa’s goal drought is now longer than six hours. In fact, they did not even test Leicester goalkeeper Ben Hamer. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert looks frustrated during the 1-0 loss to Leicester on Saturday . Lambert again insisted he would not walk away from this job but many more performances like this and it can only be a matter of time before that decision is taken out of his hands. ‘I’ve always been used to pressure,’ he said. ‘I have to fight it off again. There’s only two ways you can meet a fight, head on or run away from it. I’m not one to run away from things.’ There was controversy late on as Matty James and Ciaran Clark were both red carded, the former for challenging Jores Okore and the latter for his part in a melee, and the pair had to be separated leaving the pitch. Nothing, however, could take away from Leicester’s performance which saw them move to within three points of safety. Konchesky even claimed his goal, just the 16th of his career, was the most important he has ever scored. The former West Ham defender said: ‘Every goal for me is memorable, but I can’t think of a more important one in my career, and that includes scoring in the FA Cup final nine years ago.’","Leicester beat Aston Villa 1-0 in a fiery Midlands derby on Saturday .

"When actress Kelli Maybank took her final bow at the end of the pantomime Sleeping Beauty, she thought all the surprises were over. But little did she know, her boyfriend had been nervously waiting backstage so he could come on and propose to her in front of the audience after the final bow. Kelli, 29, is playing Prince Percival of Percatania in the production at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham. Scroll down for video . Actress Kelli Maybank, 29, was stunned when her boyfriend proposed onstage following her performance . Kelli had been playing the Prince in Sleeping Beauty at the Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham . Boyfriend of 10 years, Mark Grunsell, unexpectedly appeared on stage with flowers and a diamond ring . She was on stage with the rest of the cast taking their final bow when Mark Grunsell appeared with a bouquet of flowers - and a diamond engagement ring. Mark popped the question and the audience burst into cheers and applause when Kelly said yes. Afterwards, still in her tricorn hat and thigh high golden boots, Kelli, said: 'I was a bit shocked. My heart was pounding when I saw him. I thought, Oh God, here we go.' 'I knew I was going to say yes. 'I wanted to cry, but I had to hold it together, because I was in costume. 'I didn't have a clue he was planning this. Kelli admits: 'I was a bit shocked. I knew I was going to say yes. I didn't have a clue he was planning this.' Mark planned the romantic proposal with the help of Kelli's best friend, Laura, who was on hand that night . Kelli reveals that although they'd been together for a decade, she didn't push for a proposal . 'I couldn't kiss him properly though, because my hat was stuck firmly onto my head so it didn't come off during the show.' The couple, who met through friends, and conducted their relationship long distance for three years, are planning to get married in 2016 in the church used previously by members of her family. Kelli added: 'We've been together for nearly 10 years. At around eight years in, I did wonder when he would propose, but I was never one of those girlfriends to force things.' All of Kelli's closest friends and family were in the audience for her - very fitting - fairytale proposal . Mark opted to propose to Kelly (second from right) on stage because he didn't want to do anything obvious . Mark arranged for Kelli's close family and friends to be in the audience for the big deed, after clearing it with the Everyman Theatre. Self-confessed unromantic Mark, 33, who runs a delivery franchise, said he decided to propose on stage because he didn't want to do anything obvious. He said: 'We've been together a long time and it seemed like a fun way to propose, as life with Kelli is always a drama. 'It was easier to do this than to do it at a table in a restaurant. I would feel awkward doing that. '[On stage] seemed like a fun way to propose,' Mark explained. 'Life with Kelli is always a drama.' Following Mark's impromptu proposal, the pair returned to their native Dorset for an engagement party . 'I couldn't have done it without the help of Kelli's best friend, Laura. 'I did check, through Laura and Kelli's family, how likely she was to say yes. I had a quick second thought when that was brought up.' The couple, who have two Yorkshire terriers, named Poppy and Daisy, have been celebrating ever since; guzzling champagne at the theatre on Saturday and returning to their native Christchurch in Dorset for an engagement party. The director of the pantomime, Phil Clark said: ' At last fantasy meets reality! Whoever said fairytale endings don't come true? Anything can happen in panto!

"Manuel Pellegrini revealed who he believes is the best player in English football... and surprisingly it wasn't his Manchester City star striker Sergio Aguero. In fact, the City boss confessed it is actually Arsenal talisman Alexis Sanchez who is proving to be the best in the country, following his brace and assist in his side's 3-0 win over Stoke on Sunday. Speaking with AS, the 61-year-old Chilean highlighted just why he thinks his compatriot is the hottest property, having provided 12 goals and seven assists for the Gunners since his £32million transfer from Barcelona last summer. Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring his second goal in Arsenal's 3-0 defeat of Stoke on Sunday . Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini claimed that Sanchez was the best player in English football . 'Every game I see him making a great effort, showing great commitment, ambition and the maturity needed to keep improving year after year.' Pellegrini said. 'I'm happy for him because at this time he is the best player in English football.' Pellegrini's comments may have surprised some sections of supporters at the Etihad - considering his very own striker Sergio Aguero netted 14 times for his club before being hit with a knee ligament injury in December - but he could not deny the talents of the former Barcelona number 9. 'I always thought [he was going to be world class]. The only thing you could criticise him for before was that he didn't score enough goals. 'He wasn't a scorer. But he has improved this a lot in the last two campaigns.' Despite a slow start to his career at the Catalan giants, Sanchez ended his final season at the Nou Camp with 19 La Liga goals to his name before making the switch to north London. Sergio Aguero (right) returned to action at Everton on Saturday after a month out with a knee ligament injury . 'Alexis has progressed in recent years. His spell at Barcelona has been very useful for him as well as sharing a team with great players.' Andrew Cole - 18 goals, 4 assists . Kevin Phillips - 19 goals, 2 assists . Alexis Sanchez - 12 goals, 7 assists . Eric Cantona - 10 goals, 9 assists . Sergio Aguero - 14 goals, 4 assists . The Chilean international's immediate impact in the Premier League is certainly making him stand out from the crowd. The 26-year-old's exploits after his first 20 games in England's top flight are third only to those of Andrew Cole (Newcastle United) and Kevin Phillips (Sunderland), who were directly involved in 22 and 21 goals respectively compared to Sanchez's 19. Interestingly Aguero sits fifth in the same standings, behind former Leeds and Manchester United forward Eric Cantona. Pellegrini's comments will surely spur the Argentine on to regain the form he showed prior to his injury after his goalless return to action on Saturday when he came off the bench in the 1-1 draw at Everton.","Manuel Pellegrini revealed Alexis Sanchez is the top player in England .

"Dawn Jewell with her beloved horse before he was killed . A mutilated pet horse found knifed to death by its owner may have been sacrificed as part of a Satanic ritual, police today revealed. Two-year-old stallion Eric was found dead in a field in Stithians, near Falmouth, Cornwall, with his right eye gouged out, his teeth removed, and his testicles sliced off. Officers are now investigating the possibility that Eric was killed as part of a Satanic ritual as his death occurred on the same weekend as St Winebald Day. Niche Satanic websites describe St Winebald Day on Saturday, January 7, as a date for 'blood rituals, dismemberment, animal and human sacrifice' in the Satanic calendar. Another pony, called Barney, in Carmarthenshire was . also attacked and killed in similar circumstances to Eric over the same weekend - and investigators haven't ruled . out that the killing could also be connected to Satanic worshipers. Devon and Cornwall Police Inspector, . Chris Strickland, said: 'There are many lines of inquiry but this is . obviously one line we're going to pursue. 'We will be keeping an open mind until more information comes to light.' Eric was attacked over the same weekend as the Satanic festival, between 4pm on . Sunday and midday on Monday, when the horse's owner, Dawn Jewell, . discovered his mutilated body. Sunday night also saw a full moon - which also holds significance for Satanic rituals. Inspector Strickland added that he was aware of . discussions on internet forums linking the killing to a Satanic ritual and admitted this was a 'strong possibility' but insisted police also had . other leads. He said: 'I have done my own research on the internet and there are people out . there who have these beliefs and so that is a strong possibility, but . there are other leads we have got as well and other possibilities or . motives.' Officers search for clues on Dawn Jewell's land after her prized stallion was killed in a similar attack . Eric's owner said she was devastated by what had happened to the horse she had raised from a foal. Her mother, Vivien Allaway, said they were both 'well aware of rumours and speculation about Satanic links. She said: 'It's not based on fact, but it's plausible so we can't dismiss it'. Initial post-mortem tests were carried out on Erik and a full forensic examination will . be conducted. Dyfed-Powys Police have revealed they are also investigating an attack on a . pony in Carmarthenshire on January 5, which saw the animal suffer similar . injuries to Erik, where its eyes had been gouged out. Seven-year-old Barney the pony was found butchered in a field when his owner went to feed him. Both of his eyes had been gouged out, his stomach slit open, an ear cut off and his genitals removed. Barney's owner, 64-year-old Linda Vickerage, was unable to move his body straight away and left his corpse in the field where he was found. Similar attack: A horse was found mutilated in Cornwall on Sunday, its genitalia removed, an eye cut out and teeth pulled out . She said: 'When I came home in the . evening I thought there was something wrong. I went to the field with . the torch, and to my horror I could clearly see he was dead. 'I shined the torch on his face, his eyes had been pulled out and there was blood pouring from his abdomen. 'You can see a knife has been deliberately used to open his guts, it’s done with almost surgical precision.' In a bizarre twist, police believe . Barney's killer came back the following night and carried out further . mutilations on the pony. Ms Vickerage's 38-year-old daughter Nicola is now offering a £3,000 reward for information about the attack on Barney, which happened on her mother's smallholding in Whitland, West Wales. A Devon horse lover Graham Rickard has also offered a £2,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the attacker. Police are investigating the . attack along with the RSPCA. One line of inquiry will be to see if . someone has a grudge against the horse or his owner. RSPCA . spokesman Jo Barr said yesterday: 'This is a shocking incident and I . cannot imagine what would cause someone to carry out such a cowardly and . barbaric act. 'I would urge anyone with information to contact either the police or the RSPCA.' St Winebald Day is traditionally a small Christian festival in December celebrating the work of its namesake St . Winebald, who was an Anglo-Saxon Benedictine Abbot and Missionary, and . led a seven year pilgrimage to Rome followed by a mission to Germany . where he founded a monastery and Heidenheim. In . recent years, small Satanic groups have marked the St Winebald Day as . January 7, and associated the date with animal sacrifice.

"Chris Kyle hesitated the first time he killed a person at long range with a rifle. It was a woman who was about to attack a group of US Marines with a hand grenade. The US Navy SEAL was overlooking an Iraqi town from a shabby building as US forces were still invading the country, before Saddam Hussein had been ousted. The Marines didn't see the woman coming. 'Take a shot,' Mr Kyle's chief told him. Mr Kyle stammered: 'But...' 'Shoot!' the chief told him again. Making the shot: Chris Kyle takes aim from on top of an overturned crib during the Second Battle of Fallujah . Four tours: During his time in Iraq, he gained infamy among the insurgents, who nicknamed him 'the Devil of Ramadi' and put a $20,000 price on his head . When Mr Kyle finally pulled the trigger, the woman dropped the grenade. He shot her again as it exploded. But after four deployments to Iraq, he learned to stop hesitating and start shooting straight. With 255 kills, 160 of them officially confirmed by the Pentagon, the retired Navy Seal sniper is the deadliest marksman in US military history. During the Second Battle of Fallujah alone, when US Marines fought running battles in the streets with several thousand insurgents, he killed 40 people. His feat blows away the previous . American record of 109, set by Army Staff Sgt. Adelbert F. Waldron . during the Vietnam war. Carlos Hathcock, the famed Marine sniper who was . the subject of the book 'One Shot, One Kill,' killed 93 people as a . long-range sniper in Vietnam. Telling his story: Mr Kyle (left) has just written a book about his experiences in Iraq called 'American Sniper.' It will hit bookshelves Tuesday . Despite . the incredible number, Mr Kyle is still far from being the deadliest . marksman in the world. That distinction goes to Simo Häyhä, a Finnish . soldier who killed 542 Soviet soldiers during World War II. Chris Kyle's 255 kills set a record among American marksman and his 2,100-yard shot is unbelievable. But snipers around the world have surpassed him in other ways. Mr Kyle is a cowboy from . Odessa, Texas, who was a professional bronco rodeo rider before he . joined the Navy. He grew up hunting deer and pheasant with a rifle and a . shotgun his dad bought him. He never realized he was a good shot until he joined the Navy and got into the prestigious SEAL special operations unit. For . his deadly track record as a marksman during his deployment to Ramadi, . the insurgents named him 'Al-Shaitan Ramad' -- the Devil of Rahmadi -- . and put a $20,000 bounty on his head. 'I . thought to myself, “Oh, hell yeah!” It was an honor,' he told Texas . Monthly magazine when Army intelligence told him about his infamy. But his Navy SEAL companions gave him a different name 'the Legend.' His . most legendary shot came outside Sadr City in 2008 when he spotted an . insurgent with a rocket launcher near an Army convoy -- 2,100 yards . away. At that distance, 1.2 miles, he fired a shot from his .338 Lapua Magnum rifle. It struck home, knocking the man over dead. 'God blew that bullet and hit him,' Mr Kyle told the New York Post. Mr . Kyle's preferred weapon, though, was a custom-built bolt action rifle . with a powerful scope. It was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum, a . cartridge originally developed for hunting North American big game. However, Mr Kyle said he has found a new use for it -- making long range, highly accurate shots. 'I could hit a target from 1,800 yards, and it would shoot like a laser,' he told Texas Monthly. Long shot: Mr Kyle poses here with the rifle, a .338 Lapua Magnum, he used to kill an insurgent from 2,100 yards away outside Sadr City . Mr Kyle, who retired from the Navy after 10 years of service, is telling his remarkable story as a deadly marksman in his new book, 'American Sniper,' which hits shelves Tuesday. For his valor, he received three Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars with Valor, according to his book publisher, Harper Collins. Additionally, he was shot twice and was in six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat across the country. Grateful nation: Kyle receiving an award from the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs . The action was enough that the members of the unit adopted the white skull of the gun-wielding comic book vigilante The Punisher. They painted the symbol on their body armor, their vehicles and even their weapons. Despite the astonishing number of people he has shot, Mr Kyle says he has never second-guessed himself since the first time he had to pull the trigger on the grenade-wielding woman in Iraq. For him, the enemy is a 'savage,' he told the Post. 'It was my duty to shoot the enemy, and I don’t regret it. My regrets are for the people I couldn’t save: Marines, soldiers, buddies. I’m not naive, and I don’t romanticize war. The worst moments of my life have come as a SEAL. But I can stand before God with a clear conscience about doing my job,' he told Texas Monthly. He left the service in 2009, deciding not to enlist in order to 'save his marriage' he told his publisher. Mr Kyle has two children and lives in Dallas. Since leaving the Navy, he has started his own military contracting firm, Craft International. It provides military and law enforcement sniper training, as well as private security and protection.","Served four tours of duty in Iraq, where he gained the nickname 'The Devil of Ramadi' from insurgents .

"Fitness guru Richard Simmons's close friends have lashed out at his spokesman's claims that he is not clinically depressed following a knee injury and the death of his pet dog, arguing: 'He is not ok.' On Friday, Simmons's longtime spokesman, Thomas Estey, said the 66-year-old - who has not been seen in public for months - is 'sad' that the 'serious' injury to his knee has sidelined him professionally . However, he shot down earlier claims the star had become a recluse in his Hollywood mansion due to 'paralyzing depression' over his poor health and the death of his beloved Dalmatian, Hattie, aged 17. 'He is not clinically depressed or a shut-in or a recluse,' he declared. But now, Simmons's friends have disputed Mr Estey's comments on his welfare, saying a number of reasons have led them to believe that 'something dire' has happened to the eighties guru. Scroll down for video . Fitness guru Richard Simmons's (pictured) close friends have lashed out at his spokesman's claims that he is not clinically depressed following a knee injury and the death of his pet dog, arguing: 'He is not ok' They told TMZ that the last contact any of them had with Simmons was on March 10 and even when the mother of one of his closest friends died a few months ago, he failed to contact her. Furthermore, Simmons was reportedly close with actress Joan Rivers, who died from complications of routine throat surgery in September, yet did not attend her funeral. One friend, who did not wish to be named, told the celebrity news site: 'There is no way he wouldn't have gone to her funeral if he was ok.' Simmons has also apparently abandoned his exercise studio, where he was regularly a fixture, and has failed to contact friends and family to inform them he is well. 'If Richard is really ok and is aware people are extremely concerned about him, he'd pick up the phone and tell them to relax. But he hasn't, and we're worried sick,' the friend said. Despite their concerns, Simmons's friends said they did not believe his knee injury, not Hattie's death, would have ultimately driven the star to cut himself off from the outside world. On Friday, Simmons's longtime spokesman, Thomas Estey, shot down claims the 66-year-old had become a recluse due to 'paralyzing depression' over his poor health and the death of his Dalmatian, Hattie (pictured) MailOnline talked to Simmons' housekeeper outside his Los Angeles (above) home on Thursday, and she said he is 'perfectly fine' and not depressed as previously reported. 'He's home and he's fine,' she claimed . On Saturday, Simmons tweeted: 'Thank you again for allllll your kindness.... remember to work out today!!!' They believe there must be another - unknown - reason. In his statement to the New York Daily News on Friday, Mr Estey suggested that Simmons may be using a disguise to venture out in public without being seen. 'If he needs to wear a disguise, he’ll wear a disguise,' he said. 'When you’re Richard Simmons, it’s not easy to get away with anonymity.' He also addressed claims that Simmons is depressed over the death of Hattie - his last surviving Dalmatian who he reportedly took out with him in LA and treated like a child - and his knee injury. According to a source, who spoke to TMZ, Simmons is in desperate need of a knee replacement and risks never being able to exercise again if he continues to avoid the routine procedure. A woman is pictured standing behind a gate at Simmons' Los Angeles mansion on Thursday, November 13 . Earlier this week, Simmons took to Facebook (above) to thank fans for their 'outpouring of love and concern' But Estey said: 'The truth is very simple, he has a knee injury, and it’s serious enough to keep him from doing what he loves most: exercising and motivating others. '[But] he is not clinically depressed or a shut-in or a recluse. [Hattie] passed away a year and a half ago, it’s not the issue. And he hasn’t lost weight recently either.' Simmons's housekeeper also denied claims that the star is suffering from 'debilitating depression', saying he is 'perfectly fine'. Speaking to MailOnline, the housekeeper, named Teresa Reveles, who is allegedly tasked with turning friends or associates away when they come to visit him, said: 'He's home and he's fine.' It comes as Simmons himself has taken to social media to thank fans for their 'outpouring of love and concern' following the surprising news of his well-being. In a post on his official Facebook page he said: 'I am so touched by the outpouring of love and concern that I have received today. I have had a tough time dealing with this injury, as it is keeping me from doing what I truly love to do and that is to teach classes around the world.' And on Saturday, he tweeted: 'Thank you again for allllll your kindness.... remember to work out today!!!' Simmons pictured at a students' exercise symposium in 2004, wearing his trademark shorts and tank top. The eccentric entertainer hasn't been seen in public for almost a year . Reynold Gideon, who lives directly opposite, tells MailOnline exclusively that Simmons' housekeeper is adamant the sparkling fitness fanatic is merely 'resting'. Mr Gideon confirmed that Simmons had issues with his knee but believes he's doing well and is most likely to be working on something new, he understands from many conversations with the gym guru's staff. Mr Gideon explained: 'I think he's working on a new project, he's constantly recreating himself because the man has so much energy. He's a wonderful neighbor to have.' Since his 80s heyday Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair . 'He told me about a knee problem months ago but I've not seen him since so I don't know of any updates with it,' Mr Gideon explained. One concerned neighbor pulled over their vehicle to ask MailOnline if the dazzling star had died, such is his absence in the community. The woman, who declined to be named, enquired: 'Is he dead? We're all quite worried, nobody has seen him in months. It's so out of character but nobody knows what to do.' An unidentified man arrived at the property to hand-deliver documents in an 8.5 by 11-inch brown envelope, received by Simmons' housekeeper, but refused to comment regarding the nature of his visit. Simmons was last seen in public on January 11 at a charity event and has avoided his own famed studio 'Slimmons' in Beverly Hills for several months. Since his 80s heyday Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair and trademark exercise shorts and tank top. In 2011, the fitness guru had Dancing With The Stars viewers talking about his seemingly slimmed down build whist appearing on the show to coach celebrity contestant Chaz Bono. The 63-year-old's smaller frame sparked speculation that something was awry, and perhaps he might even be ill - though this speculation was later quashed by his agent. Simmons continues to run the Beverley Hills exercise studio, called Slimmons Studio, that he established in 1974. MailOnline reached out to Simmons for comment.","Friends of fitness guru Richard Simmons claim 66-year-old is 'not ok'

"Yale has threatened to kick out a 20-year-old history major because she's too thin. New Jersey native, Frances Chan, who is 5'2"" and weighs 90lbs, claims she's been force feeding herself Cheetos and ice cream in an attempt to add flesh to her tiny frame after the Ivy League school became convinced she was suffering from an eating disorder. Chan said the New Haven, Connecticut, college wouldn't even let up when her parents confirmed she, and the rest of her family, had always been naturally skinny and even sent in childhood medical records and had their doctor contact the school. Scroll down for video . Harsh: Yale has threatened to kick out 20-year-old history major Frances Chan, pictured, because she's too thin . 'It felt really bad to be this powerless,' Chan told the New Haven Register. 'I ate ice cream twice a day. I ate cookies. I used elevators instead of walking up stairs. But I don't really gain any weight.' She said the battle over her weight began in September when she noticed a lump in her breast and went to get it checked out. The lump came back benign, but Yale doctors called her in for a follow up appointment because they had other 'concerns.' In the meeting, they told her she was dangerously underweight and imposed mandatory weekly weigh-ins as well as sessions with a mental health professional and a nutritionist. Chan tried to comply with the school's request and put on weight but she only managed to gain two pounds. Force feeding: Chan, pictured left and right, is 5'2"" and weights 90lbs and claims she's been force feeding herself Cheetos and ice cream in an attempt to add flesh to her tiny frame . Mandatory: Since December, Chan been forced to show up for weekly weigh-ins and also sent off to a mental health professional and a nutritionist . However, the university said that wouldn't do. One health professional even told her her low weight would kill her and they threatened to put her on a medical leave of absence. Angry, helpless and distracted from her studies, Chan decided to pen an essay about her experience for the Huffington Post. In it she explains that she's been small 'since high school, but it has never led to any illnesses related to low weight or malnutrition.' 'My mom was the same; my whole family is skinny. We all enjoy Mom's fabulous cooking, which included Taiwanese beef noodle soup, tricolor pasta, strawberry cheesecake, and cream puffs, none of which make the Weight Watchers shortlist. I just don't gain weight easily.' She claims the university's blind use of Body Mass Index as a yard stick for a healthy weight is where they are going wrong. BMI: Chan, pictured, claims the university's blind use of Body Mass Index as a yard stick for a healthy weight is where they are going wrong . 'It . subjects students who have a personal and family history of low weight . to treatment that harms our mental health,' she writes in the article. 'By . forcing standards upon us that we cannot meet, the University plays the . same role as fashion magazines and swimsuit calendars that teach us . about the ""correct shape"" of the human body.' Finally, Chan decided to draw the line on the endless weigh-ins and mental health check ups, preferring to risk expulsion than send herself crazy trying to reach an unattainable goal. 'I'm done,' she writes. 'No more weigh-ins, no more blood draws. I don't have an eating disorder, and I will not let Yale Health cause me to develop one. If Yale wants to kick me out, let them try -- in the meantime, I'll be studying for midterms, doing my best to make up for lost time.' The essay, in which Chan acknowledges the college thought it was doing the right thing, had the desired effect of drawing attention to the issue. Yale: One health professional at Yale, pictured, even told her that her low weight would kill her if she didn't sort it out and they threatened to put her on medical leave, she claims . In addition, her parents came to New Haven to meet with health officials on campus, she switched to a new physician and she also wrote about her experience to Yale President Peter Salovey. On Friday, she learned that her new doctor acknowledged BMI was not the only measure of a healthy weight and admitted the college had 'made a mistake' in how they handled her thin frame. 'So she trusts that I do not have an eating disorder,' Chan said, relived, of her physician. In a statement to the Register, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said he couldn't talk of specific cases but insisted: 'Yale has a strong system of mental health care for students.' He also said Yale has recently improved campus mental health services, and specifically included a student advisory committee on mental health and a series of 'listening sessions' with groups of students, presumably to avoid this happening again.","History major, Frances Chan, from New Jersey, claims she has weighed 90lbs since high school and her entire family are naturally skinny .

"If you have woken up from a vivid dream, only to forget what it was about, you might want a dream recorder. While such a consumer device may be years away, researchers have created a system that uses a biosensor headset to edit moving images shown on a screen according to changes in an individual's brain activity. The film that’s created is a visual record of a wearer’s subconscious mind, giving them a glimpse into the dream world. Day dreaming: Researchers have created a gadget that uses a biosensor headset (pictured) to edit moving images according to changes in an individual's brain activity to produce a dream-like film . Manchester-based animator Richard Ramchurn came up with the idea for the #scanners cinema experience, which allows everyone to watch a film differently. In its initial format, his setup allows a single user to manipulate a digital art installation. ‘Narratives and layers can be built that are all governed by the user's concentration and meditation levels. Edit points can be created by monitoring the users blinking. ‘The audience can project their feelings onto the film that they are seeing, the film they watch will have a series of overlapping structures that they can interact with and/or disregard,’ he wrote on Kickstarter, which he used to raise funds for the project. Viewers will watch a film wearing a headset that reads their brainwaves, and they will all see a different film. This is because images will be edited by their subconscious thoughts. A still taken from a test screening of a surreal film is pictured . All viewers will watch a film wearing a headset that can read their brainwaves. The headset will let them manipulate the images they see, according to their subconscious mind. In this way, the narrative can be changed and 'edit points' created when they blink. Every viewer will see the film differently. The system's creator said it will give people a glimpse into the dream world, because the film they see will be a visual record of their subconscious mind. ‘The goal of the project is for people to be able to physically see and hear their dreams,’ he explained. ‘We tested the device at Manchester University last year and a lot of people who used it compared the experience to lucid dreaming.’ The technique relies on the MindWave Mobile - a headset developed by tech company NeuroSky, which costs £100 ($159). In trials, volunteers were asked to wear the headset and watch a short film. Mr Ramchurn said: ‘The rhythms of the editing, how the movie jumps from scene to scene, depends on the mind state of the person watching it. ‘Much like a dream you can’t really control what happens on screen. 'Your brain chooses the sounds and sights you experience but you can’t really direct them - you just have to go with it.’ He was inspired to come up with the project after reading Walter Murch’s book In The Blink Of An Eye, which compares dreams to films. He said: ‘Films and dreams are very similar. The technique - which could one day pave the way for a dream machine for consumers - relies on the MindWave Mobile - a headset developed by tech company NeuroSky, which costs £100 ($159) (pictured) The goal of the project is for people to be able to physically see and hear their dreams. Here, a subject watched a film wearing the headset.  Its creator, Richard Ramchurn said: ‘Much like a dream you can’t really control what happens on screen. Your brain chooses the sounds and sights you experience but you can’t direct them' 'The problem is it’s easy to remember a film because you’re conscious while it’s playing, but it can be hard to recall a dream once you’re awake. ‘The headset is the perfect device for exploring dreams, because it brings your subconscious to the forefront, placing it on a screen for you to experience consciously.’ Mr Ramchurn predicts that scientific advances may make detailed dream recording possible in the near future. ‘There is research which suggests we may be able to fully record a dream within the next 10 to 15 years,’ he said.","Cinema experience has been created that edits films according to people's brainwaves so that everyone sees a different version .

"The daughter-in-law of former Conservative foreign secretary Douglas Hurd may have plunged 60ft from the roof of her New York home because of sleeping pills she was taking. In the days before her death, Sian Hurd, 46, had told her diplomat husband Tom she was having trouble getting to sleep and so took some benzodiazepine sedatives. At her inquest yesterday her father Roland, a retired GP, said they could have altered her mental state as the drugs ‘exacerbate morbid ideas’. Tragic: Catherine Hurd, centre, pictured on her wedding day to husband Thomas, died after plunging 60ft from her New York home . Home: The four-storey house in the fashionable Upper East Side of New York where the Briton died on May 21 last year . The mother of five had previously . tried to take an overdose of sedatives in 2007 and suffered a ‘sudden . nervous breakdown’ but had  recovered well and was not being treated for . depression at the time of her death. Mr Hurd wept as he described finding . his wife’s body in the garden of their house, just a short distance from . where he worked at the United Nations. He had woken at 4am, but finding her . missing from the bed, searched their home in the fashionable Upper East . side. She had climbed up a ladder in the corner of the bedroom to gain . access to the flat roof through a hatch, before plunging over a wall. She died from multiple injuries on May 21 last year. Sadness: Thomas Hurd arriving at the inquest today, left, and her father Daniel Aubrey, right . Lord Douglas Hurd whose daughter-in-law died (file picture) Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame . Short told the hearing in Winchester the fall was ‘more than likely an . intentional act’ but he recorded an open verdict. The inquest heard the family was  due . to move back to their house in Battersea, South-West London, and Mrs . Hurd had been packing belongings from their £9,500-a-month rented house . with three of her children – Benedict, 15, Oliver, ten and . seven-year-old Hannah. Mr Hurd, a Middle East expert with the . UN Security Council, said: ‘She was looking forward to returning home. We were going through a period of transition logistically and we were . also confronted by some family illness.’ He said the day before her death, his wife had trouble sleeping and had taken small doses of sedatives. Asked by Mr Short if he could  tell whether she had jumped or fallen, Mr Hurd replied: ‘We will never know.’ Her father Roland Aubrey told the . inquest: ‘There were no warning signs in the way she spoke to us that . would indicate she was depressed. She had been taking some medication to . help her  sleep and it was the type of drug that can exacerbate morbid . ideas. It can affect the mental balance of your mind.’ Friends of Mrs Hurd described her as a ‘free’ spirit’ who loved nature. Recording his verdict, Mr Short said: . ‘I cannot know for sure what was on her mind … She was probably feeling . depressed, it does not necessarily follow she jumped.’ Douglas Hurd, 82, now Lord Hurd of .

"Ladies' man? Godfrey Bloom with his wife Katie - who, as a woman, he concedes is 'better at finding the mustard in the pantry' than a man . Employment law should be torn up to allow small firms to sack women workers who get pregnant, UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has suggested. The Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire MEP said that owners of smaller businesses were too scared to hire women of childbearing age because of maternity and anti-discrimination laws. Mr Bloom called for the tearing up of 'draconian' employment legislation which burdened small employers by giving women the right to take maternity leave and expect their jobs back. He said there should be 'liberty of contract' which would see a woman replaced for a job if she had children. 'Young women would much rather have a job under liberty of contract than not be given a job because of the fears some employers might have', he told London's LBC radio. He had argued that feminism had 'done no favours' for the 'sisterhood' and that maternity rights in employment law had been bad for women. In an interview with London's LBC radio station, he insisted that: 'Trying to paint me as a misogynist dinosaur does not bear out the facts'. Mr Bloom said he employed mostly 'young women', 'many of them glamorous too' and was a big supporter of women's equestrian sport and Cambridge women's rugby. He had been invited on the show to discuss an article he had written arguing against boardroom quotas. Mr Bloom claimed that women were better at digging out the mustard from the pantry than reversing their car into a parking space. The 63 year-old set out the differences between men and women in an attempt to argue against quotas in the boardroom. 'You cannot legislate for human nature and nor should you,' he said. 'Men and women are different yet there is no golden rule,' he said in an article for the website politics.co.uk. 'Most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man and most men can reverse a car better than a woman.' He predicted that feminism was a passing fashion, created by 'shrill, bored, middle class women of a certain physical genre'. The only male supporters of feminism were men 'who seem to have no link with the usual social and sporting male preserves, the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach'. The feminists of the 1970s were actually 'hostile to other women' and had done 'the sisterhood no favours'. Bongo bongo: Mr Bloom, whocreated a stir when he walked out on an interview with Krishnan Guru-Murthy on C4 News earlier this month, said he would 'happily punch the first man who tries to steal my beer' The former businessman said he was puzzled that women had produced so few great works in the arts despite having much more time on their hands in the 18th and 19th centuries . 'Women, in spite of years of training in art and music - and significant leisure time in the 18th and 19th Centuries - have produced few great works,' he said.Mr Bloom's comments came just weeks after he sparked outrage by claiming that foreign aid was going to 'bongo-bong land'. Women were more interested in tidying the house than getting ahead in business. 'Men and women care about different things on a micro-scale,' he said. 'Leaving the lavatory seat up, wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad. A man simply cannot understand what the problem is. 'Most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility. Men cannot see the point in making the bed if you are going to get back in it tonight.' He also said he would be 'happy to punch the first man who tries to steal my beer'. UKIP was also at the centre of another controversy this week when its chief executive Will Gilpin quit after just eight months. 'Mutual agreement': Will Gilpin is to leave his role as chief executive of UKIP . Mr Gilpin said that the party was resisting any attempts to try and become more professional - and this would cost it potential seats at the 2015 general election. The former RAF pilot, warned that the party would never progress beyond a 'bunch of enthusiastic amateurs' while leader Nigel Farage held so much power. 'The thing I am most shocked by is that Nigel does his own thing without the party knowing where he is or what he is doing,' he told the Telegraph. 'Nigel would see the party as being about him. The party is structured like a flying wedge, pushing Nigel forward.' There is speculation that former Tory MP Neil Hamilton could replace him. Barmy army?

"A dentist made a cast of Jimmy Savile's teeth to check against the bite-marks found on the bodies of the Yorkshire Ripper's victims, it has emerged. It is now clear that detectives went to some lengths to find out if Savile was connected to the shocking serial killing spree in the 1970s. His teeth were examined in 1980, a year before Peter Sutcliffe, now 66, was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to kill seven others. Scroll down for video . 'Mates': Peter Sutcliffe named Jimmy Savile in police interviews, left one of his victims' bodies near the DJ's home and was regularly visited by him while in Broadmoor . Close: The BBC star's home is very near to where Sutcliffe dumped one of his victims - as the Ripper mentioned in a police interview . Two prostitutes thought to have been killed by Sutcliffe had bites on their breasts. He denied killing one of them, but detectives at the time thought he was lying to cover for an accomplice. Two of the Ripper's victims were found near Savile's home in Leeds, and Sutcliffe even named Savile in police interviews. Sutcliffe was asked why he placed a victim's boots over her legs before he left the park. He said: 'For two reasons. One, because I could hear voices from I don’t know where and a car had just driven into an entrance just behind the building — that was the block of flats I found out later where Jimmy Savile lived. 'Secondly I was surprised to see how luminous she appeared in the dark.' Unsettling: Details of police probe into Savile link was revealed by ex-model and Benny Hill girl Nikki Critcher, pictured, a friend of the Harley Street dentist involved . The sick pair later appeared to have formed a disturbing friendship, with the BBC star visiting the killer in jail and describing him as a 'mate' after later trips to see him in Broadmoor Hospital. Dr Mace Joffe was sent from Harley Street to Leeds to make a cast of Savile's teeth, revealed the dentist's friend Nikki Critcher, an ex-model and former Benny Hill girl, in The Sun. 'He said he had been told by the police that Savile was known to them for using prostitutes and that he had been a potential suspect,' said Ms Critcher, who has now retrained as a lawyer. 'We were amazed,' said the mother of three and former Page 3 girl. 'We didn't think he'd be the sort - he was doing all his charity work and things.' Dr Joffe died in 2003 and so cannot reveal more about the investigation. A former detective who helped catch the Yorkshire Ripper this week made the shocking claim that Savile was quizzed over the serial murderer's crimes. Former West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible killer. Mr Stainthorpe, who worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who spent years trying to catch Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put forward by members of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may seem. 'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.' Savile, seen at Broadmoor in 1991, as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe meets boxer Frank Bruno, who was on a visit to open a new gym . However, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman . said: 'Hundreds of people were identified in the operation, we cannot be . more specific than that at this time. John Stainthorpe said a member of the public named Savile as a suspect . 'Details of all who were questioned . in connection with the crimes are in storage, so we cannot confirm that . Jimmy Savile was spoken to.' Mr Stainthorpe said the person who gave police the anonymous tip-off was 'aiming in the right direction'. 'Child perverts soon become child killers,' he added. The detective's shocking revelation came as the killer said that Savile regularly visited him in custody and the pair became friends. Rubbishing claims the late DJ abused . around 300 victims over six decades, Sutcliffe said those making allegations . were 'jumping on the bandwagon'. The Yorkshire Ripper's horrific crimes shocked the nation as he embarked on a murderous rampage across the country, slashing his victims, mutilating them and killing them. Between 1975 and 1980, the vicious murderer attacked women, stabbed them with screwdrivers, stamped on them, left notes with their bodies taunting police for not catching him and killed in total 13 women. Officers desperate to catch him cast their net far and wide as they hunted for the man who signed his notes as 'Jack The Ripper' and launched a huge campaign, publishing his notes and voice recordings in a bid to have someone identify the murderer by his writing or voice. In 1981 he was convicted of  murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. Sutcliffe, who will never be released from Broadmoor mental hospital, told the Sun that the claims made against his 'friend' Savile were exaggeration. Jimmy Savile, shown relaxing at his penthouse flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in 2006, lived just yards from where Sutcliffe killed his third victim . He said: 'It's a load of rubbish. People are just getting carried away. 'He visited a lot. He'd always come and chat with me on visits and I would introduce him to my visitors. Several times he left £500 for charities I was supporting.' One of Savile’s abuse victims urged police to investigate any links between the pair. The victim said: 'Sutcliffe and Savile are two peas in a pod. It's quite fitting the only person to stick up for Savile is Sutcliffe.' Sutcliffe's 'friend' Savile was said to have been given his own set of gold-plated keys to high-security Broadmoor, where the Ripper is a patient. He was allegedly given bedrooms or an office at . three hospitals, and this week more former patients came forward to say . he abused them on children’s wards. A victim of Savile has demanded police instigate any links between him and the Yorkshire Ripper . The details come after it was reported that Sutcliffe killed his third victim, . Irene Richardson, yards from Savile’s flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in . 1977. Miss Richardson was killed near the disgraced paedophile's three-bedroom penthouse, which overlooks Roundhay Park. It is three miles outside Leeds city . centre, with floor to ceiling windows, and has been put on the market . for £325,000, with the proceeds intended for the Jimmy Savile Charitable . Trust. Savile's relatives said they do not . want a penny of his £4.3million estate and called for the cash to be . donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes. Mental hospital: A gold-plated set of keys to Broadmoor was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed . At . Broadmoor, Savile boasted that he was actually responsible for getting . some mentally ill patients - among them murderers - freed from their . sentences. He called himself the ‘Governor’ of the . hospital and was made chairman of a hospital taskforce by the Department . of Health in the 1980s. Savile, who died a year ago aged 84 in his Leeds flat, is now believed by police to be one of the UK's most prolific child abusers. Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into the television and radio star's activities. Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse. Savile was allegedly questioned by police about the crimes of Peter Sutcliffe. Seen here are twelve of his 13 victims . Police are pictured searching the grounds of a property where the body of Marguerite Walls, the 12th victim of Peter Sutcliffe, was discovered. A detective claims the disgraced DJ was quizzed by police in connection with the terrible deaths . Police and forensic experts, seen examining the place where another victim was killed by the Yorkshire Ripper, spoke to hundreds in their hunt for the killer . The police launched a huge campaign to track down the killer who hurt so many women, and were given Savile's name by a member of the public during the inquiry . Last month health chiefs announced an inquiry into Savile’s reign of abuse at three NHS hospitals. It will be run by the Department of Health itself, raising fears it cannot be truly independent. Former barrister Kate Lampard will oversee the investigation to provide ‘independent oversight’, Downing Street pledged. It will examine why the paedophile presenter was allegedly given the keys to Broadmoor, a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville and free rein at Leeds General Infirmary. He allegedly raped and molested young victims for decades without anyone stopping him. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘[Kate Lampard] will provide oversight of the Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor inquiries as well as the Department of Health’s inquiries into the appointment and role Savile held at Broadmoor Hospital. ‘All relevant information from these inquiries will be passed to the police.’ Unlike the BBC, which has issued several grovelling apologies, none of the hospitals has yet said sorry for the alleged abuse. Savile, who raised £40million for the hospital in his lifetime, boasted that he ‘lived’ in a bedroom managers had given him at Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, and said he could do as he pleased.","Police knew Savile used prostitutes, according to friend of dentist involved .

"A two-year-old boy allegedly abducted by his parents and taken to Malaysia has been returned to Adelaide. A South Australia Department for Education and Child Development (DECD) spokesman said the toddler is now in the care of Families SA. The boy was under the guardianship of the Minister for Education and Child Development, but lived with his grandparents. He was returned to Adelaide on a Malaysia Airlines flight early on Sunday in the company of two Families SA social workers and has undergone a routine health check, the spokesman said. Scroll down for video . A South Australian couple have been arrested in Malaysia after kidnapping their two-year-old son and fleeing the country last weekend, Chief Superintendent John Venditto revealed . Police on Friday said the parents, aged 26 and 23, were arrested by Malaysian authorities on Thursday and have been charged with the aggravated unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction. The grandparents, aged 64 and 52, have been charged with aiding and abetting the parents. In accordance with South Australian law, the offence could see them sentenced to a prison term of up to 19 years. Australian police have also charged the child's 64-year-old grandfather and 52-year-old grandmother' with aiding and abetting in the unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction', according to a police statement. The grandparents failed to notify authorities, for more than 24 hours, that the two-year-old had left their care. It has also been alleged that they 'handed the boy over to his parents on Saturday August 2'. Police refused to reveal why the parents had lost custody of their child or if they had a criminal record, however they did reveal that 'the child was under an assessment and investigation order that was issued by the courts' at the time he was taken. Police refused to reveal why the parents had lost custody of their child or if they had a criminal record at a press conference on Friday, however they did reveal that 'the child was under an assessment and investigation order that was issued by the courts' Chief Superintendent John Venditto said at a press conference that the entire operation took only six days from the moment police were informed that the child was missing until the arrest of his parents. 'It is an extraordinarily quick and rapid response to something that would generally take a lot longer,' he said. Chief Inspector Tony Crameri, the officer in charge of the investigation, said the child's well-being was the priority throughout the operation. 'This was an incredibly delicate investigation and we were mindful that the parents could flee at any moment with the boy to an unknown location,' he said. The parents could face up to 19 years in jail according to South Australian law, while the grandparents, who  have also been charged, are expected to appear at the Holden Hill Magistrates court (pictured) in October . 'Such a quick and positive outcome could not have been achieved without the cooperation of a number national and international agencies, including Interpol, the Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Government, Commonwealth Attorney Generals Department, Department of Foreign Affairs, South Australia DPP and the Australian Federal Police,' he said. The parents have so far appeared at a Malaysian court and will now be remanded for the customary 60 days until the case will resume. Australian authorities are awaiting for decisions surrounding their extradition and any further charges to be decided by Malaysian authorities. Meanwhile, the toddler's grandparents have been granted bail and are set to appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on 14 October. Their charges could also lead to a lengthy jail sentence, according to police.","Two-year-old boy abducted by his parents has been returned to Adelaide .

"The body of a shirtless man killed by Ebola is picked up from the middle of a dirt road in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and carried away by health workers. The shocking images, which are being taken in West Africa on a daily basis, highlight how the outbreak is spiraling out of control - and medical officials are yet to find a cure. But experts believe an unusual treatment may help combat the disease, one which involves using the blood of those who have survived the deadly virus. Scroll down for video . Health workers place the body of a man inside a plastic body bag in front of a crowd in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. He is suspected of dying due to the Ebola virus . 'This is something that's fairly simple to do,' said Dr. Peter Piot, director of London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the co-discoverer of the Ebola virus. More than 200 experts, assembled by the World Health Organization, have gathered in Geneva for a two day conference. The group are looking at issues of safety and effectiveness and considering which treatments should be prioritized for testing during the current outbreak. There are around a half dozen medicines and vaccines in development. None has been tested on humans but an early trial of one vaccine began this week in the United States. Much attention has focused on the unproven drug ZMapp, which was given to seven patients, two of whom died. But the limited supply is now exhausted and its developer says it will take months to make even a modest amount. In contrast, WHO's blood network, an international group of blood regulators, noted recently there are thousands of survivors from past Ebola outbreaks in Africa who could be tapped as a source. The group said blood from survivors should be considered experimental and recommended that studies be done during the crisis. His corpse was left on a dirt road in the middle of the Liberian capital with pedestrians ignoring the body as they waked past . In another document published this week, WHO estimated the first batches of survivor blood could be available by the end of the year. The agency said it had identified several recovered patients as potential donors, but acknowledged 'logistics of blood collection are an issue.' Some scientists think antibodies in the blood of Ebola survivors could help patients infected with the deadly disease. Antibodies are produced by the body's immune system to fight off harmful things like viruses. They remain in the blood ready to fight off any future infections by the same foreign substance. Piot said it is vital to find out if the blood treatment is effective. 'I hope this is the last Ebola outbreak where all we have is isolation, quarantine and supportive care to treat patients,' he said. Experts say blood from survivors could be collected and processed for multiple patients, or a survivor could donate blood to an individual patient. Both methods require screening the blood for diseases like HIV or malaria. A health worker sprays the body of the dead man as a crowd surrounds the gruesome scene . While direct donation would be easier, the levels of Ebola-fighting antibodies produced by a survivor can vary. Ideally, experts said, the amount of antibodies should be measured. 'With drugs, you can at least do some quality control,' said Tom Geisbert, an Ebola expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. 'If you're just taking blood blindly from (survivors) without testing it for antibody levels, how can we predict what outcome they will have?' In West Africa, there have been no organized attempts to use the blood of survivors to treat patients. Blood from a 14-year-old boy who survived Ebola was given in July to American doctor Kent Brantly, who was infected in Liberia. Brantly also got some ZMapp and was released from an Atlanta hospital last month. It's unknown whether the drug or the boy's blood aided his recovery. Blood from survivors of diseases including Ebola, bird flu and anthrax has been used in the past when doctors ran out of options and seems to work best in diseases where there's a toxin, like anthrax and tetanus. Medical workers from the Liberian Red Cross load another body into the back of a van in Monrovia . Health worker's spray each other with disinfectant chemicals after dealing with the corpse of the Ebola with a victim in Monrovia, Liberia . For treating Ebola, 'you would need to come up with how much you should give, how long, and what's a safe infusion rate,' said Dr. Michael Kurilla, director of BioDefense at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. 'If you know what the potency of the serum is, you could theoretically help the body clear Ebola out of their cells before it can do too much damage.' Dr. Colin Brown, who recently worked in Ebola clinics in Sierra Leone for King's College London's partnership with the country, said local hospitals should be able to provide survivors' blood if doctors want to offer it. So far, more than 3,000 people have been infected. Last week, WHO estimated there could be another 20,000 cases before the Ebola outbreak is stopped, a figure Brown described as unfortunate but realistic. Visual artists walk with  placards during a rally in Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coastagainst the Ebola virus which is effecting neighbouring countries . 'It does give us the opportunity to try some new therapies,' he said. 'And as long as they are not harmful, why shouldn't we try to do something, hopefully help some patients and learn from this?' Health officials are monitoring more than 200 people who may have been exposed to Ebola in southern Nigeria and are working to find more people at risk in a race to contain the disease's spread in Africa's most populous country. Authorities had been cautiously optimistic that they would be able to keep Nigeria's outbreak relatively small. The sick Liberian-American who brought the disease to Nigeria by plane was quickly isolated and officials said they were successfully monitoring the people who were in contact with him. But then last month, one of those contacts escaped surveillance and fled to the southern oil hub of Port Harcourt. He infected a doctor who, in turn, exposed dozens of people to the disease when he continued treating patients after he began having Ebola symptoms, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. Elsewhere in West Africa, the outbreak is spinning out of control, killing about 1,900 people so far, according to the WHO. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have each recorded hundreds of deaths and the disease most recently spread to Senegal. There are no known casess of Ebola in Ivory Coast, but the problem is beginning to spiral out of control in neighbouring countries including Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia . In southern Nigeria, 200 people have been identified as having been exposed to the ill doctor and are being monitored, the WHO said. About 60 of those are considered at a high risk of getting Ebola. Officials are urgently tracking down more contacts and educating residents about the disease, Dr Sampson Parker, the health commissioner for Rivers State, where Port Harcourt is located, said. Rumour, fear and confusion about Ebola, which is more typically found in Central Africa, have helped to fuel its spread. Some people hide their symptoms or avoid medical care, seeing hospitals as places where people simply go to die. Nigerian officials have urged people in Port Harcourt not to panic. Joseph Obari, an oil worker, said he felt the local authorities had put in place adequate measures to curtail the disease. But others worry that Ebola will spread. 'I am very afraid because of the manner the disease is spreading,' said Oji Egwuno, a hotel manager in Port Harcourt. 'I have to be cautious because I don't want to be the next victim.' So far, more than 3,000 people have been infected and around 1,900 people are thought to have died. Last week, WHO estimated there could be another 20,000 cases before the Ebola outbreak is stopped .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Anyone who has ever tried to take a photo of their pet knows how difficult it can be to get them to comply. Wildlife photographer Alex Cearns has dedicated her life for the past eight years to taking the perfect shots of animals and the results are stunning. The former police woman from Perth has unveiled possibly the cutest animal pictures in the world, including one of an oprhaned sugar glider who holds up its tiny claw to a human's hand. She says her days are now filled with 'high-fives from dogs and cuddling kittens' instead of chasing criminals. Helping hand: A tiny sugar glider reaches up to touch a human's hand as it stars in the 40-year-old's heart-melting project . Pretty in pink: Two piglets appear to be kissing as they nuzzle their noses together in the photograph shot by Alex Cearns . A sleeping litter of cuddly puppies, a posing black and white lamb and two kissing pink piglets star in the 40-year-old's heart-melting project. Ms Cearns, who used to spend her time on the beat tackling crime in West Australia, now gets to while away her hours with the most adorable species on the planet. 'I like to say now people are pleased to see me,' she joked. She's put a collection of her perfectly-timed snaps together - taken from the thousands of photos she has shot so far - in her new book Mother Knows Best – Life Lessons From The Animal World. Puppy dog eyes: This little bruiser is reaching out to the camera as he stars in the animal photography book Mother Knows Best - Life Lessons From The Animal World . It's a hard life: Five brown and white sleeping puppies appear to be taking a snooze in the award-winning wildlife photographer's snap . Too cute: Could you refuse this pooch anything? A grey and white pup (left) looks lovingly at the camera. And a grey little bunny clasps his paws together, its pointy ears pricked up  (right). Split-second photography technology helped her capture the images super fast. 'The bit that takes the longest is getting the animal relaxed and in the right pose,' she told MailOnline on Saturday. Explaining how she gets the animals in the mood to pose for the camera, she said: 'A lot of it is do with my own body energy. After years I know when to look them in the eye and not appear threatening. 'Most are agreeable but the ones that have been abused can be harder.' She also uses toys and treats to soften them up. Ducks in a row: Four yellow ducklings sit side by side in size order, with the smallest looking particularly cute . Open wide: A bird (left) squawks for the camera while Jolly the piglet (right), who was rescued and rehomed, shows off the banana she's eating . Hand raised: Bailey the pink galah parrot is pictured having a big stretch. He was just seven weeks old when the photo was taken . The award-winning Australian photographer has captured the special relationship between many mother and baby animals over the years. There are fluffy bunnies and ducklings that you want to reach out and stroke and inquisitive white kittens with piercing green eyes. Plus all different breeds of puppies with doe-eyed expressions. A couple of them reach out their paws to the camera as if they want to make friends. It's almost impossible for anyone to choose a favourite from the beautiful photos, but Ms Cearns says fragile pooch little Barli Pip, who was found on the streets of Bali aged 8-10 weeks old with mange, really pulls at her heart-strings. 'I love all of them for different reasons but Bali Pip resonates with me... 'We sold the photo in a charity fundraiser and raised over $15,000 from copies of her photo alone in just three hours.' Meow: Three inquisitive white kittens with piercing green eyes respond to Ms Cearns' call . All together now: Five puppies, who were rehomed after they were born to a mother already in foster care, look thick as thieves . Striking a pose: A lamb with a black head and sock on its back foot (left) appears to model for the camera and a cuddly black and white pup (right) lays down for its photo . When Ms Cearns posted the striking photo on Facebook it was viewed by more than 1.5 million people. The delicate little dog went on to grow her hair back and was rehomed. Ms Cearns' dramatic change from copper to wildlife photographer and animal rights advocate came in 2006, when she left the force after 14-years of service. She wanted a complete life change and had developed a lifelong love of animals during her early formative years in outback South Australia where her father was a shearer and wool valuer. A trip to Tasmania with a friend with an SLR camera gave her the inspiration she was looking for. 'I was 19 when I joined the police and over the next 14 years I was exposed to the darkest side of humanity. But policing prepared me for the sights I see working with animal charities – the abuses and atrocities left to the rescue groups. Tiny: A miniscule sandy coloured pup stares straight at the lens in this striking photo . Sad eyes: A caramel and white dog looks longingly into the lens (left) and a glossy black puppy chews on a yellow tennis ball and holds onto it protectively (right) Give me five: A stunning black dog holds up his paw, as if in a sign of friendship, to the camera . 'I left the WA Police not wanting to know what people did to each other anymore, but my sense of justice shifted into concern for vulnerable creatures and drives me to create change through my photography,' she told the Herald Sun in March. Many of the animals captured in the photos are sadly survivors of abuse. The pig eating a banana, named Jolly, was rescued and went on to live in a rescue farm, as did the other two kissing pigs. And the Jack Russell dog laying down was found by rangers wondering the streets when it was not quite one year old. 'He is one of the smartest dogs I've ever met,' she said. Favourite: Ms Cearns says fragile pooch, little Barley Pip, who was found on the streets of Bali aged 8-10 weeks old with mange, really pulls at her heart-strings . The five puppies, pictured with a white background, were born in foster care so were also forced to be rehomed. And the pink galah parrot, pictured having a big stretch aged seven weeks, was hand raised. Ms Cearns doesn't just focus on domestic animals, she will also be coming to Sydney's Taronga Zoo on June 3 to bring the plight of Asia's Bears into focus. She is working with charity Free The Bears and will host an Animal Photography Master Class and speak about her photography and philanthropic pursuits in a lecture at the zoo. Free The Bears raises funds for projects supporting bear conservation and rescue. Ms Cearns will also be heading to Laos to photograph bears in a horrific bile farm and at the Free The Bears sanctuary, on her mission to raise funds and awareness.","Wildlife photographer Alex Cearns took the photographs over the past eight years .

"The housekeeper for Richard Simmons denies claims he's suffering from 'debilitating depression' amid reports he's become a recluse in his Hollywood mansion. It's said fitness fanatic Simmons is in desperate need of a knee replacement and risks never being able to exercise again if he continues to avoid the routine procedure, according to TMZ. The operation would reportedly be his second replacement, the first he delayed having for a decade, in four years. A source told TMZ: 'Doctors told Richard he needs a left knee replacement and if he doesn't get it he will never be able to exercise again.' Scroll down for video . On Thursday, TMZ reported that eighties fitness guru Richard Simmons hasn't been seen in a year and has been spent that time holed up in his Los Angeles home, depressed over a knee surgery that could leave him without the ability to exercise. Pictured above in November 2013 at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Simmons is allegedly 'paralyzed with fear and depression' as pressure grows to have the operation which sparked his reclusive behavior in 2014, TMZ say. However a housekeeper who lives on the property insists there was nothing to worry about regarding Simmons' physical or mental health when speaking to MailOnline today. The housekeeper, named Teresa Reveles, is allegedly tasked with turning friends or associates away when they come to visit him, said: 'He's perfectly fine. He's home and he's fine.' It comes as Simmons himself took to social media to thank fans for their 'outpouring of love and concern' following the surprising news of his well-being. In a post on his official Facebook page he said: 'I am so touched by the outpouring of love and concern that I have received today. I have had a tough time dealing with this injury, as it is keeping me from doing what I truly love to do and that is to teach classes around the world.' Reynold Gideon, who lives directly opposite, tells MailOnline exclusively that Simmons' housekeeper is adamant the sparkling fitness fanatic is merely 'resting'. MailOnline talked to Simmons' housekeeper outside his Los Angeles (above) home on Thursday, and she said he is 'perfectly fine' and not depressed as reported . A woman stands behind a gate at Simmons' Los Angeles mansion on Thursday, November 13 . Mr Gideon confirmed that Simmons had issues with his knee but believes he's doing well and is most likely to be working on something new, he understands from many conversations with the gym guru's staff. Mr Gideon explained: 'I think he's working on a new project, he's constantly recreating himself because the man has so much energy. He's a wonderful neighbor to have.' 'He told me about a knee problem months ago but I've not seen him since so I don't know of any updates with it,' Mr Gideon explained. One concerned neighbor pulled over their vehicle to ask MailOnline if the dazzling star had died, such is his absence in the community. The woman, who declined to be named, enquired: 'Is he dead? We're all quite worried, nobody has seen him in months. It's so out of character but nobody knows what to do.' An unidentified man arrived at the property to hand-deliver documents in an 8.5 by 11-inch brown envelope, received by Simmons' housekeeper, but refused to comment regarding the nature of his visit.

Simmons was last seen in public on January 11 at a charity event and has avoided his own famed studio 'Slimmons' in Beverly Hills for several months. Since his 80s heyday Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair and trademark exercise shorts and tank top. In 2011, the fitness guru had Dancing With The Stars viewers talking about his seemingly slimmed down build whist appearing on the show to coach celebrity contestant Chaz Bono. The 63-year-old's smaller frame sparked speculation that something was awry, and perhaps he might even be ill - though this speculation was later quashed by his agent. Simmons continues to run the Beverley Hills exercise studio, called Slimmons Studio, that he established in 1974. MailOnline reached out to Simmons for comment.","Today, reports surfaced saying eccentric fitness guru Richard Simmons had not been seen in public for months .

"A foreign doctor who killed a young English mother during childbirth has admitted she had been drinking, telling police: ‘I need vodka so I don’t shake.’ Anaesthetist Helga Wauters, 45, is facing five years in prison after she botched a caesarean section at a French clinic last month, causing the death of 28-year-old Xynthia Hawke. Miss Hawke, from Somerset, had moved to a small village in the Pyrenees while she was pregnant to start an idyllic new life with her French partner. Her baby boy, named Isaac, survived the birth but she had a fatal heart attack when a resuscitation procedure went horribly wrong. The doctor, who was found three times over the drink-drive limit and has been charged with aggravated manslaughter, has now admitted that during the operation she went off to drink wine with friends. Devastated: Yannick Balthazar must now raise his son alone after his partner, Xynthia Hawke, was killed by in a botched caesarean section by an anaesthetist who is said to have been drunk at the time . Botched care: Belgian Helga Wauters, 45, has been charged with aggravated manslaughter and faces up to five years in prison . That evening, she had also allegedly drunk a 500ml bottle of Vodka mixed with water and when detectives raided her home they found 17 empty bottles of the spirit. Wauters, who is originally from Belgium and has previously admitted to having a ‘pathological alcohol problem’, told authorities in France: ‘I was not drunk, I was at 70 per cent of my capacities. 'I need vodka so that I don’t shake.’ Miss Hawke, a prize-winning linguist, grew up in North Petherton, Somerset, before moving to France to study. This summer, she settled in Ustaritz, a small village near the Spanish border, after starting a relationship with Yannick Balthazar, 33, and falling pregnant. On September 26, she went to a private clinic in nearby Orthez to give birth, having been told of its ‘good reputation’. Her baby was too large to be delivered naturally so she had to have a C-section. Happy couple:  Ms Hawke and Mr Balthazar pose for a selfie (left) and the pregnant mother-to-be shops in a market just weeks before her death . Beaming: The mother-to-be regularly updated friends on her pregnancy and was ecstatic about having a baby . After Isaac was born, Wauters allegedly inserted a tube into Miss Hawke’s oesophagus instead of her windpipe, starving her of oxygen and causing her to suffer fatal cardiac arrest. She was rushed to a hospital in Pau, South West France, but fell into a coma and died four days later. Wauters had been working despite alleged difficulties with ‘expression, comprehension and reactivity’. France’s national news agency AFP said she went off during the procedure to have ‘a glass of rosé’ with friends. When she returned, she allegedly smelled of alcohol and admitted to being ‘in a daze’. Staff said she was slurring her words to the extent that she ‘could not be understood and she did not seem to understand what people were saying.’ Miss Hawke grew up in North Petherton, Somerset, where she excelled at her comprehensive, Haygrove School, and won a prize for outstanding achievement in GCSE French . When Wauters turned up for police questioning four days later, she had 216milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of her blood - the equivalent of four bottles of wine. The legal limit for driving in England is 80 milligrams. Miss Hawke’s devastated family, who live in a cottage in North Petherton, are said to have flown out to France to mourn with her partner and help him look after their child. ‘It is a very difficult time for us,’ Mr Balthazar, 33, told the Mail last week. ‘It is very sad. We are in mourning. I am looking after my family, my son, that is what is important to me now. We need to be with family now. I am going to let justice do its job.’ Miss Hawke’s parents Fraser and Clare, 61 and 56, declined to comment. Her uncle Nigel Cromney-Hawke, from Somerset, said: ‘It’s devastating.’ Wauters’s barrister, Florence Hegoburu, warned against any ‘hasty conclusions’, adding: ‘My client will assume her responsibilities in relation to the facts that she recognises, but she is not solely responsible. 'There are grey areas here, and the investigation will make them clearer.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.’","Xynthia Hawke, 28, killed by doctor who botched childbirth care in France .

"For some couples a simple weekend away is enough to make them feel they’ve got out of the house and experienced something special. Not for the Skinners, though. Husband and wife team Andy and Sarah Skinner have spent the past 10 years travelling the world together to remote locations as they photograph wild animals in their most intimate moments. The couple from Berkshire have captured some of the most dangerous beasts on our planet going about their daily business in this stunning collection of wildlife images. Scroll down for video . An adorable but wild at heart lion cub patrols a stretch ground in Savuti in Botswana, as photographed by Andy and Sarah Skinner . A serene image of a male leopard relaxing after climbing up a tree with his catch hanging to the left in Maasai Mara, Kenya . Andy and Sarah regularly swap their ordinary day jobs for life on the edge - and have notched up more than 50 excursions to destinations including Africa, India, North America and the Arctic. Sarah, 40, says it’s a far cry from her day job as a bathroom supplies account manager or Andy’s as a heating and plumbing engineer. 'It's exhilarating, it's challenging. There's nothing better than sitting under the stars and listening to lions roaring. 'It's so different to what we do. It's a release going into the wild and we really do live two different lives. The fearless couple leave no stone unturned when it comes to getting the perfect picture, and have converted a Land Rover into a specialist safari vehicle. Look at our teeth ... Sarah and Andy have been married for 13 years and been on over 50 exotic overseas excursions together . Up close and personal with an adult male lion as he stares into the lens of the Skinner's camera in Kenya . Andy, 40, explains the moment their operation went up a notch. 'We were sitting around a camp fire in Kenya one night and then we decided to ship our own vehicle over,’ he says. 'We bought the car here and completely stripped it down and changed the chassis and the gear box and prepared it for an African adventure. 'It has a fridge, a cooker and a roof tent. We got it on a container and took it to Mombasa. It's kept there and we use it for all our photography. 'The vehicle is just how we want it so we have photo mounts and we can focus on different species.' With their customised equipment they have no problem getting up close to lions, tigers, bears and giraffes in their natural environment - capturing them as they eat, sleep, fight, bond and play. 'We've got a good understanding so we never feel in danger,' said Sarah. It's time for a spot of grooming in this charming image of an adult female cheetah with her offspring . 'There can be hairy moments but Andy is very capable so I'm always confident that I have got a man that can get us out. 'Last year, we were sat by a fire in Botswana and we turned around to see a large female hyena stood just a couple of feet away from us. 'We've had all the big animals come into camp and get really close. Many times we wake up to buffalo or elephants. 'They usually just nonchalantly pass by and generally avoid us. One particular morning we awoke in camp to a buffalo sitting at the base of the ladder to our roof tent. 'Seemed he just wanted a bit of company and security! So, most of the time it's really exciting.' An adult silverback mountain gorilla takes a load off in Rwanda, showing just how relaxed the animals can be in the Skinners' presence .

'I saw Andy hanging from a tree because he used to be an arborist,’ Sarah says. ‘Eventually we got together. We both had a real love for wildlife before that. ‘I dragged him to Africa in 2004 and that was the point that we both got hooked.’ The pair have since been to that continent more than 40 times.

'We got more and more into it and then we weren't satisfied with guided tours so that's when we started self-driving in Kenya.’ Andy adds: 'Both of us love being immersed in natural environment surrounded by wildlife. ‘Every single picture brings with it a memory, and it's great that we can look back and have such fantastic memories. 'Some of our adventures aren't for the feint-hearted and I would not recommend people just go driving around Africa.'","Andy and Sarah Skinner have visited Africa, India, North America and Arctic to take remarkable photographs .

"She may have admitted that she was close to pulling the plug . on her lifestyle newsletter after receiving a wave of criticism back in 2011, but judging by her latest installment, Gwyneth Paltrow has certainly changed her tune. The actress - whose endeavours have been labelled pretentious and out of touch by some critics - has unveiled a new collection of bar accessories on her Goop blog. But forget plastic cocktail glasses and umbrella straws, Gwyneth's selection of 'unique and individual pieces' are slightly out of the price range of the average drinker. A load of Goop? Gwyneth Paltrow, whose lifestyle website has been met by much criticism, has now unveiled a range of bar accessories starting at £616 . The 40-year-old is offering sterling silver shot glasses for £616 ($950) as well as a pair of glass and sterling silver decanters for an eye-watering £2917 ($4495). On her Goop page, she writes: 'For stocking a bar that is as useful as it is good looking, we've gone to Foundwell for unique accessories from jiggers to muddlers and more.' Describing the £616 shot glass, she writes: 'This sterling shot cup has the phrase ""Just a thimble full"" engraved on it - a gentle reminder to practice a little bit of restraint. 'A great gift or a fun conversation piece for your home bar.' Long shot: Her shot glasses at £616, and she describes them as 'a great gift or a fun conversation piece for your home bar' The actress launched Goop back in September 2008, a personal website where she dishes . out advice to her readers and encourages them to 'nourish the inner . aspect'. Each week the newsletter focuses on a subject area, split into Make, Go, Get, Do, Be, and See. In an interview with the March 2011 issue of Harper's Bazaar UK, she admitted: 'There were a couple of times when I thought 'I'm just gonna stop doing it. 'People are so mean to me. I don't want to do it. 'But . then I was like, ""Who cares what some lame person out there says?"" I . was in Italy once, and this old man came up to me and said, ""I had the . best time in Nashville because of Goop."" And that is so worth it to me.'

"Air passengers lying about their health has rendered airport screening for diseases including Ebola ineffective, with around half of infected travellers missed. Concerns over being delayed drives passengers to withhold the full truth over their risk of exposure, experts warned today. A team of scientists from California and London examined screening processes for six different viruses. They were Ebola, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), Marburg virus, swine flu and avian flu. The team said questionnaires are the most effective detection method when a disease is in its early stages, and sufferers are not showing any signs of symptoms. A new study has found arrival screening for diseases including Ebola, like that taking place at Heathrow Airport, above, is more effective than departure checks, because symptoms can develop during travel . Scientists in California and London said infrared temperature checks, pictured above at the airport in Lagos, Nigeria, at best, only detect fevers 70 per cent of the time . But they admitted that at best, just 25 per cent of people honestly reported their exposure to flu during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, while others hid symptoms by taking medication. They found checking the temperatures of passengers suspected as being at risk of exposure to diseases like Ebola and the related Marburg virus is 'particularly ineffective'. The scientists said the long incubation periods of the two illnesses - in Ebola the incubation period is two to 21 days, while it's three to nine days for Marburg virus - renders the policy useless. But, they noted, the practice does prove beneficial when trying to detect cases of other diseases including swine flu, that has a shorter incubation period. The study found questionnaires, such as this one from Public Health England, are most effective when diseases are in their early stages . Katelyn Gostic, from the University of California, said: 'We found that for diseases with a long incubation period such as Marburg and Ebola, taking passengers’ temperature to test for fever is particularly ineffective at the start of an epidemic but does pick up more cases as it stabilises. 'With diseases such as swine flu that take a shorter time to incubate, fever screening is the most effective method throughout an epidemic,' she added. Fever screening at arrival destinations has been criticised for being ineffective. But the researchers suggest it might prove more effective than those programmes that rely on screening passengers as they leave a country. The study notes some symptoms of diseases will progress during a journey, making it easier to detect on arrival. And they warn, at best, infrared non-contact thermometers will only ever detect fevers 70 per cent of the time. Dr Gostic, said: 'Honest reporting can not only improve on-site detection but is essential to enable authorities to follow up with travellers who may have been exposed but have not yet developed symptoms. 'We need to find ways to incentivise better self-reporting.' The study suggests resources could be better spent on arrival screening, or on tracing and containing potential cases that appear through airport questionnaires. The research carried out at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will be published in the journal eLife.","New study found arrival screening is more effective than departure checks .

"A high school footballer who died after collapsing during a game told his father 'Tell mom I love her' just hours before the tragedy, it was today revealed. Tom Cutinella, 16, was playing as a linebacker for Shoreham-Wading River High School against John Glenn High School when he was injured during a tackle. He was raced to Huntington Hospital on Long Island, where he underwent emergency surgery for a brain injury. But despite medics' best efforts, he later died. He was the third teenage footballer to die in five days following the deaths of cornerback Demario Harris Jr. and linebacker Isaiah Langston. Scroll down for videos . Tragic: Tom Cutinella (pictured left and right), 16, was playing as a linebacker for Shoreham-Wading River High School against John Glenn High School when he was fatally injured during a helmet-on-helmet tackle . Memorial: The player, the eldest of four siblings, was raced to Huntington Hospital on Long Island following the collision, but later died. Above, students are pictured pausing by a memorial at the school yesterday . Today, Mr Cutinella's father Frank revealed his son's heartbreaking final words to him as he ran toward the school bus. He explained how the teenager had forgotten his No. 54 football jersey, so he had had to hurry out of their Long Island home to give it to him. 'I threw the jersey at him and he caught it and said, ""I love you Dad"". He always said ""I love you"" to his family before going to school each morning,' the father of four told Newsday. 'But his mom was still in the house. Then he gets halfway to the bus, turns around and says, ""Tell Mom I love her."" That was the last message he gave us.' Paying tribute: Today, Mr Cutinella's father Frank revealed his son's heartbreaking final words to him as he ran toward the school bus. He said: 'He gets halfway to the bus, turns around and says, ""Tell Mom I love her"" Devastated: Yesterday, Mr Cutinella's family and friends attended a tearful vigil for the student, who was also a keen lacrosse player. Above, Mr Cutinella's football teammates are pictured crying by the memorial . Paying tribute: A candelit memorial is set up for Mr Cutinella, who was running for junior class president . He added that his son, who was running for junior class president alongside his football teammate Jason Curran, was an honors student who 'loved to give'. 'He always said, ""Dad, you know I'm a giver"",' he said. 'And he's still giving. I'm at the hospital right now and they are harvesting every possible organ of his that they can.' Mr Cutinella collided helmet-to-helmet with a Glenn player while blocking during the third quarter of the game. Shoreham's head coach Matt Millheiser described the smash as 'a big hit.' The player, the eldest of four siblings, then stood up and tried to walk off the field after the incident, but collapsed several feet from the sideline. Bowed in prayer: Yesterday, Mr Cutinella's teammates, alongside players from four rival teams (pictured), were seen hugging and crying beside the makeshift memorial on the Long Island school's football field . Transport: The player's father explained how the teenager had forgotten his football jersey on the morning of the tragedy, so he had had to rush out to give it to him before he got on the school bus (pictured) He was attended to by emergency medical technicians and rushed to hospital by ambulance, while both teams agreed to suspend the game. Yesterday, Mr Cutinella's family and friends attended a tearful vigil for the student, who was also a keen lacrosse player. His teammates, alongside players from four rival teams, were pictured hugging and crying beside a makeshift memorial on the football field. ''He died doing what he loved to do. And doing it with the people he loved,' said Mr Cutinella's friend and teammate, Mr Curran. High school: Mr Cutinella attended the Shoreham-Wading River High School on Long Island (pictured) Meanwhile, school board member Jack Costas said the community was 'devastated' by Mr Cutinella's death. He said: 'It's always tragic when someone so young and so full of life has their life ended. It's going to be a very, very difficult road ahead from this.' He added that the school was expecting to get a full report into exactly what happened. In the past couple of days, Mr Cutinella's friends and relatives have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to the footballer. Ashley Ventimiglia wrote: 'Thomas is my little cousin. Please pray for my family. The best boy I knew.' In the second of the three football deaths, Mr Harris Jr. of Charles Henderson High School in Troy, Alabama, died on Sunday after collapsing on the field Friday following a tackle. Meanwhile, Mr Langston of Rolesville High School in North Carolina died on Friday after collapsing during pregame warm-ups. Although he did not know the official cause of death, Mr Langston's brother Langston told Fox NYC that it was related to a blood clot in the brain. There are about 50 to 100 sudden deaths among athletes in middle, high school and college every year,  Dr. Marlon Rosenbaum, associate clinical professor of medicine and pediatrics at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons told CNN. Previous deaths: Cornerback Demario Harris Jr. (left) of Charles Henderson High School in Troy, Alabama, died Sunday after collapsing on the field Friday following a tackle. Linebacker Isaiah Langston (right) of Rolesville High School in North Carolina died on Friday after collapsing during pre-game warm-ups . Dr. Roosevelt Gilliam, cardiologist at Healthcare Medical Group in Jonesboro, Arkansas, said the most common cause of sudden death among young athletes ishypertrophic cardiomyopathy, when the heart is thickened and enlarged. This problem can be detected by an initial ECG screening, followed by an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) for diagnosis. People with it should generally not participate in competitive athletics or other strenuous activities, Mr Gilliam said.","Tom Cutinella was playing as linebacker during high school football game .

"A Louisiana mayor whose son is Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu's chief of staff told voters at a private event to vote twice, speaking to a partisan crowd 24 hours before Election Day last month. Video of Opelousas, Louisiana Mayor Don Cravins Sr.'s Nov. 3 remarks show him telling a crowd in his home town that 'if you ""early voted,"" go vote again tomorrow. One more time’s not going to hurt.' Louisianans, like Americans in many states, had the option of either voting 'early' or showing up on Election Day. Taking advantage of both options would be a crime. And for voters worried about criminal fraud charges, Cravins said he had an insurance policy – the re-election of a Democratic district attorney. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . SWAMP: Former State Senator Don Cravins, now a Louisiana mayor, told voters a day before Election Day to vote twice. His son is Sen. Mary Landrieu's chief of staff in Washington . ENDANGERED: Sen. Mary Landrieu, the last remaining Democrat on a US Senate ballot, faces an uphill climb in her runoff election on Saturday, but one of her Louisiana advocates said voters should cast more than one ballot each for her . NO PROBLEM: District Attorney Earl Taylor won re-election on Nov. 4, an outcome that Cravins Sr. said – to wild applause – would protect double-dip voters from prosecution . 'Tomorrow we’re gonna elect Earl Taylor as the D.A. so he won’t prosecute you if you vote twice,' Cravins said. Taylor won a fourth term on Nov. 4. FAMILY CONNECTION: Don Cravins Jr. is Sen. Mary Landrieu's chief of staff in Washington . Cravins' remarks were met first by laughs and then by wild cheers as he told the crowd to 'vote number 99' – Mary Landrieu's ballot-line number. Landrieu's campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. State Sen. Elbert Guillory introduces the Cravins footage on video, calling it 'shocking, even for the sad swamp of Democrat politics here in Louisiana.' Guillory is among a handful of black U.S. politicians to leave the Democratic Party, announcing in 2013 that he had become a Republican. Cravins, a former Louisiana state senator, faces a runoff election for another term as mayor against another Democrat on Saturday. Landrieu's runoff against U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, however, is the main attraction in Louisiana. Cassidy is polling far ahead and a victory by the Republican would give the GOP a total of nine additional seats in the Senate in 2015. The Black Conservatives Fund PAC, a group that recruits right-leaning African-American political candidates, obtained the video of Cravins' remarks and shared it with MailOnline ahead of an 11:00 a.m. press conference in Louisiana. After the event, the group released the raw footage from Cravins Sr.'s Nov. 3 speech. During that same speech, Cravins told voters that Landrieu would vote with President Barack Obama '97 per cent of the time,' in a jiu-jitsu moment calculated to turn a frequent Republican criticism into an advantage. That video clip went viral, energizing some in the GOP. After word spread Monday morning that the group of center-right African-Americans would release another video clip, Landrieu's campaign announced its own press conference with the senator in Baton Rouge, timed to coincide with the public unveiling. In an unusual move, the campaign's press advisory did not specify where the event would take place; reporters were told to RSVP to learn that it would take place at a Hilton hotel. Black Conservatives Fund senior adviser Ali Akbar wrote Monday on Facebook that Landrieu had 'announced she's having a press conference now at the exact same time as we are having ours.' 'I kid you not. She's scared and I bet she lawyered up.' He said in a statement that Cravins had encouraged voters 'to violate state and federal law by committing voter fraud. He is compromising the integrity of our voting process and likely violating federal and state law himself.' FAVORITE: Bill Cassidy, a GOP congressman hoping to oust Landrieu on Saturday, would be the 54th Republican senator in the new Congress that begins work on January 3 . Akbar added that his group had provided the FBI, the Louisiana Secretary of State and the Louisiana Attorney General office with copies of the video. 'We’re pledging our full cooperation with state and federal investigations,' BCF board member Anita MonCrief added. Landrieu's campaign looks to be in trouble just five days from the runoff. Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that political committee which had previously donated heavily to her have switched their allegiances and are now backing Cassidy. And according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Republican voters are the only group whose participation in early voting hasn't dropped off during the runoff, compared to the weeks before the Nov. 4 general election. Landrieu edged Cassidy in that election by 1 percentage point but failed to reach the 50-percent threshold to avoid a runoff. A third candidate, tea-party Republican Rob Maness, captured 13.7 per cent of the vote but later endorsed Cassidy.","Black conservative group obtained videotape of Don Cravins Sr. telling Louisianans to vote twice in Nov. 6 Senate runoff election .

Officials admit that there has been ‘significant under-investment’ since the 1940s, when the Commons was bombed by the Nazis. For years contractors have adopted a 'make do and mend' approach to repairs, while the Commons and Lords have continued to meet. However, experts warn the building is deteriorating at a faster pace than repairs can be carried out during parliamentary holidays. Dr Richard Ware, programme director for the Restoration and Renewal Programme, said: ‘There is very little downtime and the problem is how on earth you undertake fundamental renovations on the scale required under those circumstances. ‘The more things become antiquated the chances of a bigger crisis grow. It’s already burned down once,’ he told Business Insider. Mel Barlex, parliamentary director of estates and technical director for the programme, added: ‘Within six months of my joining I had a member stuck in a lift as a vote was underway. 'The legislation was ultimately passed by seven votes. That brought home just how serious these issues are.’ Many of the 3,00 windows will not close, iron roofs have rusted and leak, toilets regularly flood and the building is riddled with asbestos, in roof spaces, light switches, toilet systems and as a sound suppressant. A Parliament spokesman said: ‘There has been significant under-investment in the fabric of the Palace since at least the 1940s, when parts of the Palace were renovated following bomb damage during the Second World War. Other parts of the Palace have not undergone appropriate renovation since it was built. ‘To date, all intrusive renovation work has been carried out around sittings of parliament. This approach has permitted only the minimum essential maintenance and piecemeal replacement of systems at highest risk of failure. ‘Currently, the rate and speed at which work can be carried out is slower than the rate at which the building is deteriorating so the backlog of essential repairs (and in turn the risk of system failure) is growing over time.’ Brick work is also crumbling, because the Anston limestone from Yorkshire is prone to erosion . Many parts of the Houses of Parliament have not been repaired since they were built, more than 160 years ago . Paintwork in the grand corridors inside the building is also peeling, and in many areas has been damaged by water . A report two years ago found the Victorian structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing. It warned that MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics, heating, ventilation systems, drainage and stone work. They concluded that the World Heritage Site - which contains the Commons and Lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms, offices and dining rooms - was so poorly-maintained that it is ‘remarkable that it continues to function’. And they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe, the Palace of Westminster could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834. Although they did not put a final cost on the work, they say it will be at least £1.6billion. Officials admit that there has been ‘significant under-investment’ since the 1940s, when the Commons was bombed by the Nazis . Beneath the grand corridors and ornate debating chambers, a complex web of cables and pipes has built up over decades . Officials admit that instead of removing outdated cables, more wires have been added, making it difficult to access them for repairs and maintenance . Untangling the years of 'make do and mend' repairs has given  contractors a major headache . The damning report on the state of the home of British democracy was ordered by the House of Commons Commission. It warned: ‘While the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown, investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the Palace.’ There has been no renovation to the spectacular building, rebuilt along designs by Charles Barry in the 1850s, since the late 1940s, following the destruction of the Commons chamber by Nazi bombs. The report goes on: ‘Considering the age of the Palace of Westminster, the 60-plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment, the long-term under-investment in the fabric and the intensive use to which the Palace is put, it is remarkable that it continues to function. ‘The signs of wear and tear, the number and frequency of relatively minor floods and mechanical breakdowns, the high cost of maintaining obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible evidence of the looming crisis.' Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’: . ASBESTOS . The walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk. ELECTRICS . Much of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power . VENTILLATION . Many original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable. HEATING . Many boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the Commons chamber for months . FLOODING . Faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are damp and stained. LEAKY ROOFS . A problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life. DANGEROUS CEILINGS . Several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the House of Lords chamber . DRAINAGE . Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected. FIRE SAFETY . Out of date alarms and automatic detection systems; little ‘compartmentation’ meaning fire can spread easily. LIFTS . Oldest lift dates from 1893, several contain obsolete components. Only nine compliant with building regulations.","Officials as Parliament becomes antiquated, chances of a crisis grow .

"A Florida woman who struck and killed a firefighter as he was changing a flat tire on the side of the road made a frantic 911 call begging the dispatcher to send help. Lt Kevin Johns, 48, a 29-year veteran of the Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue, passed away from his injuries Tuesday after he was mowed down by Lorenza Simmons' car on Interstate 95. Just moments after the deadly collision, a distraught Simmons dialed 911 telling the operator she had struck a man. Scroll down for video . Hero: Lt Kevin Johns, 48 (left and right ), a 29-year veteran of the Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue, was struck and killed while changing a flat tire on the side of the road . Agonizing wait: Lorenza Simmons, pictured next to her heavily damaged Hyundai Sonata, made a frantic 911 call begging for help after plowing into Lt Johns . 'I need an ambulance ASAP, please; I need police,' Simmons says on the newly released recording. I had a bad accident and my car got off the road and it hit a man. Please! 'He's breathing. Can you hear me, sir? Sir, can you hear me? He's breathing, but I need somebody here. Please hurry.’ Johns, a married father of three and a grandfather, was on his way to work at around 7am Tuesday when he pulled over on the side of the highway near Yamato Road to change a tire and was struck by Lorenza Simmons' white Hyundai Sonata. Simmons told police that a Toyota RAV4 in front of her slowed down 'out of nowhere' and she swerved right to avoid a collision because her wheels locked up when she tried to hit the brakes. Despite her efforts, Simmons plowed into the back of the SUV and then veered off to the side to avoid hitting Johns' car parked on the shoulder of the road, Local10 reported. Simmons, left, said Johns, right, stepped out from behind his car and she did not have enough time to stop . According to the woman, the firefighter suddenly emerged from behind his car and she slammed into him, the impact sending the 48-year-old man onto her windshield, . Speaking with WPBF reporters on the scene, Simmons said she stayed with the badly injured firefighter, made sure he was still breathing and tried to talk to him, but he only managed to say a few unintelligible words amid grunts of pain. 'Oh my gosh, I need somebody here,' she can be heard crying during her 911 call. 'Please, take care of this man!’ Just before police and paramedics arrived on the scene, Simmons told the dispatcher: 'I can't believe I hit this man.' Johns was rushed to Delray Medical Center, where he died six hours after the collision. Chain of events: Simmons told police she swerved to avoid striking a Toyota RAV4 (left) that suddenly slowed down and then veered to the side so as not to collide with Johns' car on the shoulder of I-95 . Cruel fate: Kevin Johns was on his way to work at Fire Station 13 when he got a flat tire and had to pull over . Catastrophic collision: The impact sent Johns flying onto the windshield of Simmons' white Hyundai . Dozens of the firefighter’s colleagues came out to support him, forming an honor guard outside the hospital to conduct his flag-draped casket to the medical examiner's office in Palm Beach. So far, no charges have been filed against Lorenza Simmons in connection to the accident. Johns leaves behind his wife, Brenda, three children, ages 17, 20 and 28, and one grandchild. At the time of the crash he was only six months away from retirement. Johns’ co-workers remembered him as the consummate professional who had an impeccable reputation within the department and the community. ‘He understood what it meant to be a firefighter, it was in his blood,’ Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler told the station WSVN.’ I mean, his father was a commander for our fire department for many years.’ Honor guard: Dozens of firefighters came up to accompany Johns' flag-draped casket to the medical examiner's office .

Daddy's little girl: Kevin Johns got to walk his daughter Amanda (left) down the aisle and meet his granddaughter (right) Proud dad: Johns, center, pictured with his two sons, Zach (left) and Kevin Jr (right), at his daughter's wedding . Fort Lauderdale Deputy Fire Chief Timothy Heiser described the veteran firefighter as a leader and role model to his younger colleagues, and someone who led by example on the job and inspired confidence in his superiors. Sun-Sentinel reported that Johns joined the force in 1986, following in the footsteps of his father, Commander Vernon Johns. He and his wife, whom he met in high school, also owned a day care center in their hometown of Jupiter. Hesler added thatJohns had an outstanding record with the department, and that he was never even late for a shift in his 29 years serving at Fire Station 13.","Lt Kevin Johns, 48, a 29-year veteran of Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue, was struck and killed while changing a flat on the side of I-95 Tuesday .

"It's not every day you reach a milestone birthday, so when you do - you should celebrate in style. And Zaire, London Zoo's giant gorilla, marked her 40th in style by wolfing down a cake made specially for her by the Great British Bake Off runner-up Richard Burr. The fan favourite on this year's show, Richard faced the tough challenge of creating a dessert with all of Zaire's favourite treats, including sugar-free jelly, apples, carrots and walnuts. And he certainly lived up to his 'star baker' reputation because the 16.5st western lowland gorilla greedily devoured it all. Scroll down for video . Judge: Giant gorilla enjoys a taste of her 40th birthday cake made for her by Bake Off runner-up Richard Burr . Richard proudly presentshis layered cake to Zaire, which includes her favourite food and colour pink . Not sharing: Zaire arrived at her birthday party and immediately went to her cake and got stuck in . Girlie girl: Despite her age, Zaire loves everything pink and especially enjoys blackcurrant fruit tea . But Richard, who earned the coveted 'star baker' title five times on the show, wasn't fazed by the task - which required the cake to be vegan and Zaire's favourite colour pink. He said: 'I'm thrilled to have made a birthday gift for such a special lady. 'I've always loved London Zoo and am a regular visitor so it's a pleasure to use my Bake Off skills and help celebrate Zaire's birthday. 'I hope she likes the treat I've created especially for her.' He added: 'Frankly, if she was on the panel, I might have won the show, to be honest.' The cake had several defined layers, which featured walnuts, apples, carrots, red peppers and sugar-free jelly . The red peppers were the first to go, said zoo staff, before Zaire dug into the pink-coloured jelly . Clearly, using her hands was too much effort so Zaire digs in using just her mouth instead . Richard's intricate creation is in a messy state after the birthday girl got to it, with the jelly proving especially enjoyable . Zaire's favourite colour is pink so the colour had be prominent in Richard's cake for the birthday girl. But he also had the tricky task of making a vegan cake without eggs, sugar, butter or flour to fit Zaire's dietary requirements. He aimed to give Zaire her daily diet in cake form and include her favourite treats: carrots, apples and walnuts. Keen to show off his Bake Off skills, Richard made sure the cake had 'clear, defined layers' - a popular requirement of judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. There is a layer of shredded carrot and parsnip, bound with coconut oil and with brazil nuts hidden inside. Instead of buttercream, icing is ground cashews coloured with beetroot juice and decorated with pecans. There are slices of red pepper in the middle and the top layer is sugar-free vegan jelly with strawberries set within. Zaire was presented with the cake at her birthday party and immediately ran over to indulge in some cake. She carefully picked at her favourite bits, with red peppers being among the first to go, before she dug into the jelly topping. Zaire, who likes to forage for food and interact with children who visit her, is the eldest gorilla at ZSL London Zoo and has been there for 30 years. Gorilla keeper Glynn Hennessy said: 'Zaire is our old lady of the group, but is still a girlie girl at heart and loves anything pink, as keepers have noticed from various enrichment activities. 'She loves pink fruit tea like strawberry or blackcurrant, so Richard making her a pink birthday treat was a fantastic surprise. She definitely enjoyed tasting all her favourite ingredients. 'Zaire has been at ZSL London Zoo for 30 years and is a calming influence on the rest of the group. She's been there and seen it all so she deserves a fabulous fortieth. 'We're sure having Richard on-hand made her birthday a memorable day.' Nearly gone: With messy fingers, Zaire enjoys the final bit of jelly before the cake is all gone . Tucked away in a corner with her treat, she clearly has no plans to share with her friends . 'She definitely enjoyed tasting all her favourite ingredients,' said gorilla keeper Glynn Hennessy .

"Claims that Jeremy Clarkson’s ‘offensive’ Falklands number plate was a coincidence were crumbling yesterday as it emerged a second ‘joke’ plate was found in the same car. The controversial Top Gear presenter – along with co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond, and their crew – had to flee Argentina last week after locals were angered by the ‘H982 FKL’ plates, an apparent reference to the 1982 Falklands War. The BBC insisted they had not even realised the meaning behind the Porsche 928GT’s plates until three days into filming. They were removed when locals complained. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson and fellow presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) were forced to flee Argentina last week after their convoy was attacked by locals furious over Clarkson's number plate . However, that defence was undermined yesterday by the fact that a set of plates saying BE11 END had been found inside the sports car, which has been abandoned by the crew along with other vehicles. A spokesman for the BBC has admitted the second set had been planned for a sequence in the show, but were not used. And yesterday the dealer who sold the Porsche to the BBC complete with its original H982 FKL plates admitted the show’s staff knew the car’s registration number before they completed its purchase. In another twist, an Argentine judge is now reportedly considering whether to begin a criminal inquiry into unauthorised ‘plate changing’ on the vehicle – after it was found with the registration HI VAE. The offence carries a jail sentence of up to three years. The anger was sparked by the H982 FKL plate, which locals say was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War . The Porsche was sold to the BBC by classic car specialist Mark Waring, 54, of Cheam, Surrey, through his dealership Rennsport Classics Ltd. He had advertised it with the plates masked. Asked about how interested the BBC were in the number plate, Mr Waring said: ‘I’m not prepared to discuss that.’ But he denied claims he had been gagged, saying he never discussed any clients. Asked whether he suspected the Top Gear team were delighted when they discovered the Falklands reference in the car’s plates, Mr Waring said: ‘I wasn’t aware it was Top Gear buying the car, just the BBC.’ Argentinian Police have now revealed they have found another set of offensive number plates in the car . It emerged last night that Top Gear had sent one of its mechanics to inspect the car – and that a researcher went to pay for the car, meaning the team had ample opportunity to spot the ‘Falklands’ plate. But executive producer of the show Andy Wilman insisted all were surprised when its significance was pointed out on the internet three days into filming in Argentina last month. Mr Wilman also suggested he would refuse to answer to the Argentine legal system if charged over using fake plates on the car, saying he had feared for his life and they had no choice than to switch. The new number plate revelation came when local police searched the car Top Gear left behind after the show’s 29-strong crew crossed into Chile on Thursday last week. Jeremy Clarkson flew back to Britain from Chile after the incident and has since claimed the number plates' apparent reference to the Falklands War was a coincidence . But an official in Argentina claims the new plates show the presenters were planning to 'provoke' locals . The car's seller said he was contacted by Top Gear, who told him to forward any media enquiries to them . The cars were attacked near the Argentine city of Ushuaia after pictures of the number plate emerged online . The cars (pictured during filming) have since been impounded by the Argentinian police, who are investigating whether any offence was committed when the plates were switched .

Wenger has been outspoken on the subject in the past following incidents relating to Jack Wilshere -the midfielder was pictured smoking on holiday last summer - and William Gallas. Szczesny was forced to apologise for his behaviour – and it is unclear whether he might also be axed from this week’s Barclays Premier League clash at home to bogey side Stoke. David Ospina was in goal for the FA Cup win over Hull on Sunday and kept a clean sheet – with Szczesny not even picked on the bench. That may have been pre-planned – the Polish keeper didn’t play in any of Arsenal’s domestic cup games last season. But Former Arsenal star John Jensen had claimed on Danish TV that Szczesny, 24, had suffered a bitter fall-out with Wenger and would not play again this season, although Arsenal denied that allegation and said Szczesny remains part of their first-team plans.

"The AFL has called play-on with an ambitious plan to see an Australia-wide women's competition, with the first bounce to potentially come as early as 2017. AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan wants a national review into second-tier football that gets underway next month to include the launch of a women's competition in its discussions. Nearly $80 million is spent on the second-tier, the level directly under the AFL, each season. League executives Mark Evans and Dorothy Hisgrove will lead the review, which will explore how that money is spent and look into ways to 'footify' more women, children and multicultural communities. Participation rate in women's competition have soared, with Victoria 52 teams playing across seven divisions in Victoria. AFL Media Relations Manager Patrick Keane said it was a 'personal goal' of CEO Gillon McLachlan to have a women's competition in two years, and said 2020 was the 'very latest' the AFL would want it introduced. AFL Victoria competition manager of women's football Darren Flanigan said a national women's football league would be great for the sport. 'It'd be fantastic for women's footy,' Mr Flanigan said. 'It would really raise the profile of the competition, and bring a much deserved increase in recognition for players. 'Also, if it stopped being an amateur league and players were paid as semi-professionals or professionals, that'd be great.' AFL Media said it is a 'personal goal' of CEO Gillon McLachlan to have a national women's competition get underway in 2017. Mr Flanigan said the sport is in a boom period of growth, and is expected to continue into the future. 'We have nine new clubs and an increase of more than 30 per cent in participation,' he said. 'That sort of growth is something we have been seeing for a few years now. We'd expect it to continue in 2015, and even get a bit stronger.' Mr Flanigan said popularity is not only increasing across the country, but across all ages levels. 'The growth is coming all the way through from Auskick and right up through the junior levels and into the open-age leagues,' he said. 'Every state now has a female competition and most have a second division.' AFL Victoria competition manager of women's football Darren Flanigan said numbers are expected to increase further in the coming years. However, he would not comment on any potential funding wish-lists, and said that is 'a decision for the AFL'. 'What we are all about is creating a strong, positive environment for women who want to get out there and have a kick of the footy.' The AFL has taken steps forward in recent years in relation to including more women in the game, with St Kilda's Peta Searle becoming the league's first full-time assistant coach last year. in 2013, Richmond appointed Peggy O'Neal the first female club president.","Women's league in 2017 a 'personal goal' of AFL boss Gillon McLachlan .

"Trayvon Martin had drugs in his system the night he was shot and killed, a medical report has revealed. The autopsy on the 17-year-old showed traces of THC, which is found in marijuana, in the teenager's blood and urine. Martin was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest fired from 'intermediate range'. Self-appointed neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman is on trial for the teenager's murder in Florida. New pictures also support the gunman's claim that he was injured in a fight with the teenager, as he is shown with a swollen - possibly broken - nose and bleeding profusely from his head. Scroll down for video . Brawl: Injuries to Zimmerman's face and head, combined with Trayvon Martin's bloody knuckles, reveal a fight between the two that is consistent with Zimmerman's story to police . Evidence: This photo shows the head wounds that George Zimmerman's doctor noted in his medical report . Trayvon's tragic end: The dead teenager's body lying under a yellow tarpaulin after he was killed in a gated community in Sanford, Florida . An autopsy report seen by NBC News claimed Martin also had broken skin on his left ring ringer below the knuckle. The report, prepared by the medical examiner in Volusia County, follows a separate medical examination on Zimmerman which found he had black eyes, a nose fracture and two cuts to the back of his head a day after the fatal shooting on February 26. The report from Zimmerman's doctor at Altamonte Family Practice bolstered the 28-year-old's claims that he was being punched and pummeled by the unarmed teen when he opened fire in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, who is charged with murder in the killing, claims he acted in self-defense and only shot Trayvon when the teen saw the pistol he was carrying and reached for it. It was then, Zimmerman said, he drew the gun himself and pulled the trigger. Injured? This picture seems to show that Zimmerman had a broken nose on the night of his arrest, as suggested by one of the officers who arrested him . Bleeding: Zimmerman's head wound is clearly visible in this photo provided to his defence team this week . On Tuesday, ABC News obtained a medical report from Zimmerman's family, who examined the neighborhood watch volunteer the day after the shooting. Zimmerman wanted to be checked out so he could be cleared to return to work. KFTV in Orland also reported on Tuesday that Trayvon had broken skin on his knuckles when his body was autopsied. The new report contradicted a previous claim by Richard Kurtz, the funeral director who handled the teenager's remains, that there was no damage to his knuckles. Zimmerman's doctor found a 'closed fracture' in Zimmerman's nose, meaning his nose was broken but the skin had not ruptured to expose the nasal bones. He also discovered two cuts on the back of his head, one was one-inch long and the other was a quarter-inch. The famous ice tea: A can of Arizona branded drink which Trayvon bought at a nearby store . Bullet: A casing fired from Zimmerman's gun in what he said was self-defence . Weapon: The handgun apparently owned by Zimmerman and used in the deadly shooting . Handgun: The Kel-Tec PF-9 9mm pistol was taken by Florida police to serve as evidence . George Zimmerman could face the death penalty if federal investigators believe the killing of Trayvon Martin was racially motivated. The neighborhood watch volunteer is currently charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. However, WFTV reports the FBI is investigating whether Zimmerman targeted and shot Trayvon out of a hated for blacks. If a federal prosecutor finds enough evidence to charge Zimmerman with a hate crime murder, the maximum penalty is death. Zimmerman also had two black eyes and bruises on his upper lip and cheek. He also complained of lower back pain, according to the doctor's notes, ABC News reports . The injuries are consistent with Zimmerman's account of his encounter with Trayvon. He told police the high school junior approached him and suck-punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Trayvon then climbed on top of Zimmerman and bashed his head into the sidewalk several times. Zimmerman, 28, told his doctor he was troubled by what happened the night before, saying he experienced 'occasional nausea when thinking about the violence.' The doctor said it was 'imperative' that Zimmerman go to a psychologist he had been seeing to be examined. It's unknown what Zimmerman had sought counseling for in the past. Before the shooting, Zimmerman had been prescribed Adderall, a common psycho-stimulant used treat ADHD, and Temazepam, a sleeping medication. Both drugs cause agitation and mood swings as side effects, though they occur in fewer than 10 percent of patients. Zimmerman claims he followed Trayvon, who was wearing a hoodie, when he saw him walking through the gated community when Zimmerman lives. Hiding out: Zimmerman walked out of jail in the dead of night after posting bail and was quickly whisked away to an undisclosed hiding place . Trayvon, who was staying at his father's girlfriend's condo, was returning home after buying at snack. Zimmerman followed the teen in his car and called 911. He then got out of his car, despite the emergency dispatcher saying he didn't need to continue pursuit. Zimmerman claims that's when Trayvon approached him and threatened him. He told police the teen started the fight by punching in him the face. A national uproar resulted in protests across the country after police declined to arrest Zimmerman. Protestors and Trayvon's parents say he was targeted for being black and the Zimmerman went free because he is not black. Defence: Zimmerman will next appear in court at a bond hearing set for June 29 . Zimmerman was later charged with murder by a special prosecutor who was appointed by Florida Gov Rick Scott. Zimmerman is currently free after posting $150,000 bail. He is currently in hiding after receiving 'thousands' of death threats. On Tuesday, prosecutors 67 CDs with evidence over to defense lawyers. They also released a list of 78 possible witnesses who could be called during the trial. Included in the list are 50 law enforcement officers, including 28 members of the Sanford Police Department. There are also 28 civilians on the list. Among them are Zimmerman's friends and family members. However, the names of 22 witnesses - mostly neighbors who happened to see or hear part of the confrontation - had their names redacted from the public list, in an effort to shield them from the international attention that case has received.","Traces of THC, found in marijuana, discovered in blood and urine .

"The photographer who took the ‘Break the Internet’ full frontal nude pictures of Kim Kardashian insisted on Thursday that 'they are art’ and he is 'very proud of them'. Jean-Paul Goude, a legendary French photographer, told a friend that they ‘were by no means a caricature of Kim, but art.’ The comments follow a flood of parodies being posted on the internet mocking the 34-year-old. Scroll down for video . Holding nothing back: Kim Kardashian went fully nude in a newly released shot from her shoot for Paper magazine with Jean-Paul Goude (censored by MailOnline) What a treat: Kim Kardashian reveals her glistening naked form in yet another shot from Paper magazine's much-talked about Jean-Paul Goude shoot . He told a close colleague in Paris: ‘I am very proud of what they represent – yes there is meant to be humour in the pictures, but above all they are very artistic’. Mr Goude, 74, has not granted any formal interviews since the publication of the pictures because he ‘wants to remain humble', said Virginie Laguenes, who works with the photographer. ‘He is busy with a new project, and wants to carry on with that,’ said Mme Laguenes. She said he ‘worked very well’ with Kim, after the pair hit it off straight away when doing the shoot for Paper Magazine in Paris in September. The American reality TV star beauty smeared herself in baby oil for the shots and then slowly unpeeled a black cocktail dress for Jean-Paul. Soon Kim and Jean-Paul were recreating his iconic 1976 ‘Champagne Incident’ image of model Carolina Beaumont opening a bottle of bubbly onto a glass balanced on her bottom. Photoshop and other technical methods were clearly used to create the image of champagne flying through the air, but Mr Goude has insisted that very little of Kim's body was altered. Kim was married in Paris earlier this year, and owns a flat in the city along with her husband, the rapper Kanye West. Artist: Photographer Jean-Paul Goode and former lover Grace Jones. They had a son together . Anyone for bubbly? In one of two covers for the magazine, the reality star pours champagne into a glass balanced on her bottom, this version can be bought at newstands . It's Kim's turn: Photographer Jean-Paul Goude recreated his well-known Champagne Incident shot with the 34-year-old . Another source told MailOnline: ‘She feels very comfortable with French people, and pretty much did anything that Jean-Paul asked. She absolutely loved the snaps. ‘Kim is particularly happy about the way the pictures are already becoming as iconic as the 1976 champagne incident ones.’ Jean-Paul is famous around the world for his stunning images, having worked with top models including Grace Jones, a former lover with whom he has a son, Paulo. He has also taken pictures of singer and actress Vanessa Paradis, and is the artist behind numerous memorable advertising campaigns. One, for car firm Citroen in 1984, showed a vehicle speeding into the mouth of a giant robotic head looking like Grace Jones. Earlier on Wednesday, Kim shared the two cover shots with her 21 million Instagram followers, captioning the bottom shot with the magazine cover line: 'Break the Internet'. Trending: Kim certainly lit up the internet with comical discussion of her new magazine cover, available online at Paper.com . And late on Thursday more pictures from the shoot emerged with the reality star posing full frontal nude in two extremely risqué new shots. The images, which MailOnline has chosen to censor, make no attempt at discretion as the naked Kim faces the camera front on, grinning happily. In an interview published on Yahoo Style, Paper's editorial director Mickey Boardman explained that it was all Kim's idea. 'Kim’s attitude was ""if we’re gonna do it, let’s really go there,""' he said. 'And it was her idea to take off her clothes and show more than her butt. But we [Paper] didn’t say ""let’s do a cover with your butt hanging out."" 'She said she was willing to take her clothes off and one thing lead to another.' And Kim certainly shows no sign of nerves in the shoot, as she holds her dress down around her knees. In a second new photo from the inside spread Kim can be seen slipping out of her sparkling cocktail dress, her shining behind turned towards the camera to reveal her bare breast. Smeared in baby oil, Kim looks delighted with herself as she smiles at the camera. And as for who had the task of oiling up that much talked about bottom? 'It was the make-up artist,' revealed Boardman. 'It was someone who she works with a lot so she felt comfortable.' 'Which one's real?' Referencing what is most certainly a Photoshop-enhanced image of Kim Kardashian's bottom, Chelsea Handler posted a side-by-side comparison of her bare bum  on Instagram . Mythical beast: One user turned Kim into a beautiful centaur . And as for the talk that the booty had been digitally enhanced, Boardman had this to say: '[There was] much less [retouching] than people think. 'That’s really what she looks like. That’s her. I would say it’s the normal amount of retouching that’s on a normal cover.' He also revealed: 'It is not padded. It is not augmented. That is all really her.' But already, the cyber world was overrun with memes parodying the covers. One was shot with her looking coquettishly over her shoulder with her bare bottom on full display. A second was the Champagne Incident remake. But it was the booty shot which captured everyone's imagination, with Chelsea Handler being one of the first celebs to take a stab at mocking it. Referencing what is most certainly a Photoshop-enhanced bottom, Handler posted a side-by-side comparison of her bare bum with Kim's on Instagram. The comedienne, 39, captioned her image: 'Can you believe more than 2 a** can fit on the same screen? Guess which one's real. Your move, instagram.' Glistening: A lot of users compared the reality star to a glazed donut . Brits do it better: Kim is compared to Pippa Middleton . Kim and the giant peach: the soft fruit was another thing that looked like her behind . Bum's up! An alternative talk on the Kim snap came from American Dad . In the image Chelsea wears nothing but her bra as her underwear is pulled down while she snaps a mirror selfie in a bathroom. Glee actress Naya Rivera - whose looks (and style choices) have been compared to Kim's - also had something to say. 'I normally don't. But... you're someone's mother...' the 27-year-old actress commented on Instagram, referring to Kim and husband Kanye West's toddler daughter North. Kim got some support though too, including from MailOnline's US Editor At Large Piers Morgan who described the image as one that will be 'forever etched in the memory'. Pouring cold water on the internet trolls who had come out to mock Kim, Piers continued: 'It’s time for me to make a shocking admission: I like and admire Kim Kardashian-West. Meanwhile, the internet continued to go to town creating their own versions of the image, from centaurs to docking stations. Twitter user @KelKulus was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the Paper magazine image, tweeting his own version with the caption: 'Kim Kardashian looks so much like a centaur in Paper Magazine, I figured I'd take it one step further.' Kim's rear becomes the rump of a horse, turning the reality star into a centaur. Out and about: On Wednesday afternoon the reality star was pictured arriving at the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills for her pregnant sister Kourtney's baby shower . Mommy duty: Kim brought along her toddler daughter North; Kim's Paper magazine cover attracted criticism from actress Naya Rivera who commented on Instagram: 'you're someone's mother' Lashing out: Kim's style stalker Naya Rivera criticised Kim's mag cover, writing on Instagram 'you are someone's mother' @GeneralBoles killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping Russell Brand's face onto Kim's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming 'PARKLIFE!' Food items has also been another way to describe Kim's glistening rear; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons. 'Krispy Kim' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star, and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of Aero chocolate. Pippa Middleton wearing that bridesmaid dress at her sister's Royal Wedding was also used as a comparision, though really the Brits behind didn't really 'do it better' than Kim. Another tweeter highlighted the mother-of-one's gravitational pull by surrounding her derriere with asteroids. The user also gave Kim a surrealist makeover by Photoshopping her bottom onto her face for quadruple the cheeky impact. One user even compared the image of Kim to that of a Barbie doll, as @SarahKhalegh pointed out: 'Kim Kardashian literally looks like a plastic &unrealistic Barbie doll. Look at her waist in comparison to her body.' It does seem the magazine have done their best to Photoshop the reality star's waist to oblivion and make a behind look bigger than James's Giant Peach. Loved up: Earlier on Wednesday, Kim shared a cut picture of herself getting a kiss from husband Kanye West . Support: And of course Kanye had nothing but good things to hashtag about his wife's racy cover shoot . Just under a fortnight ago, Kim stepped out looking far curvier as she joined her husband Kanye at the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honouring Quentin Tarantino and Barbara Kruger. Of course the rapper, who only follows Kim on Twitter, tweeted his approval of the cover with the simple hashtag '#ALLDAY'. While all this was going on, it was business as usual for Kim, who was spotted out at a Beverly Hills hotel with her family for her pregnant sister Kourtney's baby shower. However Kim didn't get exactly what she wanted... the internet seems to be working perfectly fine.","Jean-Paul Goude tells colleague that they 'were by no means a caricature of Kim, but art' after the poses were parodied on the internet .

"British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais, it emerged today. The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year. During a visit to Calais on Monday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve signed an agreement to ensure the new facility will be open by January. Scroll down for video . Illegal immigrants have been waiting in Calais to try to cross the English Channel and work or claim benefits in Britain . Thousands of immigrants, many of them from Africa, try to sneak on board trucks waiting to cross the channel . Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart, pictured, said there were currently 2,500 migrants living in the town . But aid groups warned the centre could turn into an expensive 'ghetto' that will become a magnet for thousands more asylum seekers who want to make the journey across the English Channel. Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will have 'a budget of more than three million euros a year, which the state will be asking the European Union for.' Britain pays more than £8bn a year to the EU, meaning UK money will certainly end up being used to welcome the migrants to Calais, who currently number around 2,500. Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will be housed in a collection of prefabricated buildings close to the docks, where migrants try to get on lorries every day. The facility will serve at least 1,500 meals a day, and provide heating toilets and showers as well as beds for the most vulnerable. Mayor Bouchart said the migrants were willing to risk death to cross the English Channel . The migrants have been living in make-shift camps near the ferry port in north-eastern France . Campaigners fear that a new planned camp in Calais could quickly turn into a 'ghetto' The new centre has raised the prospect of a new Sangatte - the Red Cross centre which became a magnet for migrants before it was shut down as part of an Anglo-French agreement in 2002. In a statement, Emmaus France, the migrant charity, said the new centre would become 'a ghetto', giving 'migrants invisibility' as they prepared to continue their dangerous journeys. Even Jean-Marie Alexandre, president of La Vie Active (Active Living), which will be running the centre, has voiced his concerns. 'It will of course be complicated,' said Mr Alexandre. 'It's a risk that we're taking, above all for our reputation. In this matter, we have more to lose than we have to gain.' Mr Alexandre said: 'We will be managers of this welcome centre on the condition that it is legitimate and that security is assured.' Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart said last week that some 2,500 migrants currently in the area were 'willing to die' to take advantage of British social security benefits. The black economy in Britain is estimated to be worth some £80bn a year, four times the size of France's, so cash-in-hand jobs are attractive to asylum seekers in the UK. Ms Bouchart said the British government had done nothing to suggest to potential migrants that there was no 'El Dorado' for them in the UK, and that the situation was far worse than 11 years ago, when Sangatte was shut. The Sangatte camp was closed in 2002 and demolished following an agreement between Britain and France .","British EU contributions will fund new centre in Calais .

"America and Britain have been accused of leaving hostages to die and keeping families in the dark about their fate by the father of a man held captive by Isis. Following the murder of US hostage Peter Kassig families of freed hostages demanded to know why America and Britain did not do more to secure his release. Hostages from France, Denmark and Turkey are understood to have been freed following negotiations. A video released by Isis yesterday purports to show 26-year-old Mr Kassig being beheaded along with 18 Syrian soldiers. The father of a former hostage who was held in Syria by the extremists told MailOnline: ‘There does not seem to be any coordination between major powers such as Britain, America and countries like France who are prepared to deal with the terrorists. Following the murder of Peter Kassig, above, the father of a freed hostage has attacked America and Britain for keeping loved ones in the dark . Ed and Paula Kassig, whose son Peter was killed according to a video released by Isis this weekend, have appealed for the video not to be watched . Peter Kassig seen in a previous Isis video in which he was threatened with execution. His body was not shown in the horrific video released at the weekend . ‘Accordingly families are kept in the dark about what is happening to their loved ones. They feel powerless in the struggle to see them freed.’ Asking not to be identified for security reasons, the father added: ‘On the one hand countries like France are clearly negotiating with IS, and getting their hostages freed, while with the Americans and the British it’s the complete opposite’. A former hostage who was held in Syria who also asked not to be named said: ‘Nobody seems to know what they’re doing – the Americans and British in particular come across as incompetent and unfeeling, with no coordinated policy. 'Britain used to negotiate with terrorists groups like the IRA - all kinds of deals were done. We're dealing with human lives here - we can't just leave people to be killed in the most horrific circumstances imaginable.’ Such views were backed up by Nicolas Hénin, a French journalist held in Syria for 10 months before being freed with three fellow countrymen in April this year. The Frenchmen at one point shared a cell with James Foley, another US hostage who has decapitated by IS killers, aged 40. Hénin has visited the Foley family in Rochester, New Hampshire, since and said they were ‘very disillusioned, extremely disappointed with the policies in general.’ 'Hope the next family is better treated': Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who was held hostage by Islamic State, says the families of US victims need to be looked after more carefully . Isisi negotiations: Released French hostages Edouard Elias (second left), Didier Francois (third left), Nicolas Henin (fourth right), Pierre Torres (second right) arrived back at Villacoublay military airbase on April 20 after 10 months of captivity in Syria . He said members of the Foley family ‘were buffeted by the government, they weren’t supported, they had very little communication, either from the State Department or the FBI’. He said the Foley family were ‘a lot more reasonable than all the soap powder sellers who came every day to try and exploit his image, the memory of the son, in selling this or that cause.’ Mr Hénin was released with three fellow countrymen – Édouard Elias, Didier François and Pierre Torrès. While France has always insisted it does not pay ransoms to groups like IS, there have been well documented claims that millions in cash has been handed over through middle men. Mr Hénin has always insisted that his release was secured through ‘negotiation’ by the French government with his kidnappers – something the British and Americans refuse to do. They believe that paying ransoms encourages more kidnappings, and provides massive funding to murderous groups such as IS. Mr Foley’s family received a message warning that he would be killed after his captors demanded a ransom of $132m in 2013. While not calling for ransoms to be paid, Mr Hénin said the Foleys hoped that ‘those close to the next Americans who are taken hostage are better treated.’ Confirming Mr Kassig’s death on Sunday, US President Barack Obama said IS, which now controls a third of Iraq and Syria, 'revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.' The family of James Foley, pictured above in a chilling video released by Isis, are said to be disappointed by the treatment they have received by US authorities . It followed an emotional statement from Mr Kassig’'s parents about the fate of their 'treasured' son, who was captured by IS last October. In the release, Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, said they hoped their son would be remembered for his 'important work' and his love for others. US National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the country was 'appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American.' Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'horrified by the cold blooded murder' of Mr Kassig and claimed that IS militants 'have again shown their depravity'. Mr Kassig was captured in Syria in October last year while providing medical training and humanitarian aid to victims of the country's conflict.","Father of freed hostage says France negotiates but U.S. and Britain do not .

"Michael Gove was yesterday embroiled in a new war of words over showing Blackadder in schools – with one of the programme’s stars. Sir Tony Robinson, asked to weigh in to the row over whether the TV comedy should be used in lessons about the First World War, branded Mr Gove ‘very silly’. The actor, who played the hapless Baldrick in the long-running series, refused to accept Mr Gove’s claims that it would feed pupils ‘left-wing myths’ about the 1914-18 conflict. Sir Tony Robinson, asked to weigh in to the row over whether the TV comedy should be used in lessons about the First World War, branded Mr Gove 'very silly' Writing in the Mail last week, Mr Gove said: ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder as misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out of touch elite. Even to this day there are left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths.’ He said this portrayal served to belittle Britain’s role in what was a ‘just war’ to combat German aggression. The troops who fought and died showed ‘patriotism, honour and courage’, he said. But yesterday Labour’s education spokesman, Tristram Hunt, a historian, called Mr Gove’s article ‘shocking stuff’. And Sir Tony, a prominent member of the Labour Party who once sat on its national executive, said: ‘I think Mr Gove has just made a very silly mistake. It is not that Blackadder teaches children about World War One. When imaginative teachers bring it in, it’s simply another teaching tool. ‘They probably take them over to Flanders to have a look at the sights out there, have them marching around the playground, read the poems of Wilfred Owen to them. And one of the things that they’ll do is show them Blackadder.’ He told Sky News: ‘To make this mistake, to categorise teachers who would introduce something like Blackadder as left-wing and introducing left-wing propaganda, is particularly unhelpful and irresponsible from a minister of education. It’s just another example of slagging off teachers.’ A spokesman for Mr Gove hit back, saying: ‘Tony Robinson is wrong. Michael wasn’t attacking teachers, he was attacking the myths perpetuated in Blackadder and elsewhere. ‘Michael thinks it is important not to denigrate the patriotism, honour and courage demonstrated by ordinary British soldiers in the First World War.’ Blackadder Goes Forth is set in the trenches of the Western front in 1917, and focuses on the increasingly desperate attempts of Captain Blackadder, played by Rowan Atkinson, to avoid the action. Speaking ahead of the centenary of the outbreak . of the Great War Mr Gove said only 'undergraduate cynics' would say . soldiers had fought in vain . He receives little help from his sidekick Private Baldrick. In his article Mr Gove, who has been defended by some historians, said the effect of such programmes is that ‘our understanding of the war has been overlaid by misunderstandings and misrepresentations which reflect an at best ambiguous attitude to this country and at worst an unhappy compulsion on the part of some to denigrate virtues such as patriotism, honour and courage’. Britain is preparing to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war in a series of events costing £50million. Labour’s Mr Hunt claimed in The Observer that the Government was using the centenary to ‘rewrite the historical record and sow political division’ and accused the Tories of being ‘crass’. He added: ‘Whether you agree or disagree, after the deaths of 15million people during the war, attempting to position 1918 as a simplistic, nationalistic triumph seems equally foolhardy – not least because the very same tensions re-emerged to such deadly effect in 1939.’","Gove claimed Blackadder depicted military efforts as 'misbegotten shambles'

"Motown legend Smokey Robinson has listed his 9,075-square-foot California mansion for a discounted price of $7.99 million - hoping for a 'third time lucky' after previous attempts to sell the property failed. The white-washed, six-bedroom property on the star-studded Chatsworth estate includes a wine cellar, 'man cave', movie theater with reclining leather seats, and a 2,000-square-foot guest house. It first hit the market in 2005 for a cool $10.5 million and was lowered to $10 million in 2007 with no success. All yours: Motown music legend Smokey Robinson has listed his 9,075-square-foot California mansion for a discounted price of $7.99 million .

Music legend: Robinson (pictured left, in the Seventies and right in October 2014) has been behind some of the greatest records of the past half-century, writing and producing songs for artists including the Supremes and Marvin Gaye . Robinson, 74, purchased the three-storey home for $2.7 million in 2002. His second wife, Frances, was in charge of interior design and it took a year to get the Nineties build up to scratch. She designed a 'men's room' for Robinson and his friends to hang out in, decking it out with a pool table, plasma TV and trophy cabinet. A large crystal chandelier in the  domed hallway and cherrywood flooring in place of marble were among her other touches. The designer told SF Gate the first time she and her husband tried to sell the property in 2005 that it was 'too much house' and they were looking to downsize. Indeed, one of the redundant bedrooms was used as a storage room for Robinson's golf gear. Lived-in: Robinson, 74, purchased the three-storey home for $2.7 million in 2002 .

Fred Calloway of Calloway Real Estate holds the current listing. During his time at the Chatsworth property, Robinson released numerous albums including the collection of standards Timeless Love and most recently Smokey & Friends - an album of duets, including ones with Elton John, John Legend and Jessie J. The R&B star, who was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, founded The Miracles while he was still in high school. Their single Shop Around became Motown’s first number one hit on the R&B singles chart. He announced his retirement from the stage in 1972 so he could concentrate on running Motown Records as  vice president. However, he returned to the music industry the following year as a solo artist, releasing hits such as Cruisin', Being With You  and Just to See Her. In 1987, he was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and awarded an individual star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Along with the Miracles, Robinson has been behind some of the greatest records of the past half-century, writing and producing songs for artists including the Supremes and Marvin Gaye.

"Tiny and innocent, little Danica May Camacho peers out at the world just moments after her birth at a hospital in the Philippines. Wearing a hat to keep the heat from escaping through her head, she nestles against her mother's skin as her proud parents look on. However, Danica's birth is not only significant to mother Camille and father Florante. She is one of the world's symbolic seven billionth occupants. Room for one more? Tiny Danica Camacho - the world's 7 billionth resident - is cuddled by her mother Camille as they are wheeled out of the delivery room . Something to celebrate: Proud father Florante Galura holds a cake marking the significance of his daughter's birth . The Philippines, ranked 12th as the most populated . country in the world, joined the rest of the world as it welcomed its . symbolic seven billionth baby in a simple ceremony at the hospital. Danica was born two minutes before . midnight and arrived to a celebratory cheer at the packed Government-run . Jose Fabella Hospital in Manila. Weighing 5lbs 5oz, . Danica May Camacho was delivered amid an . explosion of media flash bulbs in the delivery room at Manila's Jose . Fabella Memorial Hospital. Mother Camille Dalura said: 'She looks so lovely. I can't believe she is the world's seventh billion.' The baby is the second child for Camille and her partner Florante, who quietly stood in a corner . wearing a white hospital gown as television crews and photographers . crowded to get a shot of his daughter. The parents and the baby were met by top United Nations officials in the Philippines, who presented the child with a small cake. What's all the fuss about? Danica is oblivious to the significance of her arrival . New family: Danica's arrival was marked with a simple ceremony at the hospital where she was born . There were also gifts from local . benefactors including a scholarship grant for the child's study, and a . livelihood package to enable the parents to start a general store. Also on hand to witness the landmark . event was 12-year-old Lorrize Mae Guevarra, who was declared the world's . symbolic six billionth baby in 1999 and is now in the sixth grade. Guevarra said: 'I am very happy to . see this cute baby. I hope like me she will grow up to become healthy . and well loved by everyone.' The child is one of several in . countries around the world being declared a symbolic seven billionth . human.The United Nations has declared October 31 as Seven Billion day - . the date when the  globe's population is estimated to reach seven . billion. It was hoped she would arrive at exactly midnight, but she was delivered two minutes early. Health Secretary Enrique Ona said the . arrival of the world's seven billionth baby also presented the . Philippines with an opportunity to assess population related issues. According to the UN Population Fund . (UNFPA) State of the World Population Report, the Philippines is the . 12th most populous country in the world with 94.9 million people. China continues to have the biggest share of the population at 1.35 billion, followed by India at 1.24 billion. Still growing strong: Experts expect the world population to continue expanding until the middle of the century . The report noted that in many parts . of the developing world, where population growth outpaces economic . growth, reproductive health care remains a crucial issue. UNFPA representative Ugochi Daniels . said that while the Philippine population remains young, with people . under 25 making up 54 percent of the total, they needed to be taught . proper 'life skills' and about sexual issues. She said that while women were having fewer children globally, the overall population continued to go up. 'While our world of seven billion . represents a complex picture of trends and paradoxes, there are some . essential global truths we observe,' she said. 'Conversely, there is no one global population outlook.' The UNFPA said 10 percent of Filipino . girls aged 15 to 19 have started child bearing, with many of the young . also increasingly vulnerable to HIV. There is scepticism over the accuracy . of the UN's Seven Billion Day estimation, with critics saying there is . no way of truly telling when the population of the human race hits the . landmark. In the past century, the world’s . population has increased fourfold. And it has only been 12 years since . the planet marked six billion people. Many . independent demographers say the UN has jumped the gun.

"The family of 5-year-old Arianna Remy continued to fight for her custody in court this week while the granddaughter of the Red Sox announcer languished in foster care, waiting for a Massachusetts judge to decide her fate. The child was seized by state officials after Jerry Remy's son, 34-year-old Jared Remy, was charged with stabbing to death Arianna's mother, Jennifer Martel, last August. The 61-year-old baseball announcer and . his wife, Phoebe, have been locked in a custody battle with Miss . Martel's parents, Brian and Patricia Martel, and her brother and his . wife. Scroll down for video . In limbo: Arianna Remy, 5, pictured here with her now-late mother, Jennifer Martel, has been in foster care since August . On Wednesday, the lawyers representing the two warring families appeared in court to make their case in a closed-door hearing at Middlesex Probate and Family Court, The Boston Herald reported. A spokesperson for the Department of Children and Families said that both sets of grandparents have been visiting Arianna in foster care on a regular basis. The trial in the custody case is expected to get under way March 25. Meanwhile, Jerry Martel returned to work Sunday for the first time since his son's arrest last summer. The 61-year-old sportscaster was back in the NESN television booth to announce the Red Sox exhibition game against the Baltimore Orioles in Fort Myers, Florida. ‘It was good to be back and do a game,’ Remy said after the Red Sox’s 8-6 victory. ‘It felt like my first game of spring training, like it always does — you know, you get all scrambled when all the guys get into the game. It was fine. It felt really good to be back.’ His son Jared Remy, 34, is accused of the murder of Miss Martel, 27, whom he allegedly pinned to the patio at their Waltham home and stabbed repeatedly in front of their . 5-year-old daughter Arianna last August. Veteran Boston Red Sox commentator Jerry Remy, pictured on Monday, had made the difficult decision to return this season after taking a leave of absence when his son was accused of murder . Mr Remy told a press conference in January: 'Call me a bad father if you want. But I’ll be damned if my wife is not a good parent.', Boston.com reported. The couple have three adult children Jared, Jordan and Jenna. Mr Remy offered no defense of his accused son, telling reporters: 'It’s pretty clear what is going to happen. He’s in jail. There’s no bail.' Jared Remy's murder trial has been . scheduled for October this year. He broke his silence during a court . appearance last October to proclaim his . innocence. 'No,' was Remy's blunt response when a Boston Herald reporter asked if he killed the mother of his daughter. 'That’s ridiculous.' 'How dumb would I . have to be? I loved her, I still love her,' he said. The . bulky 34-year-old maintains his innocence despite eyewitness accounts . of Remy committing the murder. Police also reportedly dragged Remy from the murder scene covered in blood. Jared Remy is accused of stabbing to death his 27-year-old girlfriend last August while their 5-year-old daughter looked on at their Boston home . Jennifer Martel, 27, was stabbed multiple times and bled to death on August 15. Her family says she was very close to escaping the abusive relationship . Remy's daughter has been in state custody since after the murder. 'She’s in a good place. She has a dog . to play with, which makes me happy because she loves animals. I’m hoping . she’s going to be a veterinarian one day,' her father said. Both Remy and Miss Marel's parents have petitioned for custody of the little girl. He also said he has no intention of contacting his daughter while he remains behind bars. 'If . she chooses to know me at some point and wants to see me, that’s fine. If she doesn’t, that’s fine, too. I just want her to be happy. I love . her. I want her to go to high school, I want her to go to college, I . want her to have everything in life she  deserves,' he said. Boston Red Sox second baseman turned broadcaster Jerry Remy will return this season . Remy also expressed regret over the pain this is causing his famous father, as well as his mother. 'They’re very good people. I wish the media would leave them alone. None of this is their fault. They don’t need to be dragged down in this, too,' he said. At . the time of the brutal murder, Jerry Remy said that . his ‘disgust and remorse’ were indescribable. In a statement released . through his Twitter account, Mr Remy said he and his wife were . ‘heartbroken’ over the death of Miss Martel. ‘Words cannot describe my wife's and my grief,’ Jerry Remy . wrote. ‘Son or not, I am at loss for words articulating my disgust and remorse . over this senseless and tragic act.’ On August 13 last year, police arrived at Jared Remy's home in the Windsor Village apartment complex . at 9.30pm following multiple 911 calls. They found . Martel bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds. Middlesex . Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Miss Martel in . the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to . the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly. 'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle'. Remy was arrested at the scene after he held . his hands over his head and surrendered to officers. His clothing was . soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an . engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket. Just . feet away lay Miss Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab . wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A . blue cloth covered her face. 'There . was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the . victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was . motionless, not breathing.' Remy, who in 2005 . admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District . Court just days before the murder on a domestic assault charge against Miss Martel. He was released without bail. History: Remy was released from jail for assaulting Martel just two days before her murder . Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend. 'She . said, ""I was planning my escape,""' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on . Wednesday. She said, ""Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape.""' Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing. At least one . neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid . and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved . his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said. 'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.' Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio. Remy pleaded not guilty and . has been ordered held without bail. Remy's defense attorney, Peter . Bella, did not contest the bail order. Police found Miss Martel dying from multiple stab wounds at the Windsor Village apartment complex in Waltham, Massachusetts last summer . Remy has maintained his innocence in the brutal murder of his girlfriend last year . Patty Martel described her daughter as 'an excellent, loving mother' to her daughter Arianna. 'She . had so much to look forward to in her life,' she said. 'She planned on . getting married, but she broke it off and told me she was never going to . marry him. ... In the last few years my daughter wasn't happy. He would . do anything and everything to keep them away from us. It got worse in . the last few months but she never told me it was to the point where it . was this.' She said she was determined to take custody of her granddaughter. 'I . don't want him to get his hands on her. If he gets out that's the first . thing he's going to do is try to get her. He just traumatized his . daughter for the rest of her life.'. In 2009, Remy, then a security guard . for the Red Sox, and a colleague were accused of using steroids. He was . fired after he admitted using the performance-enhancing drug, but he . denied supplying steroids to his coworker.","Arianna Remy, 5, remains in foster care pending outcome of trial set to begin later this month .

"Sara Davis had a happy summer. The company director could race around the Home Counties from meeting to meeting in her Nissan Juke without so much as a hint of a traffic jam. Now she has to allow an hour for a journey that in August took 30 minutes, fits in far fewer meetings and arrives home late and frustrated each evening. Just thinking about sitting behind the wheel makes her stressed. She is in no doubt whose fault that is. Scroll down for video . ‘When the school run starts in early September, the misery begins,’ says 35-year-old Sara Davis from Surrey . ‘When the school run starts in early September, the misery begins,’ says the 35-year-old from Ashtead, Surrey. ‘It’s like an annual migration. Herds of mothers pack themselves onto the roads in their 4x4s and SUVs with no regard for other road users, then trundle off mindlessly like lemmings. ‘There’s nothing more annoying than sitting in traffic when you need to be somewhere on time, all because of mothers driving their children to school — especially when half the cars have only one child in them.’ Retired business analyst Preston Cater, 60 says: ‘Chaotic parking is normal and at 8.55am the car horns start’ Sara’s annoyance began several years ago when she was working in Chigwell, Essex, near a prep school. ‘Every morning it delayed me by at least half an hour. The area was well served by public transport, but I never once saw a child or mother walking down the road. ‘Every car was a huge 4x4 and most of the children were watching DVDs on the in-car entertainment systems. They were deposited at the school front door. ‘If mums couldn’t get through the gates, they just ditched the cars in the road or on the verges. Anyone who objected was likely to get a mouthful of abuse.’ Sara’s anger is being echoed by drivers all around the country. Come 8.30am, with the rush hour in full swing, an extra million parents get into their cars to drive their children to school. That adds 150 per cent to commuters’ journey times, according to sustainable transport pressure group Sustrans, while the mums are travelling, on average, just over a mile-and-a-half. Nowadays, nearly half of all schoolchildren are driven to school, despite most living within a 25-minute walk or 15-minute cycle ride. Twenty years ago, it was just one child in five. The influx of cars not only clogs roads, but causes problems for residents when mothers in a rush abandon their vehicles in the road or block driveways. ‘School mums fly round the corner of my one-lane street as if they own the road, then just sit there staring you out if you have the temerity to be coming in the opposite direction,’ says Louisa Bishop, 45, an office worker who lives near a primary school in Blackheath, South-East London. ‘Normally it’s fine — you wait and the other driver will thank you or they let you through first. Nearly half of all schoolchildren are driven to school, despite most living within a 25-minute walk or 15-minute cycle ride. Twenty years ago, it was just one child in five . ‘But not school mums. I’m the one who always has to reverse because in minutes there will be three or four of them in a line, honking their horns. Once I was trapped for six minutes. ‘It’s all so unnecessary. Why can’t they just walk?’ Retired business analyst Preston Cater, 60, lives near a school in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. ‘Chaotic parking is normal and at 8.55am the car horns start,’ he says. ‘Parents deliberately park their cars just anywhere.’ Andrew Balkin, a health adviser, is equally frustrated. The 42-year-old from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, says: ‘I came out of my house one day to find a mother parking across my driveway. ‘I told her politely that I had to get out because I had a meeting, but she started swearing at me using every word in the book — in front of her son, who could only have been nine. ‘She stomped off, leaving me stranded. It was 20 minutes before she returned. I was furious. Then I had to deal with a client equally angry that I was late.’ The school run doesn’t just affect people’s moods; it also has a severe effect on business. According to Aberdeen University, it costs the economy £88 million in wasted time each year. While some children live too far from school to walk or are too young to take a bus by themselves, rising numbers are being driven to the gates because of parental anxiety about their safety. Mother-of-two Ingrid Dearling, 37, from Reigate, Surrey, says: ‘I live 2½ miles from my children’s primary school and they are too young to get the bus on their own. What can I do? I don’t feel I should apologise. For most mothers, the school run in the car is a necessity. It’s not as though it’s an enjoyable thing to do in the morning.’ Mum and midwife Helen Dawson, 36, from Leeds, also believes that there is no alternative for busy working mothers. ‘Everyone needs to take their children to school,’ she says. ‘When you’re in a rush to get to work, you can’t just park miles away to please the neighbours.’ The school run doesn’t just affect people’s moods; it also has a severe effect on business. According to Aberdeen University, it costs the economy £88 million in wasted time each year . Yet irresponsible parking can have unforeseen consequences. Police were called to Fixby junior school in Huddersfield after an ambulance trying to reach a sick child took 15 minutes to battle the last 300 yards to the school because people had left their cars strewn about. ‘The ambulance driver was at a loss for words,’ fumed head teacher Claire Allen in a letter to parents. In Roundhay, Leeds, 83-year-old Michael Bligh feels trapped by parents gridlocking the streets around St John’s Church of England primary. ‘They use my driveway to turn their cars around, and once someone blocked the gateway when my brother was ill and needed to get to a doctor’s appointment,’ he says. ‘When I confronted them, they hurled abuse at me.’ The school run can also cause accidents. Between 2011 and 2012, there were more than 800 serious and fatal injuries to children at school run times, according to Road Safety Analysis research. Every month, 1,100 children suffer some form of injury on their way or from school. ‘The figures are not surprising,’ says Nick Lloyd, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. ‘These are the peak times for road accidents.’ Many mothers blame oversubscription to schools for the increase in school run problems. Kay Rogers, 44, an interior designer from Bristol, says: ‘I have to drive as I have girls at two schools. I can’t walk it.’ Other mothers admit that they drive their children to school as it’s convenient. ‘Driving means I can quickly drop off my eight-year-old, then get on with other things I need to do,’ says 32-year-old Rosie Hodgson, from Laleham, Surrey. Her child’s school, Laleham Church of England primary, holds a fortnight-long initiative each year to try to get people to car-share or walk to school. ‘Once it has finished, everyone starts coming in their cars again,’ says 44-year-old Jo Sturdy, who lives just over a mile away. In Montpelier in Edinburgh, there were calls from residents for an exclusion zone to keep motoring mothers out of the genteel Georgian neighbourhood. Mum-of-three Larra Praino, 33, walks her children to school there and despairs at what she sees. ‘Parents reverse their cars and chuck out their children in a hurry,’ she says. ‘It’s lazy and careless. It’s so easy to walk.’ Edinburgh city leaders are considering whether to introduce a ban. It can be done: this year, East Lothian Council banned cars from roads leading to three primary schools in Haddington at peak time. Traffic wardens and police enforce the rule. The 18-month pilot, which could be extended if it proves successful, has even proved to be a hit with many parents. Michelle Wall, 30, whose son Matthew, five, goes to Haddington infant school, says: ‘Maybe it is bit inconvenient for some parents, but it’s absolutely necessary.’ The school run problem is so acute that in 2008 an all-party parliamentary committee was established to look at ways of weaning over-protective parents from their cars . The school run problem is so acute that in 2008 an all-party parliamentary committee was established to look at ways of weaning over-protective parents from their cars. It recommended a system of U.S.-style yellow school buses. A pilot scheme in West Yorkshire, where 200 of the custom-made buses were introduced, was successful — but then came the recession and plans to roll out the initiative were ditched. Health experts and council officials agree that encouraging mothers to walk their children to school would be the best solution. And according to Sustrans, they could save themselves £600 a year by doing so. Now, isn’t that an incentive?","‘When the school run starts, the misery begins,’ says Sara Davis, 35 .

"Police will go on strike in Calais tomorrow in protest at the vast influx of migrants ‘threatening public safety’ as they prepare to enter Britain. In unprecedented scenes, members of France’s SGP-FO police and general workers’ union will call for more resources to cope with the growing number of foreigners. ‘The police can no longer provide for their own safety, let alone that of Calais,’ said Gilles Debove, spokesman for the union.

Gang fights are common, while many steal food and other essential supplies before trying to board lorries and then ferries heading to Britain.

The population of Calais has been invited to a demonstration on Monday, with police union members also calling for a traffic ‘go slow’ on main roads heading into the town. Mr Debove added: ‘We are no way trying to stigmatize migrants. Our message is clear: this will be a pacifist and republican demonstration which will exclude any extremist organisation.’ Over the summer, Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry.

"If you are going to get ahead in life, it seems every little girl and little boy needs a Pank in their life. A Pank will smother them with love and advice and buy them the very latest and expensive must-have toys which will ensure their ongoing popularity with their friends. Sociologists, always on the lookout for a new acronym, have coined a fresh one - Pank - a professional aunt, no kids. Doting: Panks smother their nieces and nephews with love and advice and buy them the very latest and expensive must-have toys . And among the notable Panks smothering their nieces and nephews with love and enviable gifts is actress, Cameron Diaz. Diaz, who has no children, was present at the birth of all her three nieces and admits she spoils them rotten. The 41-year-old actress says: ‘Whatever they want, they get. I cannot resist. But being an aunt is the most important role in my life.’ Jennifer Aniston, 44, who is merely a godmother to Coco Arquette, the daughter of her Friends’ co-star Courtney Cox, says that although she doesn’t have children herself she too dotes ‘like a mother, or at least an aunt’ with the eight-year-old. 'I cannot resist': Cameron Diaz, who has no children, admits she spoils her three nieces rotten . She said of the little girl who calls her Nuna: ‘She is very precious to me and we share confidences.’ The stars are the latest to acknowledge the power of the professional, childless aunt who has surplus love and money to lavish on their pampered niblings. The image of the doting, slightly dotty aunt has been a British stereotype since the Victorian age, . But today Panks are anything but dotty or eccentric and are likely to be working in well-paid top level jobs. And they are becoming more and more visible in the sociological make-up of the British family because more women are choosing to focus on their professional careers and put off having children until later. Jane Pilcher, a sociology lecturer at the University of Leicester, told the Sunday Times: ‘Those who have put off having children might give expression to their nurturing side through the children of their siblings. ‘And they might be glad to spend surplus money on them.’ she added. Last week research by Euromonitor, a global marketing research firm, suggested American Panks were spoiling their nieces and nephews to the tune of £6bn a year. And with more and more women choosing to concentrate on their careers in the UK - Britons not far behind. For every Pank there is also a Punk - professional uncle, no children - and actor Jake Gyllenhaal, 32, is the perfect example. The actor says some of his best evenings are spent babysitting his sister Maggie’s, children. Motherly: Jennifer Aniston, 44, dotes on goddaughter Coco Arquette, right, who is the daughter of Courtney Cox . He said: ‘Ramona and Gloria Ray are the cure for the Hollywood day.’ Though he admitted he has yet to become an expert in choosing presents for the two youngsters. Melanie Notkin, 44, a marketing consultant, founded the website SavvyAuntie with the idea of fixing just such a problem. She said: ‘People imagine us knitting or eating food out of a can while watching TV, but really these days we are more like the cool aunt who exposes a child to cultural experiences that their parents might not have the time and money for.’ She said around three out of every four Panks spent around £300 a year on their nephews and nieces and the sum is rising. Babysitter: Jake Gyllenhaal, pictured with his sister Maggie, is the perfect example of a Punk - professional uncle, no children . The Office for National Statistics this year published figures showing that one in five British women is childless at 45. The figure compares with one in eight childless women among what could be described as their mothers’ generation – those born on the eve of the Second World War in 1939. The proportion of women who do not have babies has not been so high since 1920, when many were denied marriage and family by the loss of so many men in the First World War.","Panks smother their nieces and nephews with love and advice .

"A student from China was scammed into giving a taxi driver from Chicago O’Hare airport $4420 for a taxi journey that should have cost less than $300. The University of Illinois student who did not know very much English, was lied to by the driver who told him that there were no more buses heading to the town of Champaign, Illinois that evening. The 18-year-old Chinese student was approached by a driver in the arrivals hall of O'Hare airport and offered to take the student to the university campus some 150 miles away for $1,000. Upon arriving at the campus, the cabbie demanded $4,800 for the journey. Unfair fare: A Chinese student was charged $4,800 for a 150-mile ride from Chicago O'Hare airport to his university campus at Champaign, Illionois . Right rip-off: The journey should have cost just under $300 for the 150 mile trip, but the cabby had other ideas... ‘The student said he didn't have that much so he gave him all he had,’ University of Illinois police Sgt. Tom Geis told the News-Gazette. Chicago police are now looking for the driver. The International Student and Scholar Services program at the University of Illinois asked the student as to why he trusted the taxi driver and why he was carrying such a large amount of money in the first place. ‘It's hard to know why this would have happened,’ Julie Misa, director of the program said. Touting for business: The driver approached the student in the arrivals hall after picking up his bag and initially agreed to a $1,000 fare for the trip . The university website recommends students a number of ways to get to the campus including a bus which costs around $30. A web site designed to book taxi rides, worldtaximeter.com, says that riders should expect to pay $290 for a cab from O'Hare to Champaign, a 150 mile trip.","Driver approached Chinese student at Chicago O'Hare airport .

The hat was bought for £1.5million at a packed auction at Fontainebleau, near Paris, today (above) The two-pointed hat, of a style widely worn by military officers at the time, was usually worn sideways by Napoleon, making him easy to spot on the battlefield. He wore around 120 during his life, including one at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, when he was famously defeated by a British-led army under the Duke of Wellington. The last time one of the hats came up for sale in France was in 1968, meaning there was huge interest in this weekend's sale at Fontainebleau, near Paris. Auctioneers Osenet had originally put a reserve price on the headwear of just under half-a-million pounds. Jean-Pierre Osenet, president of the house, said: 'Napoleon wore his bicorne hats in a different way to everybody else and that was sideways. He did this to make himself stand out and be easily identified. 'There are not that many historical people who can be identified by a single item. Churchill was famous for his cigars, and Napoleon was famous for his hats. Dictator: Napoleon, who was famed for wearing his bicornes sideways, owned around 120 hats during his reign from 1804 to 1815. The auctioned hat  was recovered by Napoleon's personal vet, Joseph Giraud . Battle: Napoleon was defeated by the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo (depicted above) in 1815 . 'It is said that there are about 20 of his original hats in the world today and most of them are in museums and can't be sold. Maybe there are just two or three in private hands. 'The last one that sold at public auction was in 1968 and it was bought by the Champagne company Chandon.' Napoloen changed his hat at least three times a year, and this one was recovered by Joseph Giraud, Napoleon's personal vet, after he had finished with it. The 19in-long headpiece has a grey-green quilted silk interior and shows signs of wear. It remained in Mr Giraud's family until 1926 when it was sold to Prince Louis II of Monaco, who was related to Napoleon. Rare: The last time one of the hats came up for sale in France was in 1968, meaning there was huge interest today. Napoloen changed his hat at least three times a year, and this one was recovered by Joseph Giraud . Vintage: The hat remained in Mr Giraud's family until 1926 when it was sold to Prince Louis II of Monaco . Worn: The 19in-long headpiece has a grey-green quilted silk interior and shows signs of wear and tear . The prince collected all sorts of memorabilia relating to the French emperor which are displayed at the Napoleon Museum of Monaco. But the Grimaldi family is now selling some of Prince Louis's collection at auction after deciding to pursue new museum projects and refurbish of their palace in Monaco. Also sold were a pair of Napoleon's stockings, gloves, a shirt and silver drinking cups. Napoleon named his most famous horse Marengo after the battle, and the pair also fought together at Waterloo before Marengo was captured and ended his life in Britain. Before the bicorne, there was the tricorne - a three-cornered hat which became popular in the 18th Century. The tricorne evolved from the broad-rimmed round hats worn by Spanish soldiers by pinning up three sections to form a triangle. For this reason, they were also known as 'cocked hats'. The modification allowed gentry, in particular, to show off their expensive wigs, but their smaller size also made them much more practical to carry. By the end of the 18th Century, however, the tricorne had fallen out of fashion in favour of the bicorne. However, tricornes can still be seen today as part of the uniform of the Chelsea Pensioners (top right). The bicorne was generally worn with the points at the front and back. But Napoleon chose to wear them sideways 'to make himself noticed', according to auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat.","Hat worn by Napoleon Bonaparte during Battle of Marengo sold at auction .

"A bikie who opened fire in a  shopping centre and injured an innocent bystander has been sentenced to 12 years and three months in jail. Mongols member Mark James Graham, 28, was sentenced on Monday for the attempted murder of rival Bandidos member Jacques Teamo at the Robina Town Centre on the Gold Coast on April 28, 2012. Graham was also sentenced for unlawfully wounding bystander Kathy Devitt, who was hit in the buttock by one of two bullets. Scroll down for video . Mark James Graham (left) shot at Jacques Teamo (right) on April 28, 2012 . Mark James Graham (in black top) strolls around Robina Town Centre . On the day in question, an innocent passerby picked up a $10 note that a fellow shopper had dropped and handed it back to the owner. The Good Samaritan was oblivious that the person was Graham - who had just pulled out a gun from his bum bag, The Courier Mail reported. Graham, whose cleanly-shaven head showed his tattoos on his skull, was somewhat expressionless during the sentencing at the Supreme Court in Brisbane. In sentencing, Supreme Court Justice Alan Wilson said it was inconceivable that any prior conflict or vendetta between Graham and Teamo could justify Graham's 'brazen contempt' for public safety. 'What you did there with that weapon shattered the peace of a place in which citizens generally feel safe as they go about their leisurely business,' Justice Wilson told the heavily-tattooed bikie in the dock. 'Your conduct exposed a large number of people to a real and present - and also alien and entirely unexpected - danger.' Justice Wilson said it 'remained a mystery' that Mr Teamo was armed with a knife, and Graham with a handgun, to both go on a shopping trip with their families. 'When you saw each other, neither the presence of family nor of large numbers of innocent bystanders, discouraged you from a confrontation which resulted in Teamo and Ms Kathy Devitt, a person unknown to you, being shot,' he said The Courier Mail reported. Graham confronts Jacques Teamo (pictured wearing a white top and wearing a cap) It will be almost 10 years before Graham is eligible for parole after he was declared a serious violent offender, which means he must serve at least 80 per cent of his sentence behind bars. His defence barrister Anthony Kimmins told the sentencing hearing his client wrote a letter to Ms Devitt and arranged to pay her $10,000 compensation, actions that showed 'genuine remorse'. Justice Wilson shaved 21 months off the 14-year sentence he originally intended to give Graham, but said that was due to the amount of time the father of one spent in jail awaiting sentence. The court heard Ms Devitt was still psychologically affected by the incident and that some bullet residue remained in her wound. Teamo, who had brandished a knife during the confrontation, walked away with only minor injuries to his shoulder. Justice Wilson said it was only down to good luck that other bystanders weren't wounded. Graham's lawyer had argued at an earlier sentencing hearing that his client had acted in self-defence. However, Justice Wilson said even if that was true, the jury in Graham's trial had been entitled to find the tattooist's reaction was 'grossly disproportionate' and 'abhorrent'. The men, surrounded by shoppers unaware of the drama about to unfold, exchange words .

"Her story is as remarkable as it is revolutionary. And it's ironic to think that, in a low-income housing block in Harlem - an area of New York hardly known for its safety - the most dangerous person inside is arguably an 85-year-old Chinese grandmother. Dr Gao Yaojie - a gynecologist, author and affirmed human rights warrior - has been living in exile in Manhattan since 2009 for her tireless commitment to a crisis in China that has seen her almost universally renowned as 'the AIDS granny'. Dr Yaojie, who cannot return to her country out of fear of being jailed for 'inciting subversion', has spent close to 20 years attempting to expose an AIDS epidemic borne out of a corrupt blood-selling scandal. The indefatigable octogenarian went against the Chinese government to challenge official figures about the extent at which AIDS was decimating whole towns and and how it came to be the country's leading cause of death among infectious diseases. China's first AIDS activist: Dr Gao Yaojie, who is living in exile in NewYork out of fear being imprisoned in China, has not stopped her campaign against a blood-selling scandal in her country for almost 20 years. She maintains that most of the people suffering from AIDS in China contracted it through donating blood . Dr Gao Yaojie, an 85-year-old gynecologist, works away in her tiny one-bedroom apartment in Harlem, writing towards her 27th book exposing China's AIDS plague . Dr Gao Yaojie helps treat an unnamed AIDS victim in China . While officials continued to preach that HIV was contracted through sexual transmission and drug use, Dr Yaojie garnered a cache of evidence to show the infections actually came through blood donations, according to Buzzfeed. She claims up to 10 million people, mostly in rural areas, could have been contaminated by either donating or receiving blood via transfusion as part of a ruthless money-making machine known as the 'plasma economy'. Because of China's susceptibility to natural disaster and disease, the need for blood is paramount and extremely profitable. Fearing the AIDS crisis in 1985, just as doctors of the world began to understand HIV was transferred via blood, China banned imports of foreign blood products under the misguided belief all their citizens were disease-free. In 1991, the government-backed a campaign as part of this 'plasma economy', encouraging farmers to sell their blood, marketing it as both an 'honor' to the people and an easy way to make money. The poorest of people especially jumped aboard, with hundreds of licensed blood and plasma banks popping up in provinces and thousands more illegal ones. The process was sped up by reusing needles and pooling the blood together, meaning the stations were unknowingly transferring HIV-tainted cells to people both when taking blood from donors and when transfusing it to those in need. It's the information of this scandal and her role in making it public that caused Dr Yaojie to feel endangered and flee China four years ago. She says she left with nothing but blood-pressure medication in one hand and a USB stick filled with her findings in the other. 'I am in my eighties,' she told The Pulse. 'I don't care about my life. 'But I do do care about the evidence concerning the AIDS plague in China. 'My priority now is not to go back to China. 'The most important thing is to leave the evidence, the material, for posterity. 'Otherwise no one will know the truth.' She is almost 86, but Dr Gao Yaojie is about to publish her 27th book on the cause of China's long-denied AIDS plague . Dr Yaojie's AIDS crusade began in 1996. She was retired at the time after already living through a lifetime of turmoil during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. A married mother-of-three, she was taken as a political prisoner for being an educated woman and spent over a year in a labor camp. Once being reunited with her family, she was working as a doctor during the shocking one-child policy, at which point no living babies were allowed to leave hospital. Her job was mostly centered around late-term abortions, some at full-term, before she stopping working. But Dr Yaojie was brought out of retirement to consult on a strange case - a 42-year-old woman, Ms Ba, had undergone ovarian surgery but had not recovered after the operation. Instead she had become more ill, with fevers, a bloated stomach and lesions. When an AIDS test she ordered came back positive, Dr Yaojie was perplexed. How could a simple farmer - whose husband and child had clean blood, and who was not a drug user or prostitute - have AIDS? Dr Gao Yaojie's quest to help the people of China who had contracted AIDS started in 1996 with just one patient, Ms. Ba, whose file seemed to be the complete opposite of what the government defined as a typical AIDS sufferer . There were only a few confirmed AIDS cases in China at the time. Dr Yaojie determined the source was a government blood bank — Ms. Ba’s post-surgical blood transfusion had infected her with HIV. Ms. Ba died within two weeks. 'I realized the seriousness of the problem,' Dr Yaojie later wrote. 'If the blood in the blood bank carried the AIDS virus, then these victims would not be a small number.' Over months and years, Dr Yaojie's research into the epidemic took her across much of rural China, where she discovered villages with infection rates of 20, 30, 40% or more, as well as whole communities of AIDS orphans. There no treatment options and no education about the sickness that was killing off generations of people. So Dr Yaojie began making public lectures and circulating pamphlets she'd had printed to increase AIDS awareness. She was also giving out her own money to AIDS victims, hence the nickname 'the AIDS granny'. For years Dr Gao Yaojie moved around rural China, applying medicine to people who suffered from AIDS and gathering information on what had caused such a widespread outbreak. She would even hand out her own money . Her charity exposed the local governments who weren't doing their jobs properly, as well as a government that were covering up the truth of what was happening to their people. She began being followed and maintains that her phone was tapped for years. In one particular AIDS village, Dr Yaojie learned the mayor had put a 500 yuan ($82) bounty on her head, with any villager who caught her entitled to the money. But she was their savior. 'They didn’t even try to catch me - they didn’t want to turn me in,' Dr Yaojie said. Dr Yaojie recalls one story about two boys who were best friends, one with HIV and the other healthy. One day they were fighting, causing both to start bleeding and their blood to mix. 'They both died of AIDS,' she said, fighting back tears. Only in 2008 did China acknowledge that AIDS is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases. In 2011, a joint U.N.–Chinese government report estimated 780,000 people in China are living with HIV. The report said just 6.6% of them were infected through the plasma trade. The real numbers are subject to debate and almost certainly higher, say global health experts. As Dr Gao Yaojie's profile increased, further incensing government officials, and following the arrests of other humanitarians doing similar work, she realized she would have to leave China . It was in 2007 that Dr Yaojie realized she had to leave China, especially after the arrests of other humanitarians doing similar work, one of which had been jailed for 11 years. 'I needed to leave to protect my children and my family,' she said. She had been invited to America to receive an award from the Vital Voices Global Partnership, a group co-chaired by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton. But local officials put her under house arrest to stop Dr Yaojie from going. According to cables released by WikiLeaks from the then-U.S. ambassador to China, Vice Premier Wu Yi — the highest-ranking woman to ever serve in China’s communist party government — intervened personally to force officials to allow Dr Yaojie to travel to the U.S. to accept the award. She returned afterwards, but fled permanently in 2009. Dr Yaojie has refused to discuss exactly how she managed to get out of the country, so as to protect the people who helped her. However she managed to fly to New York from the southern city of Guangzhou shortly after the death of her husband. Dr Yaojie spends her days writing and is about to publish her 27th book. She says the government continues to deny the AIDS epidemic. In May 2012, the government ordered families to demolish and clear millions of tombs set across four counties that had been used to bury the dead, in an obvious attempt to hide evidence. A farmer walks though a Chinese town that came to be known as an 'AIDS village', with mass graves seen in the background . 'I want to stop, but I cannot,' she said. 'I am too old. 'I feel powerless to all things. 'The purpose of writing these books is to ask for justice for the victims and leave it for the later generations to judge. 'It is also a mental comfort for me.'","Dr Gao Yaojie, a gynecologist in China, was brought out of retirement in 1996 to treat a young mother who had undergone ovarian surgery but become more ill after the operation .

"The American naturalist who filmed himself getting eaten by an anaconda for a highly-anticipated television event has spoken out about what inspired him to take part in the risky stunt. This past summer, Rosolie donned a special suit to let a 25-foot 400-pound snake eat him in a dangerous performance set to air on Discovery Channel this Sunday. Overall, Rosolie was so confident in the suit's design that he was more worried about the snake's safety than his own. 'I didn’t want to stress [the snake] out too much. I wanted to make sure that the suit was smooth and wasn’t going to hurt the snake,' Rosolie said. ' I really wasn’t scared. We tested this suit and worked on this with experts so we knew I was going to be safe.' Amid a backlash from animal rights activists who believe the anaconda was tortured by being forced to eat Rosolie, a man much bigger than its usual prey, Rosolie has responded to say the snake was unharmed and that the experiment was designed to raise money to save the animal's habitat. Scroll down for video . Eaten alive: Paul Rosolie filmed himself getting eaten by an anaconda last summer, and the stunt will air this Sunday on Discovery Channel. Rosolie pictured above with an anaconda in promotional pictures for the event. None of the following pictures show the anaconda used in the stunt . Good cause: Rosolie says he participated in the risky act in order to raise awareness of the anaconda's habitat, which is being encroached on by gold mining . 'I wanted to do something that would absolutely shock people,' Rosolie told the New York Post. 'Environmentalists, we love to preach to the choir. What I’m trying to do with this is bring in a bunch of people that wouldn’t necessarily know what’s going on in the Amazon.' Fundrasier: The special to air Sunday will reportedly advertise a fundraiser to save the snake's habitat . 'For the type of attention that this is getting and for the type of emergency that’s going on down there — desperate times, desperate measures.' 'Once they see the show, these are people who are going to be supporters' he said. 'It’s a cool little dissonance there — they’re all coming out against me, but I’m the guy that’s been down there in the jungle trying to protect these things.' Rosolie, a New Jersey native who first visited the Amazon at age 18, spent 60 days hiking through the rain forest in Peru with a team of about a dozen people searching for the right anaconda to take part in the stunt. In the process, the team also started the first scientific study of anacondas in the wild, taking down the weight, length and sex of each snake they came across. They also took samples of their skin to test for mercury, a by-product of the gold-mining industry which is encroaching on the creature's habitat. The special on Sunday will be promoting a fundraiser to raise money to save the snake's habitat. The naturalist and his crew had nearly run out of the time allotted by the Discovery Channel when they finally tracked down a female green anaconda that Rosolie first spotted in 2008. He says it took 12 people fighting in water above their heads to catch the 25-foot 400-500 pound anaconda, adding that herpetologists were on site to make sure the snake was in good health throughout its short captivity. Armor: In order to survive being eaten by the snake, Rosolie wore a custom-designed suit that protected him from the snake's strong grasp and digestive acids. It also packed cameras, communication devices and enough air to last him three hours . Not an easy job: It took a team of 12 to capture the snake used in the stunt. Above, Rosolie pictured on the hunt in the Amazon . From there, Rosolie put on a special suit made of carbon fiber designed to protect against both the snake's deadly grip and digestive acids. The suit also packed a three-hour supply of oxygen, communication devices and several cameras. Before going through with the effort, Rosolie also swallowed a pill that transmitted his vitals to his team. In order to attract the snakes's attention, Rosolie doused himself in pigs blood and imitated movements of the anaconda's typical prey. The snakes usually hunt wild pigs, deer, capybaras and caiman. Rosolie says 'it didn't take long' for the anaconda to fall for the maneuver, but wouldn't elaborate on what actually happened once the snake tried to swallow him whole. 'Experiencing that kind of power was worth everything, because it was just amazing,' he said. 'Eaten Alive' airs Sunday on Discovery Channel at 9pm ET.","Naturalist Paul Rosolie donned a special suit to experience being eaten by an anaconda in the Amazon this past summer .

"Amid a slow-growth recession rebound and mounting unemployment concerns, President Obama and his family are tightening their belts, just like the rest of America. With their usual $21 million vacation home on Martha's VIneyard unavailable for the first family's August 10-18 holiday, they have rented a nearby $7.6 million palace instead. And a nearby hotel, with rooms ranging in price from $225 to $345 per night, has rented more than 75 rooms for Secret Service agents, Transportation Security Agency officers and members of the presidential entourage. The hotel rooms alone will cost between $135,000 and $207,000. It's unknown how much the home rental for the president's family and their closest friends will set the Obamas back. The WHite House has said in the past that the president and Mrs. Obama pay for their own food and lodging during vacations, as has been the practice in previous administrations. The Chilmark House, a $7.6 million palace owned by financier Rick Schulte, will host the Obamas duing their August vacation on Martha's Vineyard . Roughing it: The White House chef will have his hands full with this state-of-the-art kitchen. The Obamas will pay for the food, but not for the wages of the cooking and serving staff . Sundberg Kennedy Ly-Au Young Architects built the home in 2006. First class all the way, but it's a step down from the $21 million home the Obama's are accustomed to renting for their New England vacations . The most expensive published rental rates on the island run between $30,000 and $35,000 per week. A property expert in the town of Vineyard Haven told MailOnline that the Obamas' chosen property, owned by financier David Schulte, would 'likely run in the $40,000 to $60,000 range for the eight-day stay.' 'I wish I had the commission on that,' said the rental agent, who asked not to be identified. The $21 million home the Obamas rented for their 2011 vacation on Martha's Vineyard cost an estimated $50,000 per week. Their personal costs, though, will pale in comparison to the taxpayers' portion of the expenses. Secret Service protection, location pre-screening, White House staff pay, operation of Air Force One, the hotel accommodations for government employees and many other budget items will likely top $2 million. Sunscreen? Check. Beach umbrella? Check. Entourage and Secret Service protection? If this 2009 trip to 'The Vineyard' is any indication, the trip will cost $2 million or more . The home 'sits on nine and a half acres' and includes 'a low group of buildings connected by porches, terraces, and patios,' according to the architects . Huge complex: This aerial shot shows the Martha's Vineyard mansion owned by financier David Schulte that the Obamas will rent . If past vacations are any guide, those expenditures will also include Coast Guard ships off the Massachusetts coast, a motorcade of more than 20 cars, specialized 'war wagon' SUVs flown on military aircraft for the Obamas' use, . Air Force One alone costs the government $180,000 per hour to operate and staff. The Obamas are only required to reimburse the Treasury for the cost of a comparable commercial fare. News organizations follow the same guidelines when sending reporters on the specially outfitted aircraft. In a 2011 interview with US News & World Report, former White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry defended the costs related to a massive presidential vacation delegation. 'Remember [President] Clinton's trip to Martha's Vineyard in August 1998 when we ended up trying to decapitate bin Laden with a cruise missile strike?' McCurry recalled. 'That's why the ""entourage"" has to accommodate all aspects of the presidency, even on vacation. You never know what might happen. August always produces the unexpected.' White House Dossier, written by former White House correspondent Keith Koffler, estimated in January that the Obamas' vacations in Hawaii since 2009 have cost a collective $20 million. Fore! President Obama will likely take some time to brush up on his golf game, as he did during his family's 2010 Martha's Vineyard vacation. Greens fees are Obama's responsibility, but taxpayers will cover the Secret Service protection . The Vineyard Times, a newspaper on Martha's Vineyard, first reported on July 17 that the Obamas had settled on Schulte's property for their holiday. Sundberg Kennedy Ly-Au Architects, which designed the home in 2006, writes that it 'sits on nine and a half acres' and includes 'a low group of buildings connected by porches, terraces, and patios.' 'The choice of materials reflect both a modern sensibility and the architectural traditions of the Northeast in general and the island in particular, with gray-toned wood shingles, metal, stone, and concrete in evidence. 'A huge glacial erratic, or boulder dropped by an ancient retreating glacier, was left in place,' the architects write, 'and now rests near the front entrance—a marker to guide visitors into the welcoming compound and further ground the home in its natural surroundings.'","Staff staying at hotels with rooms ranging in price from $225 to $345 per night .

"A beautifully restored boat serving Michelin-starred food. Divers on hand to catch any fish on the menu. Countless reviews describing the cooking as ‘simply divine’. This restaurant almost sounds too good to be true. Trouble is, it was. Because when dozens of foodies headed down to sample the ‘mind-blowing’ food at Oscar’s after reading its glowing reviews on TripAdvisor, all they found was an alleyway full of bins. The restaurant had never existed. Instead, the would-be diners had fallen victim to an online prank designed to expose the failings of the review website. Rubbish: Diners who visited the address were baffled when they arrived at an alleyway full of bins . A disgruntled businessman said he carried out the stunt because he was fed up with TripAdvisor not being policed, allowing people to write malicious reviews. The man, who will not reveal his identity, has admitted he posted all the reviews, and even provided an email address for bookings. The site, which allows people to review restaurants, hotels and pubs, has become a major influence on the UK’s tourism industry. But some business owners have complained of being targeted by rivals, who post fake reviews to deter their customers. The prankster set up a profile for Oscar’s in May, using the name Oscar Parrot. He described it as one of the best . places to eat in Britain, a floating restaurant built in the hull of an . old fishing boat amid reefs and shipwrecks in Brixham, Devon. The profile boasted that staff in diving gear would swim down to catch whichever kind of fish customers wanted. The perfect day: Rave reviews were posted on TripAdvisor for the fictional restaurant Oscar's in Devon . It was apparently run by a couple called Colette and Alfredo, with food and decor based on el Bulli – the Spanish restaurant often named as the best in the world. In a series of reviews, customers raved about its cooking, which ‘bordered on sorcery’, and described it as a ‘simply divine’ experience. Eventually, however, the entire profile was taken down after several diners warned it was a hoax. Its creator says he set up the bogus listing after a friend’s hotel received a barrage of criticism he suspected was from a rival. He said: ‘There are many businesses that have had grudge reviews listed on TripAdvisor, mostly from a rival. The restaurant was supposed to have opened up in New Quay Lane, Brixham . Imaginary: Oscar's was apparently run by a couple called Colette and Alfredo but in fact it never existed . Baffled: Excited tourists flocked to the highly-rated but fictional Oscar's but were left scratching their heads after finding themselves down this alleyway . ‘Many of these are so blatant, any person doing a short check would see the obvious. ‘The chances were better then average that Oscar’s could have sailed on for months.’ The fictional venue was listed as New Quay Lane, Brixham, and the page said it moved location dependent on tide and season, making it even harder to find. A series of reviews lavished praise on its food and decor, describing it as ‘perfect’, ‘unexpected’ and ‘a beautiful restaurant, tastefully fitted out, amazing food and wine’. Bookings began to flood in to the email address supplied by the prankster,  who always replied saying the restaurant was booked out for months. But that didn’t stop would-be customers arriving in taxis looking for it. Those disgruntled diners quickly began posting warnings to other visitors, telling them not to be fooled by Oscar’s. One wrote: ‘The restaurant does not exist. It is a spoof, as are the reviews.’ Despite that, its page went undetected for weeks. It was finally removed a few days ago. Oscar's was listed as a floating restaurant built in the hull of an old fishing boat in Brixham, Devon (pictured) Simply divine: The restaurant was billed as being Michelin-star quality . Is this it? New Quay Lane in Brixham which was meant to be home to world class restaurant Oscar's . In the three months that it was supposedly open, Oscar’s managed to climb to 29th place in a ratings list of 64 restaurants in Brixham. TripAdvisor recently vowed to get rid of fake or defamatory postings after hoteliers and restaurateurs claimed bogus reviews were harming their trade.

"Unpopular: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said many wind farms were causing huge unhappiness across the country . Wind farms have been branded a ‘complete scam’ by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, reigniting coalition battle over green power. As the government unveiled new powers for local residents to block turbines blighting their villages, Mr Paterson condemned many planned schemes as ‘deeply unpopular’ and causing ‘huge unhappiness’ across the country. The outspoken remarks from a senior Tory minister in charge of environmental policy risks a furious reaction from Liberal Democrats pushing for more renewable power projects. The Conservatives have taken a tougher line on wind farms in recent months, and this week unveiled plans to give communities a powerful ‘veto’ over controversial new onshore developments. Schemes will have to gain local residents’ consent before a planning application can even be made, effectively handing them the power to prevent turbines being erected. Planning rules are also to be changed so that the drive for renewable energy can no longer be used as a reason for overriding environmental and other concerns. Mr Paterson signalled that plans for wind farms will have to take into account the impact on the countryside and views as well as the desire to save the planet. In an extraordinary intervention at the Royal Cornwall Show yesterday, the Tory Cabinet minister said: ‘Turbines are regarded as a complete scam, but as of today we have given power to local communities to decide. ‘The criteria is now that environment and landscape will have to be taken into consideration as well as the national energy requirement.’ Bribes: Communities are to be offered up to 20 per cent off their bills if they allow a wind farm near their homes, but they will also have power to block new developments . Under the new rules councils must look at the cumulative impact of wind turbines and reflect the effect on landscape and local facilities. There is also a major increase promised in the amount developers pay local communities to win them over,  including long-term electricity bill discounts of up to 20 per cent. However, Mr Paterson suggested anger with many schemes would not be overcome by additional bribes. He added: ‘I know there is huge unhappiness with some of these projects, both from what I hear nationally and from my own constituency in Shropshire. ‘There are places where these projects are well prepared, the community wants it and it will be worthwhile. But in inland areas they are very often deeply unpopular,’ the Western Morning News reported. Leila Deen, Greenpeace energy campaigner, said: 'Wind farms may seem like a scam to a Government minister who questions the science of climate change and who’s pushing for his Shropshire constituency to be fracked for shale gas. 'The public disagrees - two thirds of people would rather have a wind turbine near their home than a fracking site. 'Onshore wind powered almost 2.5 million homes in 2011, is falling in cost and will play a key role in our future energy mix.' Mr Paterson’s appointment to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last September was controversial, with allies forced to deny he was a climate change denier. In 2007, he  described wind farms as ridiculous, claiming they ‘demand vast amounts of public subsidy and do not work’.","Owen Paterson says communities will get new powers to block turbines which are 'regarded as a complete scam'

"The number of children taken into care has hit a record 10,000 in one year. Since the 2007 killing of Baby P, there has been a huge surge in the number of youngsters being removed from their families by social workers. The children’s court advisory service dealt with 10,199 cases between April 2011 and March 2012 – a near-doubling of the numbers in just four years. Tragic case: Since the 2007 killing of Baby P, . the number of  youngsters being removed from their families by social . workers has surged to record-breaking levels - reaching 10,199 in the past year alone . It is the first time the body has received more than 10,000 referrals in a single year. The trend has raised fears that rising numbers of vulnerable children are being taken away from their families unnecessarily and  consigned to languish in a care system that too often fails them. Government statistics have shown children who spend years in care are more likely to leave school with barely any qualifications and fall into crime, drug abuse and prostitution. Family Rights Group, a charity which offers advice about social services, warned the care system was ‘struggling to cope’ with the rising numbers. Chief executive Cathy Ashley said: ‘There are court delays, children being put in temporary placements or moved around with little notice, siblings are being split up and there is a significant shortage of foster carers. ‘Family Rights Group knows from the rising calls to its advice service and recent research that in some of these cases more could and should be done to have kept children safely with their family.’ The upturn in care referrals coincides with a decline in the number of adoptions, and charities said more needed to be done to speed up the adoption process. Jailed: Baby P was just 17 months old when he died at the hands of his mother, Tracy Connelly, left, her violent partner Steven Barker, centre, and his brother Jason Owen, right, on August 3, 2007 . House of horror: The house in Penshurst Road, Tottenham, where Baby P lived . Baby P, later named as Peter Connelly, . was just 17 months old when he died in Tottenham, North London, at the . hands of his mother Tracey, her violent partner Steven Barker and his . brother Jason Owen on August 3, 2007. He . suffered more than 50 injuries despite being on the at-risk register . and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health . professionals over an eight-month period. The . number of children taken into care rose dramatically in the wake of the . jailing of Peter’s mother, Barker and Owen over his killing in November . 2008. 'More children are being protected': But Anthony Douglas, chief executive of Cafcass, admitted social workers had 'panicked' after the Baby P case . There was a further . spike after a major review of the case was published in May the . following year. But levels of referrals stayed high, and over the past . year have shot up even faster. Cafcass, . the agency which looks after children’s interests in the family courts, . said the number of care applications was 6,698 in 2002/03 – the first . full year figures were collated. In . 2007/08, before full details of the Baby P case had been made public, . the figure stood at just 6,241. But by 2011/12, it had soared to 10,199. Local . authorities in England made 886 care applications last month, just ten . short of the highest figure ever recorded for March. January 2012 saw . the highest ever number for a single month, with 912 referrals made. Almost all applications result in the child being taken into care. The . true figure for the number of children placed in care could be even . higher, since each application can involve more than one child. Anthony Douglas, chief executive of Cafcass, has previously suggested some of the surge in referrals has been unnecessary. Speaking in late 2009, he highlighted concerns over ‘some agencies referring lower level concerns in case they make a mistake by under-reacting’. ‘Agencies must regain confidence in their own professional judgments and assessments. The UK child protection system remains one of the safest in the world therefore that confidence is justified,’ he said. Yesterday he admitted social workers had ‘panicked’ but added: ‘We do not believe the rise in care applications has been due to too much risk aversion on the part of practitioners. ‘Just after the Baby P serious case review was published [in May 2009], there was a lot of panic and a big spike in applications as a result of that panic. That atmosphere, however, is gone. ‘What has remained is the high level of intolerance of children living in these desperate situations and we have evidence that children are not being dragged into the system needlessly – more of them are being protected.’ The total being looked after by the state is more than 65,000. But social workers have been criticised for allowing youngsters to languish in children’s homes or with rapidly-changing foster families. Studies have shown that youngsters in the care of the state are significantly more likely to be expelled from school, gain few qualifications, fail to find work and suffer from mental health problems. Ministers earlier this year unveiled a serious of measures aimed at breaking down barriers to adoptions, such as demands that adopters are of the same race, amid frustration at low levels of adoptions. According to social workers, child protection is now facing a ‘major crisis’. Sue Kent, of the British Association of Social Workers, said soaring referrals combined with Government cuts were preventing social workers doing their jobs properly. A study by the National Foundation for Educational Research found improvements in the detection of abuse and more consistent identification of dangers in the wake of the Baby P case. The case was felt to be ‘instrumental’ in this. But the research also suggested a decline in parenting over the same period was also to blame. There was also evidence of ‘defensive practice’ among social workers. Actress and director Samantha Morton, pictured, spent almost 18 years in care or living in foster homes. During her time in care she claimed she was physically abused, took class A drugs and almost ended up in jail after threatening to kill a girl who bullied her. She said she escaped a life addled by drugs and violence after being saved by television and drama at the age of 16. Miss Morton, now 34, was taken into care as a baby, began going to raves when she was 12 and dropped out of school at 13. In the past, the Minority Report star said: ‘I came horribly, dangerously, massively close to not surviving. 'My weakness – if you can call it that – was drugs. I took all sorts from a fairly young age, ecstasy and LSD among them.’ In 2009 Miss Morton directed a film, The Unloved, based on her experiences. The film tells the story of a young girl in a Nottinghamshire care home. In one scene, a 16-yearold girl is sexually abused by an adult care worker. Miss Morton said that the scene mirrored incidents in her own life. By numbers: The shocking statistics that show how the care system blights youngsters' lives . Tom Rahilly, the NSPCC’s head of strategy and development for looked-after children, added: ‘While the continued high level of care applications looks dramatic, we must remember that the majority of children come into care as a result of abuse or neglect. ‘Care provides a safe and supportive environment for these children. This continued rise could simply indicate people are being more alert to situations where children are at risk, which can only be a positive development.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘These decisions are never taken lightly – but the bottom line is that children’s welfare must be paramount and they must be protected as early as possible from risk and abuse. ‘There is absolutely no evidence that children are being taken into care unnecessarily. We’re investing £4billion nationally over two years in children services. We’ve given local authorities complete freedom over their budgets so they can target children most at risk and protect them from harm. ‘It is a false economy for councils not to make this a priority – because society will pay much more further down the line if children don’t  get the support they need as early as possible.’","Cafcass dealt with 10,199 cases between April 2011 and March 2012 .

"Revolutionary: The jab, which shaved two inches of waistlines of women during experiments, also helped control blood sugar levels and cut the risk of Alzheimer's . A dieting jab that can help women drop two dress sizes could be available within a year. Those taking the drug liraglutide before breakfast each day lost an average of 19lb over 12 months. And a third of women shed 23lb – more than a stone and a half. Such levels of weight loss can cut the risk of heart disease and other illnesses, as well as improve sleep and quality of life. The once-a-day jab, which tricks the brain into feeling full, also lowers blood pressure, raises ‘good cholesterol’ and staves off diabetes. And if that wasn’t enough, there are also tantalising hints that the drug slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. With just one diet drug already approved for use and Britons among the fattest people in Europe, experts say that diet and exercise alone won’t solve the obesity crisis. However, the new jab will have to be proved to be extremely safe before it is cleared for use. Price will also be a crucial factor if it is to be prescribed on the NHS. The impressive potential benefits of liraglutide were unveiled at the European Congress on Obesity in Sofia, as concern mounts that Britain is losing the fight against flab. Around two-thirds of women are overweight or obese and, shockingly, a study this week showed British girls are the fattest in Europe. Being obese can knock up to nine years off a person’s life and raise the risk of a host of health problems including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and some cancers. The treatment of obesity-related illnesses costs the NHS more than £5billion a year, with millions more lost to the economy in sick leave. Researchers in 27 countries, including the UK, tested liraglutide on almost 4,000 overweight and obese men and women. Necessary: Experts warn the obesity epidemic cannot be beaten with diets and exercise alone . They injected themselves once a day for a . year – with some subjects taking a placebo – and all those taking part . watched what they ate and exercised. Some two-thirds of those taking . liraglutide lost at least 5 per cent of their weight, while a third shed . at least 10 per cent. For a 14st woman, this would equate to around a stone and a half – or two dress sizes. Waists shrank by an average of two inches, levels of harmful blood fats also fell and the body found it easier to process sugar. There was also a drop in blood pressure, while some of the patients on the cusp of diabetes will be tracked for three years to see if the medicine cuts their odds of developing the full-blown disease. Liraglutide’s maker, Danish firm Novo Nordisk, already sells the drug to treat diabetes and is wasting no time in trying to get it approved as a weight-loss medicine. It works by acting like an appetite hormone, known as GLP1, which is made by the gut and tells the brain when we have eaten enough. However, whereas GLP1 is broken down within minutes of being produced, liraglutide stays in the body for hours, tricking the brain into thinking a person is fuller for longer. Orlistat, the only other diet drug prescribed in Britain, works by stopping the body from absorbing some of the fat in food. Novo Nordisk has applied to the EU regulator and, if liraglutide is declared safe and effective, it could be prescribed within a year. Like all drugs, it is not without side-effects, with nausea being the most common. Professor John Wilding, a Liverpool University expert who led the latest trial, said drugs can help when diet and exercise fail. ‘One of the problems when people diet is that they become more hungry and their body is always trying to take them back to their previous weight,’ he said. ‘Drugs help people lose a greater amount of weight in the short-term and help them maintain that weight loss long-term.’","Doctors warn diet and exercise alone will not solve UK's obesity crisis .

"A new vaccine against meningitis B gives full protection to teenagers, according to the first large-scale trial and could be available this Spring. There is currently no vaccine to protect against Meningococcal B in this country. It is the most common form of bacterial meningitis and the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target. Breakthrough: New meningitis B jab - effective against 80 per cent of strains found in Europe - could be approved for use by the spring (pictured posed by model) It is one of the diseases most feared by parents because it is hard to diagnose and swift to kill. Latest research findings on the 4CMenB vaccine show two doses produces an immune response in almost 100 per cent of adolescents. Previous data found similar levels of protection in infants, suggesting the vaccine could guard against about 80 per cent of 1,000 meningitis B strains found in Europe. Manufacturers Novartis applied to the European regulatory authorities for a licence a year ago, and it could be approved as early as this Spring. Jab: New injection could stop dozens of infants being killed by meningitis each year . The vaccine could dramatically cut the toll of infants and children dying from the disease or struggling with lifelong disabilities. In a new study, conducted in Chile, different doses of 4CMenB were given to 1,631 teenagers, says a report in The Lancet medical journal. The results show two to three doses generated an immune response, indicating protection, in almost 100 per cent of those getting the active vaccine rather an inactive placebo. Researchers from the University of Chile said the ‘pivotal study’ showed two doses of vaccine given even six months apart produced a protective response. Previous trials on the vaccine found similar levels of response from the vaccine in adults and children. Meningococcal B is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in the UK and the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target. Although vaccination programmes have been successfully introduced to combat pneumococcal meningitis and the strains C and Hib, no B vaccine currently exists in this country. The new vaccine was developed using so-called ‘reverse vaccinology’, decoding the genome sequence of meningitis B and selecting proteins most likely to be broadly-effective vaccine candidates. It could be given to babies from the age of two months in three doses, with a booster at one year. There are more than 1,200 cases of meningitis B in the UK each year, resulting in some 120 deaths - half of which occur in the under fives. Around 250 children are left with serious life-long complications such as limb amputations, blindness, deafness and brain damage. Although meningitis B vaccines have been developed against single strains, for example in Cuba and New Zealand, Britain needs a multistrain jab. After licensing the Government’s independent advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, will decide whether to recommend routine use of the new vaccine for infants and children on the NHS. They will look at its efficacy and safety, while the cost implications are considered by the Department of Health. When meningitis C vaccine was added to the childhood programme it was accompanied by a catch-up plan for teenagers and young adults in a bid to increase immunity within the population most at risk. This in turn reduces transmission of the meningitis bugs in the community, reducing the risk to all ages. Dr Myron Christodoulides, chair of Meningitis UK’s Scientific Medical Panel and expert in microbiology and infection at the University of Southampton, said ‘Previous studies have shown that 4CMenB has the potential to provide significant protection when administered to infants. This new study shows that the vaccine could also be highly protective in the adolescent age group. ‘However, there are still a number of important questions to be answered such as how many strains it will protect against, how long the protection will last and whether it will stop the bacteria from being passed on to others, providing indirect protection to those not vaccinated.’ Steve Dayman, founder of Meningitis UK who lost his own son Spencer to the disease in 1982, said ‘It is extremely encouraging that the vaccine could provide almost 100 per cent protection to adolescents. ‘Behind the under-fives, teenagers are the next most at-risk from this disease. Meningitis can kill in hours and we have seen first-hand the devastation this disease can cause people. If introduced, this vaccine will be the first of its kind and could save thousands of lives but it is vital that research continues to develop improved vaccine strategies.’ Pharmaceutical company, Pfizer is also in the process of developing a Meningitis B vaccine to protect teenagers.","Meningitis B causes 120 deaths in Britain each year .

"A hotel worker was today sentenced to death in Kenya after he was convicted of helping to kidnap British tourist Judith Tebbutt during an attack in which her husband was shot dead. Ali Babitu Kololo, 27, was found guilty of robbery with violence and kidnapping with intent to cause murder over the brutal raid by Somali pirates in September 2011. He was handed the death sentence but is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison after Kenya halted its programme of public executions. Sentenced to death: Ali Babitu Kololo (right) was convicted of robbery with violence and kidnapping with intent to cause murder at a court in Lamu, in Kenya . Culpable: Hotel worker Kololo denied any involvement but Mrs Tebbutt said she felt he was responsible for guiding the pirates to her and her husband . Kololo, a Muslim father-of-two, shook silently in the dock as magistrate Johnstone Munguti sentenced him during the two hour judgement hearing at a court in the coastal town of Lamu. Mr Munguti said: 'I must tell you that I am obliged by the laws of Kenya to sentence you to suffer death for the first count, that is for robbery with violence. 'For the second count I sentence you to seven years in prison.' Kololo was led from the court in handcuffs after becoming the first person to be convicted over the kidnapping of Mrs Tebbutt and the death of her husband. The couple, from Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, were enjoying a holiday when a gang of six men burst into their secluded beach cottage in the early hours of September 11 2011. Mrs Tebbutt, 58, a social worker, was dragged from their bed and bundled into a speedboat which took her to Somalia. She spent more than six months as a hostage in the war-torn country before being freed in March 2012. Her husband, publishing executive David, 58, died at the scene after he was shot in the chest as he tried to protect his wife during the raid at the remote Kiwayu Safari Village. Weak but alive: Judith Tebbutt is seen just after being freed from six months captivity as the hands of the Somali pirates . Kololo, who previously worked at the luxury resort, was arrested the day after the attack and remains the only person to be charged in connection with the tragedy. He admitted in court that he had helped lead the Tebbutts' attackers to their cottage but claimed he did so under duress after he was himself abducted by the gang. Today the court dismissed that claim and said it was clear he had been the sixth member of the group. Mr Munguti referred to evidence given to the trial by Mrs Tebbutt, who told how her captors had told her the sixth gang member had been arrested. The magistrate said: 'Mrs Tebbutt was unable to positively identify you, although she could not rule you out. 'However, one of her attackers said somebody was left behind and that the guy was in big trouble in Kenya. 'On the evidence, that person could only have been you, because no other person was arrested and charged.' Kololo, a devout Muslim, wore a pink T-shirt today as continued to deny his guilt. Addressing the court in his own mitigation, he said: 'I have left everything to God. I abide by your decision.' He added: 'I did not participate in the attack. The prosecution framed me.' Two Metropolitan Police detectives were in court today to witness proceedings. The pair were part of a team which flew out to help Kenyan police in the days after the attack. Local detectives have said they continue to investigate the abduction but have acknowledged it could be difficult to track suspects who are believed to remain in Somalia. Mrs Tebbutt this month published an account of her abduction and months as a hostage in a book about the tragedy. Hidden terror: The Kiwayu Safari Village Beach where Mr and Mrs Tebbutt were attacked. Mr Tebbutt died in the struggle . Isolated: The Tebbutts were the only guests at the luxury resort when the kidnappers struck . In it she described how she spent the first three weeks of her captivity believing she would one day be reunited with her husband. She eventually learned of his death after her kidnappers arranged a phone call with her grown-up son Oliver. Mrs Tebbutt was eventually released in March 2012 after her family raised a ransom. The widow has since spoken of her desire to see justice done. In her autobiography, A Long Walk Home, she wrote of her belief that Kololo was partly responsible for what happened to her. She wrote: 'Ali Babitu Kololo was not among the five men who took me off Kiwayu in a skiff. 'But if he is found guilty of the crime for which he stands accused then he is deeply complicit - things would not have happened as they did had the pirates not been guided around the island as they evidently were.' Britain's ambassador to Somalia, Neil Wigan, today welcomed Kololo's conviction. He wrote on Twitter: 'Welcome conviction in Lamu today of Kololo for his role in Tebbutt kidnap and murder.' The death penalty is a source of controversy in Kenya, where human rights campaigners have argued it should be abolished. The country has not carried out any executions since 1987 and is currently reviewing its sentencing. Officials today indicated it was highly unlikely Kololo would be executed. Instead, it is expected his sentenced could be formally commuted to life imprisonment at a later hearing.","Ali Babitu Kololo, 27, is first to be convicted of attack on Judith and David Tebbutt .

Some fans had queued up overnight but failed to see almost any tennis because of the wet weather. John . Simpson, 37, a company director, from West London, said: ‘I think it’s . terrible. 'The members’ seats are the best seats in the house but the . members cannot even be bothered to fill them up. ‘Meanwhile, you have thousands of people outside who would kill to watch a bit of tennis. 'We have been queuing since 6am but because of the rain we have seen only 30 minutes of play. 'I . think the members need to think about how lucky they are to have these . seats. Tennis should be for the fans and not just for the elite.’ Karen . Rispoli, 60, from Sydney, said she could see only one person sitting in . the Royal Box at the start of Sharapova’s match against Alison Riske . and many more empty seats in the stands. She . said: ‘It was a shame that they didn’t open them up to  people who were . out here. There was one person in the Royal Box at the start.’ Disappointing: Rows were left empty as tennis stars Rafael Nadal (left) and Maria Sharapova played . Ms . Rispoli has seen just 30 minutes of tennis before play was suspended on . the outside courts and covers pulled over to protect the grass. Joanne . Robson, 30, had travelled from Durham to watch the tennis but had to . content herself with watching the big matches on the screen. Roman . Zoltowski, 76, who has engraved the champions’ names on to the . silverware for 35 years, has owned up to a spelling error. In 2009 he . used a ‘v’ instead of the ‘w’ in the name of Croatian Kevin Krawietz, he . admitted. ‘I’m . a bit disappointed watching Centre Court because there’s lots of empty . seats and we’re all sitting here in rain,’ she said. ‘I find that really . annoying.’ A . receptionist at the Members’ Lobby confirmed the empty  seats behind . the Royal Box belonged to the All England Club Members, adding: ‘They . were probably having a break from watching the tennis.’ A spokesman for the All England Club did not comment. During the Nadal match, sportsmen and . women, who are traditionally invited there on Wimbledon’s middle . Saturday, were glued to the game. And David Beckham was . happy to oblige a hat-trick of ladies with their camera phones during a . break in play at Wimbledon yesterday. Selfie hat-trick: David Beckham poses for a photo with three adoring fans during a break at Wimbledon today . The old charmer – who brought mum Sandra to the Royal Box on Centre . Court – was at it again a little later as he and a female RAF officer . seemed to be enjoying a chat about the weather. Beckham and his mum sat just in front of another former Manchester United star, Sir Bobby Charlton, with his  wife Norma. Injured . British women’s number one Laura Robson may not be playing this year, . but away from the court she has been enjoying an online flirtation with a . young singer. The dalliance began when Jack Rosies, 21, wrote a song and posted it on YouTube asking Laura, 20, for a Valentine’s Day date. Then . earlier this month Laura agreed to attend one of Jack’s gigs – at the . famous London jazz bar, Ronnie Scott’s  – but had to pull out. Olympic cycling gold medallist Bradley Wiggins, whose famous sideburns have morphed into a full beard, sat alongside his wife Catherine. Fellow Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton was also there with husband and former Team GB trainer Scott Gardner. Others watching included: boxers David Haye and Nicola Adams; England Rugby captain Chris Robshaw; rower Sir Matthew Pinsent, former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, along with Stuart Broad and their partners; Winter Olympics gold medallists Lizzy Yarnold and Amy Williams; and retired Olympic swimmer Mark Foster. Meanwhile, prices for Centre Court tickets for tomorrow’s matches, likely to include Andy Murray’s last-16 match against Kevin Anderson, were already sky-high last night. On website Viagogo tickets were being offered at up to £1,900 for a pair. Pairs of tickets for the Men’s Singles Final on Sunday were going for up to £6,500, though prices are likely to soar further should Murray progress that far to defend his title. Golden boy: David Beckham charms one of Wimbledon's volunteer services personnel . Service . personnel who volunteer  as stewards at Wimbledon have been threatened . with the sack if they sit on unoccupied show court seats when they go . off duty. The . special force of 300 services personnel have also been banned by the . All England Club from taking courtside ‘selfies’ at the tournament. Last . night Armed Forces members and tennis celebrities called on the club to . reverse the decision. Retired colonel Richard Kemp said: ‘Our troops . give so much to defend our country, including the All England Club. In . return, they should have the decency to let them have these seats.’ Officially, . workers at the tournament are not allowed to fill unoccupied show court . seats but stewards used to turn a blind eye if members of the military . took them. This . year, however, Wimbledon’s team of civilian honorary stewards have been . ordered to eject anyone from the Armed Forces they catch sitting in the . stands. One . serviceman told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They have been telling us to . leave. It’s particularly upsetting because we were told it was because . it looked like we were skiving. ‘Eventually our officers told us it was causing too much hassle and if we watched the games we would be sacked.’ Another added: ‘It’s a shame because we’ve given up two weeks of our leave to come here and volunteer.’ The volunteer added that military personnel have also been banned from taking selfies while working.’ Col Kemp added: ‘This is one of the differences between American and British attitudes to their armed forces. This would never happen in the US, where so many organisations and individuals give special treatment to the troops.’ Oracene . Price, the mother of Venus and Serena Williams, told The Mail on . Sunday: ‘We value our armed forces in America so I don’t get why they . can’t do it in England.’ Last . night a spokesman for the club said off-duty staff had never been . allowed to sit on a show courts and if it had happened in the past it . was against the rules of the club.

"The Queen was praised yesterday for speaking out on behalf of the world’s poor. Royal experts said she was well within her rights to champion the underprivileged and insisted she had not breached any constitutional protocol. The Queen made her remarks to Professor David Simon on a visit to Royal Holloway, University of London, with the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. The Queen looked radiant in royal blue as she visited the Royal Holloway University in London . Queen Elizabeth was beaming after an official visit to Royal Holloway at University Of London . The Queen attended Royal Holloway to mark the college being awarded the Diamond Jubilee Professorship of Music by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, to recognize its department of music's high quality of research and teaching . Followed by Prince Phillip, the Queen greeted members of the university, carrying a bunch of posies . She told Prof Simon: ‘Poor people and their problems don’t get reported often, and they need all the assistance they can be given.’ Anti-monarchists have accused the Queen of breaching her political neutrality by making comments that are critical of Government policy. But Royal commentators insist the Queen had a duty to speak out on behalf of those in need. Penny Junor, who has written biographies of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, said: ‘The Queen is not stupid and would never stray into the world of party politics. I think most people will agree with what she said.’ Hugo Vickers, the historian and royal biographer, described the Queen’s comments as ‘sensitive and sensible’. He said: ‘The Queen is allowed to speak, and if people want to pretend she said something political that is what they will do.’ Prof Simon last night said he told the Queen about his field of expertise, which involves working with poor people, particularly in Africa. The Queen looked to be thoroughly enjoying the day and was rarely seen without a smile . He said they also discussed the recent flooding in England, how it affected those caught up in it, and how people here are much more able to recover from challenges, due to help such as insurance. He said: ‘I don’t think she was trying to be overtly political – it was just a sign of her compassion as far as I was concerned.’ Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, supported the Queen’s comments, saying: ‘I think it’s simply an accurate observation, something that we’re  certainly seeing in our work and which people see increasingly in their communities, such as more families receiving emergency food aid.’ John Hilary, of the War On Want charity, said: ‘Poverty in Britain is not a chance occur-rence. It is the result of a sustained political attack on working people and local communities.’ But Graham Smith of anti-Monarchy group Republic called her comments ‘crass’. ‘It’s a criticism of Government policy, and the rights and wrongs of Government policy aren’t what she’s supposed to speak on,’ he said.

"A university students union has hit out at a Cardiff promotions company for distributing charts encouraging new students to record their sexual conquests alongside when they drink so much alcohol that they vomit. Climax Promotions has been giving out freshers packs which contain charts which are divided into two sides - on one side is a 'shagchart' - for recording sexual conquests - and on the other a 'chunderchart' - for tallying how many times students have vomited as a result of binge drinking. The company, which bills itself as Cardiff's top events company and boasts on its website of bringing 'you the best value for money and the most exciting events',  last year was linked to a promotion that featured a t-shirt with the words, 'I was raping a woman last night and she cried'. The Climax Promotions chart which was handed out to Cardiff freshers so they can record their sexual conquests and how many times they vomit after excessive drinking . MailOnline has attempted to reach Climax Promotions for comment, but is yet to receive a response. Cardiff University Students' Union vice president Faraz Alauddin not only distanced the union from the promotion he called for Climax Promotions to be banned from the campus. He said: 'Promoters will try and jump onto everything. 'Climax have absolutely nothing to do with us. Climax has nothing to do with us, we try and and kick them off. They shouldn't be here, they shouldn't be on campus. 'Cardiff University Students' Union does not support, endorse or encourage this sort of promotional material or lad culture, more generally.' He added: 'The students' union has a strict advertising policy that does not allow such material on campus. 'We believe that the item in the image was distributed by an external company promoting themselves outside of our building and are not in any way associated with the students' union.' Roz Hardie, the chief executive of Object, which challenges the objectification of women, said young men needed to understand the difference between 'flirting and harassment' and that anyone who had the chart on their wall was signalling they were 'someone to avoid'. The Cardiff University Students' Union has called for the company behind the 'shagchart' to be banned from their campus . Ms Hardie said the company behind the chart was doing 'far more than encouraging young people to enjoy themselves', and she hoped the student community as a whole would consider whether they were the type of company they should support. The promotion follows research published earlier this month showing that a culture of heavy drinking has led to sexual molestation becoming the norm on a night out for young women. In a disturbing insight into how 18 to 24-year-olds behave on a night out, a survey has found one in three girls received inappropriate or unwanted physical attention or groping, but few were surprised. Academics said that excessive consumption of alcohol has turned Britain’s pubs and clubs into a ‘permissive social arena’. The report comes nine years after Labour controversially relaxed Britain’s licensing laws to allow 24-hour drinking despite police, judges, health workers and a Daily Mail campaign all warning the policy would prove to be a disaster. The findings were revealed in a report for the charity Drinkaware, which is urging women to stop tolerating behaviour which would be considered unacceptable when sober. ICM researchers found that 31 per cent of young women said they were touched inappropriately on a drunken night out. But only 19 per cent said they were surprised by it. In addition, more than a quarter (27 per cent) have put up with inappropriate sexual comments or abuse on a drunken night out.","Cardiff company hands out charts for students to tally sexual conquests .

"More than one million babies have reportedly been born to couples who met on Match.com - and now one of the children will be rewarded. The online matchmaker is offering a $50,000 college scholarship to a 13- to 20-year-old whose parents or stepparents hooked up via the once-spurned dating site. To be in the running, American children of '#MatchMade' couples must submit short videos in the next two months describing their parents' love story, including the role of the 19-year-old website. The general public will then choose the best of 10 finalists through Facebook and Twitter. Scroll down for video . #MatchMade kid: Dating website Match.com has introduced a $50,000 scholarship 'connecting the children of Match.com couples to an education' Hopeful: The Match Group CEO Sam Yagan (pictured) said the pool of potential applicants could number 100,000 . Match CEO Sam Yagan said he expects at least 100,000 people to enter, as the stigma around online dating gradually gives way to acceptance. He said when the site launched nearly 20 years ago, couples were embarrassed to reveal they met online. 'They were making up stories: ‘We met at . the park,’ or a conference. Now people are pretty open about it,' he said, according to BuzzFeed Business. 'I hope . this (competition) will encourage kids all around the country to ask, ‘How did you . meet?’ 'People should know that about their parents and talk about their . love story.' The scholarship includes a $5,000 vacation award for the parents, and doesn’t consider test . scores or grades of the children. The scholarship could be offered every year. Yagan said he had 'kind of a life-changing moment' about nine months after creating OkCupid in 2003 when a user emailed a thank you note with a picture saying, 'I just had this OkBaby, thanks so much for introducing me to this guy'. 'I’m a math guy, I don’t get emotional about things, but I remember actually pausing and saying, ‘Holy s***, the stuff we do is really important',' he said. 'Because let’s be real - the thing about dating is if there weren’t online dating sites, people would find other ways to meet and get married. 'But those specific humans are only the result of a specific pair we put together … those million babies literally wouldn’t exist.' Yagan predicts that, as Match commands at least 20 percent of the online dating market, 'it’ll get to the point that 10 percent of all high school students will be Match babies.'

"A 15-year-old girl has been horrifically murdered in Houston in what appears to be a satanic ritual killing. She was found with an upside-down cross carved into her stomach and religious items placed in a circle around her partially naked body. Police say Corriann Cervantes was abducted, then raped and bashed in the head with the lid of a toilet tank and an ashtray until she died. She was kidnapped on Wednesday, but her body was not found until Saturday morning. Police arrested 17-year-old Jose E. Reyes and a 16-year-old classmate of Corriann's, who knew her from the alternative high school they both attended in Clear Lake, Texas. Sick smile: Jose Reyes smiled at the court cameras on Monday as he appeared on murder charges . Brutal: Corriann Cervantes, 15, was taken to a vacant apartment, where she was raped and brutally murdered, police say . Reyes confessed to the horrific crime and said he had killed Corriann so that his younger friend could 'sell his soul to the devil,' according to KTRK-TV. In court on Monday, Reyes looked directly into the camera and smiled. He faces adult capital murder charges. A judge ordered him held without bail. The 16-year-old is being charged with capital murder as a juvenile. His name was not released. Corriann was found in a vacant apartment about 4am Saturday - three days after she was kidnapped. One of the neighbors who found her body said there were religious items placed around her body, according to KTRK. A police report says she was found half naked with her clothes torn and an upside-down cross carved into her stomach. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped. Crime scene: Corriann's body was found, surrounded by religious cult items, in this vacant apartment . Motive: Reyes claims he killed the girl so his friend could 'sell his soul to the devil' A broken toilet tank cover was found around her head. Detectives believe the teens savagely beat her with the lid and an ashtray. Reyes confessed that the pair sexually assaulted Corriann. When she tried to leave the vacant apartment, they grabbed her by the arms and pulled her back in again, according to police. Reyes was arrested Sunday after he told the horrific details of the crime to a family member, who called police. Victim: Corriann was found murdered three days after she went missing from her Texas home . The 16-year-old was arrested at school on Monday - the same school he attended to Corriann. Classmates were shocked to hear about Corriann's horrific murder on Monday and counselors were made available to her friends at school. Friends left an outpouring of grief on her Facebook page - and rage for her suspected killers. 'RIP prayers to her family and friends. God will take her into his arms to comfort her and she is smiling down from heaven now. Hope the ones who did this suffers for it!' one mourner wrote.","Corriann Cervantes' body was found half-naked with an upside-down cross carved into her stomach .

"The Muslim convert who shot dead a soldier and brought terror to Canada's Parliament was caught listening to fanatical Jihadi audiotapes encouraging violence with a wanted suspected terrorist, MailOnline can reveal. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was influenced by radicalized Hasibullah Yusuzfai after meeting at a mosque in Vancouver, it has been claimed. Yusufzai, 25, has been charged under a new anti-terrorism law for allegedly joining Islamist fighters in Syria after fleeing Canada in January. Wanted: Hasibullah Yusuzfai, 25, has been charged under new Canadian anti-terror laws after he fled the country to allegedly go and fight for Islamist radicals in Syria. He underwent a dramatic transformation from wannabe hunk, left, to radical, right - in an Interpol wanted poster . Gunman: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was friends with Yusuzfai in Vancouver where they were seen listening to extremist preachers spew hatred against the West . The pair would spend time together listening to recordings of extremist preachers encouraging acts of violence, according to the father of David Bathurst, one of their Muslim convert friends. Speaking outside his home in Burnaby, Vancouver, John Bathurst said: 'David often heard these guys play tapes and immediately said ""No, that's wrong. What you're listening to is not about what's taught in the Quran."" They would be listening to these shocking tapes counseling violence. 'From what I understand from David is that these tapes are coming off-shore from sources that are outside of local influence.' Up until now Canadian police have only acknowledged that the killer and Yusufzai had contact through social media. This is the first evidence that the pair actually met. Yusufzai is the only one of around 130 people who have left the country to fight for extremists to have been charged. Another 80 have since returned. In a shocking twist, John, 67, confessed to hiring both Yusufzai, in 2013, and Zehaf-Bibaeu, in 2011, for his family business, Bathurst Irrigation, after his son recommended them. He describes their employment as 'causing a s**t storm' and says their sole duties were to dig holes in the ground with a pitchfork for a few dollars more than minimum wage. 'Hasibullah [Yusufzai] worked for us for two weeks, he had a chip on his shoulder from the day he arrived, he was very angry man,' he explained. 'He's a guy that David met at the mosque before disassociating himself after learning how radicalized he was. 'I met him, of course, he used to ride a motorcycle. He worked for me for two weeks last year in 2013, he told my son he really needed work and asked for help. 'Normally we have people who come and work for us stay for an entire summer but Michael [Zehaf-Bibeau] lasted only two days. 'I don't remember why he quit but probably because the work is too hard. David would have philosophical discussions with this guy and remembers him being pretty radical and would be talking crazy.' Convert: David Bathurst, left, befriended fellow Muslim convert Zahef-Bibeau and also Yusufzai. Zahef-Bibeau and Yusufzai even worked at the irrigation business run by David's father, John . Fears: John Bathurst has provided the first evidence that the killer and Yusufzai were friendly in person. The Canadian authorities have only acknowledged publicly that the pair communicated over social media . John told how his son David met the cold blooded killer six weeks ago at a street festival in downtown Vancouver, recalling how Zehaf-Bibeau was unstable and spoke passionately about moving to Syria. He said: 'Michael told him he wanted to go to Syria which David knew wasn't a good idea because he was unstable. He warned him not to go if he was going to do the devil’s work. 'That was the last conversation they had together, they were associates from meeting at the mosque.' John admits having to monitor son David's activities for signs of being radicalized since he converted to the religion seven years ago. He said: 'Sometimes I have to speak to David about some of the radical stuff that he's heard, for instance he has been on a real British-bashing thing lately and I told him to change his way of thinking.' Incredibly records from 2011 indicate that Zehaf-Bibeau wanted to be incarcerated to help him with his crack addiction - where he could get treatment in prison. He confessed to committing an armed robbery in Quebec ten years prior, although officers couldn't find a record of the crime. The troubled addict then attempted to rob a McDonalds restaurant in Vancouver with a sharpened stick, according to audio records reported by CTV. A police report filed shows that an officer described Zehaf-Bibeau as 'happy' when they arrested him. During the investigation it was ruled that Zehaf-Bibeau did not suffer from any mental illness and was described as being a 'devoted Muslim for seven years'. John told MailOnline: 'Michael was begging for help, he was mentally ill but for some reason he didn’t get it, he didn’t meet the criteria. David was counseling Michael always telling him: ""Don’t do anything unless it’s at the heart of Islam.""' Innocent: Cpl Nathan Cirillo was shot dead by Zahef-Bibeau in Wednesday's attack on the Canadian Parliament . Senseless: Cpl Cirillo's mother, Kathy, weeps as his casket is taken into a hearse ahead of his funeral Friday . John added: 'The situation has made David’s beliefs stronger. I'm so proud of him as a son… but I hate religion.' Zehaf-Bibeau murdered soldier Cpl Nathan Cirillo, 24, at Ottawa’s war memorial on Wednesday before being shot dead himself as he stormed a nearby parliament building. A CCTV video released by police shows the gunman hijacking a minister’s car then speeding off towards Centre Block – the main building of the Canadian Parliamentary complex – pursued by police. After leaving the stolen car he ran into the building and exchanged fire with House of Commons security and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RMCP) before being shot dead by hero Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers. Meanwhile Zehaf-Bibeau's mother Susan Bibeau told the Associated Press that she had lunch with her son last week after being estranged for five years. In her statement Mrs Bibeau said her son seemed lost and 'did not fit in'. She added: 'Can you ever explain something like this? We are very sorry.' RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson told a news conference that Zehaf-Bibeau had a 'history of violence, drugs and mental instability' but was not linked to a Muslim convert that killed a Canadian soldier in a hit and run in Quebec on Monday. However Paulson said killer Zehaf-Bibeau was trying to get a Libyan passport to travel to Syria.","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, who shot dead Cpl Nathan Cirillo in Ottawa on Sunday was caught listening to fanatical tapes with Hasibullah Yusuzfai .

"Researchers have revealed an unprecedented insight into Australopithecus sediba, a two million-year-old human ancestor. The fossils, which were studied by . scientists across the world, show a mixture of primitive features and of . more advanced features typical of later human species. They analysed bones of sediba discovered near Johannesburg in 2008 to find out how he walked, chewed and moved. Scroll down for video . This image shows a reconstruction of Au. sediba. For comparison, there is a small-bodied female modern human on the left and a male chimpanzee on the right . The human ancestor has a narrow upper rib cage while the modern human's thorax is uniformly cylindrical. The cone-shaped rib cage allowed the early hominin to move its shoulder blades so it could climb trees. However, it prevented it from swinging its arms meaning that walking and running was much more difficult. It had a slim waist similar to modern humans but feet which turned sharply inwards. Au. sediba had the same number of lumbar vertebrae as a modern man and a similar curvature of the lower back. However, its back was longer and more flexible than that of modern humans. As a result, it is believed that this new species is currently the best candidate for a direct ancestor of our own species. The human ancestor had a narrow upper rib cage which is similar to that of large apes, such as gorillas, but which is different to the human thorax which is uniformly cylindrical. The researchers believe that it is the narrow upper thorax of apes that enables them to move their shoulder blades so that they can climb trees, however, it prevents them swinging their arms which makes walking upright much more difficult. Therefore, Dr Peter Schmid, of the University of Zurich, assumes that Au. sediba was not able to walk or run on both feet as well as humans can. ‘They probably couldn't run over longer distances, especially as they were unable to swing their arms which saves energy,’ he said. While the lower thorax was less well preserved, it appeared to show that the early human had a slim waist similar to that of a modern human. Image shows a reconstruction of Au. sediba - the fossils of which were found near Johannesburg in South Africa . An examination of the lower extremities also revealed a heel, metatarsus, knee, hips and back, which are unique and unprecedented. It suggested that sediba walked with feet turned sharply inwards. The teeth of this species were also studied and indicate that it is also a close relative of the previously identified Australopithecus africanus. Both of these species are more closely related to humans than other australopiths from east Africa, according to the new research. The study, published in the journal Science, also revealed that both africanus and sediba shared about the same number of dental traits with the first undeniably human species. Casting technicians at the Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the Witwatersrand cast elements of the sediba skeleton in order to prepare the standing reconstruction . Dr Peter Schmid assembles a standing skeleton of Au. sediba at the Evolutionary Studies Institute . ‘Our study provides further evidence that sediba is indeed a very close relative of early humans, but we can't definitively determine its position relative to africanus,’ said Dr Debbie Guatelli-Steinberg, co-author of the study and professor of anthropology at The Ohio State University. The researchers examined the teeth from sediba and compared them to eight other African hominin species, which include modern humans from Africa, and extinct species of Homo, Australopithecus, and Paranthropus. In all, the researchers examined more than 340 fossils and 4,571 recent specimens. They also examined teeth from 44 gorillas for comparison. The focus was on 22 separate traits of tooth crowns and roots that can give clues as to the relationship between the different species studied. A reconstruction of the skeleton of Au. Sediba is pictured next to a model of the common chimpanzee's skeleton . A 2D reconstruction of Au. Sediba based on fossils found in South Africa . Researchers use standardised measurements from the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System to compare the teeth on these 22 traits. The researchers found that on 15 of these traits, sediba and africanus scored the same. Sediba shared 13 traits with Homo erectus, an early human species, which was comparable to how africanus scored. Sediba and africanus shared five dental traits that were not found in earlier australopiths, further showing their close relationship. Both also share five traits with early humans – Homo habilis/rudolfenis and Homo erectus -- which were not shared with earlier ancestors, demonstrating the close relationship between these two australopiths and the first humans. Dr Guatelli-Steinberg said their dental analysis showed that both africanus and sediba are more closely related to humans than the famous ‘Lucy’ skeleton fossil found in East Africa in 1974. This fossil represented a species, Australopithecus afarensis, that was at one time was thought to be the closest relative of humans. Images shows the parts of the skeletons which have been studied to reveal the new findings . The reconstructed skull and mandible of Australopithecus sediba . Lucy is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago. Sediba lived 1.977 million years ago, while africanus lived between 3.03 and 2.04 million years ago. ‘Our research on teeth can't definitively settle if either sediba or africanus is more closely related to humans than the other species,’ Dr Guatelli-Steinberg said. ‘But our findings do suggest that both are closely related to each other and are more closely related to humans than afarensis. ‘We need to find more sediba remains to help fill in the missing pieces of this evolutionary puzzle.’ An analysis of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral region of the spinal column was also carried out and shows that Au. sediba had the same number of lumbar vertebrae as modern man. The strong hollow back suggests that he was more advanced in this area than Au. africanus and may be more likely compared with Homo erectus. Au. sediba had a human-like curvature of the lower back, but it was functionally longer and more flexible than that of modern humans. ‘They probably walked in a way that we might find strange—a ‘compromise’ form of bipedalism indicative of a hominin that still partially relied on climbing trees,’ Dr Scott Williams explained. Image shows the bones that made up the human ancestor's ribs . He noted that ‘the adult female is the first early hominin skeleton that preserves an intact terminal thoracic region and this provides critical information on the transition in inter-vertebral joints, and, by inference, mobility of the lower back.’ ‘The bony spine of Au. sediba likely had the same number of vertebrae as that of modern humans,’ Dr Williams added. ‘However, it differed in one primary aspect of its configuration—the transition in inter-vertebral articular facets occurred at a higher level of the spine that than normally occurs in modern humans. In combination with other features, a functionally longer lower back would have allowed for a more flexible spine in Au. sediba relative to that of modern humans.’ In addition, morphological indicators of strong lumbar curvature suggest that Au. sediba evolved in this regard relative to Au. africanus, which lived between 3.03 and 2.04 million years ago, and closer to the more recent Nariokotome Homo erectus skeleton—to date, the most complete early human skeleton discovered. The new study shows an image of a human species with a mosaic-like physique. Some body parts are similar to those of earlier and others to those of later hominins. ‘The numerous similarities with Homo erectus suggest that Au. sediba represents the most appropriate early form of the genus Homo,’ said Dr Schmid. He added: ‘The previous candidates are too fragmentary to be capable of occupying this position.’ The newly described human ancestor is thought to be more closely related to humans than the famous 'Lucy' skeleton fossil found in East Africa in 1974. The image shows a 3D model of 'Lucy'","Biggest-ever study of the two million-year-old fossils found in South Africa .

"The college drama professor who gave Robin Williams his first stage role at aged 20 says that after watching the tragic actor on TV recently, 'he looked as if he had lost his charm.' In an interview with MailOnline, Robin's friend and former drama professor James Dunn said, 'I hadn't seen Robin in a while but he was being interviewed on TV a month ago and I remember being shocked at how old he looked. 'For the first time his eyes looked deep set and his face looked tired. He always had an impish charm about him for as long as I can remember but that vanished.' Scroll down for video . Genius: James Dunn said Robin Williams was his star pupil and cast him as Tranio in a Wild West Version of Taming of the Shrew at the Edinburgh Festival in 1791. the students raised the money for the trip themselves . Charlie Chaplin of his generation: Dunn said: 'He always had an impish charm about him for as long as I can remember but that vanished' Charmer: Dunn remembers Williams as a 'womaniser' who 'was from a very well-to-do family and he was an only child but he was always broke' Dunn was devastated when he learned that his star pupil committed suicide dead body at his Californian home on Monday while his unwitting wife, Susan Schneider, slept in another room. She revealed yesterday that Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson's Disease when he took his own life. Speaking from his former office in the College of Marin, where he taught Williams for three years and continued to stay in contact, drama professor Dunn reveals how he was floored by Robin's talent from the getgo and compared his legacy to that of Charlie Chaplin. 'There was always this aura around him. He always had women attention. You just couldn't not love him and that definitely rubbed off on the ladies,' he said. 'He was a womanizer, there's no doubt about that - and he always seemed to be able to deal with anything.' But Dunn never thought the 63-year-old was a self destructive person. 'He was a sharp guy. And even until recently Robin still seemed to be in good shape despite the major heart problems. 'There are . some people who have demons but Robin wasn't that way, I never saw him . as a dark person but some comics do have a dark side. 'I think it's hard to be funny and pull out the absurdities of life.' Dunn said there was, however, a lot going on inside of him as with anyone who is that creative. 'He did a lot of drugs and then cleaned up on that. Then he got into alcohol and was in rehab a couple of times. When . you look back on it you think ""Well he lived life,"" he was like a moth . to a flame - eventually he burnt out,' Dunn believes. He thinks that the actor seemed indestructible. A man for all seasons Robin Williams beloved drama teacher, James Dunn poses at Marin College where Williams spent three years in the 1970s . Buckaroo: Robin (right) is seen in one of his first ever acting roles for a wild west version of theTaming of the Shrew at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland 1971 while a student at Marin. He played Tranio . Royal attention: Princess Margaret arrives at the show to watch Williams and his fellow actors perform . 'When he was my student I used to kick his a**, you've got to be able to put up with that. Robin's a true genius like Charlie Chaplin, and I think he'll be remembered the same way. It was an honor to know him personally and professionally, it's really sad.' Talking to MailOnline, Dunn - who also hired Williams to work in his backyard - told how as a broke student he would borrow money from classmates and probably spent it on marijuana. 'He was from a very well-to-do family and he was an only child but he was always broke,' Dunn explains. 'So he was always borrowing money from every student. Every single one of them he owed money to because you just couldn't say no to him.' Dunn first cast Williams, then 20, as Tranio in a wild west version of The Taming of the Shrew in 1971, and the class brought the show to Edinburgh Festival in Scotland that year. Dunn also shared never before seen footage of a young Robin Williams behind the scenes of the school production. The black and white video shows Williams, wearing cowboy attire for the Shakespeare adaptation, lapping up the attention in his first serious acting role and he is the last to leave after the final bow. Williams and his fellow students - who raised money for the trip themselves - were rewarded by scooping the illustrious Best of The Fringe Award. The rare archive footage shows Williams on stage in front of an audience that included Princess Margaret, who is also seen being greeted by cast members on her arrival at the theatre. The 81-year-old, who recently retired, also recalled the moment he was first awestruck by the hilarious Williams during a rehearsal of Oliver! gone wrong. 'There were some sound problems and everyone was p***** off. It was like midnight and out of nowhere Robin started talking to the baton he was holding and then spoke back,' he said. Dunn continued: 'Every person in the room went from being in a bad mood to hysterics with tears of laughter streaming down their face. 'I knew what kids in the group were going to go on and make it, I went home that night and told my wife ""That boy's going to be a star."" Robin blew my mind that night. Westward ho: 'There was always this aura around him,' Dunn says of Robin (standing, far right). 'You just couldn't not love him and that definitely rubbed off on the ladies' 'This guy, internationally known, invented a comedy that nobody else can do. Nobody can do Robin because he's so unique. For instance, in the mid-80s he came back to perform Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors - he did every single part and character by himself to help raise money for the college.' Dunn recalled a touching anecdote from the Hollywood star who he remained close to until his final years. 'Robin used to work for me in my backyard and on his 40th birthday he invited me to his party in Napa,' he said. 'His family were preparing a book so I wrote this letter which said ""Well, Robin, you used to work for me in my backyard for five dollars an hour."" And since he was making a bit more money then so I finished it with ""But I guess I'll pay you ten dollars now.'"" Despite reports of money troubles, Williams still gave generously to the college with yearly contributions of thousands of dollars over the last 20 years. 'He wouldn't have lived any differently if he wasn't famous, it's just who he was. He would have been a hyper individual no matter what,' Dunn reflected. 'Robin's made so much money that I imagine there may have been some bad deals along the way.' The college will discuss memorial plans and consider various tributes to their most famous alumni. 'But we can't name the building after him,' joked Dunn, adding: 'Because it's already named after me!'","Robin Williams' longtime friend and college professor James Dunn says Robin looks as if he had lost his charm in recent weeks .

"Child ‘judges’ and ‘jurors’ as young as 14 are being given the power to punish thugs, arsonists and vandals with soft sentences such as writing poems or drawing posters to atone for their crimes. Critics have branded the idea a ‘crazy experiment’ full of ‘silly gimmicks’ that trivialises serious offences. And the pilot scheme is further undermined by a Mail on Sunday investigation which found many of the teenagers passing judgment on their peers have posted inappropriate messages online. Under the ‘peer court’, offenders are given an astonishing range of lenient punishments after being ‘tried’ by a mock judge and jury composed of young volunteers. But one 22-year-old potential judge taking part in the taxpayer-funded experiment posted a naked photograph of himself with his private parts covered by a hat on Facebook; a young female volunteer retweeted a racist comment with a photograph of a black woman; while a third boasted on Twitter: ‘It’s 14.00 and we’re already on the drinks!’ Volunteers of the Hampshire Community Court, where cases will be heard by a judge aged 18 to 24 and 12 jurors aged from 14 . A leaked document seen by The Mail on Sunday reveals the full tariff of soft-option sentences available to the court, derided as ‘juvenile Judge Judy’ by one critic. The scheme will be trialled in Hampshire from next month, and is being monitored by the Ministry of Justice. It could be introduced in other areas, if judged a success. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has expressed enthusiasm for the project, which will run for three years backed with £165,000 of taxpayers’ money, saying: ‘It’s a very interesting idea... We don’t particularly want to give teenagers criminal records if we don’t have to.’ But other Tory MPs are furious at what they see as going soft on crime. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, West Yorkshire, described it as ‘a crazy experiment’ which sends out the wrong message. And he said the social media posts of volunteers in the pilot scheme made a mockery of a court’s authority. ‘Are they the pillars of society people would expect to be sitting in judgement on others? I think not.’ Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention said: ‘This scheme combines the worst of soft sentencing and silly gimmicks. Tom Trew, who is to be part of Hampshire Community Court who posted this photo of himself on a social network site . ‘Some of the punishments read like a sick joke, trivialising serious crimes. It sets a bad example to young people to imply that if they commit serious offences the only result will be a few hours back in the classroom, or volunteering.’ The Hampshire Community Court will hear up to eight cases a week in a room at Fareham police station. Cases can only be referred there with the victim’s agreement and both sides will be represented by volunteer ‘advocates.’ Offenders aged between ten and 17 who have admitted guilt will be brought before the ‘judge’, who will be the only participant in the process aged over 18. The upper age limit for court staff is 24. One test case dealt with by the 16 volunteers during their training  involved a teenage shoplifter. They ruled that he should be ‘educated’ that his offending might harm his chances of getting a job. He was also ordered to design a poster explaining the damaging effects of shoplifting, and give it to the shopkeeper from whom he stole, along with a letter of apology. Another case involved a 14-year-old boy who admitted kicking his mother. He escaped with a warning. Most participants in the project came forward in response to messages posted on social media by Hampshire . Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Hayes and PC Mark Walsh, who became an enthusiast for the idea of peer courts after seeing them in action in America. Guidelines written by PC Walsh for the judges and jurors say: ‘You are expected to serve as a positive role model... You should remain temperate and dignified and refrain from all morally reprehensible or illegal conduct.’ One volunteer, shop worker Blake Hayward, 23, said: ‘I want to be a police forensic investigator so I thought this would be useful. We’ve learned about court procedures and helping lead the offender in the right direction. ‘It’s trying to get the offender and victim talking to each other in the same room. We are trying not to make the courtroom look too formal as we are dealing with young people and we don’t want to shock them.’ Blake Hayward, who will also be part of the scheme, and will probably serve as a judge is dressed in a sumo wrestling suit in one of his Instagram posts . The 12 jury members will wear blue T-shirts bearing the Hampshire Police logo. The court usher will have a black robe but there will be no wigs or formal attire for the judge. Officials say the panel will only handle offences deemed too minor to be sent to magistrates’ or youth courts, where harsher sentences can be imposed. Mr Hayes said: ‘We’re talking about low-level anti-social behaviour, not serious physical violence or aggravated burglary. ‘These are young people who have probably committed a crime for the first time and haven’t really understood the consequences.’ Of the criticisms, he told The Mail on Sunday: ‘You’ve picked on what might seem trivial outcomes, but it could be community service to show that the person has understood the consequences of their crime.’ None of the volunteers whose social media output was highlighted by The Mail on Sunday wished to comment, according to Hampshire Police. But Mr Hayes said: ‘The 16 volunteers are from various backgrounds. It is important that the peer jury is reflective of the community. The volunteers highlighted continue to have our full support.’ The Ministry of Justice said: ‘This is not a Government pilot. Serious offences will always go to court where tough punishments are available.’ Volunteer Jo-Jo Navarro-Shrank, who posted a contentious tweet, will also be involved in Hampshire Community Court . They . are the new faces of Britain’s first ‘peer court’: booze-swilling, . sex-obsessed and openly offensive... yet apparently qualified to sit  in . judgment of their peers. Among them are Tom Trew, 22, who has posted a photo of himself on Twitter, naked except for a hat covering his private parts. Elsewhere, . he boasts of sleeping  with a girl whose name he didn’t even know, . makes explicit references to sex acts, and calls a pal a ‘pikey’. Fellow . volunteer Jo-Jo Navarro-Shrank retweeted a photograph of a black woman . with the message: WHOSE MATTE BLACK MUM IS THIS!???!’ alongside an . emotion icon  of a laughing face. The 17-year-old student has also posted: ‘Always feel so at home at nail salons since most of them are Oriental lol.’ At . 23, Blake Hayward, a shop worker, is one of the older volunteers and . will probably serve as a judge in charge of the proceedings. So . it comes as something of a surprise to find a series of online . photographs of him cavorting with women and men, and one on Instagram . which shows him in a fat suit dressed as a Sumo wrestler. One of his . abusive comments reads: ‘Don’t you love  it when people are c***s.’ Another says: ‘This hot piece of meat has just followed me... OMG!’ On . May 3 this year he tweeted: ‘Another p**** ticked off!!’ and  two weeks . later he declared:  ‘It is 14.00hrs and we are already on the drinks!’ Drink . is clearly a hot topic. On May 31 he posted: ‘Why am I at work in my . birthday?! Wanna just get drunk!!’ And last year he said: ‘I need to . start going out more  and getting p****d!’ Conservative MP Philip Davies, who believes the courts will only trivialise crime . Just last week Parliament rightly introduced mandatory minimum sentences for knife crime offences with young thugs at the forefront of people’s minds. Yet here we have the exact opposite – a politically correct ‘Juvenile Judge Judy’ form of justice. Part of the PC agenda is for everything to be ‘representative’  of the population and this move to have young people ‘judging’ other young people seems to me to be  an example of that fluffy utopian view of the world. The whole idea sounds like a crazy experiment. By law, 14-year-olds can’t smoke, can’t drink, can’t drive and can’t have sex, and yet it seems that, under these proposals, they could be allowed to influence the judicial process. Rather like schools which encourage input from children when choosing a new head teacher, this strikes me as yet another example of blurring the line between children being children and adults being adults. Would it not be far better to  work to stop the culture of children knowing their ‘rights’ before understanding their responsibilities, and tackle the lack of respect  that many show to adults and those in authority? I think that a stern warning from a respected police officer would scare many children off crime. However, if that did not work for some little thugs, an appearance before a proper judge – or even a night in the cells at an early stage – might be much more likely to make them think twice about committing a crime again than being told to complete a first aid course or  write a poem by a panel of their young peers. Crime should be punished. What sort of a message are we sending to young criminals by trivialising their crime in this way? You really couldn’t make it up.","Young judges and jurors are being given the power to punish thugs, arsonists and vandals .

"The . government's broad programs to collect U.S. phone records and Internet traffic . helped disrupt a 2009 plot to bomb the New York City subways, a senior U.S. intelligence . official said. But the assertion raises as many questions . as it answers because court testimony indicated the subway plot investigation began . with an email. Over the past days, The Guardian newspaper . and The Washington Post have revealed classified documents showing how the National Security . Agency sweeps up phone records and Internet data in its hunt for . terrorists. Those programs have come under criticism from civil libertarians and . some in Congress who say they were too broad and collected too much about . innocent Americans. Busted: NYC terror suspect Najibullah Zazi, pictured in 2009, pleaded guilty to plotting to bomb the New York subway system . In one of those programs, the NSA's collected daily records of millions of . phone calls made and received by U.S. citizens not suspected of any . wrongdoing. On Thursday, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., . who leads the House . Intelligence Committee, credited that effort with thwarting a terrorism . plot. But he did not elaborate. The senior U.S. intelligence official who asserted Friday that the phone . records program together with other technical intercepts thwarted the subway . plot would not provide other details. The official was not authorized to discuss . the plot publicly and requested anonymity. Afghan-American Najibullah Zazi pleaded guilty in the 2009 . plot, saying he had been recruited by al-Qaida in Pakistan. Safe: The NSA's domestic spying program stopped an alleged terror plot planned against the New York City subway system . The break in that case came, according to court documents and testimony, when . Zazi emailed a Yahoo address seeking help with his bomb recipe. At that time, British intelligence officials . knew the Yahoo address was associated with an al-Qaida leader in Pakistan. That's because, according to British government documents released in 2010, . officials had discovered it on the computer of a terror suspect there months . earlier. Because the NSA and British intelligence work so closely together and so . little is known about how the NSA monitors email traffic, it's possible that . both agencies were monitoring the Yahoo address at the time Zazi sent the . critical email in 2009. A-OK: There have been no successful terrorist attacks in new York City since 9/11, perhaps in part due to the NSA's 'PRISM@ program . What's unclear, though, is how the phone program aided the investigation, . which utilized court-authorized wiretaps of Zazi and his friends. Based on what's known about the phone-records program, the NSA might have had . an archive of all the phone calls Zazi had made, which might have helped . authorities look for possible co-conspirators. Because the phone program remains . classified, however, it's impossible to say with certainty how the program . benefited the investigation.","Government program credited by Rep.

"Banned: Transgender footballer, Aeris Houlihan, 32, has been banned from playing for her local women's team by the FA . A transgender footballer has been banned from playing for her local women's team until two years after her gender reassignment operation. Despite holding a UK passport and driving licence stating that she is female, Aeris Houlihan, 32, has been told by the Football Association that she can only play with men. Ms Houlihan now faces a wait of nearly two and a half years to play competitively with other women, even though she has provided FA bosses with medical proof that her hormone levels are identical to that of a natural-born female. Ms Houlihan said that the verdict came after the FA admitted to her that their legislation for transgender applicants is outdated. 'It's really disappointing and doesn't make any sense, I just want to play football,' Ms Houlihan said. 'It's not like I want to play for Barcelona, I just want to play for my local club.' England fan Ms Houlihan has been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for eight months and is due to have her operation in March next year. She applied to the FA in June to play for Sunday League Football Team, Middleton Park Ladies FC in Leeds, and was asked to provide a doctor's letter to verify her female hormone levels. After providing medical evidence with the backing of her hormone doctor, Ms Houlihan said she was then repeatedly ignored by the FA for five months. She said she received one message from the FA to say that England Women's National Football Team manager, Hope Powell's sacking had affected her case before finally hearing back from them in October. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Aeris Houlihan as a seven-year-old with Father Christmas and, right, today. She holds a UK passport, driving licence and a gender certificate which states that she is female . Fan: Ms Houlihan, pictured left as an eight-year-old, has always been a football fan and will never miss an England game . She was then told that she could not play for her local team and would be unable to appeal this decision. Ms Houlihan said: 'My hormone doctor . was disgusted with the decision. I have lost all the testosterone . advantage males have and I'm far too weak to play for the men's team. 'The . FA didn't even bother to look at my hormone levels or my blood test . results, which are the same as any other woman's. They are blind and . need to look at the evidence in front of them.' On the ball: Football has always been an important part of Ms Houlihan's life and she previously played for the St Mary's Men's side in the Yorkshire League . Team spirit: Ms Houlihan (back row, third from right) has the full support of her teammates at Middleton Park Ladies FC . Home Ground: The home of Middleton Park Ladies FC in Leeds, Yorkshire . Middleton . Park Ladies FC are also appalled by the FA's ruling and have voiced . their support of Ms Houlihan, who can now only participate in friendlies . with her team. 'We support . the fact she would like to play in a Ladies team as she is now legally a . women, she has a British passport and she should be allowed to compete . as a woman, just as she is allowed to live as a woman in her everyday . life,' the club said in a statement. Outrage: Ms Houlihan said her hormone doctor was 'disgusted' with the FA's decision . 'So as a club we fully support all our players who play for Middleton Park FC and will stand by them.' Football . has always been an important part of Ms Houlihan's life and she . previously played for the St Mary's Men's side in the Yorkshire League. She said: 'With the HRT, I need to keep active. Not only that, I love football - playing it and watching it. I never miss an England match, even when it's just a friendly.' Ms Houlihan, who runs a popular YouTube channel discussing sex-change issues, added: 'A lot of transgender girls are quite shy and many of my subscribers have said I'm helping them out by going public with my unfair FA ruling. 'I feel obliged to carry this forward because there will be other people in my situation too. I'm representing something I believe in.' A spokesman for The FA commented: 'The FA’s policy on trans inclusion in football was set following consultations with experts on the subject, as well as guidance from DCMS and the International Olympic Committee. 'Individuals undergoing gender reassignment after puberty are required to have had the relevant surgical changes completed at least two years previously, as well as hormonal therapy for a sufficient length of time to minimise gender-related advantages in football matches. 'If an individual does not meet the requirements of the policy, they are not able to play football in their legally acquired gender.' The FA have long campaigned for equality in football and have run campaigns and initiatives to increase lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) representation in the sport. However, policy dictates that transgender players must have had their sex reassignment surgery completed for at least two years before they can be registered to play in FA competition with their acquired gender. Players must also have undergone hormone therapy for a sufficient length of time to minimise any gender-related advantages they may have while playing football, so as to ensure a fair competition. Children who undergo gender reassignment before puberty are allowed to be registered as their acquired gender. The criteria is not written into the FA rule book. On the FA's website it is stated: 'An individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity should never be a barrier to participating in, and enjoying, our national sport.' In order to meet that requirement The FA has pledged to identify the boundaries that prevent LGBT people from engaging with football and ensure that 'every opportunity is given to enable members of gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans communities to participate and progress within their chosen area of participation in football'. The FA is also dedicated to tackling all forms of homophobic, bi-phobic and transphobic language and behaviour – whether by spectators, players, coaches or other participants.","Aeris Houlihan has been told by the FA she can only play with men .

"Billionaire oil bosses today joined the President of France in paying their last respects to Total boss Christophe de Margerie – as the investigation into his death in a plane crash uncovered mysterious new evidence. The 63-year-old chief executive died when his private plane crashed into a snow plough at Moscow's Vnukovo airport a week ago. President  Hollande joined numerous other dignitaries including  Tamim Ben Hamad Al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar and IMF managing director Christine Lagarde at the service at Saint-Sulpice church in Paris. Service: Pallbearers carry the coffin of former Total Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie before a funeral service at Saint Sulpice church in Paris, France . French President Francois Hollande joined numerous other dignitaries including Tamim Ben Hamad Al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar and IMF managing director Christine Lagarde at the service at Saint-Sulpice church in Paris . Family: Bernadette de Margerie, second right, widow of former Total SA Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie, and relatives arrive at a funeral service for her husband . Russian ambassador Alexandre Orlov represented President Vladimir Putin, who said de Margerie had been a 'true friend' of his country before he died in a tragic accident. But a French investigator has now suggested that the snow clearing machine crossed the runway and then mysteriously reversed back into the jet's path. Before his death De Margerie worked closely with Russia and had plans to invest in Russian energy . Francois Hochart, who was sent to Moscow by France's BEA accident investigation bureau, told AFP news agency that the initial take-off was routine. 'The pilots did a few checks and at that moment, the runway was clear,' said Mr Hochart. 'Fourteen seconds after the start of the acceleration, one of the pilots said: ""What's that car crossing the runway?"" ' Referring to the control tower, Mr Hochart said: 'We know that the snowplough crossed the runway without the tower's authorisation. 'For a totally unknown reason, it reversed back onto the runway just as the plane arrived.' Such findings will heighten conspiracy theories around the crash, which is under criminal investigation. There have been a number of arrests, including that of the 60-year-old snowplough driver, who was said to be drunk at the time. Vladimir Martynenko is said to have had a blood alcohol content of 0.6 grams of ethanol per litre of blood, compared to the legal limit of zero for driving in Russia, but he denies it. Instead, Martynenko said he had 'lost his bearings' and did not notice he was on the runway. Total, one of the world's largest hydrocarbon producers, is among France's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization and a major player of French international business. Evidence: A French investigator has now suggested that the snow clearing machine crossed the runway and then mysteriously reversed back into the jet's path. Drunk? Vladimir Martynenko, the driver of the the snowplough which hit the plane, is said to have had a blood alcohol content of 0.6 grams of ethanol per litre of blood . Total recently named Patrick Pouyanne as the new chief executive, while former Total CEO, Thierry Desmarest, was appointed chairman. During his time as CEO, De Margerie worked closely with Russia and had plans to invest in Russian energy. Hours before the crash, he met Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to discuss foreign investment in Russia. Following the memorial service, De Margerie will be buried Tuesday morning in a small private ceremony in Normandy, northern France.

"Three people were charged Monday in connection with a Cold War-style Russian spy ring that tried to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources, authorities said. Evgeny Buryakov, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy conspired to gather economic intelligence on behalf of Russia, including alleged information about U.S. sanctions against the country, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Monday's charges are linked to Buryakov's alleged covert work on behalf of Russia's foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, according to a criminal complaint.

One of them Evgeny Buryakov, 39, masked this work by posing as a banker for Russia's Vnesheconombank, (pictured) according to the complaint and the bank's website . The men conspired to gather economic intelligence on behalf of Russia, including alleged information about U.S. sanctions against the country, and to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured in a file photo) said in a statement . Buryakov, 39, masked this work by posing as a banker for Russia's Vnesheconombank, according to the complaint and the bank's website. Buryakov was arrested Monday in the Bronx. The two other suspects are at large. The alleged conspiracy began in 2012, following the 2010 expulsion of several Russian spies from the United States. Federal prosecutors said Sporyshev, 40, worked as a Russian trade representative from November 2010 to November 2014, while Podobnyy, 27, was an attaché to Russia's mission to the United Nations from December 2012 to September 2013. 'The presence of a Russian banker in New York would in itself hardly draw attention today, which is why these alleged spies may have thought Buryakov would blend in,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement. Buryakov, 39, worked as a banker for Russia's Vnesheconombank, according to the complaint and the bank's website. Pictured: His LinkedIn page which details that he is a 'Deputy Representative' Each defendant was charged with acting as or helping Buryakov to act as an unregistered agent of a Russia, which carries a maximum 10-year prison term, and conspiracy. Prosecutors said the case was built on physical and electronic surveillance of dozens of meetings, including several in which Buryakov met with an FBI agent posing as a wealthy investor who hoped to develop casinos in Russia. They said Buryakov would seek information 'far outside' what a banker in his position would care about, including a list of Russian entities that might face future U.S. sanctions. Buryakov was arrested on Monday in the Bronx borough of New York City. His lawyer was not immediately available for comment. The FBI Twitter account carried the news on its page on Monday afternoon . Sporyshev and Podobnyy have not been arrested and no longer live in the United States but had diplomatic immunity while they were in the country, federal prosecutors said. 'These charges demonstrate our firm commitment to combating attempts by covert agents to illegally gather intelligence and recruit spies within the United States,' Holder said in a statement. 'We will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country - no matter how deep their cover.' 'Following our previous prosecution with the FBI of Russian spies, who were expelled from the United States in 2010 when their plan to infiltrate upper levels of U.S. business and government was revealed,' said Bharara, the new charges 'make it clear that - more than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War - Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst.'","Evgeny Buryakov, posed as an employee in the Manhattan office of a Russian bank, according to prosecutors .

"Overcome: Zane, seven, died in his sleep during last winter's floods as waters rose around Surrey home . Parents who suspect their seven-year-old son was killed by cyanide gas during last winter’s floods say authorities knew there was a risk of deadly ‘ground gas’ at their home but did not warn them. Zane Gbangbola was overcome by fumes while he slept as floodwaters rose in the basement of the house during storms in February . His parents were taken to hospital suffering from the effects of hydrogen cyanide poisoning and his father Kye has been left a paraplegic due to exposure to the gas. Now it has emerged that the Environment Agency and the local council were aware of potential risks of ground gas from an old landfill site next to the Gbangbolas’ riverside home. The Environment Agency – which is responsible for regulating waste sites and dealing with floods – even installed a gas-proof membrane at a cabin it built four years ago next door to their house, but did not warn residents about the risk. Council documents also show that as far back as 2007 planning officials knew that the ground could contain ‘harmful substances’ – but residents were only told if they applied for permission to alter their homes. The revelations are the latest twist in an eight-month battle by Kye and Nicole Gbangbola to find the truth about their son’s death. After receiving a letter of condolence from David Cameron, they met Ministers last week and will meet Liz Truss, the Environment Secretary, later this month. They have accused the police and authorities of a cover up, after Zane’s death was attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning, supposedly caused by a faulty petrol-driven pump. A pathologists’ report initially said that said the cause of death was ‘inconclusive’, but after further tests, it was changed to ‘carbon monoxide poisoning’. But the couple say that is impossible as they never used the hired pump in their house. Zane’s parents believe he must have been overcome by hydrogen cyanide released by the floods from contaminated land in an old landfill 20 yards from their home. Scientists have told The Mail on Sunday that the deadly gas – used in the Nazi death camps – could have come from the former landfill site behind the family’s home, generated by water rising through the landfill soil. Zane’s family say he would still be alive if they had been told of the danger lurking just beyond their property, a riverside home in Chertsey, Surrey. His death sparked panic in the early hours of February 8 as 17 residents were sent to a decontamination ward and warned that hydrogen cyanide had been detected at the home by firefighters. Flooded: The houses in Chertsey surrounded by flood waters close to the old landfill site (bottom left field) Tragedy: The home of Kye and Nicole Gbangbola during the floods in February where their son, seven, died . Some neighbours were told they may have only 15 minutes to live. Last night Mr Gbangbola said: ‘If we had been told the land was contaminated we would have been able to protect ourselves.’ The company director added: ‘To put down a gas membrane in their own property suggests the Environment Agency had real concerns about ground gases such as hydrogen cyanide. So why didn’t they tell anyone else?’ Inundated: The well-defended Environment Agency-owned hut next to the family's home . Last night the family’s MP, Kwasi Kwarteng, accused the EA of ‘dragging its feet’. He said: ‘If the Environment Agency had some intelligence there were gases there and used a gas membrane when they built their property, that is significant and we need to find out more information about it. ‘It is an appalling tragedy and we need some action.’ After Zane’s death, police investigations focused on a petrol-driven pump the family hired to remove floodwater from the basement. The couple insist the pump was never switched on during the flood. They say the pathologist was not told to test Zane’s blood for the presence of hydrogen cyanide – which disappears from the body within 48 hours. Pollution expert Dr Mark McKinney said: ‘There is no reason to put down a gas membrane unless there is evidence and concern about ground gases.’ Asked about the membrane at the hut, an EA spokesman said: ‘The local authority was satisfied our desktop study identified basic ground protection as entirely appropriate as a purely precautionary approach.’ In a new statement last night the Environment Agency said: 'In 2010 we built the property with standard damp-proofing protection as it's a timber structure on low-lying land. 'Our sincere sympathies continue to be with the Gbangbola family and we are cooperating with the investigation fully.' Spelthorne Council said: 'A desk-top study prepared by the Environment Agency's consultant was submitted to the Council. It recommended basic ground gas protection as an alternative to undertaking monitoring and assessment. This is common practice.' Surrey Police said: ‘We are conducting further enquiries to establish whether there is any liability or criminal offences in respect of the hire company who provided [the pump] and we have submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service.’ More than 15,000 people have signed a petition demanding the ‘Truth About Zane’ and the family has the support of celebrities including Vivienne Westwood, Emma Thompson and Peter Gabriel. Zane would have been eight on Tuesday, and his parents and their supporters are set to mark the day with a march on Spelthorne Borough Council’s offices in Staines at 1pm.

"Raid: Police have searched the home of Reverend Paul Flowers after he was filmed apparently buying hard drugs . Police have searched the home of disgraced former Co-operative Bank chairman Paul Flowers as they investigate drugs offences. West . Yorkshire Police is probing him after he was filmed allegedly buying crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. The Methodist minister led the bank for three years, which lost £700million while he was apparently taking drugs and setting up sex sessions with rent boys. In 1981 he was convicted of gross . indecency after he was caught by police performing a sex act with a . trucker in a public toilet - but he was forgiven by the church. He . also resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after . 'inappropriate but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he . used, the city council said. Police in Yorkshire have admitted they had raided his home. 'Officers executed a search warrant at an . address in Great Horton, (Bradford) as part . of an investigation into alleged drugs offences,'  a spokesman for the force. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing growing . questions over his party's links to the former bank chairman, who has . also been accused of incompetence. Co-operative Group chairman Len Wardle has already quit amid the deepening scandal. Mr Wardle brought forward his plans to retire by six months, acknowledging that he led the board that had appointed Mr Flowers. Raid: Officers last night entered the home of Rev Flowers with a forensic team after the Mail on Sunday revealed the scale of his drug taking . Investigation: West Yorkshire Police back at the home of disgraced bank boss Paul Flowers today after more revelations about his life . Tory . chairman Grant Shapps has now demanded to know when Mr Miliband and . shadow chancellor Ed Balls were aware that Mr Flowers resigned as a . councillor in Bradford after adult material was found on his computer. In . a letter, Mr Shapps challenged the Labour leader to give details of . private meetings with Mr Flowers, explain why he had been brought on to . the party's business advisory group, and return a £50,000 donation to Mr . Balls' office that he had backed. 'Will you instruct your MPs not to . accept any more money from the Co-operative Group until the current . investigation is resolved?' Mr Shapps insisted. Labour has said Mr . Flowers was 'neither influential nor important' and the 63-year-old has . been suspended from the party for bringing it into disrepute. A . source said: 'It's true that there was a private meeting with Ed in . March of this year. There were two informal dinners - three meetings . that we can find records of in the space of three years. 'This shows that Mr Flowers was neither influential nor important.' Mr Flowers lives in a modest house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85 . During . an appearance before the Commons Treasury committee earlier this month, . where Mr Flowers stumbled over the basic facts and figures relating to . the ailing bank, he was pressed on whether he had approved a £50,000 . donation to Mr Balls' from the Co-operative Group in 2011/2012 while a . member of the board. Ciaron Dodd said Paul Flowers was debauched and 'showered him with gifts' 'My recollection is that we paid for a . particular researcher to assist the shadow chancellor in the work that . he needed to do, and that we believed to be a legitimate and proper use . of resources,' he replied. A spokesman for Mr Balls said: 'The Co-op . Group, not the bank, donated £50,000 to the shadow chancellor's office . which was declared in the normal way at the time. 'Ed has never . discussed the donation with Paul Flowers. Ed's been to a few events . which Rev Flowers has also been at, but he's never had a meeting or . phone conversation with him.' Last nigh the humiliation of Paul Flowers worsened when a rent boy claimed the ousted Co-op chief hired him for sex. Ciaron Dodd, 21, said they met in plush hotel rooms paid for by the struggling bank. The . Methodist minister, who was forced to quit his £130,000 role in June, . showered him with gifts and took him for nights out to the theatre, said . Mr Dodd. The explosive allegations came as the Labour Party faced further damaging questions about its links with Flowers. Pictures . have emerged of a lavish reception hosted by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls at 10 . Downing Street for Flowers and fellow Co-op grandees while . Labour was in power. It also emerged that Labour knew two . years ago that Flowers had been forced to resign as one of the party’s . city councillors after gay porn was found on his computer. But . it appears the Co-op was not told – allowing him to continue until June . as its banking chairman, a position from which he helped to approve . massive donations to Labour and Mr Balls. Dodd, a £650-a-night escort, has backed up his claim by producing . damning messages sent by Flowers, 63, from his work email - in . which he organises drug-fuelled threesomes. Dodd said: ‘I knew what he did for a living and couldn’t believe how debauched he was. ‘Every time he saw me he knew he was risking everything – but he just didn’t seem to care. ‘He . took me to the theatre and gave me presents like chocolate and wine. I . was old enough to be his grandson but he didn’t seem to think we looked . like the odd couple.’ Prime Minister David Cameron today joked that a senior Labour MP took 'mind-altering substances' during a night out with a former bank chairman who was filmed allegedly using illegal drugs. Mr Cameron made the gag at Prime Minister's Questions after former environment minister Michael Meacher claimed inward investment to the United Kingdom was lower than in a number of Third World countries. The Prime Minister retorted Mr Meacher must have been on a night out with Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the Co-operative Bank for three years, who was filmed allegedly buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. Question: The Prime Minister offended Labour's  Michael Meacher today when he asked about investment and Mr Cameron replied: 'I can only conclude that you too have been on a night out of the town with Reverend Flowers . In a question to Mr Cameron, the MP for Oldham West and Royton said: 'Are you aware that according to the Economist, Britain is now 159th lowest in the world in terms of business investment, just behind Mali, Paraguay and Guatemala. 'Can you tell the House that when, under your esteemed leadership and that of the Chancellor, Britain can expect to catch up with Mali?' Mr Cameron replied: 'I can only conclude that you too have been on a night out of the town with Reverend Flowers (right) and that mind-altering substances have taken effect. 'The fact is that in the first six months of this year, Britain has received more inward investment than in any other country anywhere in the world.' The joke angered Mr Meacher, who raised a point of order at the end of Prime Minister's Questions. Turning to Speaker John Bercow, he said: 'As you would have heard, and as everyone else in the House heard, I raised a perfectly reasonable question, which was based on clear evidence as I indicated. 'Is it parliamentary for the Prime Minister to respond by accusing (me) of sounding as if (I) had been taking mind-altering substances? I want to ask whether it is parliamentary to use such an unjustifiable, rude and offensive phrase?' Mr Cameron replied: 'I completely respect you and the important question you asked which I tried to answer with the point about inward investment in to Britain. 'I made a light-hearted remark. If it caused any offence, then I will happily withdraw it. I think it is very important that we can have a little bit of light-hearted banter and a sense of humour on all sides.' Earlier, Mr Cameron said that Chancellor George Osborne is to have talks with financial regulators on a possible inquiry into the troubles of the bank. Mr Cameron told the House of Commons that there were 'a lot of questions that have to be answered' about the appointment of former bank chairman Mr Flowers. West Yorkshire Police have searched the home of Mr Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the bank for three years, after he was filmed allegedly buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. Co-operative Group chairman Len Wardle has already quit amid the deepening scandal, which came after the ailing bank had to be bailed out by hedge funds after getting into financial difficulties. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron told MPs: 'The Chancellor will be discussing with the regulators what is the appropriate form of inquiry to get to the bottom of what went wrong here. 'But there are clearly a lot of questions that have to be answered. Why was Rev Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren't alarm bells ringing earlier?'","Reverend Paul Flowers filmed trying to buy crack cocaine and crystal meth .

"Roboticists might create machines that show their intentions, but a math model says emotional machines like Marvin the android from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (pictured) won't exist . The prospect of robot overlords, friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years. But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist. This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims. A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness. He believes that integrated information can't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds, because the brain contextualises information. For example, when we see a red triangle our brains don't register the shape as a colourless triangle plus a shapeless coloured area, New Scientist reported. Instead we see it as a whole - a red triangle, we understand the 'wider picture'. Phil Maguire of the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, said that a computational device called the XOR logic gate relies on predicting outcomes using a combination of two inputs, which require a loss of information. ‘You have to put in two bits and you get one out. If the brain integrated information in this fashion, it would have to be continuously haemorrhaging information.’ His team has defined integration In terms of how tricky it is to modify information. It is easy enough for machines to edit a collection of individual images, but memories are composed of a bank of intertwined images and experiences and cannot be altered in the same way. Unrequited love: Consciousness cannot be created in physical machines in finite time using limited memory as this is beyond scientists' abilities. The study suggests that humans will not find friendship with a robot (pictured left and right) but are unlikely to be made their slaves either . A mathematical framework for consciousness developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison says that the ability to integrate information is a main feature of consciousness. He believes that integrated information cannot be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds, because the brain contextualises information. For example, when we see a red triangle our brains so not register the shape as a colourless triangle plus a shapeless coloured area. Consciousness cannot be created in a physical machines in finite time using limited memory, according to another expert who thinks robots will never be able to feel emotions like humans. The researchers have used mathematics to show that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly. Therefore, if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans. Professor Maguire says that consciousness cannot be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory. ‘It doesn't necessarily mean that there is some magic going on in the brain that involves some forces that can't be explained physically. It is just so complex that it's beyond our abilities to reverse it and decompose it,’ he said. His research may mean that lonely humans will not find love with a robot, they are unlikely to be made their slaves either.","Computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they can't be conscious feel emotion, one expert claims .

"The married chief executive of the Co-op Bank has been conducting a secret affair with a colleague 11 years his junior – threatening to plunge the troubled institution into a new crisis. Niall Booker, 55, the Co-op’s £2.9 million-a-year boss, was last night warned he may have to resign over the affair. His lover, Samantha Davenport, is the bank’s ‘Talent Director’ who plays a key role in selecting the very board members – and chairman – who are supposed to hold him to account. The affair, which began in February, will cause friction at the highest levels of the ‘ethical’ bank as it tries to recover from the double blow of its near financial collapse and the drugs and sex scandal of former chairman Paul Flowers, exposed by The Mail on Sunday last year. Scroll down for video . Lovers: Co-op Bank chief Niall Booker and fellow executive Samantha Davenport . Mr Booker and Ms Davenport are believed to have carried on their relationship in Manchester, home of the Co-op’s HQ, and in London, where they both live, and it is now an ‘open secret’ among colleagues. Ms Davenport, who is No 2 in the Co-op’s human resources department, is understood to command a salary well into six figures. She has previously headed recruitment at Lloyds and Barclays banks. A Co-op spokesman confirmed she plays a role in selecting not only the board members but also the chairman. Last Friday, Mr Booker who recently left his wife Valerie, was seen hand-in-hand with his lover after they emerged from Ms Davenport’s West London home, having apparently skipped work for the morning. It is understood that the blonde mother of three is divorced. While their colleagues were at work, they were seen emerging just after 2.30pm from the £850,000 Hammersmith townhouse where she lives with her three children aged 11, ten and seven. It is just a 20-minute drive from Mr Booker’s £3.5 million marital home in fashionable Primrose Hill. Holding hands like lovelorn teenagers, they hailed a black cab and headed across London to the Co-op office near St Paul’s Cathedral. Hand in hand: Niall Booker and Samantha Davenport in a very public display of affection . Even in flat heels, the statuesque Ms Davenport is several inches taller than balding, portly Mr Booker, and at one point she put an arm around his shoulders while he held her waist. Last night, the bank’s chairman Richard Pym refused to answer The Mail on Sunday’s questions, but issued a statement saying only: ‘Niall is doing a fantastic job.’ The revelation of the affair comes just weeks before the Co-op stages a multi-million-pound relaunch of its ethical ‘core values’ with a TV and billboard advertising campaign. Ironically, father-of-two Mr Booker – hired to save the bank – recently bemoaned the fact that 300 savers a day deserted it in the first six months of this year due to the ‘hurricane of negative publicity’. Presenting a survey of 73,000 customers’ views, he announced: ‘Values and ethics sit at the very heart of the Co-operative Bank and are what makes us different.’ Family man: Niall Booker, sons Fergus and Callum and wife Valerie, from whom he recently separated . In an article for The Guardian, he even compared himself to the famous fictional bank manager of Walmington-on-Sea, declaring: ‘At a time when the BBC is bringing back Dad’s Army, Captain Mainwaring… should make a return to banking.’ But staff at the Co-op fear Mr Booker’s conduct is in breach of its ‘code of governance’ because of the particular recruitment role played by Ms Davenport. The head-hunter is currently actively involved in selecting candidates to succeed the bank’s retiring chairman Richard Pym – Mr Booker’s boss, and the successor to disastrous ‘Crystal Methodist’ Paul Flowers. She has also drawn up shortlists for several other seats on the board, whose members will now face mounting pressure to show they are willing to hold senior executives to account on their personal conduct and that the bank’s ethics are not just a veneer. On its website, the bank declares that the chief executive is expected to: ‘Demonstrate ethical leadership and promote the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance throughout the Bank.’ Last night, senior Tory MP Brian Binley – himself a former Co-op Bank clerk – warned Mr Booker might have to resign. He said: ‘If these reports are correct, at the very least, Mr Booker should explain himself to the Co-op board. If he cannot do so satisfactorily, he may have to consider his position.’ The MP added that when he was a clerk, he had been proud to work for a ‘very ethically correct operation’, but was ‘deeply saddened’ over recent events at the bank. Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso, a member of the Commons Treasury Committee, said: ‘Impeccable corporate governance is imperative at the Co-op Bank. Anything other than that would be wholly unacceptable.’ A Co-op spokesman said: ‘Niall Booker had previously advised the company of the situation and appropriate steps are being taken to manage any potential conflict of interest.’ While the bank tried to play down the significance of Ms Davenport’s role in the recruitment of directors and the chairman, a source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She reviews applications, screens candidates and conducts first interviews. She also manages regulatory approval and makes the offer and negotiates the packages they are offered.’ The scandal is just the latest crisis to hit the ailing Co-op – which has bankrolled the Labour Party in the past. The bank’s troubles stem from its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 2009 which, along with other poor decisions, landed it with £1.9 billion black hole in its finances. London base: Mr Booker (left) took a taxi with Ms Davenport to the Co-op Bank's office in the City (right) The shortfall scuppered its plans to take over 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group and prompted scrutiny from City regulators. Under questioning by MPs the bank’s former chairman Paul Flowers displayed startling ignorance of its affairs, a scandal compounded when The Mail on Sunday revealed he had been using hard drugs and hiring rent boys. Last year the bank’s owner, Co-operative Group, was forced to hand over control to creditors to help wipe out its debts. Co-op Group now owns just 20 per cent of the bank. Mr Booker was parachuted in last June as part of a new team assembled by Co-op Group boss Euan Sutherland, who in turn quit in March this year after details of his £6.6 million two-year pay deal were leaked. Mr Booker’s own salary is £1.2 million, but he pockets a further £1.7 million a year ‘retention’ as long as the bank meets modest targets. But Mr Booker, a career banker who has worked in the Middle East, India and the United States, is said by insiders to have little truck with the Co-op’s ethical ethos which prevents it investing in the arms trade or the tobacco industry. ‘He’s only interested in the money,’ said one source. ‘He views the traditional values of the Co-op with ill-disguised contempt.’ Former HSBC executive Mr Booker is estranged from his wife and lawyers have been consulted over divorce proceedings, according to a source. Pictures: Philip Ide . Additional reporting: Amanda Perthen . An embarrassing conflict of interests that sets alarm bells ringing... AGAIN . COMMENT by SIMON WATKINS, CITY EDITOR . The Co-operative Bank has once again been embarrassed by the private life of a senior director. Niall Booker’s relationship with a senior colleague has apparently been an open secret at the bank – the subject of whispering in executive corridors. His relationship raises obvious questions about governance. Samantha Davenport, as ‘Talent Director’, plays a role in recruiting senior figures. Values: Mr Booker was hired to save the troubled bank that is proud of its ethics . The bank says it is taking steps to address any potential conflict of interest. This is quite right, though it does of course confirm that such conflicts could exist. Co-op Bank is only just dragging itself back from near financial collapse – and struggling to recover from the scandal of its drug-taking former chairman Paul Flowers. The bank’s finances stabilised, but only after its former owner, Co-operative Group, was forced to hand control to creditors including a clutch of US hedge funds. But Co-op Bank still lost £76 million in the first half of this year, Booker himself admitted it was still losing customers thanks to its tarnished reputation. Exclusive: How we revealed Paul Flowers' drug and rent-boy scandal . Meanwhile, as recently as last week, Booker and Davenport were indulging their relationship during what most people might regard as office hours. Former HSBC man Booker is one of a number of experienced City figures who have joined the Co-op Bank or the Co-op Group, as part of a bid to refresh both organisations. It has proved a tricky place for many of them. Booker has already faced scrutiny over his pay package, which at £2.9 million was seen as at odds with the Co-op ethos. Euan Sutherland quit as chief executive at Co-op Group earlier this year, partly in anger at the way his £6.6 million two-year pay deal had been leaked, but also enraged by the amateurish and bitter politicking culture. Booker’s affair with a colleague and his potential distraction from the serious job in hand would raise questions at any company. At the Co-op Bank, struggling to shake off financial crisis and recover its reputation for probity and ethics, it should set alarm bells ringing.","£2.9m-a-year boss Niall Booker, 55, warned he may have to resign over affair .

"Falklands veteran, Will Kevans, 51, speaking to Prince Harry about his work at the exhibition, where he revealed he preferred comics to books . Prince Harry has revealed that he 'loves' comics and would choose them over books after speaking with a Falklands veteran. The royal, who has an A Level in art, made the admission to cartoonist and former Welsh Guardsman, Will Kevans, following the opening of the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey. The confession comes amid speculation that Harry, 30, a Captain in the Household Cavalry, might return to flying Apaches after he finishes his current posting in a desk job. He told Mr Kevans, 51, who also draws Dennis the Menace for the BBC cartoon series: 'I don't read many books but I love comics.' The veteran - now a member of the Army Arts Society - had been attending an exhibition which coincided with the ceremony in London on Thursday to showcase his drawings. 'I had no idea Prince Harry would be attending and it was a real surprise,' said Mr Kevans, who went out to the Falklands on the QE2 liner in 1982. After leaving the army in 1985, Mr Kevans joined the military arts group, which was set up after the conflict to encourage soldiers to develop their skills and deal with the psychological trauma of battle. He told MailOnline that drawing cartoons was something he was always passionate about. 'When I was at school I wasn't very academic and I was always drawing cartoons or caricatures of my teachers - the army was something that I needed.' His work has included drawing characters for children's cartoon programmes as well as designing games including the Scooby Doo computer game. In recent years he has turned his hand to drawing war-related cartoons and decided to create a book that depicted his experiences of being in the Welsh Guards during the Falklands War. 'It's a graphic novel which has taken two and a half years and was quite emotional as it was the first time I had contacted some of the guys I worked with for about 30 odd years,' said Mr Kevans, whose company was attached to 40 Commando. He was at the exhibition with a copy of his book and several other pieces of his artwork, including a scaled down version of a First World War scene he had depicted. Scroll down for video .

Mr Kevans said he was surprised to see the royal at the exhibition and pleased he connected with the work . It was this that caught the prince's eye as he strolled over to have a chat with Mr Kevans. 'He came over and asked how much it was and I said ""£150 but I will do you a discount"" and he laughed.' The prince also had a look at his book 'My Life In Pieces: The Falklands War' and was impressed by his drawings. 'I think it struck a nerve with Harry - he's a young lad and a lot of us were still reading comic books when we went off to war so I think people can relate to it. 'My style is a bit Dennis the Menace so when I finished the book I wasn't sure how it would be received but it seems to have gone down very well.' Will Kevans (pictured centre with his arms folded) and his army colleagues before the Falklands War in 1982 . One of the drawings of the ships sailed by the Welsh Guardsmen during the war by the artist, who also draws Dennis the Menace for the BBC cartoon series and Scooby Doo for the computer game . Mr Kevans said creating the book was an emotional experience after he contacted fellow veterans he hadn't spoken with for over 30 years . The book tells the story of a group of Welsh Guards 'thrown into the unknown and the untold tales from Two Company’s advance on the mainland towards Port Stanley' Mr Kevans hopes that the book will help other veterans to overcome psychological trauma that it can cause . The book 'struck a nerve with Prince Harry' when he viewed at the exhibition. The artists had not been expecting the royal guest and Mr Kevans said he was 'very surprised' Will Kevans in his Welsh Guards uniform in the early 1980s while he was a serving soldier . He added: 'Harry also spotted a smaller drawing I had done of the Welsh Guard on RFA Sir Galahad and we had a chat about that. I was really pleased Prince Harry connected with it. 'I told him about an incident that happened to us where we saw one of our soldiers pass away and we chatted about his regiment, The Blues and Royals, which are very closely connected to the Welsh Guards.' Mr Kevans, who is also a singer-songwriter, said it was wife that was the driving force behind the book and feels it has been a form of therapy. 'I felt now was the time to do it. We're getting older, most of us are in our fifties and some have passed away. 'It's almost normalised it [the war] now. There is a lot of humour in the book and I hope that it will help people deal with it.' A percentage of the book sales are being donated to Combat Stress and SAMA Wales (South Atlantic Medal Association, Welsh Branch) and Mr Kevans has already raised almost £4,000. Prince Harry, who quit the Army Air Corps in January for a desk job organising military events including the Invictus Games for wounded warriors, has been speaking to veterans at various events over the last week. He told Flight Sergeant Lee Renard, a veteran of three tours of duty in Iraq and 11 in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2014, at a reception at Buckingham Palace that he 'enjoyed flying and missed it'. Another Afghanistan veteran, Flight Lieutenant Lance Levin, a Chinook helicopter pilot from 27 Squadron, RAF Odiham, said: 'He said he enjoys his flying and would like to return at some point.' However, royal sources have so far suggested that is unlikely, although they have not ruled out the fourth in line to the throne doing some other role involving flying.","Prince Harry made the admission to cartoonist and veteran Will Kevans .

"In a new interview, the Navy SEAL who claims he shot and killed Osama Bin Laden is saying that it doesn't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist. 'The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am The Shooter,' O'Neill said. 'Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.' Scroll down for video . What's done is done: Bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill (above) said in an interview it doesn't matter who killed Osama, just that he is dead . Under fire: This comes as many are attacking O'Neill for making his identity as a Navy SEAL public . This was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews O'Neill had with journalist Alex Quade that were aired on Friday's AC360. He also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow SEALs did not think they would make it out alive after raiding bin Laden's hideout. 'Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,' O'Neill said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them. '(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.' Down: O'Neill says of what happened, that anyone who questions him can only ask one other person what really happened, Osama bin Laden (above), and he's dead . Site: O'Neill also revealed that he and his fellow Navy SEALs did not think they would return alive after the raid on bin Laden's hideout (above) O'Neill's move to go public has been met with mixed response, and heavily riticzed among his fellow SEALs. He sees it differently however, pointing out how films like Captain Phillips and Zero Dark Thirty both made his work very public, and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents. 'Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,' he said. 'I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.' Public guy: O'Neill seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews, saying he doesn't care if people think he is 'full of s***' As for those who question him, he is not letting it bother him. 'Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,' he said. 'You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.'","Rober O'Neill, the Navy SEAL who claims he shot and killed Osama bin Laden, is saying he does not care if people believe he killed the terrorist .

"Inventor Kenneth Reiner's ideas for his Los Angeles mansion may have been massive - but unfortunately his wallet wasn't big enough to match them. The stunning, futuristic home, which has since featured in movies and music videos, has gone on the market for $7.5 million - five decades after it helped bankrupt Reiner. The industrialist, who made a small fortune designing self-locking aircraft nuts and women's hair grips in the mid-20th century, set no budget for the 4,720 sq ft property, known as 'Silvertop'. But while he anticipated it would cost him around $75,000 to build, the actual total topped $1 million. Scroll down for video . Stunning: 'Silvertop' was built between 1957 and 1976 and is now on the market for $7.5 million . Futuristic: In 1960, the Evening Post called it 'the darnedest house ever seen around Southern California' Picturesque: The mansion, which overlooks the Silver Lake Reservoir, had the first ever infinity pool . Breathtaking: The pool was the work of original owner, inventor Kenneth Reiner, and designer John Lautner . Today, . beneath its curved roof, sit three bedrooms, four bathrooms, a library, . study, carport and darkroom, as well as a guest house, tennis court, . gardens and the first-ever infinity pool. Patios and gardens give views over the San Gabriel Mountains, Silver Lake, Downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood Sign in the Santa Monica Mountains and West to the Ocean, according to the listing with Crosby Doe Associates. Reiner also called for gadgets straight out of a Bond movie, including a dining table with a hydraulic pedestal that was lowered for cocktails and elevated for meals, his L.A. Times obituary said. Among other gadgets and quirky designs - invented by Reiner or architect John Lautner - was a cantilevered driveway that the city feared would not safely hold a car. Interior: The 4,720 square foot home has three bedrooms and four bathrooms amid a sleek design . Futuristic: In the 50s, Reiner asked for designs including hidden buttons in the wall and moving furniture . Smart: Reiner placed no budget on his designs, including these walls that open to reveal the view . Simple: After Reiner hit money troubles it sat empty for years until new owners bought it in 1974 . Spacious: The guest house has an open plan living and dining area, as well as one bedroom and bathroom . Light: In 1974, a new family took over the property and worked with the same designer to finish it . Publications at the time also expressed awe at the swimming pool, which was 'spookily engineered so there seems to be no rim, just water to the edge,' according to Life magazine in 1962. In 1960, the Saturday Evening Post called Silvertop 'the darnedest house ever seen around Southern California', Yahoo! Homes reported. Despite the money he poured in to the structure, Reiner and his family never got to live in it. 'In the end... the extravagance of Silvertop was Reiner's undoing,' his obituary read. He had hoped to spend $75,000 on it, but he didn't put any limitations on Lautner and costs soared. Reiner and a business partner formed a corporation to support Lautner's office so he could work full time on the house - but the partner eventually sued Reiner, and he lost the home in bankruptcy. Passageways: The spacious home also has a library inside, as well as a study and darkroom . Views: The home looks over the San Gabriel Mountains, the Hollywood Sign and West to the Ocean . Privacy: Pictured, the glass facade and terrace of Silvertop, which also has a carport and tennis court . On top of the world: The stunning views include the Hollywood sign  in the Santa Monica Mountains . 'I thought . he would be devastated,' Guy Zebert, the original project architect, . told the L.A. Times. 'But he didn't show it too much. He just kept on . moving.' Afterwards, Reiner started a new beauty and barber supplies business, and his dream home was bought by the Burchill family in 1974. They finished the design with Lautner's help. In the 1980s, the movie Less Than Zero was filmed at the property, and music videos have also been set there, the Wall Street Journal reported. The family has stayed at the property since buying it in 1974, but Mary Burchill Maxson explained they wanted to sell after the death of her father. Her mother, who is in her 90s, wants to move closer to her children. 'They had great fun, and that is why they stayed so long,' she said.

"More than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls held hostage in Nigeria came agonisingly close to freedom before government officials called off a deal to swap them for jailed Islamist terror suspects, The Mail on Sunday has been told. A Nigerian journalist trusted by both the government and extremists from Boko Haram acted as go-between, risking his life on a one-man mission to enter the gunmen’s lair and broker an agreement, according to security sources. But last Saturday, at the 11th hour, officials scrapped the exchange in a telephone call from a crisis summit in Paris where Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan met foreign ministers including those from Britain, the United States, France and Israel. Broken deal: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau (left) is said to be enraged by the U-turn after President Goodluck Jonathan (right) agreed that deals should not be struck with terrorists at a summit in Paris . It was agreed there that no deals should be struck with terrorists and that force should instead be used against them. The U-turn is said to have enraged Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau. Insiders believe that the cancellation of last Saturday’s plan and the ensuing stand-off now puts the girls’ lives in even greater danger. An intelligence source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The next video we see from the terrorists could show the girls being killed one by one.’ Sources in the Nigerian capital Abuja described how Shekau had agreed to bring the girls out of their forest camps in the remote north-east of the country in the early morning and take them to a safe location for the prisoner swap. ‘They would have been dropped off in a village, one group at a time, and left there while their kidnappers disappeared. There was to be a signal to a mediator at another location to bring in the prisoners,’ sources said. Danger: The move has sparked fears that the 200 schoolgirls are now in even greater danger than before . About 2,000 Boko Haram members are currently detained. One hundred non-combatant, low-level sympathisers were to be freed and the two groups brought together in a convoy of buses accompanied by a hand-picked go-between, respected Nigerian journalist Ahmad Salkida. The plan had been agreed in tortuous negotiations in response to worldwide outrage over a night-time raid on a school in the town of Chibok on April 14 when the girls were abducted from their dormitories. Mr Salkida was born in the north-eastern state of Borno, where Boko Haram originated. He has known its leaders all his life and has unprecedented access. He has been arrested  on several occasions accused of being a Boko Haram sympathiser, and he fled with his family to Dubai two years ago. But two weeks ago, he was summoned out of exile by President Jonathan’s aides. He initially feared he might face arrest, but was then given a letter of indemnity signed by the president when he flew to Nigeria. President Jonathan met with the world's foreign ministers to discuss the crisis and a potential move forward . Sources said Mr Salkida was able to travel by taxi to the group’s forest camp to talk to Shekau two weeks ago. ‘His mission was secretive and dangerous,’ they said. ‘He is probably the only civilian with access to Shekau. There is trust between them and Salkida had only one aim – to get the schoolgirls out. ‘He reported afterwards that the group of girls he saw were alive and well, and being adequately fed and sheltered. They told him all they wanted was to go home.’ Salkida’s mission was complicated by the chaos surrounding the Nigerian government’s pronouncements about negotiations with the terrorist group. Shekau has released two shocking videos showing the girls dressed in hijabs and reciting verses from the Koran. His movement is violently opposed to Westernisation. Wearing combat fatigues and brandishing an AK-47 rifle, he has demanded the release of his members from prisons. Government spokesman Reuben Abati said yesterday: ‘I am not aware of an attempted rescue plan taking place last week.’","Officials scrapped exchange in telephone call from crisis summit in Paris .

"Russia's anti-gay stance was thrown into confusion today by speculation that fake lesbian pop duo tATu will be the surprise performers at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. The line-up for the February 7 opening ceremony is a closely guarded secret, but flame-haired singer Lena Katina yesterday tweeted 'we have been invited to take part at the Sochi Olympics'. The announcement follows worldwide criticism of Russia over recently passed laws held to be discriminatory against gays. Not schoolgirls any more: A picture from tATu's social media site shows the pair posing next to a Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics photo. There is speculation that the controversial faux lesbian pop duo could perform there . Katina and her bandmate Yulia Volkova were just teenagers when they burst into worldwide musical superstardom with their critically acclaimed 2003 single All The Things She Had. But the duo also courted controversy with a risque music video which showed them standing in the rain and sharing a passionate kiss while dressed in revealing school uniform-like outfits. Children's groups in Britain reacted with outrage amid claims their act was a marketing stunt promoting homosexuality among vulnerable teenagers. So speculation that tATu will be one of the acts at Sochi comes as a surprise with Russia currently mired in controversy after new laws were passed in the country which ban homosexual 'propaganda' to children. The legislation is drawn so widely that there are fears it could trap gay visitors or competitors in Sochi - or even tATu themselves. Mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, was quoted this week saying there are no gay people in his Black Sea resort. Earlier Putin said gay people could feel 'relaxed' about attending the Sochi Olympics but they should 'leave children alone please'. But still cuddling up: Speculation that tATu will be one of the acts at Sochi is ironic with Russia currently mired in controversy after new laws were passed in the country which ban homosexual 'propaganda' to children . However, the appearance of tATu at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony is not yet confirmed. Katina, now 29, later withdrew her post announcing their appearance, replacing it with a message stating: 'All statements will be made at the right moment. As it turned out, this was not yet the right moment.' Despite this, a number of major news websites reported that the controversial duo will be on stage in Sochi. 'Lena Katina and Yulia Volkova from tATu will be singing at Sochi Olympics opening ceremony,' stated news outlet gazeta.ru. Montages of Katina and Volkova, 28, posing with the Olympic symbol were posted on the group's social network site, but there were also claims it could be a publicity stunt. Katina also criticised the organisers for 'disgustingly bad organisation'. She ranted: 'They treat artists like **it.' Controversial: A frame of the music video for All The Things She Had which showed Katina and Volkova standing in the rain and sharing a passionate kiss while dressed in revealing school uniform-like outfits . Although the pair are now both grown up women in their late 20s, images of Katina and Volkova still show them posing as schoolgirls. Despite officially splitting in 2011, the duo recently performed together. Volkova is reported to be currently in Moscow having undergone Botox treatment in her lips. She has two children - a daughter Viktoria, aged 9, and son Samir, 6 - from two marriages. Katina wed Slovenian musician Sasho Kuzmanovich in August last year. Russian Olympic chiefs declined to comment on any role for tATu.","Ironically, children's groups in Britain once accused the pop duo of promoting homosexuality among teenagers ."
"In what’s been dubbed a cross between a GoPro and a quadcopter, physics researchers have designed the world's first wearable drone. Called Nixie, the drone folds up and attaches to a wrist strap. When the wearer wants it to start filming, they press a button and the drone unfolds and flies overhead, tracking their movements using motion sensors. Scroll down for video . The Nixie wearable drone was created by researchers at Stanford University and is a finalist in Intel’s annual Make It Wearable competition. Nixie is a drone, worn on the wrist (concept illustrated) and expands at the touch of a button. The team has created a prototype version and recently received $50,000 (£30,700) in funding . Last week, Polaroid and HTC both released details about handheld devices set to rival GoPro. The former is planning to release the Polaroid Cube - a tiny action camera with a square design. And a teaser video and leaked images reveal that HTC is planning to release a similar device of its own, in the shape of a toy periscope. The Polaroid Cube will be available for £89 ($99.99) from 1 October. HTC's camera is due to launch next month. The drone then returns to the wearer’s wrist, which could be controlled using a timer, or summoned using gestures. It was developed by Dr Christoph Kohstall, a physics researcher at Stanford University, with colleagues Jelena Jovanovic and Michael Niedermayr. And the concept is a finalist in Intel’s annual Make It Wearable competition. As a result, the team has been awarded $50,000 (£30,700) to help make it a reality. In addition to the prize money, all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. Dr Christoph Kohstall has also created an early prototype, which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year. The winner of Intel’s competition will be announced on 3 November. It is unknown when the Nixie will go on sale, and how much it will retail for, but MailOnline has contacted the company for more information. When the wearer wants it to start filming, they press a button and the drone unfolds (illustrated) and flies overhead, tracking their movements using motion sensors. The drone then returns to the wearer’s wrist, which could be controlled using a timer, or summoned using gestures . The Nixie drone is a cross between a GoPro action camera (Hero4 pictured left) and a traditional quadcopter (stock image pictured right) Other finalists include the Vumbl sports and activity necklace, a wrist-worn air conditioning unit, and a production glove. Make It Wearable is a year-long contest, open to students over the age of 13, designers, engineers, and makers. Earlier this year, Helio Aerospace Industries unveiled the first 'pet' drone that automatically follows its owner - and could change the way sports are filmed. Stanford University and physics researcher Dr Christoph Kohstall has also created an early prototype, (pictured) which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year. It is unknown when the Nixie will go on sale, and how much it will retail for, but MailOnline has contacted the firm for more information . In addition to the prize money, all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. The winner of Intel’s competition will be announced on 3 November. This illustration reveals where the camera on the Nixie drone is positioned . It is not wearable, like Nixie, but the Airdog drone can be fitted with a GoPro camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports, tracking everything from skateboarders to BMX riders. AirDog tracks and follow users and their trajectory, and has a flight time of up to 15 minutes. It can also reach speeds of 40mph (64km/h). To use AirDog, a programmable remote is strapped to the wrist or helmet, and it is likely to retail for $995 (£612). Earlier today, GoPro unveiled its latest models. The Hero4 models are available in black for £369 ($499), and silver for £289 ($399) The black model includes 1080p120 video capture,  and the silver model has a built-in touchscreen. GoPro also introduced an entry-level model, called Hero, for £99.99 ($129). The new line go on sale 5 October.","The Nixie wearable drone was created by researchers at Stanford University .

"From the terrifying Bird Dung Spider to a delicate Mirror Spider whose abdomen glitters like a disco ball, a photographer has got up close and personal with arachnids living on Singapore’s 64 islands to capture them in all their Technicolor glory. Nicky Bay used macro photography to make sure every tiny detail of the mini beasts were documented from the astoundingly long horns of the Long Horned Orb Weaver to the menacing jaws of the Ant Mimic Jumping Spider and mesmerising almost human-like eyes of the Net-Casting Ogre Spider that weaves a web between its front legs to throw at unsuspecting prey. While some people might be afraid by these arachnids, Mr Bay's photos show the incredible tactics used by spiders to hide and hunt as well as stand out and mimic less-tasty insects. The Mirror Spider is a member of theTheridiidae family and has shiny, reflective patches  on its abdomen that might be composed of guanine crystals, which have been found to be a source of colour on some  spiders' bodies . The Mirror Spider lives in Singapore and the silvery tiles on its abdomen expand to make its body appear completely silver when it is at rest (pictured) and apparently shrink when it is on the move or scared, according to the photographer . Singapore is known for being an urban jungle, but its tropical climate is also home to a host of species of spiders and insects that thrive in the warm and moist environment. Writing on his blog, Mr Bay said: 'Every year, I make a few trips to the . tropical rainforests in the region as they certainly have a different . diversity of critters compared to the local ones.' He started photographing spiders in the summer of 2008 after getting his first high-end camera - a Nikon D80 and a macro lens, the Tamron 90mm. While he subsequently upgraded to a better lens he mixes up his set-up but has now reverted to using his first lens around 99 per cent of the time. The Bird Dung Spider looks like a bird dropping by day but by night, it constructs a large silk structure, lined with sticky droplets, to catch prey . It has an armoured abdomen and under UV light glows a brilliant blue . Mr Bay almost always uses a handheld set-up to get close to the spiders, but switches to using a tripod for specific subjects. He said: 'Shooting handheld allows me to keep more than 3 . times as many shots as I would normally have if I shot on a tripod...as there is no perfect macro setup, I change my . flash setup every now and then.' He has studied the movement and markings of the Mirror Spider, a member of the Theridiidae family, which has shiny, reflective patches on its abdomen, which might be composed of guanine crystals, that have been found to be a source of colour on some spiders' bodies, Colossal reported. As its name suggests he Ladybird Mimic deliberately looks like the spotty insect in a bid to make predators believe that it also tastes foul . The Ant Mimic Jumping Spider looks like a red weaver ant and has a slimmer abdomen than most spiders. It also has a fake 'waist' so that it looks like it has three parts (tagmata) of its body like a real ant and waves its front pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant's antennae . They are commonly known in Singapore . as 'sequined' spiders and Mr Bay has noted that the sliver tiles on the . spider's abdomen appear to shrink when it is scared or angry to show its . 'real' body. The reflective tiles expand to make its body appear completely silver when it . is at rest and apparently shrink when it is on the move, he said.

The spider even waves its front . pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant's antennae, which has . the added bonus of making it look like it has six legs. The . spiders have evolved patches of colour around one of their pairs of . eyes, which makes them look like they have two compound eyes, rather than . eight simple eyes like most other spiders. Their bodies are covered with tiny reflective hairs so they look like the shiny bodies of ants. The Long Horned Orb Weaver has strikingly long horns, although its is not known why they have evolved this way . The Net-Casting Ogre-Face Spider has front-facing, almost human-esque eyes, but while she might look relatively friendly, the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs and throws it at prey . Ant-mimicking . spiders can behave more like ants than spiders too by moving in a . zig-zag pattern and contrary to their name, Ant Mimic Jumping spiders . actually avoid jumping so not to blow their cover. Biologists . believe they go to such lengths in a bid to avoid being eaten by . predators who hunt by sight, including birds, lizards and larger . spiders.

Mr Bay almost always uses a handheld set-up with his camera equipped with a macro lens and home-made lighting to get close to the spiders and other insects (pictured), but switches to using a tripod for specific subjects . His detailed photographic method can capture tiny creatures such as these Wide-Jawed Viciria Spiderlings that have neon yellow bodies . The Net-Casting Ogre-Face Spider has front-facing, almost human-esque eyes. While it might seem at first-glance that the spider only has two eyes, its four smaller ones are positioned very close by. But while she might look relatively friendly, the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs. Once the trap is set, she waits for prey and then hurls the net, and herself at it in a terrifying attack. The spider belongs to the Deinopidae family, which stretches their webs and releases them to trap prey- but most of the family does not actively move the web once they are in place.","Photographer Nicky Bay used a macro lens to capture details of spiders living on the islands off Singapore .
