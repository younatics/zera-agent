Eating the fruit every few hours helps keep the mother's blood sugar levels even . A mother-of-two who has been plagued by migraines for almost 20 years says she has been cured after snacking on bananas. Lisa Poyner, 38, used to suffer episodes that left her bed ridden for days at a time, and tried out dozens of medications to try and relieve her condition. But she realised she could head off attacks if she snacked on the fruit as soon as she felt the symptoms coming on. Mrs Poyner said: 'I had been prescribed all kinds of . medication before, but nothing ever worked as well as just making sure I . eat every couple of hours. 'Bananas are handy as they're healthy, . and good sustenance, so if I feel an attack about to strike, I just grab . one straight away. 'I don't even really like . bananas very much.' The supermarket worker from Worthing, West Sussex, now has 'banana breaks' to help her cope. 'I get my banana breaks every couple of hours, and all my colleagues are really understanding,' she said. 'I know that if I feel a migraine coming on, or start to feel a bit spaced out, I can just stop and grab something to eat.' She said it's important that she tackles a migraine before it becomes full-blown. 'If I suffer a full-on attack it leaves me completely immobile. I can lose my vision and my arms and legs go numb. 'I had been prescribed all kinds of medication before, but nothing ever worked as well as just making sure I eat every couple of hours. 'Bananas are handy as they're healthy, and good sustenance, so if I feel an attack about to strike, I just grab one straight away.' Lisa began to suffer with severe headaches while in her teenage years - but when she gave birth to her sons, Isaac, and Austin, in her late 20s, they got much worse. Mrs Poyner said: 'My vision blurs, or disappears completely, and I get a tingling sensation in my arms or legs. 'My head feels as though it will burst open - as though it's about to explode. At my worst, I was getting them two or three times a week. 'So many people don't understand how bad they are. People say to me , ""Oh, I get terrible headaches too"" - but this is not just a headache. 'I've been back and forth to the doctors for more than 20 years, trying to find what triggers them.' Lisa with her sons Austin (left) and Isaac: She works at a supermarket that allows her to take regular banana breaks . Then the mother-of-two realised they usually came on when she was hungry. Eating carbohydrates, such as a banana, helped to stave off symptoms by keeping blood sugar levels even. 'I was terrified of suffering a migraine when I was alone with my children, especially when they were young, so I made sure I always had something substantial to eat. 'When my children were young I could never imagine going back to work, as I needed a job where I can eat whenever I need to. 'I've been working on a supermarket checkout for the last six months, and my employers are brilliant. 'It might seem a bit weird to carry bananas round with me, but it's helped me to live as close to a normal life as possible.' A spokesperson for the Migraine Trust said: 'Complex migraines are those where symptoms are generally visual disturbances - zigzag lines, sparkles and stars, flashing lights and 'holes' in the vision- that some people have before the migraine headache. 'Some people have migraine aura symptoms that include feeling of 'pins and needles' , tingling , numbness and weakness on one side of the body and speech problems can also occur. Migraine aura symptoms are usually short-lived, lasting up to an hour.' For more information, visit migrainetrust.org .","Lisa Poyner has suffered from debilitating migraines since a teenager .

Sack Sir Dave: Nine in ten NHS employees want CEO Sir David Nicholson to resign . Nine in ten NHS staff say Sir David Nicholson should resign for presiding over one of our worst-ever hospital scandals. But as the NHS chief executive lost the confidence of doctors, nurses and other senior managers, the Prime Minister came to his defence in an extraordinary show of support. Mr Cameron insisted Sir David was doing a ‘very good job’ and should not be made a ‘scapegoat’ after a report this month implicated him in the Mid Staffordshire disaster, in which 1,200 patients died needlessly. Sir David, who has faced widespread calls to resign, insists he is ‘not ashamed’ to still be in his job and has blamed the failings on the ‘whole system’. But the findings from two online polls – which together received 2,000 responses – show he has lost the trust of health service professionals. When asked whether it was time for him to step down, 91 per cent voted yes. Speaking to reporters during his trip to India, the Prime Minister leapt to Sir David’s defence, saying: ‘I’ve been impressed with the grip and grasp he has over the NHS and his knowledge and understanding and love for it and what he helps to deliver in terms of results. ‘I obviously read that report very carefully. I looked at what people were responsible for. ‘It seemed to me that he had properly apologised and acknowledged the mistakes that the regional health authority had made when he ran it for that short period of time as these events unfolded. ‘We should not be seeking scapegoats and I think to highlight David Nicholson in that way would be seeking a scapegoat.’ A poll of 1,723 doctors, nurses, managers and other senior staff by NHSmanagers.net, a website for health workers, found 92 per cent wanted him to resign. A similar survey of 255 family doctors by GP magazine found 89 per cent wanted him out. Roy Lilley, a respected health policy analyst who runs NHS managers.net said: ‘This is a huge blow for Sir David. ‘It is clear he no longer enjoys the support of front-line staff. ‘As stories of quality horrors, bullying . and service dislocation emerge, it would seem time to recognise Sir . David’s huge contribution to the NHS in the past but make it clear he is . not the man to take the NHS into the future. Politicians insist on the . NHS being run in a business-like way. In defence: Prime Minister David Cameron said the NHS chief executive should not be made into a scapegoat over the Mid Staffordshire scandal, and has done a 'very good job' He continued: ‘If this were a business I think the shareholders would be calling for a new boss and a clean sweep of the board. ‘I don’t see why taxpayers should expect anything less.’ Sir David’s position has come under . increasing pressure over the last fortnight following a damning report . into the Mid Staffordshire disaster. - Cameron on shamed Sir David . Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died at the trust unnecessarily between 2005 and 2009 while countless others suffered horrific neglect. Sir David has been accused of ignoring . the warning signs and failing to intervene while head of the regional . health board and later, the Department of Health. Although he has apologised to bereaved families, he has refused to quit his £211,000-a-year post. Last week he was implicated in . another scandal when it emerged he had ignored warnings about a hospital . trust now at the centre of a probe into high death rates. Gary Walker and David Bowles, two . senior managers at United Lincolnshire hospitals, said they raised . concerns three years ago but were hounded from their jobs. As many as 670 patients are now thought to have died unnecessarily at the trust and it faces an investigation over poor care. Ignored: Whistle blowers Gary Walker (left) and David Bowles (right), two senior managers at United Lincolnshire hospitals, say they wrote to Sir David in 2009 but were hounded from their jobs . Sir David appears to be losing . political support and at least two Tory MPs from the health select . committee, Chris Skidmore and Dr Sarah Wollaston, believe he should go. On Tuesday, health minister Dr Daniel Poulter also appeared to invite . him to ‘consider’ his position. When questioned on BBC’s Newsnight, Dr Poulter said: ‘David Nicholson can obviously consider his own position. ‘But . at the moment we are accepting the fact that he, like many people, has . made an apology for what he has done and we need now to move on and make . sure that we never let another Mid Staffs happen again.’ Aside . from his role in the scandal, many health professionals privately . believe that unless Sir David leaves, the culture of secrecy within the . NHS will not change. A spokesman for Sir David declined to comment on the results of the polls. Campaigner Julie Bailey, who led the . charge in calling for Sir David's resignation, said she was . ‘disappointed’ in the Prime Minister's comments. Miss Bailey, who set up the Cure The . NHS group after her mother Bella died at Stafford Hospital in 2007, . said: ‘We are really disappointed. We thought that this leader would . help us cure the NHS. There has been calls for Sir David Nicholson to be sacked over the shamed NHS Mid Staffordshire trust, a hospital which he visited and reviewed with a 'well done' at the height of the scandal . ‘It is not scapegoating anyone - this man has failed. He has failed not only in his role at the strategic health authority but he has also gone on to be knighted and promoted to chief executive of the NHS while we have 14 hospitals under investigation and a workforce that is demoralised. It is a sad day for Cure The NHS.’ She also called into question the impartiality of the chair of the Health Select Committee, Stephen Dorrell. Daily Telegraph columnist Sue Cameron reported that Mr Dorrell said the Tories should support Sir David ‘because they owe him’. ‘He played a blinder for the Government when it was trying to put through its health reform Bill,’ Mr Dorrell told the newspaper. ‘Now people should pay their debt for the support he gave.’ Miss Bailey said Mr Dorrell should not have made the comments prior to Sir David's evidence session before the committee on March 5. ‘I would also like to call into question Stephen Dorrell's position in defending Sir David Nicholson when he is chair of the Select Committee,’ she said. ‘It calls into question his impartiality when he is speaking to defend him before he has even heard evidence from him.’","Nine out of ten NHS employees want health chief Sir David to resign .

Locked in a tight embrace on the slopes of the Verbier ski resort yesterday, Prince Harry and his society girlfriend Cressida Bonas seem to be closer than ever. The very public display of affection, in front of dozens of fellow skiers, came only a few hours after even more intimate revelries at a restaurant in the town. It was not a wild night by Harry’s standards; no one was naked or wearing Nazi fancy dress. Bear hug: Locked in a tight embrace on the slopes of the Verbier ski resort yesterday, Prince Harry and his society girlfriend Cressida Bonas seem to be closer than ever . Close: The very public display of affection, in front of dozens of fellow skiers, came only a few hours after even more intimate revelries at a restaurant in the town . But fellow diners in the wee small hours  at the Pot Luck Club restaurant in the resort’s Farinet Hotel were entertained by the sight of the Prince bouncing the 24-year-old blonde model and would-be actress on his knee. The pair were said to have ‘kissed like love-struck teenagers in the back of a cinema’. The other end of the same table was an altogether more sober affair. Harry’s uncle, Prince Andrew, whose 53rd birthday on Tuesday they were celebrating, sat with his ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, and their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Eugenie’s boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank, briefly strolled over chatted to Harry and Cressida. But for the most part they had eyes only for each other. The Yorks  traditionally enjoy a week’s skiing in the resort every year to mark Prince Andrew’s birthday, often inviting photographers to capture the event. This time, perhaps not unsurprisingly, the invitation was not extended. The family had booked a table for 20 at The Pot Luck, where they ordered steak and king prawns and drank £17 champagne cocktails. In the spotlight: This week's events in Verbier could suggest that things are beginning to get serious between Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas. The model is spotted out in London previously . As the night drew on, Harry and his socialite girlfriend became increasingly tactile. Shortly before midnight, Miss Bonas, who wore a minuscule black dress and heels, showing off a pair of endless legs, stood up and walked over to sit on Harry’s lap. The pair then began to kiss, with Harry stroking the back of her head as they did so, in a passionate clinch for several minutes. A witness said: ‘We couldn’t believe what we were seeing. They were not being discreet about it.‘The Duchess of York and Eugenie sat just a few seats away at the time and seemed to be deliberately looking the other way, making polite conversation while it was happening. ‘Afterwards, Harry’s girl stayed sitting on his knee while they chatted to his friends.’ The diner went on to reveal: ‘At one point, a waiter brought over a tray of vodka and Red Bull and Harry shouted: “Free drinks on the house!” Everyone seemed to be having a great time.’ Although Prince Andrew left shortly afterwards, the younger royals went on to an exclusive bar above the restaurant, before moving to a basement nightclub, where they stayed until 3.30am. Despite the late night, however, Harry and Cressida still hit the slopes yesterday morning and were again seen openly hugging and kissing on the slopes, which were packed with half-term visitors. Both appeared to be extremely competent skiers and spent most of the day on the mountain. Pole to pole: Harry shows touching concern for his girlfriend on their romantic break . At one point, taking a break from . their fun, Harry was seen putting his arms around Cressida’s waist while . she rested her head on his shoulder. The . student, who wore a white woolly hat with a fur bobble and pink . salopettes, appeared relaxed and could be seen laughing with the Duchess . of York as they left the slopes. She and Eugenie were also seen lying on the snow and giggling as they played with a large St Bernard dog. Last summer’s disastrous Las Vegas stag trip, during which Harry, now 28, was pictured naked — a faux pas which reportedly led to him being dumped briefly by a furious Cressida — seems a very long time ago now. So, for that matter, does his previous, long-term relationship with the Zimbabwean heiress Chelsy Davy, who dumped him in 2011, reportedly because she could not face the prospect of being in the spotlight as a royal wife. Since Vegas, Harry, in his guise of Captain Wales of the Army Air Corps, has served a four-month tour of Afghanistan as a co-pilot in an Apache attack helicopter. At the end of his service he talked of having a new maturity. A few months earlier, he had complained on American television that he would like to settle down, but girls were put off by his royal status. So, do this week’s events in  Verbier suggest matters are getting serious between him and the Stowe-educated Miss Bonas? The couple are said to have started dating last May, though they only appeared as an item on the public radar when pictured leaving a Mayfair nightclub in July. Cosy chat: The Duchess of York, so long excluded from royal circles, has a heart-to-heart with Cressida . They had spent the evening ‘kissing and cuddling’ inside Le Salon after attending the latest Batman premiere. Harry’s cousin and Miss Bonas’s good friend Princess Eugenie is said to have brought them together. The . daughter of renowned Old Harrovian businessman Jeffrey Bonas and . Sixties model Lady Mary Curzon — who posed semi-naked for a coffee table . photographic book and went on to get married and divorced four times — . Cressida is a familiar figure in London’s upper-class social scene. As a teenager, she was labelled by society bible Tatler as ‘really pretty, really nice and absolutely obsessed with Eva Cassidy (the late American singer)’. After splitting up with Miss Davy, Harry was linked to a string of women, including model Florence Brudenell-Bruce. But Cressida seems to be the one he has been most smitten with. Split: Prince Harry was previously in a long-term relationship with Chelsy Davy. The pair are pictured together in 2010 . Like Miss Davy, ‘Cressie’ went to Leeds University where she dated Harry Wentworth-Stanley, son of the Marchioness of Milford Haven. After graduation, that relationship cooled. Now she has a prince in her life. Last year she and Harry flew together to the Caribbean island of Necker for the birthday of tycoon Sir Richard Branson’s son Sam, who is engaged to be married to Miss Bonas’s beautiful half- sister, the actress Isabella Anstuther-Gough-Calthorpe. This week’s ski holiday, to which the Prince had flown on budget airline easyJet, is significant in royal terms for more than one reason. It is the first time in many, many years that Harry has been seen in public with the snubbed Duke of York’s ex-wife. Sarah . was robustly frozen out by the Royal Family after being photographed . having her toes sucked by her ‘financial adviser’ in the South of . France, an incident which precipitated her divorce from Prince Andrew. And . despite enjoying a close relationship with Harry and his brother .

Satellite images have uncovered the building where Navy SEALs practiced the mission to kill Osama bin Laden - and the similarities of that structure to the actual compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, is shocking. The training facility was constructed on U.S. soil to prepare members of Navy SEAL Team Six for what was to be a daunting mission that resulted in bin Laden's death last year. But the details of the training facility, including its location, were never released - until now. Scroll down for video . Spitting image: The training facility, which appears in this satellite image, was constructed on U.S. soil to prepare members of Navy SEAL Team Six for the daunting mission that resulted in bin Laden's death . Terror house: The training facility is remarkably similar to the actual bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan . The pictures, unveiled by whistleblower site Cryptome.org, show a bird’s eye view of the site in North Carolina, near the CIA’s Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity facility in Perquimans County. When compared with satellite images of the actual bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the two structures - though thousands of miles away - look remarkably similar. So how did Cryptome’s mapwatchers know where to look? They needed only to peek into the pages of No Easy Day, the first-hand account of the bin Laden raid by one of the Team Six members who was there. When looking at the same area in North Carolina on Google Maps, however, there is no trace of the building, which was apparently demolished - just like its Pakistan twin - after the mission.

No Easy Day was written by a soldier identifying himself as Mark Owen, but was later outed as retired Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette. He claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Bissonnette's book has proved controversial because Bissonnette did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it.

According to Tiger Woods, it was ‘just a great round of golf with Ron and Jim.’ Much has been made of Obama’s President’s Day golfing weekend in Florida – from it's cost to his questionable choices over his playing partners- but little has been reported about the questionable background of Democratic donor Jim Crane who hit the links alongside the President and Woods. Obama and the ‘boys’ – among them Woods, US trade representative Ron Kirk and Houston Astros owner Crane - have done their best to downplay the trip. Like Tiger said, it was ‘just a great round of golf.’ No doubt for him it was. But there is no such thing as ‘just a round of golf,’ for Jim Crane. From Club house to White House: Barrack Obama back at work after his 'boys weekend' in Florida . Houston Astros owner, Jim Crane at the MLB National League Opening, 2012. A man with his eyes on the future...and a distinctly murky past . Woods is a more eye-catching choice of presidential golf-partner with his dazzling skill and whiff of personal scandal. But dig a little deeper and Crane, 58, is arguably the more interesting, and controversial, of the two. This is a man who was named best CEO golfer in the world and promptly had himself removed from the rankings because, ‘Nobody likes to be tracked and traced. I mean..you may not want people to know wherever you’re at.’ This is a man who advised his salespeople to, ‘get somebody out of their element, out of that boardroom..in a golf cart,’ because, ‘If you can’t sell something in four hours, you can’t sell it.’ This is a man whose company’s business practices have been the subject of several investigations, costly legal suits and eye-watering settlements and whose own methods have drawn excoriating criticism. Playing the game: Crane and his wife Francine are generous sponsors of sports and the arts as well as political donors. This is a man who doesn’t slice shots he cuts deals. His partner on the course was Milton Carroll, Chairman of utilities company CenterPoint Energy and, along with Crane, boardmember of Western Gas Holdings. Superficially, of course Crane's presence makes sense. For a start the Texan owns the Floridian National Golf Club where the men played. Obama and his group, which included Chicago friend Eric Whitaker rented out all eight of the club's private cottages, with his security detail spilling over into many nearby hotel rooms.Then there’s the fact that since 2002 Crane has been an active and generous democratic donor and fundraiser. Last year he gave the maximum $5,000 to Obama’s campaign and $30,800 to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). In 2010 he gave to the Democratic Texas candidate, Bill White, with $125,297 in donations. But before 2002, when he began pouring his money into Democrat coffers, he was a similarly generous Republican donor. His contributions included $5,000 to the Republican National Committee, (RNC) in 2000 and several to candidates including former Texas Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn. Back then, Crane was CEO of Eagle Global Logistics. He built the freight company and with it his fortune. Inspite of intense interest in the President's golfing weekend and game with Tiger Woods, the weekend was off-limits to photographers . The Floridian National Golf Club opened in 1996 - a year later Crane's company was under EEOC investigation . Focused on relaxation: Obama is an avid golfer who met Woods in 2009 but President's Weekend was the men's first game together. Balzac wrote that at the root of all ‘fortunes without apparent cause,’ is ‘a crime forgotten.’ Crane’s personal wealth is in excess of $500million and his history is long. His path to building his wealth is punctuated with charges of racial and sexual discrimination, profiteering from the war in Iraq and breaches of fiduciary duty. In 1997 Crane’s company, Eagle Global Logisitcs, was investigated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). According . to the lengthy report published by the commission Crane’s company paid, . ‘female and minority employees less than white men who do similar work; . did not investigate employee complaints of sexual harassment; and . destroyed evidence that the company was instructed to retain as part of . the two-year EEOC investigations.’ While Barack golfed Michelle took to the slopes at Buttermilk ski area, Aspen, Colo. She was joined by daughters Sasha and Malia. Two hundred and three cases were upheld. Eagle’s General Counsel, Judith Robertson testified against the company and was later sued by them for revealing privileged information. It was reported in the Houston Chronicle that Crane instructed executives not to employ ‘blacks because once you hire blacks you can never fire them.’ As a boy Crane dreamed of owning a Baseball Team and a Golf Club. As a man he's used to getting what he wants . In 2000 Eagle was forced to pay $9million in back-pay and damages. Six years later the company was once again attracting official opprobrium – this time with allegations of war profiteering. In 2006 Eagle paid $4million to settle a civil suit brought by the Department of Justice alleging that the company had inflated the cost of military shipments to Iraq, allegedly adding $0.50 per kilogram of freight from Dubai to Baghdad. They paid a further $300,000 in 2007 and $750,000 in 2010 to settle allegations of kickbacks. Ultimately Eagle paid a fine of $4,486,120 and fired two senior executives – conditions made by the Department of Justice for dropping the case in which Eagle was one of several companies charged with price-fixing shipments to Iraq. According to Crane the fault lay with ‘two rogue executives’ both of whom were sacked. As for those Breaches of Fiduciary Duty, in 2007 Apollo Management LP entered into a merger with Eagle Logistics for $38 per share. But the deal quickly soured with Apollo claiming that the Merger Agreement was ‘the produce of a sham process, controlled and manipulated by Crane, with the tacit or express connivance of the remaining defendants’ – among them Milton Carroll also on the President’s recent boys weekend. Apollo argued that Crane dominated and manipulated board members, excluded them from key meetings and with-held vital information. Ultimately Crane cut ties from the company he founded and went onto set up Crane Global Logistics. This is not a man who accepts defeat. Though no doubt he took the President’s win on the course in good grace. But then that was ‘just a round of golf,’ wasn’t it?","Multimillionaire Houston Astros owner, Crane, hosted the President's secretive golfing weekend in Florida .

Police are trialling the new tactic in Brighton after it proved successful in other party towns such as Newcastle and Torquay . Jennifer McGee, a second year journalism student at the University of Brighton, praised the new police approach. She said: 'I think that it's good that the police made him clean it up. 'It's gross seeing it on the ground when you're on a night out. I'm always worried about standing in it and ruining my shoes.'

It is terrible and so smelly. Anything that encourages people from doing it again is a good thing.' A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'Anyone caught urinating in public could be liable to an £80 fixed penalty notice or even arrest depending on the circumstances, but if they offer or agree to clean up then we would encourage them to do so and offer some stern words of advice.'","Police in Brighton try new tactic to tackle anti-social night time habit .

Guinea pigs which have no fur are the latest pet craze sweeping across Britain, but animal campaigners say the sickly pets are a huge responsibility . The wrinkly skinny pigs, which are selling for £120 each, are almost completely bald and have to live inside with their owners during the winter to keep warm. The cute creatures, which look like the Clangers from 1970's kids TV, do not occur in the wild and were a genetic mutation, created in The Institute Armand Frappier lab in Montreal in Canada in 1978. Scroll down for video . Bald: Skinny pigs, which are naturally hairless, are growing in popularity as pets and sell for around £120. But animal campaigners say they can suffer health problems and urged pet lovers to think twice before buying . A spokeswoman from the RSPCA said the lack of fur can cause unnecessary pain, discomfort, illness and behavioural problems and that no animal should be bred primarily for how it looks. She added: 'The RSPCA wouldn't recommend people buy these animals due to the welfare problems associated with selectively breeding them for lack of hair, and because they will have complex needs that must be met to keep them happy and healthy. 'Animal charities are full to the brim with small animals looking for homes, and we would urge anyone interested in having a pet to consider re-homing a compatible pair of rescue guinea pigs instead.' Skinny pigs bear an uncanny resemblance to 1970s children's TV show The Clangers . The chief vet of animal welfare charity Blue Cross, Caroline Reay, has concerns about the increasing commoditisation of animals, including the rise of ‘handbag’ and wolf-like dogs. She said: 'Many pets are bred for particular traits, but when choosing any pet, you should never base the decision on appearance alone. 'It’s really important to remember that ""skinny pigs"" have the same welfare needs as regular guinea pigs, although with a hairless variety, owners will also need to give extra protection from the cold, sun and injury, which their fur would usually provide. 'The main concern for Blue Cross is that it is increasingly easy to buy a pet on a whim without giving proper thought to the commitment needed.' The animals do not occur in the wild and were a genetic mutation, created in a Canadian lab in 1978 . Their lack of hair has made them hugely popular with allergy sufferers and an increasing number of Brits are buying the coat-free guinea pigs as family pets. 'I've always been fascinated by unusual pets and when I saw my first skinny pig I knew I had to have one,' said Karen Brown, who looks after more than 40 skinny pigs in her home and is the leading breeder in the UK. 'I bought a lilac and white sow called ""Peanut"", and so it all began. I love the fact they live indoors with me and they have become like part of the family. Cute: Skinny pigs have only tiny tufts of hair on their noses and feet . 'They are cheeky, inquisitive, gentle and friendly, so they are good fun and make great pets.' Skinny pigs have tiny tufts of hair on their noses and feet, but otherwise they are completely naked from birth, with their plump bodies and stumpy legs on show. They come in a variety of skin colours, including albino, chocolate, silver, cinnamon, lilac, white, golden and even Dalmatian - which are white with black spots. 'I love the Dalmatian markings on any guinea pig and find it particularly striking in the hairless,"" added Karen. Skinny pigs must stay indoors because they are ill-suited to the cold and require sun cream in summer . Curious: This adorable little fellow is peeping out from a basket . The markings on the animals vary, with chocolate brown being a popular choice among pet lovers . 'My favourite colour is chocolate. They are the most popular alongside well marked darker Dalmatians.' Unlike traditional guinea pigs, skinnies cannot live outside as they would never survive the cold and have to be kept warm in a heated home. On warm sunny days they can graze in the garden, but need sun-cream of factor 50+ so their delicate skin does not get burnt by the sun. Karen Brown breeds and sells the unusual creatures for £120 each . Skinnies also have a higher metabolism than normal guinea pigs in order to maintain their body heat, which means they eat a lot of food. 'They will happily munch away all day long,' said Karen, who runs KabSkinnies in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. 'They can also be messy as they never manage to keep all the bedding in their cages and quite noisy too. 'They soon learn to recognise a fridge door opening or the rustle of a bag that could mean food, and a whole herd can start calling loudly in anticipation of being fed. 'They are really entertaining little creatures and have great personalities.' The cute creatures, which are now ethically bred in the UK, can live up to six years and enjoy the company of other skinnies and their owners. She added: 'They are always better pets if handled well from birth and boars usually being more affectionate than sows. 'It's so hard to imagine my precious little skinny pigs have descended from lab animals.'","Striking pets descended from lab-grown genetic mutations .

Light-hearted: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson joked that Tory traditionalists are uneasy about gay rights because 'biddies don't like botties' A Cabinet Minister who is opposed to David Cameron’s plan to allow same-sex marriages has light-heartedly said Tory traditionalists are uneasy about gay rights because ‘biddies don’t like botties’. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is among more than  100 Conservative MPs opposed to giving gays and lesbians the same rights to marry as heterosexual couples. Wealthy Right-winger Mr Paterson, married to aristocrat’s daughter Rose Ridley, is known for his outspoken views. He is a diehard opponent of Brussels and wind farms and a vociferous supporter of foxhunting. He has long been sceptical about gay rights and expresses his views in colourful terms privately. Summing up why older members of the Tory faithful oppose measures such as gay marriage, Mr Paterson quipped: ‘It’s simple – biddies don’t like botties.’ The comment has shocked some more liberal-minded Conservative MPs but provocative Mr Paterson revels in repeating it to others. A source close to the Cabinet Minister said: ‘Owen has no problem with the big strides made in improving equality for gays and lesbians. But he thinks same-sex marriage is a step too far. ‘He believes the Government ought to be concentrating on the economy and Europe instead of obsessing with gay rights. And most ordinary members of the Tory Party agree with him. They don’t want their leaders endlessly going on about gays.’ The scale of the Tory revolt over the issue was underlined last night when Wellingborough MP Peter Bone warned: ‘It is by no means impossible that David Cameron could be brought down as Conservative leader by his gay marriage plans. ‘He is completely out of step with the mainstream of his party.’ To add to the Tory disarray, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will tomorrow denounce Tory ‘fantasists’ who oppose gay marriage. Criticised: Paterson is opposed to giving gays the same rights to marry as heterosexuals. David Cameron has faced criticism from some within the Conservative party over the plans . In a keynote speech to mark his five years as Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Clegg will say: ‘The Tory Right dreams of a fantasy world where we can pretend the world hasn’t moved on, oppose equal marriage and refuse to accept the verdict of the British people by pretending the Conservatives won a majority at the last Election.’ And in a leaked email, Lib Dem Minister Lynne Featherstone boasted Mr Clegg forced reluctant Tory Ministers to introduce gay marriage laws. ‘I am so proud of our party because – don’t let anyone fool you – it’s because of Liberal Democrats that this is happening,’ she said in an email to Lib Dem MPs.","Environment Secretary Owen Paterson says 'biddies don't like botties'

Two families have discovered that they have been raising each others daughters after the girls were swapped at birth 14 years ago. The Belyaevs and the Iskanderovs, from the Russian Urals, only learned the truth after a DNA test was carried out to establish the paternity of Irina Belyaeva when she was 12. To the astonishment of her mother Yulia and father . Alexei, the results showed the girl they had brought up from birth was not their biological daughter. Instead, she was the child of Yelena and Naimat Iskanderov, who had in turn raised Yulia and Alexei's girl Anna. The parents now 'share' their daughters, although they have struggled with how differently their biological children have been raised. The Belyaevs are Christians while the Iskanderovs are Muslim. (Left to right) Naimat with daughter Anna he raised, and Irina by Yuliya Belyaeva. All four were stunned when they heard the daughters had been switched . The children with their biological parents, (left to right) Yuliya Belyaeva with daughter Anna, Naimat Iskanderov with daughter Irina . The horrendous mix-up began when Yulia , 32, from Kopeisk in the Urals and Alexei, were expecting their first baby in 1998, The Siberian Times reported. Naimat , 36,  an ethnic Tajik, married the then 16-year-old Yelena, and their baby was due at the same date. The two women gave birth to their daughters on December 17. Yulia gave birth at 1.30am to a girl she called Irina, 15 minutes after Yelena welcomed her baby daughter, called Anna. When both new mothers fell asleep, it is thought that the girls were switched and wrongly tagged as the other. When the delighted new parents brought them home, questions were raised over their children's looks. Yulia's . husband Alexei questioned why their daughter had such dark hair and . features, when they were pale and blond, but his wife thought she had . picked it up from other family traits. Anna, her biological mother Yuliya, and Naimat, his biological daughter Irina. The families stay in touch as they are still reeling from the news . Naimat, Yulia , Irina (left) and Anna all meet regularly, and the youngsters have grown close since the shocking discovery . Naimat did not question why his daughter was as 'white as sugar' and thought his baby had taken after her Russian mother. The problems began when Alexei became suspicious of Irina, and accused Yulia of cheating on him. He accused Irina of not being his biological daughter, and demanded a divorce in 2007, accusing his wife of cheating on him. She . insisted she had not and, when Alexei refused to financially support . Irina, Yulia took him to court, and a DNA test to confirm paternity was . arranged in 2010. It was then that tests revealed that . neither of Irina's parents were biologically related to her - she had . been swapped at birth. After . contacting the Prosecutor's Office in 2011, an investigator tracked . down Naimat and, with him, Yulia's biological daughter, called Anna. Yulia's wedding to Alexei, in 1998, broke down after he became suspicious that their daughter was not his . Anna, who believed Naimat was her biological father, pictured as a child. The little girl was finally reunited with her biological mother in 2011 . Irina (right) pictured with the mother who raised her, Yulia, and Yulia's other baby . Naimat . had been blissfully unaware there was an problem and initially refused . to meet with the other family, but relented and met his biological . daughter, who he described as his 'mirror image'. Three . years on and the families now 'share' their 14-year-old daughters, with . Anna and Irina calling both parents 'Mama' and 'Papa'. The stark cultural differences . between the two families meant that it would be impossible for the girls . to simply swap back to their biological families. They have decided to continue raising . each others biological daughters primarily as their own responsibility, . but celebrate holidays and birthdays with each other. But cultural differences did cause some trouble. Yulia feared that her daughter would marry at a young age in an organised marriage and she would stop communicating with her. During a TV show which showed the results of their DNA tests, the girls were upset as they learned of the mistake which changed their lives forever . The families only found out after extensive DNA tests proved the mix up - but they have decided to stay with their families who raised them . Naimat . struggled to come to terms with Irina's manner of being very open, not . shy to talk to boys, and asking for a lot of hugs and kisses from . relatives. However, . Naimat said that no decisions had been made on any of the children's . future arrangements and the families were attempting to be in as much . contact with each other as possible. He said: 'First of all we live in . the different villages and the second thing is that we have different . cultural background, different religions and beliefs.

When it was announced that Whitehall mandarin Christina Scott will take over as British Governor in the tiny paradise isle of Anguilla this summer, eyebrows were raised in the Foreign Office. The plum Caribbean posting – which includes the picture-postcard Governor’s Residence ‘Old Ta’ and  a salary ‘nudging six figures’ – was expected to go to someone with a background in foreign affairs. Yet all Ms Scott’s experience over the past 12 years has been at the Treasury, Transport Department and Cabinet Office. Picture-postcard: Christina Scott will take over as British Governor in Anguilla this summer. The posting includes the Governor's Residence (pictured) and a salary nudging six figures . Paradise found: Miss Scott made her delight clear when her appointment in Anguilla (pictured) was announced in October . However, one consequence of her surprise move is that she will no longer risk bumping into her  estranged husband Chris Martin in Downing Street. He is Principal Private Secretary to David Cameron, the second most powerful official in No  10, and deputy to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood. The current Governor of Anguilla is lifelong envoy William Harrison.And of the ten British Overseas  Territories with Governors – including Montserrat, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands – seven appointments went to career diplomats, one to a senior official at the Department for International Development and one to a former naval officer. By contrast, Ms Scott, 38, runs  the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which is in charge of responding to UK crises such as natural disasters or terrorism. She has never worked at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO), which customarily protects such appointments with jealousy. Christina Scott (pictured) runs the Civil Contingencies Secretariat which is in charge of responding to UK crises . Ms Scott fell in love with Mr Martin, 39, when they worked for the last Labour administration. They married in 2005 but friends were dismayed to learn over a year ago that the couple had separated. Their paths crossed again at work when Treasury official Mr Martin was promoted to his current No  10 post. It meant working alongside Ms Scott, who is based in the Cabinet Office, which is connected to No  10 by an internal passage. The high-powered and sensitive nature of Ms Scott’s work as the civil servant in charge of COBRA – the Cabinet committee that deals with national emergencies – means she comes into close contact with Mr Cameron and his senior aides such as Mr Martin. Last night, both Downing Street and the FCO denied any impropriety in the appointment process or that it had been influenced by a desire to keep the couple apart, saying her personal circumstances were not relevant. They added that it was ‘not unusual’ to be appointed to a Governorship without a background at the FCO. Ms Scott made her delight clear when her little-noticed appointment was announced in October, saying: ‘It is a great honour to be appointed as Governor. I very much look forward to working with the people of Anguilla and their elected representatives as they build a vibrant, successful and resilient future.’ Mr Martin advised Mr Cameron before his appearance at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics and accompanied him when he gave evidence. He was also involved in the investigation into claims that ex-Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell swore at a policeman at Downing Street’s gates. Ms Scott, who will be known by the grand title of ‘Her Excellency The Governor’, can expect less stress and improved working conditions, 4,000 miles away in Anguilla. Prime mover: Chris Martin, David Cameron's Principal Private Secretary is Miss Scott's estranged husband . Old Ta, near the capital, The  Valley, is an idyllic location and has hosted the Queen on official visits. At weekends Ms Scott will be able to relax on its palm-fringed beaches. Anguilla’s large measure of internal self-government means the Governor’s role, which includes dealing with policing and the remote prospect of invasion, is mainly ceremonial. Anguilla has a population of just 13,500, the same as a small English town, and is 16 miles long by three miles across at its widest point. According to legend, Anguilla was first sighted and named by Christopher Columbus and colonised by English settlers in the 1600s. It is a tax haven and, until last year, had no income tax. Not surprisingly, it is now an upmarket tourist destination. Last night, an FCO spokesman said: ‘It is standard practice for the FCO to advertise all senior positions across Whitehall. It opens up the field of competition and helps us attract the most talented candidates. Christina Scott was appointed to this role from a strong field of candidates after a successful interview in which she was assessed to be the best person for the job. The competition was open and fair. ‘Christina has relevant experience drawn from a range of roles from across Whitehall, as well as extensive domestic policy experience, which will make her an asset to the FCO and the Government of Anguilla.’ An FCO source added: ‘The job of a Governor is like no other in the FCO... it is not about the diplomatic influencing of another country’s government, it is more about being a part of that executive. It means understanding how public policy is delivered, and how to work through the machinations of politics.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘She was a strong candidate.’","Christina Scott will take over as British Governor on island of Anguilla .

"By . Ian Gallagher and Simon Walters . PUBLISHED: . 17:29 EST, 22 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:16 EST, 23 December 2012 . Pivotal: Police officer Toby Rowland . The Mail on Sunday can today name the policeman at the centre of the ‘Plebgate’ row that cost former Government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell his job. As doubts grow about the allegations made against Mr Mitchell, we can identify Toby Rowland as the officer involved in the Downing Street fracas – and the man believed to have written the official log of the incident. In the 442-word account, it is stated that Mr Mitchell called police ‘plebs’ when they stopped him from riding his bike through the Downing Street gates – an allegation the former Minister has always denied – and used language that left passers-by ‘visibly shocked’. The claims led to a media storm and Mr Mitchell’s resignation. However CCTV footage of the incident, made public last week, cast serious doubt on the log’s version of events, and increased the pressure on David Cameron to return Mr Mitchell to frontline politics. The video showed Mr Rowland, 42, ushering Mr Mitchell through the side gate of Downing Street – but no sign of a blazing row. Scotland Yard is now investigating the possibility that Mr Mitchell has been the victim of a conspiracy among officers angered by government cuts. And last night, as concern about the affair grew,  Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe broke off from his holiday to return to duty. Mr Hogan-Howe, who has been criticised for his handling of the case, said he had returned to work  ‘because of his concern for the welfare of all the officers and their families involved in the events surrounding the incident’. Last week it was claimed that another policeman sent an email to an MP, falsely claiming to be a member of the public who witnessed the row while passing Downing Street with his nephew. That officer, The Mail on Sunday can also disclose today, is 52-year-old Keith Wallis, who like Mr Rowland is a member of the Diplomatic Protection Group. Mr Wallis, from Ruislip, Middlesex, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of misconduct in public office. In a further development, this newspaper has been told that Mr Wallis – who denied being a witness to the original incident when confronted by Channel 4’s political editor Michael Crick last week – is related to a second man arrested over the affair, a 23-year-old. Scroll down for video . Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of calling police officers 'plebs' The man, who is not a member of police staff, was held last week on suspicion of ‘intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence of  misconduct in a public office’. When approached by a Mail on Sunday reporter at his home near Aylesbury last week, shaven-headed Mr Rowland, who is married to another police officer, Rebecca,  declined to discuss his role in the incident, claiming not to ‘know  anything about it’. As he washed his car outside his semi-detached village home near the Chilterns, he added: ‘I don’t know anything about that, mate. You will have to speak to Scotland Yard.’ When questioned on whether he had been . asked not to talk by the police, he sighed and asked the reporter to . leave. Later that day, Mr Rowland was visited by two police officers, . though it was not clear if they formally questioned him. Afterwards one . of the officers said: ‘They are not prepared to talk. They are not . prepared to make any statements.’ Mr Rowland is due to be asked about the apparent discrepancies in the official log – along with a female police officer who was also in Downing Street at the time. Mr Mitchell’s supporters have called for the two officers to be suspended during the investigation, but Scotland Yard say they remain on duty. Police have suggested that 30 officers are examining whether there was a conspiracy to smear Mr Mitchell and are conducting ‘a large scale and complex investigation’. One thing it will try to determine is why the log and the email contained such similar accounts of the September 19 incident. Downing Street beat: Mr Rowland is thought to have written the log about Mr Mitchell . Last night leading Tory MP David Davis, who has played a prominent role trying to clear Mr Mitchell’s name, called for the former Chief Whip to be restored to the Cabinet in his previous job as International Development Secretary. ‘I think that Mr Mitchell should return to the Cabinet at the earliest opportunity,’ Mr Davis said. ‘His honour and reputation is clearly fully restored. He has shown tremendous courage to recover from the way he was completely shredded over these false allegations. I see no reason why he should not be given back his old job as International Development Secretary, where his work won widespread praise at home and abroad.’ But Downing Street contested the suggestion that Mr Cameron should have kept Mr Mitchell in his job, releasing a statement which insisted that the Prime Minister backed his colleague for as long as he could. A spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has deep sympathy for Andrew Mitchell after allegations emerged that a serving police officer fabricated evidence against him. The Prime Minister stood behind his Chief Whip through weeks of growing demands to sack him. It was only when it became clear that he could no longer do his job that his resignation was accepted with reluctance. ‘Andrew Mitchell did not disagree with the Prime Minister’s approach throughout this period. The Prime Minister, and Andrew Mitchell, were deeply shocked to be informed that the police were investigating allegations that a serving police officer had lied about the events.’ The CCTV footage of the incident further stoked the already rancorous dispute between the Tories and Scotland Yard by appearing to show that there were no ‘shocked’ members of the public. The Police Federation vigorously pursued the claims against Mr Mitchell, with some branches of the employees’ body organising protests where officers wore ‘PC Pleb’ T-shirts. Its chairman Paul McKeever said he would apologies to Mr Mitchell if it was proved that he did not call police officers ‘plebs’. Mr McKeever has acknowledged concerns that the federation ‘stoked up’ the Downing Street incident. He  has handed control of the federation to his successor-elect Steve Williams a month before he is officially due to leave the role, due to ‘pre-existing leave arrangements’. And one of Mr Williams’s first acts was to announce plans for a review prompted by the Mitchell incident. ‘Recent events have shown that there are issues around the way the federation nationally is able to lead and co-ordinate,’ he said in a statement. ‘My first act as chairman is to establish this independent panel to ensure that we continue to represent the interests of our members in the most effective and efficient way.’ Mr Hogan-Howe, who has publicly backed the officers involved, now faces a grilling by MPs over the handling of the affair. Mr Mitchell was reported to have doubts over the Met chief’s impartiality after he said the original log was not contradicted by the CCTV footage. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘There are serious questions that need answering.’ Asked about Mr Hogan-Howe’s position, Scotland Yard said its investigation into the affair ‘is progressing with urgency, whilst maintaining an open mind and a determination to leave no stone unturned’. A spokesman declined to respond to questions about Mr Rowland’s involvement in the row. He also declined to confirm that Mr Wallis was the officer arrested. Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, yesterday insisted this was an isolated case. He said: ‘There’s always been – and there should be – a healthy tension between politicians and the police service I don’t think this is evidence of a growing distrust.’ CCTV  Questions arose about nature of 'pleb' accusations during Channel 4 documentary .

Ed Balls’s hopes of replacing Ed Miliband as Labour leader have been ‘buried’ by his bungled Commons onslaught on George Osborne last week, a Labour MP claimed last night. Bassetlaw MP John Mann said the Shadow Chancellor’s lacklustre response to the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement plans to slash welfare and raise taxes for the well-off had damaged Mr Balls’s leadership prospects – and made Mr Miliband’s position secure. Mr Mann spoke out amid claims that Mr Balls and his supporters have given up hope that either he or wife, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, could succeed Mr Miliband. Poor performance: Bassetlaw MP John Mann, left, accused the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, right, of giving a lacklustre response to Osborne's Autumn Statement plans to cut welfare . George Osborne said the plans in his Autumn Statement would return 'fairness' to the benefits system . Instead, they reportedly plan to throw their support behind Mr Balls’s deputy, rising Labour star Rachel Reeves, in an attempt to defeat Mr Miliband’s protege, Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, said to be admired by Mr Balls’s Blairite foe, Lord Mandelson. Mr Mann told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Any speculation that Ed Balls might launch a leadership challenge to Ed Miliband is dead and buried. It is believed unlikely that Ed Balls, right, will now challenge Ed Miliband, left, for the Labour leadership . ‘Ed Balls failed to defeat Osborne when Osborne was by far the most vulnerable Cabinet member. 'There was a time when it was felt Ed Miliband was running to catch up with Ed Balls. That’s reversed in the past year. 'What happened last week crystallises that change.’ And a Labour frontbencher added: ‘The Balls brand was built on an aura of invincibility. 'But against Osborne last week, he was as nimble as an arthritic elephant. 'He’s been holed below the waterline by one speech.’ Labour politicians also criticised Mr Balls for claiming his childhood stammer was to blame for fluffing his lines at the start of his Commons reply to Mr Osborne. A former  Labour Cabinet Minister said: ‘Everyone admires the way Ed has struggled to overcome his stammer. 'But to blame it for making a poor speech is feeble.’ Another Labour grandee said: ‘Ed’s response failed because he had no message and no narrative. 'If the Tories had barracked him because of his stammer, it would have been unacceptable, but they didn’t.

As a constitutional monarch, the Queen knows she must remain above the hurly-burly of everyday politics... but that didn’t stop Her Majesty from last week making a light-hearted quip about Gordon Brown’s controversial sale of Britain’s gold reserves. In a conversation with George Osborne, she recalled a visit earlier this month to the Bank of England vaults, where thousands of gold bars are kept. She then commented to the Chancellor: ‘I gather not all of the bars belong to us.’ Mr Osborne replied, with a slight smirk: ‘No, Ma’am.

The comment brought laughter from other members of the Cabinet who heard the exchange. It took place in the Pillared Room of No 10, when Her Majesty became the first monarch to sit in on a peacetime Cabinet meeting since 1781. She is said to have maintained a diplomatically impassive expression throughout the conversation. The comment was in reference to Mr Brown selling half of Britain’s gold reserves for £2 billion while he was Chancellor in 1999, when the price of gold was at a 20-year low.

Defiant: Prime Minster David Cameron denied his tough stance on benefit shirkers was unfair . David Cameron last night denied he is being 'cruel' by vowing to ban unemployed people who refuse to try to find a job from claiming the dole. In a hard-hitting New Year message, he promised to 'get behind the workers' and crack down on the shirkers. It came as he summoned Tory MPs to a private meeting, during which he will fire the starting gun for the 2015 General Election campaign. An email sent by Chief Whip Sir George Young and obtained by The Mail on Sunday orders Conservative MPs to attend the gathering a week on Tuesday. The Prime Minister, Tory chairman Grant Shapps and No 10 head of campaigns Stephen Gilbert will tell backbenchers that despite Labour's big lead in the polls, the Conservatives can still win the next Election. Sir George wrote: 'The Prime Minister has asked me to invite you to an important meeting to focus on our campaign for the 2015 General Election.' Mr Cameron plans to use the meeting to boost party morale, which is flagging after dire economic forecasts, revolts over gay marriage and Europe, and splits with his Liberal Democrat Coalition partners. According to a poll by website ConservativeHome, two-thirds of party members expect Labour to be in power after the next Election, with only 12 per cent believing Mr Cameron will get a Commons majority. One Tory backbencher said: 'It is highly unusual for a Prime Minister to start an Election campaign two-and-a-half years before the votes are counted. 'There has been a severe loss of confidence in the PM from some of us. It sounds like he intends to put a gun to our heads, saying, ""Back me or we will lose the next Election."" 'He trots out his, ""We're all in this together"" slogan, but it doesn't feel like that when he rams through daft policies like gay marriage. It wasn't in our last manifesto, so how can we trust him over the next one?' In his New Year message, Mr Cameron praised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith's plans to strip the long-term unemployed of benefits if they refuse to take part in schemes designed to help them find work. Tory Chief Whip Sir George Young has summoned senior Conservatives as the Prime Minister prepares to launch an early re-election campaign . The Prime Minister said: 'When people say we've got to stop our welfare reforms because somehow it is cruel to expect people to work, we are saying no. Getting people into good jobs is absolutely vital, not just for them, but for all of us. 'We inherited a welfare system that was out of shape and paid people not to work. So we made some big changes, and this New Year almost half a million more people are in work than last New Year.' Mr Cameron rejected Labour claims that his economic policies have failed. The only way to compete with the rest of the world, he argued, is to continue cutting the national debt, cut taxes and carry on with radical reforms to welfare and schools. He added: 'We are doing all this to get behind anyone who likes to work hard and get on in life.' Mr Cameron said the Queen's Jubilee and the Olympics had made 2012 'an extraordinary year for our country'. He said: 'If we are honest, it was a tough one too. For many families, making ends meet is difficult.' However, he blamed Labour for leaving massive debts and said the Coalition was putting things right. 'Britain is in a global race with countries like China, India and Indonesia; a race for the jobs and opportunities of the future. 'So when people say we can slow down on cutting our debts, we are saying no. We can't win in this world with a great millstone of debt round our necks.' Radical plans to simplify the benefits system will encourage hundreds of thousands of young people to find work, a Minister claimed last night. Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said Universal Credit, to be introduced late next year, will mean 300,000 under-25s will be up to about £100 a month better off if they get a job.","Prime Minister promises to cuts for those who refuse to look for work .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg personally intervened to help a charity linked to his wife Miriam obtain £12 million of taxpayers’ money. Labour and Tories joined forces to call for an investigation last night after leaked emails showed one of the Lib Dem leader’s key aides lobbied for Booktrust to be given the grant, instead of competing with other charities. The organisation announced last week that it had secured £6 million for each of the next two years, while other charities will have to wait until next year – and some will get nothing. By the book? Nick and Miriam Clegg at the theatre on Saturday night as Labour and Tories joined forces to call for an investigation into leaked emails showing one of the Lib Dem leader's key aides lobbied for Booktrust - a charity linked to Miriam - to be given a grant . The charity has previously received . Department for Education funding – but the new award secures that until . 2015. According to sources in Mr Clegg’s Cabinet Office, his aide Matt . Sanders referred in conversation to the fact that Mrs Clegg – a . prominent supporter of the charity – hosted a function for them just . weeks earlier. A Whitehall insider said: ‘There was . unease at the way that it appeared Mr Clegg wanted special treatment for . Booktrust, and the fact that Miriam’s name came up.’ It is understood that emails show . that senior civil servants expressed concern at the way the bidding . process had apparently been manipulated to benefit Booktrust. When the claims were put to the Education Department last night, an official spokesman said: ‘We have no comment.’ Lavish reception: As a prominent supporter of the charity, Miriam addressed Booktrust's 20th anniversary event in October . A spokesman for Mr Clegg last night . confirmed that he had asked for Booktrust to be given the £6 . million-a-year grant without having to make a special bid for it. But he . denied Mrs Clegg’s link to the charity had been used in any way and . said there had been ‘no wrongdoing’. Mrs Clegg, who uses her professional . name Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, hosted a lavish reception for Booktrust . in October at one of London’s most grandiose venues, historic Lancaster . House. Suggestion of impropriety is 'completely wrong': The decision to fast-track the money was made by Education Secretary Michael Gove . Mr Sanders confirmed he sent emails . to the Education Department asking for the charity to get the money . directly – and that he had said Mr Clegg favoured the move. He said he . had mentioned Mrs Clegg with regard to Booktrust, but only with regards . to the event. He added: ‘I asked for a briefing from officials before . attending the Booktrust event. But I did not mention her name with . regard to funding.’ Significantly, the emails were sent . from Mr Sanders’ official Cabinet Office email address, meaning they can . be subject to future scrutiny. Mr Clegg’s spokeswoman said there was . nothing improper about Mr Clegg’s close interest in the Booktrust . grant. ‘Any suggestion of impropriety is completely wrong,’ she said. ‘Miriam has no role within the charity, beyond being supportive of its . excellent work.’ The decision to fast-track the money . was made by Education Secretary Michael Gove on the advice of officials, . she said. And a No 10 spokesman said that David Cameron also fully . backed the decision. Mr Clegg’s spokeswoman also said: ‘Miriam has no role in any decisions made by the Government.’ Mr Sanders, who also advises Lib Dem . Schools Minister David Laws, said he made it clear to officials that . both he and Mr Clegg believed Booktrust should be given the £6 million a . year without having to bid for it. He said other officials supported . this view and that the final decision was taken by Mr Gove. There is no . suggestion of any wrongdoing by Booktrust, which has given away 40 . million books to schoolchildren in the past 20 years. It has received . Government grants since 2004. Thankful: Booktrust chief executive Viv Bird said of the funding: 'I am grateful to Ministers for this vote of confidence' In 2011, the Department for Education . awarded it £13.5 million over two years; and last Thursday the charity . announced that it had secured another £6 million for both 2013/14 and . 2014/15. Chief executive Viv Bird said: ‘I am grateful to Ministers for . this vote of confidence.’ At the charity’s 20th anniversary . party in October, Spanish-born Mrs Clegg said she fell in love with . Britain through reading Enid Blyton’s stories and was keen to encourage . her three sons to read. She quoted Roald Dahl’s Oompa Loompa song, from . Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, ‘So please, oh please, we beg, we . pray, Go throw your TV set away, And in its place you can install, A . lovely bookshelf on the wall.’ The book formed the theme for Mr Clegg’s Christmas party for Lib Dem MPs last week. On the Booktrust’s website, Mrs Clegg . is quoted praising The Gruffalo as ‘the single favourite book at home’ and last night she and her husband attended a stage production of . Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson’s Room On The Broom in London. Inquiry into how grant was made: Tory MP Peter Bone (right) says Mr Clegg will have 'serious questions to answer' on the award of public money and Labour MP John Mann (left) said MPs should not interfere on behalf of a body . Last night, Labour and Tory MPs . called for an inquiry into how the Booktrust grant was made, and for all . relevant emails to be published. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘If there . was undue influence over the award of this money, Mr Clegg will have . very serious questions to answer. ‘No one is questioning the good work . of this charity but I would be very concerned if communications from his . office have been used to influence the award of public money. There . should be a Cabinet Office inquiry and I will be writing to the Cabinet . Secretary about this.’ Labour MP John Mann said: ‘Any grant involving public money must be handled the right way. Ministers should not interfere on . behalf of one body. There needs to be a full inquiry and that means . publishing all relevant communications.’ As part of a savings drive, Booktrust . and other similar groups had been told that this year they would have . to compete for a share of a £60 million Government pot – submitting a . proposal before January.","Booktrust announced it had secured £6m for each of the next two years while other charities will have to wait until next year .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 14:16 EST, 6 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:49 EST, 7 March 2013 . Millions of families were today spared the threat of having to split up their household rubbish into at least five separate bags and boxes. A judge rejected a legal bid by the recycling industry - backed by green pressure groups - to enforce rigorous new recycling rules on every home in the country. The new recycling regime would have required every council to demand that householders separate their rubbish for recycling into different bins for paper, metal, plastic and glass. Complicated: Seven recycling firms made a legal bid for strict new recycling rules that would force every home in the country to use different bins or bags for paper, metal, plastic and glass - such as this street in Stoke on Trent . The system would have meant families would also have had to use yet more bins for food and non-recycling rubbish, and for garden waste. Seven recycling firms who are part of the Campaign for Real Recycling - an organisation also backed by environmental groups including Friends of the Earth - said the complicated recycling rules are necessary to meet the demands of the EU's Waste Framework Directive. Currently, around four in tens homes in England and Wales have rubbish collection rules in force . But in a judicial review heard in the . High Court in Cardiff, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said it was . 'unambiguously clear' that local councils had a right to set their own . rules on how to recycle, based on economic and technical practicalities. The decision comes against a background of continuing political tension over how household rubbish is collected. Local councils, and both Labour and Coalition governments, have faced discontent from voters following the introduction of compulsory recycling schemes. These include the notorious fortnightly collection systems and kitchen slopbucket collections in which families can be asked to use as many as nine different bins. Last month the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs admitted that much of the household waste collected for recycling in fact goes to landfill, and that published recycling figures are exaggerated. It acknowledged that a high proportion of rubbish put out for recycling by householders is rejected by recycling processors as too impure for use in processing plants. At the same time DEFRA also conceded for the first time that recycling rules have been set out not to meet any British requirements but to comply with the terms of the Brussels directive. About four in 10 homes in England and Wales already have rubbish collection rules that demand they use separate bins for paper, metal, plastics and glass. The recycling firms who brought the Cardiff judicial review said that in order to comply with EU rules householders should be made to ensure that recycling is carefully sorted before it is collected by the binmen. Waste: DEFRA has admitted that much of the household waste collected for recycling still goes to landfill . Mr Justice Hickinbottom said in his . ruling: 'They are all members of the Campaign for Real Recycling, and . their commercial interest in this claim is underpinned by a strong . belief in the environmental benefits of recycling.' Local councils have faced discontent from voters over compulsory recycling schemes - such as the kitchen slopbuckets, pictured . The companies said the EU Waste . Framework Directive, agreed in 2008 and which went into operation in . 2010, sets down that 'waste shall be collected separately if . technically, environmentally and economically practicable, and shall not . be mixed with other waste or other material with different properties.' But the judge said that the primary objective of the EU regulation was the protection of the environment and public health, not the enforcement of separate collection of waste. 'It would be contrary to principle, and fundamentally incongruous, if the directive were to require separate collection of each of the four waste streams, if such collection were not necessary to achieve the higher objectives of the directive,' Mr Justice Hickinbottom said. 'The evidence before me does not begin to justify the assertion that such collection is in all circumstances necessary for the achievement of the directive's objectives or any of them.' The judge refused the recycling companies the right to take their claim to the EU's Court of Justice in Luxembourg. A spokesman for DEFRA said after the judgement was made public: 'This ruling shows our interpretation of the Waste Framework Directive is right. 'It recognises that it is for local authorities to decide, within the law, whether separate recycling collections are necessary and practicable. 'We will continue to work with local authorities, the waste industry and other partners to provide waste services that meet the needs of local communities and improve the quality of recycling.'","Campaign for Real Recycling says new tough rules are needed to meet the EU's Waste Framework Directive .

"By . Catherine Ostler . PUBLISHED: . 19:58 EST, 6 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:01 EST, 7 March 2013 . Carole Middleton's influence is increasing to such a degree that some are suggesting she and husband Michael be given a title . With the words ‘I’ll take the teddy for my dau . . .’ during a walkabout in Grimsby on Tuesday, the Duchess of Cambridge perhaps let slip what the world has been waiting to know — the gender of the royal baby. Is she expecting a girl? Certainly, she is pregnant enough to know one way or the other. As the Palace has announced that the baby is due in July, Kate must be at least 23 weeks pregnant. An ultrasound between 18 and 22 weeks can reveal the sex for those who want to be told. Some tests — amniocentesis, for example, which screens for Down’s syndrome — can provide an answer at 15 weeks. Either way, when the Duchess laughingly protested ‘We’re not telling!’ to one of the Grimsby well-wishers who suggested that she knew whether she was expecting a boy or a girl, it was surely a hint that she definitely knows. Should we see any pink paint being smuggled into Kensington Palace, Apartment 1a, which is currently being refurbished, we won’t be surprised. The prospect of a little Princess increases the already strong chances that this baby will be brought up royal, but essentially a Middleton. Some royal watchers think William has become one. As a first granddaughter naturally gravitates towards her maternal grandmother, and Carole has raised two daughters (in a highly dedicated fashion) and Charles none, this naturally strengthens her position even further. At some stage, Carole will effectively become the Queen Mother anyway. Indeed, her influence is increasing to such a degree that some are suggesting she (and husband Michael) be given a title. Of course, the Queen will take an active interest in her new heir or heiress. So there will be no shortage of strong female role models for the little Princess. THE NAME GAME . The smart money is on Elizabeth, a nod to the Queen, and both Carole and Kate’s middle name. Contenders for the middle name are Carole, Diana, or Frances — Diana’s middle name, after her mother. Although Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have wangled themselves in front of Kate in the royal pecking order, they will have to curtsey to Kate and William’s child. There’s no way round that one, girls. If the Duchess does have a girl, she might name her Elizabeth, as a nod to the Queen. It is also both Carole and Kate's middle name . TIMELESS TOYS . There would be minimal pink plastic for a princess. This is where a royal girl would come into her own: perhaps she alone would be allowed to play with Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House, the exquisite mini-palace at Windsor, which was designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. Or ‘France’ and Marianne’, the blonde and brunette dolls presented by the French to the Queen and her sister Princess Margaret in 1938, who came with a 360-piece trousseau, including cases by Louis Vuitton, handbags by Hermès and Cartier jewellery. Then there is ‘The Little House’ or Y Bwthyn Bach, a straw thatched cottage given to the Queen and Princess Margaret by the people of Wales in 1932. It is in the garden of the Duke of York’s house, Royal Lodge, at Windsor, and is the perfect spot for playing with elegant little tea sets on summer days. NANNY DILEMMA . The Duchess of Cambridge could have let slip what the world has been waiting to know during a walkabout in Grimsby . There’s no word on whether Kate will have a maternity nurse — if she does, she had better get them to sign a confidentiality agreement because they are usually terrible gossips. There has been talk of her not having her nanny. She may go down the fashionable route (like Gwyneth Paltrow and many others) of having a housekeeper who does childcare duties. This allows the mother rather smugly to say at trendy West London supper parties: ‘I don’t have a nanny.’ If Kate does employ one, a girl will perhaps require a less boisterous type than William and Harry’s former companion Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who loved to romp around with the small princes. Those discreet sorts at the leading firms, Kensington Nannies and Norland, will be waiting for the call . . . WHICH SCHOOL? All the nearest nursery schools, including the Minors Nursery School in Pembridge Square, a short walk across Kensington Gardens, are co-ed. There are several girls’ schools close by, too — Pembridge Hall, sister school of Wetherby (Prince William’s alma mater), and Glendower in South Kensington. But given how much Kate hated all-girls’ Downe House and loved mixed Marlborough, perhaps she will favour co-ed. In which case she might choose between Norland Place on Holland Park Avenue, famous for its emphasis on manners as well as academics, or the more theatrical Thomas’s in Kensington. Other parents at these bastions of privilege will include the English upper middle classes and the international super-rich, keen to give their children an English education — and befriend our future monarch. Whichever establishment Kate chooses can probably get away with doubling the fees the moment the news leaks, given that there is talk of the socially aspirational who live close to Kensington Palace timing their pregnancies as close to Kate’s as possible. BABY FASHION . Move over, Harper Beckham. With a mother who can make wellies sell by the shopload when she pulls them on, the marketing power of a princess would be boundless. A July tot can cool off in frothy dresses with matching pants to cover her nappy. First port of call — though packages will probably arrive without asking — would be the Marie Chantal shop a short pram ride away. Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece designs some of the prettiest girls’ clothes in London, and William is godfather to one of her children, Charles another. These days, a Babygro with angel wings is a must. For later on, a floaty ‘Princess’ dress is £220. A princess would have no shortage of strong female role models . Otherwise there is Rachel Riley in Pont Street — as well as Notting Hill’s fashionable ‘Ilovegorgeous’. Who did they have in mind when they designed a mauve ‘Catherine’ baby dress at £46? As this would be the only girl in England who doesn’t need to indulge a Princess fantasy, we may well see tasteful restraint. THE HEIR'S HAIR . Pippa Middleton could have plenty of advice for any princess parties . Roving hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker cut William’s and Harry’s hair when they were boys and went on the Asian tour last year with Kate. She could do mother and daughter at the same time. A BLING BED . It must be the most regal Moses basket in the world. Furniture shop for Chelsea rich kids, Dragons of Walton Street, makes one called the ‘Elizabeth Taylor’ which has hand-cut glass crystals and French Chantilly lace draping down from the basket. The hood can be made with a coronet on it (a snip at £5,995). Well, a princess can hardly sleep in one from Ikea. PRINCESS PARTIES . These will be the most sought-after invitations — on the junior West London circuit, anyway. But granny Carole and Aunt Pippa will come into their own. ‘Celebrate with a cake’, as Pippa might have written in her book. The Middletons’ firm Party Pieces provides ‘Princess Castle’ and ‘1st Birthday Princess’ ranges of paper plates, cups, banners and other party goods — but that might be a touch naff in the circumstances. P.S. Of course, there is always the possibility that when the Duchess said ‘I’ll take the teddy for my dau . . .’ she was about to say ‘dog’, or ‘darling son’, or even ‘delinquent husband . . .’","Duchess of Cambridge perhaps let slip gender of the royal baby .

The student started staying over in Feenstra's guest room while the teacher's husband was away. Feenstra now faces charges of an improper relationship with a student after the girl complained in September 2012 that Feenstra has been constantly  calling her since she tried to end their relationship and turning up to her work place.

William Moody, better known to pro wrestling fans as Paul Bearer, the pasty-faced, urn-carrying manager for performers The Undertaker and Kane, has died, the WWE said. He was 58. Mr Moody's family notified the WWE of his death on Tuesday but no formal cause was released, a spokesman for the wrestling company said. TMZ reports that Mr Moody suffered a blood clot three days before his death. After stints in various independent wrestling promotions, Mr Moody joined the WWE in 1990 and quickly became associated with The Undertaker, a character who claimed he was undead and boasted of mystical powers. The WWE said in a statement that Mr Moody, 'went on to become a memorable part of WWE over the course of the next 20 years.' In . the WWE plotline, Paul Bearer later managed Undertaker's on-screen . half-brother Kane. He also managed the bad-guy character Mick 'Mankind' Foley.

In his final WWE appearance last year, Paul Bearer was locked in a freezer by Randy Orton and left there tied up even after he was found by Kane. That was Mr Moody's life in the WWE. And it was a business he loved for nearly 40 years. Many of his colleagues paid tribute to him on Wednesday on Twitter. 'Rest in peace, Paul Bearer. You will never be forgotten. There will never be another,' wrote wrestler Triple H. On March 2 he allegedly told people at a Cauliflower Alley Club reunion that he was seeking treatment for 'respiratory issues.' The president of the wrestling society, Bob Kelly, told TMZ that Mr Moody was hospitalized immediately after the reunion. Moody was a perfect fit as a macabre mortician. When he joined the WWE, he ditched the blond hair and Percy Pringle name he forged in the 1980s for jet black locks complete with powdered white face.

Richard D'Alauro, a representative of the pro-firearm NRA for the city, can no longer own or buy guns because of an order of protection made after a domestic incident with his wife at their Long Island home. Suffolk County authorities filed a noncriminal charge of harassment as a result of the confrontation, which took place in September 2010.

Police were forced to make two trips to confiscate the 62-year-old's arsenal of 39 pistols, shotguns and rifles, Maribeth D’Alauro, who has since divorced her husband, told the New York Daily News. A transcript of the proceedings, which took place in October at Suffolk County Court, show the NRA official admitted to the harassment charge and admitted that he intended to 'harass, annoy or alarm' his wife'by subjecting her to physical contact'. Under federal and state law, convicted domestic abusers are forbidden from purchasing firearms and he can no longer buy or own firearms until October this year, when his guns will be returned.

'He believes Kevin could very well be finished and will be quietly sidelined and then written out. 'He says that he just wishes he could fast forward to his trial so he can show the nation he is innocent and get on with the rest of his life.

He is said to have been drowning his sorrows in his local pub, The Railway in Hale, Greater Manchester. The friend said the Weatherfield star, real name Michael Turner, was devastated when told Kevin would be temporarily written out while he fought the charges, but 'understands that ITV's hands are tied'. A Corrie source said of Le Vell's fears he would be axed from the soap: 'No one here has given him any cause to feel that way or have those concerns.' An ITV spokesman said: 'Given the serious nature of these charges, Michael Le Vell will not be appearing in Coronation Street pending the outcome of legal proceedings. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.' MailOnline has contacted the actor's legal team for a comment.

A Florida doctor sent his pregnant patient an email saying that he would call the police and have them force her to the hospital after she refused to give birth to her high-risk child. The case is still going on as Lisa Epsteen refuses to give in and have a C-section even though that is the way she gave birth to her first four children. When Mrs Epsteen, 35, became pregnant with her fifth child, she resolved to have a vaginal birth even though some view that as a more difficult and potentially complicated process after having given birth via caesarean four previous times. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sticking to her plan: Lisa Epsteen, 35, gave birth to her four prior children via C-section though she refuses to take multiple doctor's advice and have a similar procedure for her fifth child even though her baby is at risk and a week past the due date . Big family: Lisa Epsteen had four C-sections with her older children (pictured) but now wants to have a natural birth if possible, though she has scheduled a C-section on Friday in case she doesn't go into labor . According to The Tampa Bay Times, her due date passed a week ago, she had a worrying doctor's appointment on Friday, and then another one on Tuesday where other doctors asked her to stay in the hospital and give birth right then. She brushed those concerns away and stuck to her plan to give birth naturally, but the moment where she got truly upset was when her physician, Dr Jerry Yankowitz, sent her the threatening note in an effort to push her into action. 'I am deeply concerned that you are contributing to a very high probability that your fetus will die or your child will incur brain damage if born alive. At this time, you must come in for delivery,' Dr Yankowitz wrote in the letter. He is the chairman of the University of South Florida's obstetrics and gynecology department, and though he initially agreed to take Mrs Epsteen on as a patient and help her towards a vaginal birth, the circumstances have changed. 'I would hate to move to the most extreme option, which is having law enforcement pick you up at your home and bring you in, but you are leaving the providers of USF/TGH no choice,' he wrote. Expert: Dr Jerry Yankowitz is the head of obstetrics at the University of South Florida hospital and he sent her an email saying he would call police if Mrs Epsteen didn't go to the hospital immediately . 'In a couple of hours there are going to be cops on my doorstep taking me away from home — in front of my children — to force me into having surgery.' Instead of sending her speeding out to the hospital, Mrs Epsteen got angry and reportedly told the Tampa Bay Times that she called a support group called National Advocates for Pregnant Women because she felt his actions were illegal. The group sided with her in spite of the fact that multiple doctors told her that her baby was in distress on Tuesday, and that because she had developed gestational diabetes she was at an additionally high risk point in her pregnancy. When doctors at the University of South Florida hospital told her that she should give birth right then, she determined that their joint concern was unfounded, and felt that it was the wrong time to give birth because no one would be able to watch her 2-year-old child and her husband was still at work with no way to get to the hospital since she had used the family's only car. The University of South Florida would not comment on the issue to MailOnline, saying that they respect patients privacy. Water views: Doctors at USF wanted her to stay and have the baby after an appointment on Tuesday but she refused because there would be no one to watch her 2-year-old child and her husband was unable to get out of work . The New York-based advocacy group had a lawyer call the doctor and tell him to stop his threats against Mrs Epsteen. 'The threat he was making was both legally and ethically unjustifiable,' the group's attorney Farah Diaz-Tello said told MailOnline. 'The problem is not that her doctor . recommended that she have a caesarean section; the problem is that her . doctor threatened her with arrest if she didn't have a Caesarean . section.' Excited: Mrs Epsteen posted a video of the moment that she told her husband that she was pregnant with their fifth child = . Ms Diaz-Tello said that expectant mothers in Florida have extra reason to be nervous about the threat of law enforcement involvement, as two infamous cases stand out as warning signs. In the 1990s, a woman named Laura Pemberton wanted to have a Vaginal Birth After Caesarean (VBAC) and wanted to have the child at home with the aid of a midwife. Because she became dehydrated, Ms Pemberton went to a local hospital to get treated for that before returning to her home to have a natural birth. Once doctors learned of her plans, they sent a sheriff to her home to force her to have a C-section at the hospital. Another case occurred more recently in 2009, when Samantha Burton wanted to ask for a second opinion about whether or not she was going to miscarry as she was experiencing symptoms at the 25th week in the pregnancy. Rather than provide her with a second opinion, doctors got a court order to keep her on bedrest at the hospital for the rest of the pregnancy. She was eventually had a C-section, at which time doctors realized that the child had already died. Even though Mrs Epsteen has been so adamantly opposing having a C-section for the fifth time- repeatedly refusing various doctor's suggestions and even going against the news that her baby boy is not in an ideal position for a vaginal birth- she went ahead and scheduled one on Friday. 'Honestly, I feel abandoned. There has . to be a level of trust between provider and patient, and that has been . betrayed,' she told The Tampa Bay Times. In . light of the legal action, Dr Yankowitz sent a follow-up email saying . that he will not send the police to get her but he remains convinced . that 'you and your child are in jeopardy'. Borderline: Victoria Beckham famously had her fourth C-section with her daughter Harper, pushing what many doctors believe is the upper limit for how many caesaraen procedures many women can undergo . While the idea of having a natural . birth seems like a woman's right, there are some serious health concerns . in this particular situation because of Mrs Epsteen's history of having . four prior Caesarean operations. And the practice is common, since 29.1 per cent of all births in the U.S. in 2005 were via caesarean. The . practice of having a Vaginal Birth After Caesaraen (VBAC) has dropped . significantly in popularity and practice after a damning 1999 study. The . greatest risk that VBAC poses is uterine rupture, as the scar tissue . that forms around a woman's womb during a C-section could rip during a . natural birth, which could cause 'a catastrophic risk to the mother and . baby'. Because the . scar tissue can harden over time, many doctors consider three the 'safe' upper limit for having C-sections, with four instances happening from . time to time but still a rarity. One . of the most noted instances of the procedure is that of Victoria . Beckham who famously had her fourth C-section procedure when she gave . birth to her daughter Harper. According . to consultant obstetrician and gynecologist Clive Spence-Jones, a . fourth Caesarean — or even a fifth or sixth — is not the automatic . health disaster many people assume it to be, although risks do exist. 'Caesarean . surgeries become more dangerous for the mother the more surgeries you . have... there is an increasing risks to the baby but the risks to the . mother also becomes significant,' attorney Farah Diaz-Tello told .

Underground oceans could be bubbling up to the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa, scientists believe - making it the perfect place to look for life. A new paper has detailed the strongest evidence yet that salty water from the huge liquid ocean beneath Europa’s frozen surface actually makes its way to the moon’s surface – reinforcing suggestions that there could be life on Europa. The research suggests there is a chemical exchange between the ocean and surface, making the ocean a richer chemical environment. Illustration shows Europa in the foreground with Jupiter to the right and lo - another of Jupiter's moons - in the middle . The report was compiled by Professor Mike Brown, an astronomer . at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, and . Kevin Hand from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also in Pasaden. The exchange between the ocean and the surface, Professor Brown said, ‘means that energy might be going into the ocean, which is important in terms of the possibilities for life there. ‘It also means that if you'd like to know what's in the ocean, you can just go to the surface and scrape some off.’ Europa's ocean is thought to cover the moon's whole globe and is about 60 miles deep under a thin ice shell. Scientists have long debated the composition of Europa’s surface. Now, using the Keck II Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, Professor Brown and Mr Hand have identified indications of the presence of a magnesium sulphate salt, a mineral called epsomite, that could have formed by oxidation of a mineral likely originating from the ocean below. The researchers started their study by mapping the distribution of pure water ice versus anything else. Then, at low latitudes - the area with the greatest concentration of the non-water ice material - they found a tiny, never-before-detected, change in the results. The two researchers tested everything from sodium chloride to Drano in Mr Hand's laboratory where he tries to simulate the environments found on various icy worlds. At the end of the day, the signature of magnesium sulphate persisted. Salty water from the huge liquid ocean beneath Europa's frozen surface makes its way to the moon's surface, scientists believe . The authors, who are publishing their report in the Astronomical Journal, believe that this magnesium sulphate is generated from magnesium chloride salt which originates in Europa’s ocean. The scientists also believe the composition of Europa's ocean may closely resemble the salty ocean of Earth. Europa is considered a premier target in the search for life beyond Earth, Mr Hand said. A NASA-funded study team is working with the scientific community to identify options to explore Europa further. ‘If we've learned anything about life on Earth, it's that where there's liquid water, there's generally life,’ Mr Hand said. ‘And of course our ocean is a nice, salty ocean. Perhaps Europa's salty ocean is also a wonderful place for life.’ Europa is the sixth closest moon to Jupiter and the smallest of the four Galilean satellites that belong to the planet. It was discovered by Galileo Galilei in January 1610 and is named after a Phoenician noblewoman in Greek mythology who was courted by Zeus and became the Queen of Crete. Europa orbits Jupiter in around three-and-a-half days with an orbital radius of 670,900km. It is slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, but at 3,100km in diameter it is the sixth largest moon and 15th largest object in the entire solar system. It is likely to have an outer layer of water, some 100km thick. The outer layer of the water is believed to be frozen with a liquid ocean underneath. It is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface, which is tectonically active and relatively young.","Water from the ocean inside Europa makes its way to the surface .

A wife accused of killing six of her children in a fire planned with her husband told police she was 'basically his housemaid', a court heard today. Mairead Philpott was questioned by police after she and husband Mick were arrested on suspicion of starting the fatal fire at their . three-bedroom house in Allenton, Derby, last May. Nottingham Crown Court heard how Mrs Philpott, 31, believed her husband, 56, preferred his mistress Lisa Willis - who lived under the same roof as the pair - to her. Mairead Philpott, pictured with husband Mick, told detectives she was 'basically his housemaid' and that he preferred his mistress Lisa Willis, who shared a house with the couple . She said initially she and Ms Willis shared the housework but said that in the past three or four years she had 'done everything'. Mrs Philpott told Sergeant Joanne James, of Derbyshire Police, in an interview 18 days after the fire that she was overlooked by her husband, who favoured Ms Willis. The court heard that Mrs Philpott said: 'Lisa was just there for herself. 'For some reason they (Philpott and Ms Willis) just got so close. He would take Lisa everywhere with him, and it would only be me and him on the odd occasion. 'For the first few years, me and Lisa did the housework together. We were like sisters. 'But for the last three or four years I have done everything. I was basically a housemaid. 'I was upset, but I did not question it. I thought ""I am happy here at home with the kids"".' Six siblings died as a result of the . fire on May 11 - Jade, 10, and brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, . six and Jayden, five, died during the blaze. Six children, aged between five and 13, died in the blaze at the house in Allenton, Derby, last May . Their brother Duwayne, 13, was taken . to Derby Royal Hospital and transferred to Birmingham Children’s . Hospital, but died three days later. Their parents, Mick and Mairead . Philpott, and a third defendant, Paul Mosley, 46, are on trial over the . deaths of the children. They have each denied six counts of . manslaughter. Mairead Philpott told detectives she and Lisa Willis were once like 'sisters' The prosecution claim the children’s . deaths were the result of a botched 'plan' to frame 56-year-old . Philpott’s former mistress, Lisa Willis. Jurors at the trial were also told that Mr Philpott repeatedly asked his wife for a divorce so he could marry Ms Willis but wanted her to remain living at the same house together. In her interviews with detectives, Mrs Philpott denied any involvement in starting the blaze, and said she did not know who was responsible. She claimed she and her husband were . woken by a smoke alarm and made their way from the conservatory where . they slept into a lounge at the front of the house. But Mrs Philpott said the couple then heard a 'popping' sound before huge flames tore into the lounge from the hallway area. She . told officers they escaped out of the back of the house, where Mr . Philpott tried to rescue his children from their upstairs bedrooms using . a ladder while she 'screamed hysterically in the garden'.

The body of a man has been found in his car next to a busy road in New Zealand after lying undiscovered for five days. Alvin Singh, 34, was found next to an intersection in Papatoetoe, Auckland, after a resident raised the alarm. He was last seen leaving his home in Mangere on February 22 - but his body was not found until last Wednesday. Discovery: Alvin Singh, 34, was found dead in his car near this busy intersection in Auckland, New Zealand . A 2006 transport survey showed an average of nearly 20,000 cars a day used the section of Puhinui Rd where Mr Singh died, the New Zealand Herald reports. Detective Inspector Mark Gutry said a neighbour living nearby had reported the body to police after the car remained on the busy road for five days. Det Insp Gutry said it was unusual for a body to lay undiscovered for such a long period of time, but that it was not easy to spot Mr Singh in the car because his body was in a lying position, reports Stuff.co.nz. He said Mr Singh had been in the front of the car, which was reclined, and was 'rolled over' on the seat. The death is not being treated as suspicious and there was nothing in the car to indicate how he died, Det Insp Gutry said. An autopsy was inconclusive. It is understood Mr Singh likely died because of a medical condition - with police waiting for further test results to reveal a possible cause. Strange: Detective Inspector Mark Gutry said it was 'unusual' for a body to lay undiscovered for so long . CCTV footage of the site where Mr Singh, a Fijian, was found, showed him walking around his car and then getting in again. Mr Singh had been convicted of forgery and providing false information in relation to immigration fraud in December 2011 and sentenced to five months home detention. His partner, Ravina Singh, was sentenced to 11 months home detention after admitting to 30 charges relating to an immigration scam. She was later jailed in November last year after admitting a charge of perverting the course of justice, according to the Herald.","Body of Alvin Singh, 34, found slumped in his car in Auckland .

But the similarities with the film end there, as these real-life wartime sweethearts did live happily ever after, and recently celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary.

Happily ever after: The wartime sweethearts, seen on their wedding day in 1943, have celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary .

Railway . worker Thomas helped Ethel and a friend from the train onto the station . platform before fate threw them together again the following evening at . the nearby Grey Mare Hotel. Thomas, who lives with his wife on Alfred Street, Bury, said: 'I worked there part-time as a waiter, but it was her friend who fancied me and she'd brought Ethel along. Chance meeting: The Bramwells, now 89, met again the following night at the Grey Mare Hotel . 'I had other ideas and managed to get Ethel on her own for a moment and I asked her to go dancing with me in town the following night. It was the best decision I ever made.' The couple, who both hail from east Manchester, were married less than a year later on February 27, 1943, at St Cross Church in Clayton. Within weeks of their wedding, Thomas was called up to serve with the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa and Italy during the Second World War. His military service caused him to miss the birth of his eldest son Geoffrey, who he saw for the first time as a two-year-old when he returned home in 1946. Younger son David followed three years later. Thomas and Ethel then both worked at the Clayton Aniline Company - he as an engineer and her in the dyestuffs lab - until they retired after more than 30 years. The proud couple welcomed more than 50 guests, including their three grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren at a 70th wedding anniversary celebration at the Red Hall Hotel in Bury. The Bramwells admit they could never have dreamed of reaching such a momentous milestone when they wed. Thomas said: 'When we met we were in the middle of the war and you lived each minute to the next as you never knew when your time would be up.

Brain surgery has helped women with severe anorexia put on weight for the first time since their illness began, say researchers. They used a ‘pacemaker’ to stimulate areas of the brain responsible for symptoms of depression, anxiety and obsessive thoughts involved in the eating disorder. Within nine months half the patients had gained weight and their symptoms had improved, while others had stabilised their weight. The pacemaker stimulates areas of the brain responsible for depression, anxiety and obsessive thoughts . Researchers in Canada used a technique . known as deep brain stimulation (DBS) which has successfully helped . people suffering from Parkinson’s and chronic pain. Patients . having DBS are fitted with a neurostimulator, a device similar to a . heart pacemaker, which is connected to electrodes placed in certain . parts of the brain. The . electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the . person’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to . stimulate the brain. When switched on, the patient benefits from the blocking of abnormal nerve signals which trigger the disabling symptoms. The . small study of six patients reported in The Lancet medical journal was . designed to test safety, but researchers said DBS appeared to be capable . of treating severe anorexia. In . a commentary, UK experts Professor Janet Treasure and Professor Ulrike . Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry, said the . findings were ‘promising’ for patients who had failed on conventional . treatments. They said ‘New effective treatments for these patients are sorely needed. ‘The . fact that the procedure was associated in some patients with . improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance, . since such improvements will go some way towards reassuring patients . that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up . without making them feel better.’ There are around 90,000 Britons with eating disorders including anorexia, which often start in the early teens. A record number of 1,600 people - mostly girls and women - were given hospital treatment for anorexia in 2011. The . parents of Laura Willmott, 18, last month spoke out against the care . system for failing their daughter who collapsed and died after starving . herself to barely five stone in weight. She . had been battling anorexia for five years, but was discharged from . hospital after 11 days when doctors ruled she was ‘physically fit’ without telling her family because she was over 18. She died from a . heart attack two weeks later. Tragedy: Laura Wilmott, 18, died after a five-year battle with anorexia . The new study recruited six women aged between 24 and 57, who had been suffering from anorexia for between four and 37 years. Researchers based at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify a specific area of the brain previously targeted for DBS in patients with depression. The target area was given stimulation and three months later, five of the six patients stabilised or gained weight. After nine months, three patients were maintaining a higher weight than before the treatment started - the longest period of sustained weight gain any had achieved since their illness began. Around half of the patients also experienced improvements in their mood or reduced obsessive-compulsive behaviour. Researcher Dr Andres Lozano, a leading neurosurgeon in the field of DBS, said it appeared to have a genuine effect on the illness. ‘The finding of improvements in mood and anxiety in patients who were still underweight is especially striking, in view of the well known poor response of underweight patients to conventional pharmacotherapies or psychotherapies’ he added.","Half patients had gained weight after nine month trial .

An amorous tortoise managed to burn down the conservatory he lived in - killing both himself and his partner - while trying to mate after emerging from hibernation . It is believed Henry the tortoise knocked over his own heating lamp in his rush to get acquainted with his mate Alice, which in turn set fire to wood chippings and caused the blaze in his home in Thornaby, Teesside. His owner, Alf Clayton, believes Henry - who he described as 'a bit of a one' -  woke from hibernation and began chasing Alice around. The ruins left after amorous tortoise Henry knocked over his heating lamp while trying to mate with partner Alice. The blaze sadly killed the romantic pair when it broke just before 8pm on Saturday evening . Mr Clayton said: 'Henry had woken up and was trying to mate with his partner. 'He always was a bit of a one and had chased her around and must have knocked the heater over.' The heater set fire to wood shavings, destroying the conservatory and damaging the garage and its roof. Both Henry and Alice were killed in the fire. Mr Clayton, a retired local authority worker, said the tortoises were his wife Gayner's pride and joy. He said: 'She's devastated. 'Firefighters who attended said they would have perished from smoke inhalation and wouldn't have suffered.' He praised a neighbour who alerted the couple to the blaze before 8pm on Saturday night. Mr Clayton said: 'They spotted smoke coming out of our garage next to our home. 'My wife and I ran out. We managed to get the car out of the garage and then the conservatory, where the tortoises were, burst into flames. The heater set fire to wood shavings, destroying the conservatory and damaging the garage and its roof . 'There was no way we could get them out - it was too intense. We tried.

Mrs Clayton works at Middlesbrough's Roseberry Park Hospital mental health centre. Neither pensioner was hurt, but Mr Clayton is contacting insurers and says the cost amounts to 'many thousands'. He said: 'If it hadn't been for our neighbour, it could have spread to our house. 'I also praise the fire brigade, who got here in minutes.' Fire crews from Thornaby attended the home to put the blaze out. A Cleveland Fire Brigade spokesman said the cause was accidental - an incubator lamp appeared to have set material alight.","Henry the tortoise knocked over his own heating lamp in his rush to mate .

RBS must be split into a ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bank and returned to the private sector sooner rather than later, Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King urged today. In a surprisingly outspoken criticism of how RBS has been run, the outgoing governor said the Government had failed to take decisive action to overhaul RBS and called the current system a ‘nonsense’. He said the bank must undergo a radical restructure within a year to create a healthy lender. Taxpayers will have to bear the costs of reprivatisation, he said, warning that RBS is currently holding the wider economy back. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Sir Mervyn King called for RBS to be reprivatised . 'The whole idea of a bank being 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer, run at arms' length from the government, is a nonsense. It cannot make any sense,' he told a parliamentary committee. 'The arguments for restructuring sooner rather than later are powerful ones.' He added it was 'not beyond the wit of man' to split RBS into a 'good' and 'bad' bank to ensure the cleaned-up group could support lending and boost economic recovery efforts. 'The lessons of history is that we . should face up to it - it's worth less than we thought and we should . accept that and get back to finding a way to create a new RBS that could . be a major lender to the UK economy,' he said. Sir . Mervyn's comments will come as a blow after RBS boss Stephen Hester . last week insisted the bank's return to the private sector was on track . and could be completed within two years. They also come just days after Chancellor George Osborne appeared to rule out a split and reprivatisation of the bank. The Chancellor told Commission on . Banking Standards last week that the process could take up to three . years and cost between £8billion and £10billion to buy out minority . shareholders in RBS. Differing views: RBS boss Stephen Hester insisted last week the return to the private sector was on track . ‘The obstacles to your approach [splitting and reprivatising the bank] are very considerable ... One has to ask whether the benefits of that two or three-year process would greatly outweigh the benefits of the current strategy,’ he argued. Sir Mervyn King today said he had discussed his view with the Chancellor, but acknowledged that it would be difficult to push through reforms from a 'presentational' point of view because they would increase levels of national debt. Shares in RBS fell after King's comments and were trading at 312p in mid-morning trading, down 0.8 per cent on the day. King said it should not take more than a year to a carry out a much more decisive restructuring of RBS than efforts to date. The Bank has taken an increasingly tough line on the amount of capital banks hold and the government has chosen Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, a leader of the global push for stronger banking regulation, to succeed King at the Bank in July. RBS last week claimed improvements in the core bank would see it return to financial health next year as it reported underlying group operating profits nearly doubling to £3.5 billion in 2012 from £1.8 billion in 2011. But bottom-line figures revealed the fifth year of losses since its £45.5 billion government bailout in 2008, plunging into the red by £5.2 billion in 2012. The Bank also hit out at European Union plans to impose a cap on banker bonuses, warning they will fail to rein in excessive pay and will only force up fixed salaries that cannot be clawed back. Proposals revealed last week to limit bonuses to a maximum of a year's salary or double that if explicitly backed by shareholders, will act as a ‘distraction’ to efforts to change the culture of pay within the banking industry, according to Sir Mervyn. Andrew Bailey, incoming deputy governor at the Bank and chief executive designate of the new Prudential Regulation Authority, added it could set back recent progress made to reduce overall bonus pools, defer awards and introduce clawbacks of past bonuses. ‘My concern is that in setting this limit, it runs the risk of pushing up fixed remuneration - that's cash out of the door and it's much harder to get that back if needed,’ said Mr Bailey.","Taxpayers will have to bear the costs of reprivatisation, King warns .

Parents are turning their little girls into ‘pink potentates’ by allowing them to dress up as princesses every single day, an expert has warned. The youngsters - many of whom refuse to take their tiaras off in bed - start to adopt a ‘princess role’ and believe they have a ‘divine right’ to get their own way at home and school. But Sue Palmer, a literacy expert, says that parents need to stand up to their daughters and draw the boundaries between play and real life, setting out what’s appropriate for every day wear. Spoilt: Literacy expert Sue Palmer says some pre-school age girls are allowed to dress up as princesses every day (file photo) The princess problem means that girls insist on wearing their party dresses at all times and believe they’re ‘rather more important in the great scheme of things’ than they really are. Ms Palmer, author of 21st Century Girls, which is published today, argues that parents should make clear to their under-sevens that in real life, ‘dressing up’ is just for special occasions such as parties. A dressing up box of old clothes, fabrics, beads - and even charity items - encourages imaginative play far more than a ready-made, expensive princess outfit, she argues. In her book, Ms Palmer warns of the pester power associated with the ‘princess culture’, which is heavily marketed by Disney. She said: ‘There’s now an immense amount of prettified paraphernalia out there - indeed it’s becoming difficult to tell the difference between products that are officially toys and the clothing, shoes and accessories aimed at small female consumers. ‘So unless parents are careful, the dream can become an everyday reality and their daughter can slip into the princess role on a full-time basis. ‘Since princesses are traditionally self-obsessed and high-handed, she may then start acting like a small pink potentate. ‘If when she starts pre-school, she meets up with other girls who’ve adopted the same persona, princess culture can begin to threaten parental authority.’ Warning: Miss Palmer says parents should only allow girls to dress up on special occasions (file photo) She added: ‘In recent years I’ve met many mums who’ve told me their daughters refuse to wear anything but party dresses or to take off their tiaras to go to bed. ‘I’ve also heard similar tales from teachers, including the reception teacher who confided that she’d had to go out the previous week and buy several pairs of pink knickers - if the five-year-old girls in her class had an ‘accident’, they refused to change into dry underwear unless it was pink. ‘The world now teems with cute little moppets, all exercising their royal right to choose.’ The ‘princess role’ is resulting in a reduction in ‘real play’, as girls wearing fashionable, impractical and expensive clothes are often ‘anxious about getting them dirty’. They’re also less likely to use their imagination if they’re presented with a ‘ready-made princess outfit or doctor’s kit’. Ms Palmer, who has also written Toxic Childhood, said last night that some parents don’t know ‘when to call a halt’ to their daughters’ demanding behaviour. She said: ‘It’s a slippery slope but mum and dad have to be in charge of what’s appropriate for children to wear. ‘You don’t go to school in your princess outfit, you can’t play out in your princess outfit and you can’t go to bed in your princess outfit.’ 'Princess culture': Author Miss Palmer, right, argues in her new book 21st century girls, left, that parents should know when to 'call a halt' to their daughter's demanding behaviour . She added: ‘We are now seeing so many little princesses all over the place and car stickers with ‘princess on board’. ‘You start thinking ‘oh my goodness me, this little girl is going to think she’s rather more important in the great scheme of things than she really is’. ‘There is a danger that they might become quite princess-like themselves - believing that they’re in charge and having some sort of divine right of princesses. ‘Princesses are traditionally rather spoilt little creatures but it’s not doing girls any favours if they think they’re calling all the shots.’ In January, the head teacher of Chelmsford County High School for Girls warned that parents are turning their daughters into fragile ‘little princesses’ by showering them with praise and presents. Nicole Chapman said that some families treat their girls as if they ‘can do no wrong’ because they’ve gained a place at her school after passing the 11-plus entrance test. These ‘little princesses’ always want to please and get ‘a lot of rewards’ for their troubles. Mrs Chapman said: ‘For some of them it’s just praise but with others they can have more or less what they want.’","Author Sue Palmer has warned parents of power of 'princess culture'

A war veteran was found hanged just months after leaving the Army, prompting the soldier's family to claim he did not receive support from the armed forces as he struggled to adjust to civilian life. Kyle Stobbart, 27, spent ten years in the military, rising to become a sergeant with the Scots Guards, and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. But after struggling to adjust outside the military, the father went missing and was later found hanged from a tree. After disappearing from the family home in Pelton, Durham, his wife Abby found an emotional goodbye note detailing how hard he found the readjustment. Mr Stobbart, who was a father to three-year-old Kaidence, also wrote about feeling scared and how he had broken down in tears as he wrote his last words. When Mrs Stobbart, 33, raised the alarm that her husband had gone missing on February 22, his car was discovered in Waldridge Fell the following day - also her birthday. Mrs Stobbart initially thought that her husband had left the house to buy her a birthday present in Durham but later noticed that his bank card was in the house. She said: 'I knew straight away that if Kyle wasn't asleep and he wasn't texting me something was wrong, because he didn't go half an hour without texting me. After ringing her husband's father, the local hospital and police, Mrs Stobbart moved the covers from her bed and found the note. She said: 'I knew then that he had gone and he wasn't coming back.' Struggle: Mrs Stobbart found a note from her husband after he went missing from the family home detailing his struggle with adjusting to civilian life . Mrs Stobbart, who married Kyle in April last year, said he may have bottled up some of his experiences from his time serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, having finished his service in November. She said: 'I don't know what he had seen out there, but I know he loved the army and the camaraderie with the lads. 'He didn't talk about his work at home. It was work to him and he didn't want to bring it back with him.' Joker: Mrs Stobbart described her husband as a 'joker' with a 'big personality' Mr Stobbart had taken a job as a maintenance technician at Nissan on his return, having joined the Army at 17 after leaving school. He worked night shifts at the manufacturer's Sunderland plant and admitted being frustrated, but his wife said he showed no signs of being emotionally distressed. She said: 'We just don't know where this has come from. He said his body clock was changing but he wasn't different with me. Nothing changed towards me and the kids. 'He did go to Durham that morning but I don't know if something has just snapped in his head. She described her husband as a 'joker' with a 'big personality' who loved to wind people up. She added: 'He never took anything seriously and he could cheer up any situation.' The soldier's aunt Margaret Meek believes the army should have offered more help to Mr Stobbart as he started his new life outside the forces. She said: 'They put him on a couple of courses and that was it. We spent a lot of time together over the last three years and I'm proud that he let me in. 'He was there for everybody else but when he needed someone he didn't ask anybody for help.' Mr Stobbart leaves behind his grandmother Jean, sister Nicola, brother Michael and parents Brian and Vilma. He was also a stepfather to Brandon, 13, and Samantha, nine. Mrs Stobbart said: 'He was a brilliant dad. I couldn't fault him in any way. I don't think we could have been any happier if we tried and we knew each other inside out.

He was the one. I'm angry in a way, but I know how much he loved me and Kaidence so in his head this must have been the only way that he could see.'

Disgraced tycoon Asil Nadir was today ordered to pay back £5million of the money he stole from his Polly Peck business empire - or face a further six years’ jail. Nadir was jailed for 10 years in August after being found guilty of stealing £28.8million from the company and its shareholders. He later claimed to be penniless after prosecutors demanded £60million should be paid in compensation and interest to the administrators. Polly Peck, a leading stock exchange conglomerate, collapsed in 1990 after Nadir stole money which he sent abroad through a complex series of companies. Mr Justice Holroyde, sitting at the Old Bailey, rejected his claims of poverty and said he believed Nadir had money stashed away. Nadir was given two years to pay the compensation. He may be released after serving half of both sentences. The judge also ruled that Turkish airline boss Hamit Cankut Bagana could apply for the return of the £250,000 security he paid to allow Nadir bail. Nadir fled from the UK to his native Northern Cyprus in 1993 but returned in 2010 to face trial. He claimed to have lived on the generosity of his mother and a girlfriend while in exile and before he was discharged as a bankrupt. But the judge said: 'It is not true that Mr Nadir received no significant income or owned no significant assets since 1993.' It was argued on his behalf that Nadir had not taken part in business during his years in exile. But the judge said he could not accept that 'such a proud and talented man' would have lived off handouts from his mother and a girlfriend.

Fresh shame has been heaped on the council at the centre of the Baby P scandal, after a child placed in care by the authority was left behind on a London bus by its foster parent. Passengers are said to have called police after spotting the child, believed to be aged under two, left alone in its buggy on the single-decker bus in Enfield on Friday. A spokesperson at Haringey Council - which was slammed for its failings in the care of abused baby Peter Connolly - said the child had been removed from the care of the foster parent and an investigation launched into the incident. Investigation: The child, who had been placed in care by Haringey Council, was abandoned on a bus by its foster parent on Friday . 'Yes there was a foster carer who left a child on a bus and the child was in care of Haringey Council, and there is an investigation in progress into the incident,' the spokesperson said. 'My understanding is the child was left for a short period on the bus and the child has now been removed from the care of the foster parent.' According to a report in the Sun, the female carer got off the single-decker 491 bus in Enfield on Friday afternoon, leaving the child behind on its own. When passengers raised the alarm, the child was checked over in hospital before being returned to social services in Haringey, the report said. The carer, who later got in touch with emergency services, is not thought to have been looking after any other children on behalf of the authority. David Skelton, from the think tank Policy Exchange, called for an overhaul of the fostering system. 'There are too many cases of the most vulnerable young people being let down,' he told the newspaper.

Pretence: Christine Wilson posed as a man named Chris to have sexual relationships with teenage girls, a court heard . A woman pretended to be a boy  so she could seduce a 15-year-old virgin, a court heard yesterday. Christine Wilson told the girl she was a man called Chris. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the teenager fell in love with ‘Chris’ and in 2010 agreed to sleep with her. But the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, eventually discovered that Chris was Christine and that she had been conned into losing her virginity with the woman. Police who were investigating Wilson, 25, discovered it was not the first time she had tricked a girl. The court heard that in 2008, Wilson had a sexual relationship with another teenager – and that she had again posed as a man. The girl, who was also aged 15 when they met in Aberdeen, dumped Wilson after  seeing a copy of the photograph contained in Wilson’s passport. The story emerged following a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh at which Wilson, of Aberdeen, pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining sexual intimacy from two girls by fraud. Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentence for reports. Prosecution lawyer Jane Farquharson said Wilson was introduced to her first victim by a mutual friend shortly before her 16th birthday in 2008. They exchanged phone numbers, began texting each other and started having ‘sexual contact’ at addresses in Aberdeen. She added: ‘The complainer believed Wilson to be a boy aged 17 years old. There was sexual contact – initially, kissing and cuddling but things progressed over the course of the three months.’ However, the girl learned of rumours that her ‘boyfriend’ was actually a woman. Miss Farquharson said: ‘The complainer did not believe this gossip, primarily because of their physical intimacy. ‘In August 2008, however, the complainer was contacted by a girl from Stonehaven who advised her she had seen the accused’s passport and confirmed the accused was female.’ A copy of Wilson’s passport was emailed to the girl, who then confronted Wilson. She admitted to her pretence and the girl ended their relationship. When Wilson was interviewed by police in October 2011, she admitted having a relationship with the girl and presenting herself as a boy throughout, and accepted that she did not allow the girl to do anything to her that might disclose her gender. Wilson met the second girl at the end of March 2010 and they began having sex later in the year. She had told Wilson that she was 16 years old – and the court heard that Wilson believed her. Fraud: Wilson pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining sexual intimacy from two girls by fraud at Edinburgh's High Court . Miss Farquharson told the court Wilson used a sex toy to persuade her second victim that she was a boy. She added: ‘This was the  complainer’s first experience of what she thought had been sexual intercourse and both declared their love for each other. The complainer felt having had sex with the accused made their relationship stronger. ‘The complainer had what she believed to be sexual intercourse on one further conviction. Again this intimacy was described to be under the covers so they did not see each other naked.’ The victim eventually discovered that Wilson was a girl in August 2010 when police investigating  Wilson contacted her. Miss Farquharson said: ‘Police confirmed the accused was in fact female. This news shocked the complainer, who found it difficult to believe it was true. ‘On finding out the accused’s true identity, the complainer struggled to come to terms with the accused’s deceit.’ Miss Farquharson said Wilson had been described as the girl’s first love and the girl’s parents had described their daughter as being ‘besotted’ with Wilson. She added: ‘The accused was interviewed in respect of this offence on August 17, 2010. She accepted the complainer did not realise she was a girl nor did she do anything to disavow the complainer of the notion that she was male.’ Defence advocate Shelagh McCall told the court her client has gender identity disorder and hopes to undergo reassignment therapy in the future.","Christine Wilson told 15-year-old girlfriend she was a man named Chris .

Today Jessica King  told ITV's Daybreak that she . was not motivated by the £100,000 reward offered by Securicor for the . capture of Maher and return of the money. Ms King said: 'I was in fear for my life and to be honest it was just the right thing to do. 'When Eddie found out I knew, he threatened my life so really it had to be done.' Asked whether the reward had played any part in her decision, she added: 'I didn't even know the reward was real.

Elaborate plan: Maher then used this Opel Ascona as a second getaway vehicle . Covering his tracks: The Opel getaway car was later found torched . Police are set to launch a legal battle to stop Eddie Maher receiving a pension pot worth £125,000, it emerged today. Maher, 57, who stole £1.2million from his Securicor van in January 1993 was thought to have been penniless when he was arrested in America last year after 19 years on the run. But police discovered that he had been due a pension from his 12 years as a London firefighter before being forced to retire in 1991 due to a training injury. Maher who was jailed for five years at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday initially received an index-linked pension of around £300 a month. But the payments were frozen when he disappeared after stealing £1,172,500 while a colleague was delivering cash to a Lloyds bank in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Maher who was known as Fast Eddie had no way of collecting his pension while on the run in the U.S. and the payments due to him were retained by the London Fire Brigade. His monthly pension increased to its current level of £686 due to inflation, swelling the payments due to him to around £125,000 after interest. Suffolk Police confirmed that specialist financial fraud officers had launched an investigation to see if the money could be seized under the Criminal Justice Act. During Tuesday's hearing, David Nathan . QC, mitigating, said: 'An extraordinary aspect of this case is Mr . Maher's daughter-in-law had originally been the partner of his son Lee's . best friend. 'Lee won a lot of money on the lottery and she left her partner to marry Lee. 'When the money ran out, she did a . little research on Google on the name Maher and found out he was wanted . for the theft back in 1993. 'She heard that there was a reward and she went to the federal authorities.' Maher, originally from South Woodham . Ferrers, Essex, was due to stand trial for theft after being deported . from the US but changed his plea to guilty. The court heard that he benefited from the theft outside Lloyds Bank, Felixstowe, to the tune of £200,000. Police and prosecutors are now . preparing to retrieve Maher's fire service pension pot - thought to be . about £125,000 - through court proceedings. Maher was declared bankrupt in the US and told the court that any money he received from the theft was now gone. However, it is understood he accrued a pension worth about £600 a month during his time with the London Fire Service. Legal teams will discuss this during a series of hearings scheduled to take place at Ipswich Crown Court.","Jessica King, the ex-wife of Maher's son Lee, contacted U.S. authorities .

The 26-year-old former girlfriend of Silvio Berlusconi has recently re-launched her fashion modelling career after being dragged into the playboy's most recent scandals. Berlusconi is now threatening a return to politics as he plans to run in the coming Italian elections hoping to gain office for a fourth time.

The 26-year-old has recently re-launched her modelling career after being dragged into former boyfriend Berlusconi's sleaze scandal . Ms Minetti stands accused of procuring prostitutes for Berlusconi's infamous Bunga-Bunga parties . However, he faces yet more court cases surrounding the use of prostitutes at his so-called Bunga-Bunga parties. Bilingual Miss Minetti, whose mother Georgina Reed is from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, treated Berlusconi's broken teeth after he was hit in the face with a statue at a rally in December 2009. Berlusconi invited her to become a politician and she was shortlisted for the upcoming elections which made her the victim of much criticism. At a fashion show in September Ms Minetti claimed that fashion and politics were the perfect mix . Friend Raffaella Zardo joined Minetti for her Christmas holiday in the sun . Minetti was appointed councillor of Lombardy despite having no political experience . Once describing Berlusconi as 'the love of her life' she recently told the Italian press that he no longer returns her calls . The former dental nurse recently posed for the Parah New Generation Catwalk show for the Milan Womens Fashion Week . Berlusconi subsequently appointed her a regional councillor in LombardyShe was also involved in the so-called Caso Ruby scandal and it was discovered that she owned four apartments which were occupied by showgirls. No stranger to headlines, in 2011 prosecutors asked for her to be charged with recruiting prostitutes for Berlusconi - a probe involving a teenage prostitute allegedly paid for sex by the controversial politician. Milan prosecutors are also investigating whether she improperly requested state reimbursements for €27,000 (£22,000) in spa treatments, hotels and dinners. Berlusconi stepped down in November 2011 amid an economic crisis and the growing row over his Bunga Bunga parties. Since then his Freedom People party has been damaged by repeated sleaze allegations which have toppled regional authorities in Lazio and Lombardy. Twenty-two regional councillors from the Freedom People and Northern League parties are being investigated over expenses on items including lottery scratch cards, bullets, cigarettes, takeaway pizzas and fireworks. Berlusconi now faces renewed allegations ahead of the coming elections in February. Nicole Minetti recently stated that she thought Slivio Berlusconi's new fiancee Francesca Pascale (right) would make an 'excellent first lady'. The 27-year-old former dancer is now being groomed as the wife of the playboy who is now hoping to run once more for Prime Minister. Miss Pascale, the daughter of a wedding photographer who grew up in Naples, began dancing for a kitsch show on Telecapri station when she was 14. She later left showbusiness, studied political science and became a provincial councillor for Mr Berlusconi’s centre-Right PdL party, but stepped down in July. Earlier this month the billionaire media mogul confirmed their relationship on television, calling her 'beautiful on the inside and the outside'. Miss Pascale is said to be friends with Mr Berlusconi’s daughter, Marina, who is chairman of Italy’s largest magazine publisher, Mondadori.Miss Pascale met Mr Berlusconi in 2004 when she was 19 and has proved a loyal political collaborator.","Italian MP Nicole Minetti soaks up the sun in Miami .

An environmentalist has been forced to come back down to earth following a record-breaking 457 day treetop protest after the forest she was trying to protect was threatened by a bushfire. Miranda Gibson, 31, climbed down from the 100ft tall, 400-year-old eucalyptus tree in Tazmania to a hero's welcome, as the fire raged just two kilometres away. So long was her stay on a platform in the tree in the Styx Valley, 60 miles north west of Hobart, that she had missed a close friend of hers becoming pregnant and having the baby. Scroll down for video . Down to earth: Environmentalist Miranda Gibson got a hero's welcome after climbing down from a 100ft Eucalyptus tree after her record-breaking 457 day protest . ‘I missed a lot of things while I was up . there,’ 31-year-old Miss Gibson said when her feet finally touched the . ground again to applause from a group of supporters. ‘It was a difficult decision to evacuate, but necessary,’ she said, fighting back tears. ‘The fire is only about two kilometres from where I am so it’s quite close and potentially a high level of risk if it comes this way.’ Her sit-in was an Australian record for a tree protest, which started when she and her conservation group Still Wild Still Threatened learned ancient trees in the valley were due to be felled by logging companies. Smoke rises in the background from the approaching bush fire as protestor Miranda Gibson prepares to come back down to earth after her record-breaking protest . Ms Gibson abseils back down to earth after spending well over a year protesting in the 100ft tall gum tree . Last December she celebrated a year in the 400-year-old gum tree in a campaign that generated world-wide attention. She used modern technology – a solar-powered laptop and phone – to send her conservation message into classrooms, boardrooms and lounge rooms across the world. In an earlier interview with The Mercury newspaper of Hobart as she marked a year sitting in the tree, she said she did not know what to expect when she first hauled herself up to her treetop home, erected under canvas. ‘I don’t think I would have expected to be up here for a whole year – I really hoped there would be that protection (of trees) in place before now.’ Coming to terms with isolation and coping with Tasmania’s harsh winter weather were her biggest challenges, she said. ‘A friend of mine fell pregnant and has had a baby since I was in the tree and I didn’t get to be part of that,’ said the former teacher. Ms Gibson gets a hug from a well-wisher after touching down on the forest floor . She pointed out that a lot of people didn’t know about the threat to Tasmania’s forests and she had received a large number of emails thanking her for making the world aware. Among those congratulating Miss Gibson for her Australian record-breaking sit-in was former Australian Greens leader Bob Brown who told her as her feet touched the ground: ‘You’re our hero of the forests’. She has yet to say whether she will return to the tree top once the fire threat has passed. But friends said that whatever her decision is, she will continue to press the government to push through a World Heritage listing for the Styx Valley as well as the Florentine and Weld forests. Her sit-in beat the previous-longest tree-top protest in Australia, set by Manfred Stephens who sat in a tree in north Queensland for 208 days in 1995. The world’s longest record was set in the US between 1997 and 1999 when Julia Butterfly Hill sat in a 180ft-tall California Redwood tree for 738 days to prevent loggers cutting it down.

"By . Nick Mcdermott and Michael Seamark . UPDATED: . 20:18 EST, 16 January 2012 . The editor of the Daily Mirror yesterday conceded its revelation about Sven Goran Eriksson’s affair with Ulrika Jonsson may have resulted from phone hacking. Speaking at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards, Richard Wallace also admitted the interception of voicemail messages ‘might well have’ taken place at the tabloid – although not to his knowledge. He was the Mirror’s head of news when the story of Mr Eriksson’s affair with Miss Jonsson was published in 2002, and said the scoop had originated from a tip. Evidence: Richard Wallace arrives to give evidence to The Leveson Inquiry at The High Court, he conceded phone hacking may have occurred at the newspaper . Asked the source of the tip, he said: ‘I don’t recall the exact nature of it, it was from within the showbusiness department,’ before adding: ‘I can’t even recall who actually put the story forward.’  When asked if it may have been a result of phone hacking, Mr Wallace responded: ‘It’s possible, yes.’ Piers Morgan, who was editor of the paper at the time it published the story of the then England football manager’s affair, flatly denied intercepting Miss Jonsson’s messages in an earlier appearance at the inquiry. Mr Wallace, who became editor   in 2004, said he was unaware of phone hacking taking place in his two decades as a journalist with the Trinity Mirror company. In December, Lord Justice Leveson heard evidence from a former Mirror business journalist, James Hipwell, who claimed to have witnessed repeated examples of phone hacking by reporters on the showbusiness desk during 2000, when Mr Wallace was the department’s editor. 'A possibility': Richard Wallace said a . story about Sven Goran Eriksson’s affair with Ulrika Jonsson in 2002 . 'may have come from phone hacking' Asked by David Barr, counsel to the inquiry, if he knew about voicemail interception at the paper, the editor replied: ‘Not to my knowledge.’ But when pressed if it may have occurred without his knowledge, Mr Wallace admitted: ‘It might well have.’ Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver told the hearing she was not aware of phone hacking at her newspaper, but added there was no guarantee it had not occurred. Earlier in the inquiry, Tony Blair’s former communications director Alastair Campbell claimed a story the Daily Mirror published about Cherie Blair’s pregnancy in 1999 might have been obtained from phone hacking. But Miss Weaver yesterday said the article had originated from public relations guru Max Clifford. Denial: During his evidence Piers Morgan, who was editor of the Daily Mirror when the Jonsson story ran, denied intercepting her messages . Mr Campbell had admitted he had ‘no evidence’ that journalists intercepted the voicemails of either Mrs Blair or her lifestyle consultant Carole Caplin, but queried the source of a number of articles about the former prime minister’s wife. The inquiry was told that Mr Morgan was dismissed from the editorship of the Daily Mirror in 2004 after he published fake photographs of British soldiers abusing Iraqis. Sly Bailey, the chief executive of Trinity Mirror, said he had made a catastrophic editorial error and ‘we lost a lot of readers as a result’. ‘The board lost confidence in him as editor and that is why we fired him,’ she added. Mrs Bailey, who runs five national titles and more than 140 regional papers, said she did not launch an inquiry into phone hacking because she had seen no evidence of it. ‘I don’t think the way to run a healthy organisation is to go around conducting investigations when there is no evidence to say that our journalists have hacked phones,’ Mrs Bailey insisted. The inquiry also heard that Mr Blair urged the Mirror to sack a journalist critical of the Government – but failed to get a response. Mr Wallace, invited to Downing Street shortly after becoming editor, said: ‘One of the first things he asked me was when I was going to sack one of my journalists who had been a consistent critic of the government and Mr Blair in particular.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Richard Wallace admits it was 'possible' a story about Sven Goran Eriksson’s affair with Ulrika Jonsson in 2002 may have come from phone hacking .

"By . Jessica Satherley . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 11 November 2011 . Three gang members faced jail today after being found guilty of possessing a sub-machine gun and its ammunition, which was found stashed near a children's playground. The . Sterling 9mm weapon, which fires 500 rounds a minute, and a . balaclava, were discovered on the Pembury Estate in . east London by a Hackney Gangs Unit. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard the police officers . were cycling past the play park, an area known as a hang-out for the . Pembury Boys gang, when there was a commotion and around ten men dispersed. The weapon: The Sterling Parabellum 9mm sub-machine gun was found on the Pembury Estate in east London by a Hackney Gangs Unit . The suspicious officers searched the area and found the weapon wrapped in a plastic bag. Not far from the scene, they found bullets, a kitchen knife and a balaclava, also in a plastic bag. Fingerprints belonging to the defendants were found on the bags. Tyrell Goather, 21,and Helal Miah, . 17, were sentenced to a combined eight years in prison, while Philip . Johnson, 18, was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order at . Snaresbrook Crown Court for possession. Found guilty: Helal Miah (left) was sentenced to three years in jail and Tyrell Goather (right) was sentenced to five years in prison . They are all believed to be ‘younger’ members of the notorious Pembury Boys gang, whose turf war with the rival London Fields Gang was the inspiration for Channel 4 drama Top Boy about East London gangs. Goather was also key witness in the murder trial of Shaquille Smith, who was stabbed as he sat in a park near London Fields in 2008. Jailing the defendants, Judge Wendy Joseph said: ‘There have been many incidents in London in recent years when young people have been killed or maimed and innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire. Philip Johnson was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order . ‘This was a British Army issue sub-machine gun capable of being fired repeatedly. It was in a children's playground on  a heavily populated estate. It was near to live ammunition that could be fired from it. ‘It is obvious that a gun to be used to threaten only does not require ammunition.’ A hat and bike belonging to Miah were dumped near to the weapon. The gun was linked to two non-fatal shootings in south London in 2009 after undergoing police testing. Both Miah and Goather denied the charges and gave alternative explanations as to why their DNA was found on the weapon and bullets, but their accounts were rejected by a jury. Johnson, who is homeless after his gang activity put his family in danger, admitted looking after the bullets for ‘around half an hour’ while he was staying with a friend. Describing the offence as one of ‘significant gravity’ Judge Joseph said: ‘I know it is not easy to grow up on such an estate where there are others encouraging people to join activities that are not legal. ‘But yours is a story of why no young person should join a gang.’ Sentencing Goather, whose testimony jailed the murderers of his friend Shaquille, she added: ‘You of all people should have known better than to associate himself with those who obtain weapons.’ The men are all believed to be members of the Pembury Boys gang, whose turf war with the rival London Fields Gang was the inspiration for Channel 4 drama Top Boy (Top Boy actors pictured) Goather was convicted of possession of an offensive weapon and possession of ammunition and sentenced to five years in prison. Miah, who can be named after the judge lifted reporting restrictions, was convicted of the same offences and sentenced to three years in prison. Johnson, who admitted possession of ammunition, was found not guilty of possession of an offensive weapon and was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order due to the six months he had served in custody on remand. Detectives from the borough’s Operation Bantam gun crime unit later linked the weapon to the three through DNA evidence and analysis of phones. Police believe they were left in charge of the weapon for the ‘older’ members of the Pembury gang.","They are believed to be members of the Pembury Boys, whose turf war inspired TV show Top Boy .

More than 30 million smuggled cigarettes have been discovered in a shipment supposed to be full of wind turbines. Border Force officers first discovered 8.5 million cigarettes, which are believed to be counterfeit, crammed inside a cargo container at Southampton Container Port on March 1. Further investigation led them to another two 40ft containers full of the illegal imports, bringing the total seized to around 30.3 million cigarettes. Smuggled: Border Force officers discovered more than 30 million smuggled cigarettes in a shipment supposed to be full of wind turbines . Samples of the seized cigarettes are being tested, but are believed to be counterfeits made to look like Lambert & Butler and Regal brands . The matter was then referred to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for investigation. John Cooper, HMRC assistant director criminal investigation, said: 'The diligence of Border Force officers has prevented a huge quantity of cigarettes, believed to be Chinese counterfeits, from reaching the UK’s streets. 'The sheer scale of this haul would undoubtedly have seen criminal gangs selling the tobacco to retailers, clubs, car boot sales and eventually UK consumers. 'HMRC will continue to work with Border Force to crackdown on tobacco fraud, which costs the UK Government around £1.8 billion a year.' The smugglers were trying to avoid paying over £8 million in taxes and duty and had described the containers’ contents as 'wind turbine parts' on import documents, the HMRC said. The three cigarette laden containers were loaded onto a cargo vessel in the Shenzhen area of China.

Samples of the seized cigarettes are being tested, but they are believed to be counterfeits made to look like Lambert & Butler and Regal brands. They have now been shredded and burned at a power station to fuel the National Grid. Andy Lumb, from the Border Force, said the containers were on their way to Glasgow, adding: 'This was cigarette smuggling on an industrial scale so I am delighted that our officers have prevented this haul of contraband from reaching our streets. Shredded: The cigarettes have now been shredded and burned at a power station to fuel the National Grid . 'Tobacco smuggling is not victimless - it is effectively stealing from the public purse, at a time when the country can least afford it. 'I would urge anyone tempted by cheap cigarettes and tobacco to think again. The black market cheats honest traders and it is totally unregulated so buyers have no way of knowing what they are actually getting. 'The size of the detection should leave people in no doubt that tobacco smuggling is a serious organised crime, worth big money to the criminals involved. 'By stopping this shipment we have hit the smugglers where it hurts the most - in the pocket.'

Thieves attempted to snatch supermodel Naomi Campbell’s handbag as she sat in a limousine in central Paris, French police confirmed tonight. Revelations about the attack last November came following claims about a ‘violent mugging’ which saw the supermodel end up in a wheelchair. There were reports that the 42-year-old had been attacked just before Christmas as she tried to hail a taxi in the French capital. Best foot forward: Naomi Campbell in a wheelchair in New York following the violent attack in Paris . In fact she was already sitting in the car when two men on a motorbike are said to have tried to grab her handbag on November 21. The attempted snatch took place in Rue de Moussy, in the trendy Marais district of central Paris, just off the Rue de Rivoli. Nothing was taken, but Ms Campbell filed a complaint at the nearby police station of the 4th arrondissement. There she refused to have a medical examination, but was later pictured in a wheelchair and wearing a brace. Sources in New York later claimed Ms Campbell had suffered a torn leg ligament in the bag snatch. A spokesman for Naomi Campbell responded with 'no comment' when asked about the attack. The 42-year-old's billionaire boyfriend, Vladimir Doronin, used his private jet to fly her to Vail, Colorado, where she was treated by J. Richard Steadman, one of the world's leading orthopedic surgeons. Following a check of November crime reports in Paris, a police source said: ‘On November 21, two people on a motorbike attempted to steal Ms Campbell's handbag as she sat in a vehicle on Rue de Moussy. ‘She filed a complaint with police in the 4th arrondissement but she did not agree to a medical examination.’ The source said Ms Campbell was ‘accompanied’ during her ordeal, and had wisely stayed inside the car. There were indications that she was worried that the motorbike riders had deliberately targeted her and might strike again. ‘This was the main reason she reported the crime,’ said the source. Beefed up: Her billionaire boyfriend Vladimir Doronin has upped security around her following the attack . Muggings are comparatively rare in . Paris, although sneak thieves do operate around the poorer suburbs, and . at crowded Metro and train stations. Ms Campbell, however, is known for her five star lifestyle when she is in the city, usually staying in a 1000 pounds plus a night suite at the hugely luxurious Bristol Hotel, and travelling everywhere by chauffer driven car. Ms Campbell’s representatives have refused to comment on the affair. The New York Post reported French police are currently investigating the incident, and have apparently asked the model not to speak publicly about her ordeal. Over the past few weeks, the model has maintained a cheery online presence, tweeting a series of uplifting messages to welcome in the New Year. The attack was not the first time Ms Campbell has been involved in an incident of violence. She has often been accused of physically abusing members of her staff - in 2000, she admitted throwing a mobile phone at her personal assistant, and in 2007 she was ordered to carry out community service after assaulting her housekeeper. Four years ago, Ms Campbell was banned from flying on British Airways for spitting at two policemen during an argument at Heathrow airport. The model has been dating Mr Doronin, 50, for nearly five years - even though he is still married to his Russian wife, from whom he has been estranged for over a decade. Ms Campbell threw him a lavish birthday party in India in November, but once again got in trouble with the law when her events manager was arrested over claims the event had produced too much noise.","French police confirm supermodel was attacked on November 21 .

With his boy band looks, beautiful girlfriend and Hollywood style surname the new star of English rugby might be forgiven for losing his head. Especially after Billy Twelvetrees left his mother ‘close to tears’ after scoring a thrilling try in front of an 80,000 crowd on his international debut against Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday. However, his proud parents Kevin and Beverley remain determined that the youngest of their four Twelvetrees boys stays true to his working class roots. Scroll down for video . Hottest name in Rugby: England's latest rugby hero Billy Twelvetrees (pictured with girlfriend Georgie Rollings) has a devoted family who could hardly contain their excitement at his international debut on Saturday . Accordingly, the Twelvetrees clan avoided the traditional pre-game picnics with champagne at the Twickenham car park in favour of a pint in the nearby Eel Pie pub. They were joined by Billy’s three older brothers Jonny, Joe and Matt, his school PE teacher David Sainsbury and his childhood sweetheart Georgie Rollings. But even the Twelvetrees struggled to contain their excitement after watching their 6ft 3ins son smash his way through two Scottish defenders to score. Comprehensive school educated Twelvetrees, 24, was only in the England starting XV to replace an injured colleague. But the performance by the Gloucester centre in Saturday’s 38-18 win over Scotland has left his relatives delighted and ‘overwhelmed’. So proud: Billy's mother was 'close to tears' after scoring a thrilling try in front of an 80,000 crowd on his international debut against Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . Smashed through Scottish defenders: Twelvetrees, 24, was only in the England starting XV to replace an injured colleague but his performance in Saturday's 38-18 win over Scotland has delighted his relatives . Billy’s brother Matt yesterday said: ‘Mum’s been close to tears all day, it’s all she’s talked about.’ Speaking from the family’s modest semi-detached home in the village of Wisborough Green, West Sussex, Matt said his parents were ‘overwhelmed’ about Billy’s performance. He added: ‘The whole family were up in Twickenham last night. We are all so proud, it was amazing. We couldn’t have hoped for more. It was such exciting stuff.’ Billy’s career had seemed to have stalled at his previous club Leicester Tigers and Kevin Twelvetrees feared his son, who went to The Weald School comprehensive in Billingshurst, West Sussex, suffered because of his background. His father has previously said: ‘In rugby there’s a bit of an old boys’ network. You’ve usually got to be related to someone to get the break.’ Proud parents: Kevin and Beverley Twelvetrees remain determined that the youngest of their four Twelvetrees boys stays true to his working class roots . Now the name Twelvetrees is now set to become as well established as Billy’s World Cup winning England idol Will Greenwood. Last week Greenwood had tweeted: ‘Greenwood now Twelvetrees.... love the horticultural theme developing in england centre shirt... any more out there...’ And it was a name that is causing fascination among many rugby fans. TV host Claire Balding tweeted: ‘I want to call a racehorse Billy Twelvetrees. Just the best name.’ In fact, Twelvetrees is Billy’s mother Beverley’s surname and his dad Kevin adopted it when they married because it fitted with his tree surgeon business. 'Overwhelmed': Twelvetrees (pictured right aged 11 and left this year) is now set to become as well established as Billy’s World Cup winning England idol Will Greenwood . It has led to Billy’s nickname ‘36’ coined because his one-time captain at Leicester, Geordan Murphy had such a thick Irish accent his name sounded like ‘twelve threes’. Mr and Mrs Twelvetrees went on a bicycle ride in the West Sussex countryside to ‘clear their heads’ after the excitement of Saturday’s game. On the way home they popped into the family farmhouse of Billy’s childhood sweetheart Georgie Rollings, 24, five miles up the road. Twelvetrees is said to be devoted to Georgie and the couple recently bought a house together in Gloucester to be near his team. Georgie’s mother Georgina said yesterday: ‘Georgie is so proud.’ After the match Billy Twelvetrees said: ‘I did what I do best and I’m pretty pleased with the performance. As a youngster I always wanted to score a try for England at Twickenham and I’ve done that now. ‘I was just delighted to play in front of a great home crowd. I had all my family here, about 15 people came to watch. There were brothers, girlfriends out there. ‘My eyesight is not the best so I wasn’t able to pick them out of the crowd unfortunately but it was nice to know that they were out there.’ Victorious: Billy's (pictured at Saturday's game) nickname '36' coined because his one-time captain at Leicester, Geordan Murphy had such a thick Irish accent his name sounded like 'twelve threes'","Billy Twelvetrees made his international debut against Scotland on Saturday .

'Not a rare occurrence': Patients admitted to Spanish hospitals at weekends are reportedly being given towels to use as makeshift pillows . Spanish hospitals are forcing patients to use towels as pillows because they cannot afford to clean bed linen every day, it has been claimed. According to reports in Spain, patients admitted at weekends are being told to fold the towels to create makeshift pillows. It is believed that linen cleaning has been outsourced to private firms in a bid to cut costs. But those firms do not work Saturdays and Sundays leaving hospitals with a shortage of pillows. A patient who was admitted to the Clinical Hospital in Valencia, eastern Spain, took a picture of a folded towel on the bed in place of a pillow and sent it to local news website LasProvincias.es. Its report claimed that it was far from an isolated case with similar reports coming in from hospitals throughout Spain. Sources at the hospital told LasProvincias.es that the situation was 'not normal' but that it was also 'not a rare occurrence' for a Sunday afternoon. The source said that if the hospital was busier than it normally is at weekends then some patients would have to go without. Austerity measures imposed by the Spanish Department of Health have also had a negative effect on Valencia's hospitals, said the source. Patients are said to be expected to keep the same cutlery given to them on their first day for their entire stay. Patients used to be given a glass of milk at noon, but that has now been banned due to cost cutting measures. Last month thousands of health care workers took to the streets in 16 Spanish cities to protest against government budget cuts and plans to partially privatise the health care system. Mariano Rajoy's centre-right Popular Party government is struggling to reduce the nation's deficit and avoid hiking taxes and widespread public cuts. Unemployment figures in the country passed the five million mark for the first time in February.

Defiant: David Cameron said all those involved in the culture of top-down targets should take responsibility for the Mid-Staffordshire hospital scandal . David Cameron yesterday shifted the blame for the Mid Staffordshire scandal on to Labour as he faced down yet more clamour for the NHS chief to resign. In a marked change of tone, he told the House of Commons all those involved in the culture of top-down targets had to consider their position. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt went even further, accusing former ministers of a ‘deafening silence’ about the ‘catastrophic mistakes’ they had made. He said Labour ‘will be held accountable for what happened’ – specifically for ignoring patient care in a drive to slash waiting times, rank hospitals’ performance and shake up regulation. Last month’s Francis Report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal did not blame individual ministers and Mr  Cameron insisted there should be no hunt for scapegoats. The Prime Minister has also steadfastly backed the embattled NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson who has ignored calls from MPs, medical professionals and patients to stand down. But yesterday Mr Cameron changed his tune at Prime Minister’s Questions when Labour MP Graham Stringer asked why he did not sack Sir David over the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at the trust. Sir David Nicholson faces growing calls to resign for his role in the Mid Staffs scandal . Mr Cameron said Sir David, who . previously ran the regional health authority overseeing Mid . Staffordshire, had ‘very frankly and candidly apologised’ for mistakes . made, suggesting Labour had not. Campaign: A Cure The NHS poster shows what they think of Sir David, calling his 'shameful' and his evidence 'disgraceful' He said: ‘Everyone has to think of . their responsibilities with regard to the dreadful events that happened . at the Staffordshire hospital, including the fact that part of the . problem was people following a very top-down, target-led agenda which . led to patient care being put on the back burner. ‘David Nicholson has made his apology . and wants to get on with his job of running an excellent National . Health Service, and other people, frankly, should be thinking of their . positions too.’ A Labour source attacked his . comments, saying: ‘This seems a pretty shabby and cheap attempt to . politicise the Francis Report. It made clear that no ministers were to . blame. It is not the right thing to try to politicise what was a human . tragedy.’ But pressure is piling on ministers . over their protection of Sir David. Last night at a meeting of the 1922 . Committee of Tory backbenchers, dozens called for his resignation. Bill Cash, who represents the . Staffordshire seat of Stone, said: ‘Is there a single person in this . room who thinks Nicholson shouldn’t go?’ Only one person indicated that they disagreed with Mr Cash. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, left, said his Labour predecessors including Andy Burham, right, should take responsibility for 'catastrophic policy mistakes' Sir David caused fury on Tuesday by pleading ignorance to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch. He told MPs he had ‘no idea’ about . the appalling failures of care, ‘no access’ to mortality rates which . were published in national newspapers, and no sanction over gagging . agreements signed off by the Department of Health. Sir David admitted Labour’s . re-organisation of the NHS was confusing, but pinned no blame on . ministers. In return, four former Labour Health Secretaries rallied to . his defence. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham, . who was Health Secretary until 2010, has admitted the target culture . went too far, but has not taken any responsibility for the scandal. Nor has Alan Johnson, who was in . office when three reports were commissioned – but not published – into . the state of the NHS in 2007, revealing a relentless focus on targets . rather than patients . Last night Mr Hunt wrote on the . website ConservativeHome that ‘warnings were suppressed’ by Labour that . their ‘command and control structure’ for the NHS was not working. Sir David was in charge of the regional health body supervising the Mid Staffordshire trust, and later head of the Department of Health, over the four-year period in which up to 1,200 are feared to have died needlessly . He said they had to take the blame . for ‘catastrophic policy mistakes... all of which are having a direct . target on the lack of compassionate care in parts of the NHS today’. Mr Hunt added: ‘Labour can and will be held accountable for what happened at Mid Staffs. ‘Unless we hear a proper account from . Labour, the public will reasonably conclude that similar events could . easily happen again if Labour regained power – because the party that . used to claim the NHS was safe in its hands is proving by its silence . the exact opposite.’ No 10 is understood to want to keep . Sir David because he understands the major reforms to the Health Service . which will be unveiled next month. The ‘Nicholson challenge’ involves slashing £20billion from the NHS budget. By Sophie Borland, Health Reporter . Sir David's successor? Mark Britnell is believed to be in the frame if the NHS chief gets sacked . The head of the NHS appeared to be  losing his grip on power last night as it emerged that senior directors are quietly lining up a successor. Sir David Nicholson has repeatedly defied calls to resign, despite being at the centre of one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory. But the Daily Mail understands senior health service directors believe his position is untenable and are now in the process of appointing a replacement. The man in the frame is understood to be Mark Britnell, a former adviser to David Cameron, who is currently head of health at consultancy firm KPMG. He was interviewed by Professor Malcolm Grant, chairman of the NHS Commissioning Board, two weeks ago with a view to being appointed deputy chief executive. Should he accept the job, he would almost certainly be promoted to chief executive while Sir David is moved aside. On Tuesday, Sir David was grilled by MPs over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal where hundreds died due to poor care. He claimed he had ‘no idea’ of the horrific neglect at the trust and denied being aware of the alarmingly high death rates. Although the Prime Minister has officially given Sir David his full backing, up to 40 MPs, including Cabinet ministers, want him to leave. Mr Britnell, 47, was previously the NHS’s ‘director general for commissioning’ for two years before leaving for KPMG in 2009. The married father of two has spent more than 20 years of his career in the health service including six as chief executive of University Hospitals Birmingham. When David Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010, he invited Mr Britnell to join a ‘kitchen cabinet’ of senior health experts to advise him on the NHS reforms. But Mr Cameron publicly disowned him in 2011 – claiming he’d ‘never heard’ of him – after Mr Britnell implied the NHS would become increasingly privatised. Last year however, Mr Britnell said he had ‘every intention of returning to the NHS’. In an interview with the British Medical Journal he said: ‘I love the NHS. I don’t see what is wrong with going and getting some different sector experience to develop my capabilities as manager and go back to the NHS in the future.’ Former health secretary Andrew Lansley is said to have wanted to bring him in to replace Sir David soon after the Tories came to power in 2010. But Treasury officials reportedly objected, claiming Sir David was the only person who could be trusted to keep a grip on the NHS’s finances. Mr Britnell declined to comment on whether he was considering the role.","Responds to calls for NHS chief Sir David Nicholson to be sacked .

British high commissioner Christian Turner has been accused of 'animated involvement' in attempts to get a decision on how rejected ballots should be dealt with . On Monday, Kenyans held their first presidential vote since the nation’s disputed election in 2007 spawned violence that killed more than 1,000 people. Prime minister Raila Odinga and Mr Kenyatta are considered the top two contenders. Kenyans were growing increasingly frustrated that the any announcement about who has won had still not happened 48 hours after polls closed. Kenya’s election commission was forced to abandon its electronic tallying system after it broke down. Partial results on Tuesday had shown an early lead for Mr Kenyatta, though his percentage will drop when the rejected votes are counted in the total.

'Suspicious': Uhuru Kenyatta also asked the high commissioner why British troops on a training course arrived at the same time as the vote . The statement from Mr Kenyatta’s party on Wednesday implied that the British high commissioner pressured the commission to make the decision on the spoiled ballots, thus ensuring a run-off. The Kenyatta statement said his party awaits answers to such questions, and it called on supporters 'and the nation at large' to remain calm and peaceful. The US has warned of 'consequences' if Mr Kenyatta wins because Mr Kenyatta is wanted by the International Criminal Court.

"By . Alex Ward and James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 02:16 EST, 7 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:16 EST, 7 March 2013 . The anti-gay and anti-Semitic Westboro Baptist Church is 'manipulative' and 'brainwashes' its members into following its message according to one former member who has written a book about her experience. Lauren Drain, 27, spent her teens as a member of the small, independent, Kansas-based church which pickets the funerals of fallen American soldiers because they died protecting a nation which defends homosexuality. 'Absolutely, yes, they did, they did brainwash me,' said Drain to CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday. 'It's very controlling,' she added. 'They control what you believe, what you say, what you do, what friends you have. They say everyone on the outside's evil. And they don't allow any outside influence at all.' Scroll Down for Video . Lauren Drain spoke on CNN's 'Piers Morgan Tonight' about her experiences within the Westboro Baptist Church before she left in 2008 . Drain has written 'Banished: Surviving My Years in the Westboro Baptist Church' which recounts how her father began a documentary investigation to expose the church and ultimately ended up joining the hate-group along with his whole family in 2001. 'They manipulated the children into believing that is the right thing to do for God. They are being good Christians,' said Drain about the methods of the church which is headed by Fred Phelps and founded in 1955, in Topeka. 'They claim to speak for God. And it's unfortunate and it's an atrocity the things that they do and say, horrible things they do and say, but they claim they are speaking for God.' Now cut off from the rest of her family and disowned by her father, Drain spoke of her hurt at the time and how she fears for her siblings still in the church. Lauren Drain admitted the hardest part about being cut off from her family was that her siblings (pictured left and right with Lauren) were growing up in ignorance . 'It was very traumatic, when it first happened. I wasn't ready for it or expected it,' said Drain. 'Mostly because of my siblings who are still stuck there.' 'When I left they were three, five, 16 and now its five years later - so they are growing older, they have no opportunity to see any type of outside influence or any type of other perspective on God, any other type of knowledge of good life or good people, they have no idea that there is a happiness on the outside.' Previously, Drain has discussed how the church brainwashes its members with constant sermons of hate, daily emails and countless studies of their interpretation of the Bible. Drain revealed that the Bible group leaders skip over the verses that discuss God's love, forgiveness and hope. In fact, the infamous picketing that the Westboro Church is notorious for is paid for by the members themselves and not the church - including its younger members. As a teenager, she got job. 'All of my paycheck went to paying for picket trips,' she told MyNorthWest.Com. Speaking on CNN, Drain said that she began to question what the church was saying, believing it to be hypocritical and plain wrong. 'God Hates Fags': Westboro Baptist Church member Megan Phelps-Roper (pictured back row, right with other members and documentary maker Louis Theroux) has left the church, known for holding placards with controversial, anti-gay messages . Since leaving the WBC, Drain has worked to distance herself from the group's stigma. She's appeared in a NOH8 campaign ad and participated in candid Reddit Ask Me Anything. And in February, two grandchildren of Fred Phelps left the church apologizing for the ‘hurt’ they caused after leaving the family church to start a new life. Megan Phelps-Roper, 27, and her sister Grace, 19, left the controversial Westboro Baptist Church founded by their grandfather, which saw them holding placards with the words ‘God Hates Fags,’ ‘Fags Doom Nations’ and ‘Thank God for Dead Soldiers', at the funerals of U.S. personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and publicly celebrating when a stranger contracts cancer. Miss Phelps-Roper, who was once called as the ‘future leader’ of the church, confirmed that after 27 years she has made the decision to leave, effectively being cut off from her family. She wrote on blog platform medium.com in February: ‘Up until now, our names have been synonymous with “God Hates Fags”. ‘We know that we’ve done and said things that hurt people. Inflicting pain on others wasn’t the goal, but it was one of the outcomes. We wish it weren’t so, and regret that hurt. ‘We know that we dearly love our family. They now consider us betrayers, and we are cut off from their lives, but we know they are well-intentioned. We will never not love them.’ Miss Phelps-Roper ran the church’s social media presence, posting on Twitter up to 150 times a day from her phone, and her mother, Shirley, had called her her ‘right-hand man’. Synonymous with hate: Ms Phelps-Roper wrote that she regrets the hurt she caused while being part of spreading the Westboro message which included picketing funerals of U.S. personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan (pictured Fred Phelps Jr. at a protest) Strong views: Made up mostly by the Kansas-based Phelps family, the religious group blames most tragedies on what they call a 'pro-gay' agenda in America . She acted as a spokesperson for the group and did hundreds of interviews with journalists from all around the world. She . said: 'Until very recently, this is what I lived, breathed, studied, . believed, preached – loudly, daily, and for nearly 27 years. 'I never thought it would change. I never wanted it to. Then suddenly: it did. And I left.' Church member Margie Phelps took to Twitter today as news broke of Ms Phelps-Roper’s departure from the church. She posted: 'Some day . @washingtonpost will get it-standard of God doesn't change for anyone, . including #NotOfUs @meganphelps.' Westboro Baptist Church has made international news many times for its strong views against homosexuality. 'Future leader': Ms Phelps-Roper was once described as the next leader of the church founded by her grandfather Reverend Fred Phelps . Made up mostly by the Kansas-based . Phelps family, the religious group blames most tragedies - from the . death of American soldiers to the recent massacre of 20 children and six . adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School - on what they call a 'pro-gay' agenda in America. Recently, . Margie Phelps said in a video-taped interview that God sent . the 20-year-old Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, to kill 20 people in Connecticut in December last year . because the state legalized same-sex marriage. 'Connecticut . was one of the first states to come out with same-sex marriage,' Phelps . said as she sat beside a blood-red-stained sign that read: 'God sent . the shooter.' Former member Libby Phelps Alvarez, 29, recently spoke about her departure from the church and finding peace in her new life which did not restrict her from having a haircut, traveling and being confined to the borders of the U.S. She decided to leave after church members confronted her about a bikini she had worn during a family vacation that she decided to follow her brother’s lead, who had left two years earlier. Estranged from her family, Mrs Phelps Alvarez now lives in Lawrence not far from the University of Kansas campus with her newlywed husband, Logan. Documentary maker Louis Theroux has made two documentaries, in 2007 and 2011, about the Phelps family, interviewing founder Reverend Fred Phelps, Ms Phelps-Roper’s mother and Megan herself. He made the second documentary, with the title 'America's Most Hated Family in Crisis' after two other young members of the church decided to leave. He said at the time: ‘I’ve always been fascinated by this organisation. They operate as a cult, but are pretty unique in that they have allowed the media, and me, in. Yet after our first programme, two of the children of the family left the church, and contacted me. ‘I’m not claiming they left because of the programme, but it was obviously a factor. I was curious to go back, to see why.’ Exodus: Former member Libby Phelps Alvarez, 29, recently spoke about her departure from the church and starting her new life which did not restrict her from having a haircut, traveling and being confined to the borders of the U.S .","Lauren Drain, 27, left the church in 2008 and has written a book about the 'manipulative' Kansas group .

Vietnam is not the only country cracking down on chubby policemen. As global obesity rates have soared in recent years, countries . including the UK, Mexico and South Africa have introduced similar measures to . help keep their police officers trim. In Britain, the Metropolitan Police are now faced with fitness tests and possible pay cuts after it was discovered one in five of them was obese. In South Africa, officers were told in 2010 that they all had to fit into a new one-size uniform by the end of the year. If they needed a larger size then they could expected to lose their jobs. More gravely, the Hanoi traffic police has a reputation for corruption and abuse, as well as its unappealing appearance. The Hanoi traffic police was voted one of the 'most corrupt' institutions in Vietnam according to a recent World Bank-funded survey.

This latest image initiative is part of a series of . attempts to improve the Hanoi traffic police's faltering relationship with the public. In 2011 officers were banned from wearing sunglasses or hiding behind trees to fine unaware motorists.

Admission: Pavel Dmitrichenko looks out from the defendant's holding cell during a court hearing in Moscow . The top Bolshoi dancer accused of masterminding the acid attack on artistic director Sergei Filin, right,  has admitted he paid just £1085 to get revenge for not giving his girlfriend the good roles . An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to attack Filin. While accepting he wanted his boss beaten up, he insisted: 'It's not true that I ordered him to throw acid at Filin'. 'I told Yuri Zarutsky about the policies of the Bolshoi Theatre, about the bad things going on, the corruption,' he said. 'When he said: `OK, let me beat him up, hit him over the head,' I agreed, but that is all that I admit to doing.'

Arrests: Alleged masked attacker Yury Zarutsky (left) and Andrei Lipatov (right), the driver who took part in attack on Filin, have both confessed to their involvement, police say . The case has become more murky as . Filin claimed from hospital in Germany that Russian police have failed . to arrest all those responsible while a prominent ex-prima ballerina . alleges a full scale cover-up is underway. 'It's not true that I ordered him to throw acid at Filin,' he said. He was motivated by fury at Filin snubbing his partner 21-year-old Anzhelina Vorontsova, claim police. 'The . main reason he gave to the investigator is revenge,' a police source . told Izvestia. 'Filin did not let her play leading dancing roles in the . Bolshoi. Dmitrichenko stressed that he did not ask for an acid attack and wanted the attackers only to beat Filin.' Arrest: . Russian police used mobile phone data to arrest the trio for the acid . attack on Sergei Filin, (pictured) artistic director of Russia's . world-famous Bolshoi ballet . Bolshoi ballet's artistic director, Sergei Filin before the attack . Dmitrichenko . - who faces up to 12 years in jail if found guilty - claimed in court . that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 . January attack on Filin. 'When I heard what happened to Sergei, I was just in shock,' he said. 'I could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid. 'I did not order harm done to this man.' However, Dmitrichenko and accomplices . evidently also hacked 16,000 emails of top Bolshoi figures as he sought . to prove that Filin demanded a percentage of fees obtained by troupe . members in TV or sponsored dancing engagements outside the theatre. 'If . you want to take part in something like this, you must make an . agreement with the boss and, as far as I know, share your profits,' he . said. Filin has not commented on this claim but speaking through his wife . Maria Prorvich told how he  suspicions about Dmitrichenko - but believed . that a 'much wider' circle of people linked to the theatre were . involved. She claimed those guilty included 'not just the three who they arrested. We hope the security forces unearth all those people who are connected . to this crime.' She also strongly disputed that Dmitrichenko's anger over Vorontova was the only reason behind the attack. This theory was 'exceptional and wild', said said, adding: 'It is unlikely that it is all because of one ballerina. Sergei thinks that motives for this crime are a bit different. And this girl is just a cause but surely not the main reason for the crime.' Her comments suggest that a plot to blind and disfigure Filin with acid may go much wider and perhaps higher at the Bolshoi. Meanwhile, 37 year old Anastasia Volochkova - well known to London . audiences and once controversially fired by the Bolshoi for being . allegedly overweight - expressed doubt that Dmitrichenko was really the . key player behind the attack.

Performance: Pavel Dmitrichenko as Ivan The Terrible in Bolshoi in November . 'I have got my own idea. It seems to me that all this is a fake version and has nothing to do with the accident,' she said. 'The administration of the Bolshoi is trying to disclaim its guilt and to kill all suspicions.' Alleging a cover-up, she said: 'All that is going on now is an attempt . to take the suspicions away from the administration which may have been . connected to this event.' Another Bolshoi source added doubt to the police version that Dmitrichenko was the mastermind. 'Filin certainly squeezed out Vorontsova, but that is not a reason to throw acid in someone's face.'

Two men with longstanding HIV infections no longer have detectable HIV in their blood cells years after having bone marrow transplants. The virus was easily detected in both men in their lymphocytes - blood cells that work to defend the immune system against attack - before the operation. However, it became undetectable eight months after the surgery. The patients, who were treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), have remained on anti-retroviral therapy since the transplant. These drugs work to suppress the virus. HIV being released into human lymphatic tissue: Scientists have found no HIV in two patients' cells after they had bone marrow transplants . 'This gives us some important information,' said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes. 'It suggests that under the cover of anti-retroviral therapy, the cells that repopulated the patient's immune system appear to be protected from becoming re-infected with HIV.' One patient's bone marrow transplant was two years ago while the other was four years ago. Over time, as the patients' cells were replaced by donor cells, traces of HIV were lost. The level of HIV antibody, a measure of exposure to HIV, also declined in both men. 'We expected HIV to vanish from the patients' plasma, but it is surprising that we can't find any traces of HIV in their cells,' said Dr Timothy Henrich. 'The next step is to determine if there are any traces of HIV in their tissue.' Timothy Brown known as the 'Berlin Patient' and the only person to have been cured of AIDS, after having bone marrow from someone known to be resistant to HIV . The research team is currently designing studies that would enable them to look for HIV in the tissues. Researchers also plan to study additional HIV-positive patients who have undergone a bone marrow transplant. Researchers point out that there are two key differences between the Brigham patients and the 'Berlin patient,' Timothy Brown, who was functionally cured of HIV after a stem cell transplant. In the Berlin patient's case, his donor was specifically chosen because the donor had a genetic mutation that resisted HIV. The Brigham patients' bone marrow transplants were done without any thought to selecting an HIV-resistant donor. Second, the Berlin patient ceased anti-retroviral therapy after his transplant, while the Brigham patients have remained on anti-retroviral therapy. Their cases will be presented at the International AIDS Conference at the BWH in Boston.","One man has had no detectable HIV in his blood cells for two years while the other has been clear for four .

Scientists will begin clinical trials in 12 months, using stem cells harvested from a blood sample from the patients . Scientists are working on a new weapon in the war against wrinkles. There are not many things women have not tried in the quest for a youthful complexion – from lotions and potions to Botox and cosmetic surgery. But a British firm is trialling a new method which involves injecting the patient’s own stem cells to restore skin’s youthful elasticity. Researchers believe they will spur the growth of new skin cells, called fibroblasts, which make the elastic ingredient collagen which is produced in large quantities when we are young, but declines as we age. The company Pharmacells, based in Glasgow, plan to begin clinical trials in 12 months, using stem cells harvested from a blood sample from the patients. They believe the procedure could be commercially available in just three years, potentially revolutionising the market for anti-ageing treatments. By using the body’s own cells, it is billed as a more ‘natural’ approach to reducing the signs of ageing than Botox, a chemical which freezes the facial muscles to smooth wrinkles. They have licenced the technology to harvest a new type of stem cell – called a blastomere-like stem cell (CORR) – which is found circulating in the blood. Like other types of stem cells, it is unspecialised and can develop into many other types of cell in the human body such as a liver, brain or skin cell. The advantage of this particular one it is available in very large doses from one blood sample. They hope to inject 500millon of the cells in the skin in one jab. Athol Haas, the company’s chief executive said: ‘The skin has a natural elastic property which comes from cells known as fibroblasts. ‘The ability of the body to produce this elastic material slows down with age because the number of these fibroblasts decreases. ‘By introducing large numbers of stem cells into the right place, we are increasing the ability of the body to produce this natural material. It will be long lasting, we think at least five years if not longer.’ Pharmacells will be carrying out the first trial on patients with a clinic in Hong Kong to see if the treatment is safe to use. There are ‘stem cell facelifts’ already on the market which involve taking a fat sample from a patient – under local anaesthetic and injecting it into the face for around £7,500. But Mr Haas said: ‘The stem cells in fat are more mature so the quality is not so good, and the numbers of them in it are much smaller, around five or 10 million. ‘We are talking about 500 million, very high quality, pure stem cells and there is definitely a link between dose and efficacy. The more you have, the better it should be.’ These stem cells, discovered by researchers in the USA around 10 years ago, are deployed by the body when there is a trauma in an organ. Because they can turn into up to 50 types of other cells, Pharmacells is investigating their uses against heart attacks, Alzheimers, Parkinson’s disease and cancer. By turning them into skin cells, they could also be used against acne scars and stretch marks, he said. Rajiv Grover, a plastic surgeon and president elect of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeon, said it could be five to 10 years before stem cell treatments for wrinkles were widely available. He said: ‘It is an exciting prospect as the science of stem cells will influence plastic surgery and cosmetic medicine significantly in the future.",British firm is trialling new method by injecting patient's own stem cells to restore skin's youthful elasticity .

In a twisting murder plot, 19-year-old Jose Martinez has been arrested in the death of Jaime Meza Guzman, 45, while he slept in his Las Vegas, Nevada home on Monday with the teen accusing his daughter as being behind the plot. Found stabbed 30 to 40 times in his bed, both Mr Guzman's 17-year-old daughter and Martinez have been charged with murder, conspiracy and burglary, according to the Las Vegas Sun. Scroll down for video . Attack: Jose Martinez, 19, has been arrested and charged alongside his 17-year-old girlfriend in the murder of her father on Monday . Speaking with police following his arrest this week, Martinez said he jumped on Guzman and stabbed him with a 3-inch pocket knife several times before placing a blanket over his body. Discovering the father still breathing, the 19-year-old said he continued to strike at the man until he stopped. The girlfriend, whose name has not been released due to her age, stood with her back to her father according to Martinez, facing the bedroom's door that had been stuffed underneath with blankets to muffle any sounds. Martinez told police Guzman denied ever being abusive as he pleaded for his life.

While both Martinez and the girl took a polygraph test, with Martinez several times changing his story according to police, a tipster is said to have called in accusing the daughter behind the plot to murder. Relaying the claims that were made against him, Martinez told police he approached two friends for help with the crime on behalf of his girlfriend, who both refused. Martinez said the friends called the request 'a lot to ask of a friend,' according to the Sun. Martinez told police he didn't want to kill Guzman but hoped to delay any action until the girl could leave the house on her own. Motive: After detectives interviewed Martinez he said that his girlfriend accused her father of abusing her and had asked several times to help her kill him . Speaking to police this week, the 17-year-old said that she and her father had gotten into a fight on Sunday evening over her career choice before she snuck out around 3.30am on Monday morning to see Martinez. When his girlfriend later called him telling him it was time, he said he came over and together they entered into Guzman's bedroom. Police arriving at the scene of the crime just after noon said they found a Post-it-Note on the girl's bedroom floor reading: 'He's slept with the door open and woke up with I called you. Don't hear snoring now only little,' the green sheet of paper, matching a similar set on her desk read, reports the Sun. Martinez is set for a court hearing on Thursday. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney. When detectives informed the girl of Martinez's confession, asking her if she'd like a parent or other guardian present, she asked for an attorney.

Students at Harvard University woke up on Friday to find inflammatory invitations had been pushed under their bedroom doors. A sealed envelope contained a flyer inviting undergraduates to 'Harvard’s Newest Final Club' - one of the university's 14 exclusive single-sex social groups. This new organization claimed to be called the Pigeon - two of the all-male clubs, the Owl and the Phoenix, are named after birds. It proclaimed a motto of 'Inclusion, Diversity, Love'. But each word was footnoted. Inclusion had 'Jews need not apply.' Diversity was 'Seriously, no f******g Jews. Coloreds OK.' Love had 'Rophynol' - a misspelling of the date-rape drug rohypnol. 'Offensive': The invitation that was distributed in all nine Harvard River Houses in the early hours of Friday . The invitation claimed that the first meeting of the new club was at 11.02pm on December 13 at Berryline, a frozen yoghurt shop, and 'semi-bro attire' was required. The leaflets were distributed in nine dormitory houses. Harvard Dean of Students Evelynn M. Hammonds reacted to the pamphlets by saying: 'I find these flyers offensive. They are not a reflection of the values of our community. 'Even if intended as satirical in nature, they are hurtful and offensive to many students, faculty and staff, and do not demonstrate the level of thoughtfulness and respect we expect at Harvard when engaging difficult issues within our community.' No one has yet claimed responsibility for the incident but many at the university do believe that the flyers are satirical.

Harvard final clubs are controversial on campus as some consider them to be elitist and discriminatory. As the Harvard Crimson reported in 2011, a similar under-the-door campaign (also used by the real clubs) asked students to think twice about joining a final club. That leaflet asked undergraduates to consider the 'exclusivity, 'gender discrimination,' 'unequal access to social space on Harvard’s campus' and 'lack of transparency' of the clubs. Concerns have also been raised about the safety of students at final clubs. In 2010 the Harvard Crimson expressed concerns about sexual assault at the clubs: .

The company defended the design, telling MailOnline: 'Nike has consistently supported female athletes and the position they enjoy as positive role models.

UPDATED: . 15:39 EST, 16 August 2012 . Gabby Douglas' hair was one of the most vigorous talking points during the Olympic Games after many claimed the double gold medalist's look was unkempt. Now, it seems the 16-year-old gymnastics star has succumbed to the pressure sparked by her critics, reaching out to a celebrity hair stylist to tend to her locks. In an effort to silence those critics once and for all, the teen has booked appointments with Ted Gibson, a New York-based hair stylist who has worked with Angelina Jolie, Anne Hathaway and Ashley Greene in the past. And judging by the extremely sleek locks Ms Douglas has showed off during a string of television appearances this week, Mr Gibson may very well have worked some of his magic already. Controversy: Olympic star Gabby Douglas, whose hair sparked a social networking war during the recent Games, has booked a celebrity hair stylist to tend to her dark mane. Critics claimed her hair looked unkempt . Before and after? The Olympic star seen in London (left) and a sleek look just two days ago in New York (right) The flying squirrel's team of managers and agents approached Texas-born Mr Gibson, who owns the Ted Gibson Salon in Manhattan's Flatiron district, last week. It was right before the athlete commenced a jam-packed publicity tour that saw her appear alongside Michelle Obama on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno as well as The Late Show with David Letterman among other programs and activities. Mr Gibson, who also serves as a hair expert on the TV show What Not To Wear, charges $950 for a cut and style at his salon and has even provided services to Ms Jolie's seven-year-old daughter Zahara who was born in Ethiopia and adopted by the mega star and Brad Pitt in 2005. The hair stylist admitted to The Daily Beast that styling Ms Douglas' hair will prove challenging, telling the website: 'It's tricky because Gabby is 16 and I don't want to do anything to make her look 25 years old'. Star: Mr Gibson, who has worked on the A-list as well as on many Fashion Weeks, will care for her dark hair . Top clients: Anne Hathaway (left) and Angelina Jolie (right) are just two of Mr Gibson's A-list clients . He continued: 'Together with her vision, I hope we can create something that's easy and looks great no matter what she's doing or where she is. 'I hope to create something that makes her feel good about herself as well. That's so important and a big part of what I do for all the women I work with.' He further labelled the criticism over Ms Douglas' hair 'shameful'. 'I couldn't believe it and still can't,' he said. 'You have this young girl doing amazing things, and the conversation becomes about her hair? It was ridiculous and shameful.' As the teenager's mother, Natalie Hawkins, pointed out in the past, Mr Gibson believes that many of the sporting champion's critics are African-American women themselves, who are known to go to great lengths to keep their dark hair under control. Busy: The athlete approached Mr Gibson last week ahead of her public appearances including visits to The Late Show with Jay Leno (left), The Late Show with David Letterman (middle) and Good Morning America (right) Superstar: Ms Douglas appeared at a taping of The Late Show with Jay Leno, showing off her sleek new locks . Popular: The Flying Squirrel, as she is affectionately referred to, became one of the Olympics' biggest stars . 'Women of color spend millions and millions of dollars on their hair to look good, so we know how seriously we take the issue of hair,' he said. 'Oprah Winfrey told me once when I was on her show that ""our hair is our crowning glory"". I have to say I agree with Oprah.' Critics had taken to Twitter to express their disapproval over the star's hair. They havd argued that her dark locks should in fact mimic the tight, . ballerina-style bun that gymnasts usually tuck their hair into. One user wrote on Twitter: 'Gabby . Douglas gotta [sic] do something with this hair! These clips and this . brown gel residue aint it!'. Another posted: 'In Olympic news, why hasn't anyone tried to fix Gabby Douglas' hair?'. To which a further user replied: 'That's an Olympic sport too!'. The attacks were suspected to play their part in Ms Douglas' less-then-perfect performances after she had become the first African-American U.S. gymnastics competitor to win the all-around title in the sport. Cruel: Twitter users had claimed that the teenager's hair looked unkempt when she performed at the Olympics . Another comment: Users believed that Ms Douglas' hair required more care than what she had put into it . Big impact: Mr Gibson believes the comments took their toll on the star. She fell off the beam on Day 11 . Mr Gibson believes the controversy surrounding her hair had a huge impact on her performance. He said: 'I believe all that talk had to take a toll on her. How could it not? You've worked so hard for something and then people tear you apart for little or nothing.' The stylist added that he hopes to help the teenager 'feel good about being in her own skin'. 'Women know coming to me is a soothing and nurturing experience that compliments the styles I give them,' he said. 'It's about the hair, and then it's about much more.' Mr Gibson's work has appeared in the pages of several prestigious magazine titles including Vanity Fair, Vogue, Marie Claire and W. But he said he is looking forward to working with Ms Douglas in particular. 'I'm excited because she's so young and I have a chance for input in the brand of Gabby,' he said. 'There are so many opportunities for someone like her to shine, and I get to be part of that on the ground floor.

The second gunman to open fire in Aurora, Colorado in so many months has been identified by neighbors as 33-year-old Sonny Archuleta. The gunman shot dead three people yesterday at a house near the cinema where another lone shooter gunned down 12 people at a screening of ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ in July. Archuleta’s MySpace and Twitter pages reveal that he was deeply religious and lost his brother Pat to gun violence only last year. Police said Archuleta fired shots at officers Saturday from a second-story window before officers killed him. Once inside, they found the bodies of three other adults. Archuleta, who wasn’t formally named as the suspect by police, held officers at bay for nearly six hours after neighbors reported gunfire at 3 a.m. inside the modest townhome in the Denver suburb of Aurora, said police Sgt. Cassidee Carlson. It wasn't known if officers shot the suspect or if he shot himself. A relative told the New York Post that Stacie Phillbrook, her boyfriend, and her stepfather were all killed. Archuleta’s wife, Stephanie, managed to escape the shooting. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Happier times: Archuleta, left, pictured with his wife Stephanie, who survived the shooting . Ongoing: Police continue their investigation outside of a home following an overnight hostage-taking incident in Aurora; four people died including the gunman . What's left: Damage is shown at a townhouse following the overnight hostage-taking incident . Search: Detectives are still investigating the relationship between the suspect and his hostages . Investigators said the two men and one woman appeared to have been killed before officers arrived. According to Archuleta’s Twitter page, his brother, Patricio, was gunned down near MGM’s Restaurant and Lounge in Denver in September of 2011. Loss: Sonny's brother, Patricio, pictured, was killed on September 3, 2011 after being gunned down outside of a restaurant in Denver . Pat Archuleta, 34, was shot to death that Labor Day weekend. The gunman was identified as 33-year-old Luiz Meza. Following the shooting, Sonny Archuleta took to Twitter to write: ‘My brother Pat was murdered in Denver, Colorado on Friday September 3 at 1:45am. Pray for my family and that Jehovah well get the glory from this.’ A large front window was missing in the two-story townhome, the window's mini-blinds in disarray. Bullet holes marked two upstairs windows, and neighbors milled about outside. A fifth person escaped unharmed and called police to report that she saw three people inside the home who 'appeared lifeless,' said Carlson, who declined to elaborate about the woman's escape. A motive for the killings was unknown, and police had yet to say what weapon or weapons were used. Investigators wearing gloves and carrying evidence bags were going over the crime scene. Officers evacuated neighbors' homes during the standoff and used a bullhorn to communicate with the gunman, urging him to surrender. The shootings occurred about four miles southeast of the Aurora Mall, where 12 people were killed and dozens were wounded by a gunman at a midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises' on July 20. The man charged in that shooting, James Holmes, goes to court Monday for a preliminary hearing in which prosecutors will present their case against him. The July shootings prompted Gov. John Hickenlooper - just before the Newtown, Conn., massacre - to say it is time to debate gun control. It's expected to be a heated topic at the Colorado Legislature this year. Aurora, just east of Denver, is one of Colorado's largest and most diverse cities with more than 335,000 residents. It is home to Buckley Air Force Base as well as the sprawling University of Colorado Health Sciences Center campus, where James Holmes studied neuroscience before the movie theater shootings.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:16 EST, 11 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:16 EST, 11 October 2012 . Kennewick Man was definitely not a Native American, according to the most recent study of the prehistoric remains. The 9,300-year-old skeleton actually has more in common with Polynesians, according to Doug Owsley, an anthropologist with the Smithsonian Institute who released an updated review of the bones Wednesday. Owsley found that Kennewick man's skull has several similarities to the ancient coastal people in Asia, meaning he likely shares a common ancestor with modern day Polynesians. Unearthing the truth: Dr. Doug Owsley found no evidence the Kennewick Man was a Native American . Since his discovery in 1996, Kennewick Man has been presumed to be a Native American who lived in the region he was uncovered. The corpse is one of the complete ancient skeletons ever discovered. Kennewick Man was found accidentally by two spectators watching a hydroplane race  in 1996, on the bank of the Columbia River in Kennewick Washington. Scientists were given 10 days to study the bones in 2005. Karabu - Found in South Africa this is the most complete pre-human skeleton discovered dating back 2 million years. The 'Vampire' Skeletons - These 800-yeard old skeletons were found in Bulgaria with rods piercing their chests, a ritual aimed at preventing dangerous people from returning as vampires. King Richard III - Scientists say bones discovered this year under an English parking lot could belong to the monarch, buried in 1485. The skull is split by what appears to be a battle wound. Lucy - Thought to be 3.2 million years old Lucy is thought to be the remains of an early human anscestor, though the specimen is only 40 percent complete . Based on their findings and Owsley's latest research, Kennewick man was likely 39 or 40 years old, stood roughly 5-foot-8 and weighed approximately 160 pounds. He was so strong that the bone in his right arm was curved, and he was probably a practiced spear thrower. An injury in his right soldier, a piece of bone floating in the joint, is often seen in people who throw javelins, . Scientists are still unsure how he died, with his skeleton in excellent condition besides one abscessed tooth. His skull showed evidence of having been fractured but had healed perfectly while his ribs had also been broken but healed less well. He probably had to constantly move to find food meaning his ribs could not rest to heal properly. Researchers believe he was buried where his bones were discovered, laid to rest face up with his chin tucked down and his hands at his sides with palms down. Owsley's report challenges years of assumptions besides Kennewick Man's presumed ties to Native Americans. An isotopic analysis of the bones . shows he was most likely eating a coastal diet of marine protein - most . likely seals - rather than the grazing animals that would have . surrounded him had he lived in Columbia Valley. 'They are not what you would expect . from someone from Columbia Valley,' Owsley said. 'You would have to eat . salmon 24 hours a day and you would not reach these values.' A traveler: Owsley says chemicals found in Kennewick Man's bones indicate a diet more in line with a coastal native than a man in the Columbia Valley . Owsley presented his findings Tuesday at a meeting with Columbia Plateau tribal leaders. Owsley has been at the center of a decade-long legal battle with those same tribes to study Kennewick Man's body. Tribal leaders who claim the bones are of Native American ancestry want to bury them according to Native American tradition. Face from the past: A clay model of Kennewick Man made from his skull may the the face of a Polynesian ancestor . In 2004, a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . ruled the remains were not protected by the federal Native American . Graves Protection Act because they were too old to credibly establish a . link with modern Native Americans. The Burke Museum at the University of Washington has held the remains since 1998. Despite Owsley's findings, tribal leaders still believe Kennewick Man was a Native American. New research indicates Kennewick Man wasn't a Native American and was likely from a coast . Rex Buck, leader of the Wanapum people, thought a diet of lamprey eel could provide the same nutrients Owsley found. 'I hope you would think about . some of these things, too, and add that to your equation,' he told Owsley. But even without the dietary evidence, Owsley said he was certain Kennewick Man was not a Native American. 'There is not any clear genetic relationship to Native American peoples,' he said. 'I do not look at him as a Native American....I can't see any kind of continuity. He is a representative of a very different people.'","Skeleton has been  the subject of lengthy legal battle .

'It's neat, it's different but it's not what I expected,' said Sue McCrery of Southington, a town that borders Newtown. 'I mean the bad guys can have them (modern weapons) and I think it's our right to be able to own them too.' Too close for comfort? The first gun show in Connecticut since the Newtown school massacre took place at the weekend. Organizers pointed out that the event was primarily a collectors' event . Other gun shows canceled, include one this weekend in Danbury, about 12 miles from Newtown, promoter Big Al's Silver Bullet Productions announced on its website. Two shows in New York state - February 23-24 in Poughkeepsie and March 2-3 in Suffern - were also canceled, the website said. In nearby Waterbury, Police Superintendent Michael Gugliotto imposed a moratorium on gun shows the day after the Sandy Hook killings, saying a gun used in a future mass shooting could be traced to a purchase made at a gun show in his city. Westchester Collectors Inc had planned a firearm and knife show for Waterbury on January 12 and 13. Show organizer Newman Chitenden said canceling the show would not improve security. Contentious: The mayor of Stamford said that the event seemed 'untimely and insensitive' Counter-argument: A woman protests in front of the hotel hosting the East Coast Fine Arms Show . Stamford's Republican mayor, Michael Pavia, had asked organizers of the Stamford show to reconsider having the event 'in light of the recent tragic events in Newtown.' 'As a community, we are sensitive to the emotions and feelings of all of those who have suffered losses and are still grieving. 'Holding such an event - at this time, and in such close proximity to the Newtown, seems untimely and insensitive,' Pavia said. Outside the event, around 50 protesters passed out handbills that called the gun show insensitive and held banners supporting gun control and a ban on assault rifles. Kara Baekey, who started a local chapter of One Million Moms for Gun Control just three days after the tragedy, told the Stamford Advocate: 'We just felt it was too soon - it was only three weeks ago that the shooting happened and the Newtown community is still grieving and state of Connecticut are still dealing with what happened.' 'The sheer lack of respect for those still grieving was pretty infuriating for us.' Another protester, Stamford . resident Robin Wexler, also a member of Moms Against Guns, said: 'After what happened only 40 miles . from here there has to be changes to laws and stricter gun control in . order to keep everyone safe.' Enthusiast: An antique collector poses with a hand gun during the show . Making their point: Protestors campaign against gun shows and assault weapons outside the event . But the gun show organizers went ahead, emphasizing that theirs was an antiques event, where the weapons are less deadly and sometimes just for show. The shooter in Newtown used a military-style semi-automatic assault rifle to kill first-graders aged 6 and 7 and school staff. 'This show is primarily a collectors show, most of us here have strictly antiques,' said Dave Kleiner, an antique weapons dealer from Orrtanna, Pennsylvania. 'Closing the gun show? How is that going to help anyone that was hurt in that episode?' Gun shows - akin to a fair, where guns are on sale outside the normal confines of a gun shop - have come under scrutiny for so-called loopholes that sometimes allow sales without subjecting purchasers to a background check. This gun show also caused controversy last week when The Advocate of Stamford newspaper ran an advert for the event next to an article about the Sandy Hook shooting. The Hearst Connecticut Media Group said the ad's placement was the result of an oversight and apologized on Thursday. 'Our newspapers should not be running gun ads - including ads for antique and collectible gun shows - next to stories about Sandy Hook,' the group said. 'It's insensitive, and it shouldn't have happened. We have taken steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.' 'Insensitive': There was outrage last week when the Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, published an advert for this show next to an article about the Sandy Hook school shootings. The publishers apologized on Thursday .","Town mayor asked planners to reconsider, but Stamford show goes on .

A mother has been reunited with her baby after a woman lured her to her home and stole the child from inside her womb, it was reported today. Brazilian Odete Barreto, 22, was 37 weeks pregnant when Daiana dos Santos, 21, invited her to her house telling her she had baby clothes to give away. Once inside Santos knocked her out by hitting her over the head with a wooden plank. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Daiana dos Santos attacked Odette Barreto and cut her baby out of her womb with a razor blade . The woman then used a razor blade to cut open Ms Barreto's belly before removing the baby. Leaving the mother for dead, Santos took the baby into the street, claiming the child was hers. Shocked neighbours ran inside and found Mrs Barreto in a pool of blood. She and the baby were rushed to hospital and both stayed 15 days in intensive care in Manaus, northern Brazil.

According to police, Santos became desperate after being told earlier on September 27 that she wasn't pregnant, as she had believed. She met her victim at the same health clinic where she had been given the bad news, and convinced her to come back with her to her house. Police chief Adriano Feliz told Brazil's R7 website: ""Doctors told her that she wasn't pregnant but that her bump was actually a myoma, she became hysterical, wanting to get a child any way she could. 'She was terrified that her husband would leave her when he discovered she wasn't expecting after all.' Ms Barreto saw her baby for the first time yesterday, when both were released from hospital.

A New York man is being held without bail after he viciously attacked his wife and former boss with a blow torch on Wednesday, authorities said. Carlos Diaz, 35, set fire to his estranged wife, leaving her with second-degree burns on her body, hands, face and neck. While she was still burning, Diaz went after the man who had recently fired him as a mechanic and tried to ignite him too. Having attacked his estranged wife with a blow torch, leaving her with serious burns, Carlos Diaz visited the garage where he had recently lost his job and doused his ex-boss with gasoline . Diaz began the sickening attacks at 7.50 am on Wednesday on Ninth Avenue near West 207th Street in Inwood, Manhattan. He believed his wife, 38-year-old Cathy Zappata, had been been cheating on him so attacked her in a parking lot. Diaz tried to force her out of her vehicle, striking her with the blowtorch when she refused. He then poured lighter fluid over her face and hair, and ignited it. 'In essence, judge, her entire head was set on fire with an accelerant and a blow torch,' said Assistant District Attorney Scott Leet, as reported by the New York Post. Zappata is currently in a serious but stable condition at the burn unit at Harlem Hospital. Diaz then moved on to the auto body shop at 3966 10th Avenue where he had recently lost his job and targeted his former employer. Carlos Diaz viciously attacked his estranged wife and former boss with a blow torch, leaving the woman with second degree burns . The firebug doused the unnamed 60-year-old man in gasoline in preparation for burning him too. But the ex-boss managed to get free, even while Diaz was trying to set him on fire. Diaz eventually turned himself into police. The Post reports that he told officers that he had been hoping to 'burn them both alive.' A law enforcement source told the Post: 'He had no money, no job. He was sleeping in his van. He'd had enough.' Yet the prosecutor argued that Diaz should not be released, claiming: 'The facts of this case scream that he be remanded.' Manhattan Supreme Court judge Matthew Sciarrino agreed and Diaz is being held without bail on charges of attempted murder, assault and attempted assault. Diaz is expected back in court on Friday, where it is expected he will be indicted by the end of the day.","Carlos Diaz, 35, burnt his wife with accelerant and a blow torch, leaving her with second-degree burns on her head and face .

The memory of eating a large meal can make people feel less hungry hours after tucking into food, according to new research. After a series of tests experts found that people who think they have eaten more - but have actually eaten an average-sized or smaller portion - are less likely to experience hunger pangs hours later. The discovery could now be used to help dieters struggling to lose weight. The memory of a big meal could make you feel less hungry and help you lose weight, researchers at Bristol University have found . They then manipulated the amount of soup they actually ate using a hidden pump that could refill or empty a soup bowl without the eater noticing. Professor Jeffrey Brunstorm and his . colleagues from the University of Bristol made the discovery after . showing a volunteers either a small or large bowl of soup just before . lunch. Immediately after they had eaten, the level of hunger reported by the volunteers was equal to the amount of food they had eaten, not the amount they had seen just before eating. However, two to three hours after lunch, volunteers who had been shown a larger portion of soup were significantly less hungry than those who had seen the smaller portion. Researchers manipulated the amount of soup the volunteers had eaten via a hidden pump that could refill or empty the bowl without them knowing. They hope that dieters could be tricked into thinking they had eaten more to help them control their hunger pangs even though they had had a smaller portion . Twenty four hours later, more of these volunteers who had seen the bigger portions believed that the portion of soup they had consumed would satisfy their hunger. A drink that could not only help you lose weight, but could also treat epilepsy, diabetes and possibly even Alzheimer's has been developed by Oxford scientists. The drink has been brewed by Kieran Clarke, professor of physiological biochemistry at Oxford University and head of its Cardiac Metabolism Research Group, at the behest of the U.S. Army. The drink doesn’t involve a new drug. It contains something our bodies produce all the time. This key ingredient is ketones — the sources of energy our bodies make naturally when we start using up our fat stores for energy because there are no carbs around. According to the authors, their results show the impact memory processes have on feelings of satiety after a meal. They believe their findings could be used to trick dieters into thinking they were more full, and in turn reduce how much they ate. Prof Brunstrom said: 'For the first time, this manipulation exposes the independent and important contribution of memory processes to satiety. 'Opportunities exist to capitalise on this finding to reduce energy intake in humans. 'This study is exciting because it exposes a role for cognition in the control of hunger - appetite isn’t governed solely by the physical size and composition of the meals we consume.' The study was published in the open access journal PLOS ONE.","People who think they have eaten more are less likely to feel hungry later .

Luka Magnotta, the suspected cannibal killer, poses happily with two of the big screen's most infamous monsters... just a few years before he took his own place in the annals of real crime. Magnotta smiles as Mike Myers and Freddie Kruger take a swipe as his neck in a pitcure from a visit to a Florida theme park in 2007. While they are the stuff of the darkest parts of our imagination, it is alleged that Magnotta went on to . perform his sick fantasies for real. The only question now is: how many . times? Which one's the real monster? Luka Magnotta, the suspect in the Canadian cannibal case, stands flanked by actors portraying horror characters Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers on Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, in 2007 . Today it emerged that Magnotta has . been linked to a second killing, in which a severed head, hands and feet . were left beneath the iconic Hollywood sign. Parts of retired airline worker Hervey . Medellin, 66, were discovered at the landmark in Los Angeles, . California, in January - when Magnotta is thought to have been in the . city. Police in LA are now said to be . investigating if Magnotta was behind the killing, which has echoes of . his alleged brutal slaying of 33-year-old Chinese student Jun Lin. Another victim? Hervey Medellin's severed head was discovered beneath the Hollywood sign in January, when Magnotta was reportedly in the city . Magnotta, 29, a bisexual prostitute . who had plastic surgery to look like James Dean, was arrested in Germany . on Monday as he viewed naked photographs of himself in an internet . cafe. The Sun claims his Hollywood pimp - . named only as Alex - told them the Canadian was working as a rent boy in . Los Angeles at the time Mr Medellin's body was murdered. Soon after the gay retiree's remains . were discovered, Magnotta was reportedly using a Facebook page to offer . 'massages' to male clients at a flat in the city. In another grisly twist to the case, . police investigating the disappearance of Mr Lin said yesterday that two . of student's missing body parts – a right hand and a right foot – had been . recovered. They were posted to a primary school . and a private boys’ school in Vancouver from Montreal, the city in which . officers suspect Mr Lin was murdered by Magnotta. Police said staff at False Creek Elementary School opened a package containing a hand on Tuesday afternoon. Taunting: Luka Rocco Magnotta posted three videos while on the run from authorities on a YouTube page that has since been taken down . Smoke: Magnotta puffs on a cigarette and poses . to camera in one of the chilling videos. He was arrested on Monday at an . internet cafe in Berlin . Another containing a foot was . discovered at St George’s private school for boys later in the day. Officers said the packages did not appear to have been intended for any . specific pupil or member of staff. Disturbing: This new photo of Luka Rocco Magnotta, the man accused of hacking his gay lover to pieces, shows the Canadian porn actor looking menacing with a switch blade . Montreal police commander Ian . Lafreniere said DNA tests would be conducted to confirm the body parts . belonged to Mr Lin, but added: ‘They were the same limbs we were looking . for. They also were shipped from Montreal, where the killing occurred.’ It also emerged last night that . Magnotta - who has been dubbed the 'Canadian cannibal' apparently . couldn’t resist taunting authorities while on the run, and left an . enormous online footprint of videos and Facebook posts. The brazen videos – which authorities . believe were posted last Saturday through Monday, prior to his arrest in . Berlin – feature the low-budget gay porn star smoking and saying hello . to ‘all my fans.’ He used different music in all three . videos, including New Order’s True Faith. That track was also used in . the grisly video Magnotta posted depicting him torturing and . dismembering Mr Lin. The three videos were posted under the YouTube moniker ibechillin69, which has since been closed. Montreal police Cmdr. Denis Mainville confirmed to newspaper La Presse that the videos are indeed recent. He said: ‘We must check the clothing, . the physical aspects. The French police will give us a hand, adding: ‘It . would be very surprising if it was filmed before the murder.’ Trans-national: Pieces of Jun Lin were discovered more than 2,800 miles apart after Magnotta dropped his lover's dismembered limbs in the post . Poser: Another image posted online by Magnotta reading 'I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way' The songs – Madonna’s La Isla Bonita, . The Great Commandment by German band Camouflage, and New Order’s True . Faith – were all released in 1987, thestar.com noted. However, police have not yet found the significance of those songs, nor why Magnotta, who was born in 1982, chose them. Investigators have already disclosed . that Magnotta put a video on the internet of himself not only killing . and dismembering his victim in his flat but also eating parts of the . body. A police car arrived at Moabit jail this morning, believed to be carrying Magnotta who is to be brought before a judge in Berlin . Grisly: A packaged containing a human hand was . opened by staff at False Creek Elementary School, right, on Tuesday . while another package containing a human foot was found by staff at St. George's private school for boys, left, later in the day . Investigation: The British Columbia Coroner's Service and the Vancouver police's major crime investigators have been called in . Spotted: Interpol launched a hunt for Magnotta last Tuesday after a headless torso was found behind Magnotta's flat in Montreal and a hand and foot were posted to political parties in Ottawa . Targeted? Police said there is no indication any student or staff has been targeted at either school . Following an international manhunt, . the actor was arrested in Berlin on Monday after evading police for days . while he partied in Paris. He was searching for online reports . about the case and looking at naked pictures of himself when he was . recognised by a member of staff in an internet cafe. He has told German . officials he will not fight extradition to Canada. The crime came to light last week when . body parts – now proven to be those of Mr Lin – were posted to the . headquarters of Canada’s Liberal and Conservative parties. A torso was found in a suitcase on a rubbish dump outside Magnotta’s apartment building, but the victim’s head remains missing. International: Magnotta could be returned to Canada as early as this week, according to authorities . Murdered: Jun Lin was a Chinese exchange student in Montreal, who once dated Magnotta. A video shows him being horribly mutilated and partially eaten . Spotted: Magnotta was identified in an internet cafe in Berlin, allegedly searching for images of himself . Caught: An employee at the Spatkauf Internet-Cafe recognized Magnotta and called police. When German officials entered the premises, he did not resist . A copy of what police believe is a . video of the killing shows a man hitting his naked and bound victim . repeatedly with an icepick. He then cuts up the body, performs sexual acts on it and feeds parts to pets. Police are trying to remove the ten-minute video from the internet but it has already been viewed nearly two million times. Entitled ‘one lunatic, one icepick’ and set to music by British band New Order, it shows the killer using a fork and knife. Police suggested they had a longer . version of the film which reveals him eating parts of  the body. Commander Lafreniere said: ‘As gross and as graphic as it could be, yes, . it was seen on the video. We’re keeping some details for ourselves.’ Jailed: The central police detention facility of Berlin where Luka Rocco Magnotta is being held in Berlin, Germany . Multiples: Police said he has 70 Facebook accounts under different names . Officers believe Magnotta flew to . Paris soon after allegedly murdering Mr Lin on May 24. He chose the . French capital because he knew people there from an earlier visit, they . said.

There has yet to be any explanation for why the school packages came to light only this week. Alias: Magnotta, pictured at right at age 6, was said to use the name Eric Newman. Police said he may dress as a woman to avoid capture and released a sketch, left, during their manhunt . Concern: Parents were distraught by the news of the suspicious package . Hunt: Police said the body they found of Mr Lin was still missing a head, hand and foot, but would not immediately confirm if the found appendages were his .

"By . Jason Groves . UPDATED: . 04:46 EST, 5 September 2011 . Labour ministers should have knifed Gordon Brown before the last election, Alistair Darling admitted yesterday, as he  painted a devastating picture  of the former Prime Minister’s ‘appalling behaviour and flawed judgment’. Mr Darling, one of the few figures to emerge with credit from the last Government, said Mr Brown’s refusal to accept the severity of the economic crisis had wrecked Labour’s hopes of a fourth term in office. In a new book, Mr Darling said he failed to act against Mr Brown because of ‘residual loyalty’ and a fear that forcing him out without identifying an obvious successor would plunge Labour into  civil war. At loggerheads: Former prime minister Gordon Brown and former chancellor Alistair Darling warred with each other . But yesterday he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that ministers should have moved against him over his refusal to accept economic reality. Opening up: The memoirs reveal the turbulent days during Labour's last few years . He said: ‘I think we could have done a better job than we did. ‘There were lots of discussions like that – you know, you have a discussion with someone you have a tempestuous relationship with and they say, “We can’t go on like this, we’ll change”, and two hours later we’re back where we were. ‘If you want to criticise us collectively, perhaps we should have done something.’ He said the ‘disagreement at the very top’ had ended Labour’s economic credibility. He said: ‘If you don’t have a credible economic policy, you are simply not at the races, and our problem was it was so blindingly obvious to the outside world that the two of us, Gordon and myself, were at odds, that it really hampered us when it came to the election of 2010.’ In his book the former Chancellor accused Mr Brown of working in a ‘permanent air of chaos and crisis’. He said that Mr Brown’s ‘cabal’ operated a ‘fairly brutal regime – and many of us fell foul of it’. He went on: ‘Gordon is not an easy man to work with. ‘He is a man capable of huge gestures of generosity, but he seemed to have no conception of the effects of his sometimes appalling behaviour on those close to him, or of the political damage his way of operating – indirectly, through a cabal – could cause.’ Mr Darling said Mr Brown ‘surrounded himself with a cadre of people whose preoccupation was the removal of Tony Blair’. The feuding created a ‘cancer’ at the heart of Labour. He said that when Mr Brown finally removed Mr Blair, he appeared to have little idea what he wanted to do as Prime Minister. ‘It was all about tactics rather than strategy,’ he wrote. Telling it like it is: Former chancellor Alistair Darling appearing on The Andrew Marr Show where he revealed that perhaps Labour politicians 'should have done something' about Gordon Brown . The former Chancellor attacked bankers for failing to grasp the scale of the financial crisis, saying that even as they were teetering on the brink of collapse, they  simply did not understand they would go under without state help on the government’s terms. He lambasted them for the ‘disdain’ with which they greeted his plan to inject billions of pounds of public money into their institutions. In an interview with the Sunday Times, he described a make-or-break meeting at 11 Downing Street with bankers, and said: ‘When I told them what we were offering, there was a stunned silence, which I mistook for appreciation. Far from it – they started quibbling. I said to them, “You can take it or leave it, and if you leave it, God help you”.’ Mr Darling also attacked Sir Fred ‘the Shred’ Goodwin, former chief executive of RBS, for having no understanding of the failures at his bank. On one occasion, Mr Darling said Sir Fred strolled out of a life-and-death rescue meeting ‘as if he were off for a game of golf’. The Conservatives seized on the revelations and claimed that Labour was still in the grip of Mr Brown’s most loyal advisers. Tory MP Greg Hands MP said: ‘While the spirit of Gordon Brown lives on within the Labour leadership, the public won’t trust them to run the economy or the country.’ Mr Darling faced a Labour backlash. Labour education spokesman Andy Burnham said he still had ‘huge respect’ for Mr Brown’s achievements and added: ‘I do not believe it is that helpful to rake over these coals.’ Serious questions: Ed Balls was in total denial about the budget deficit according to Alistair Darling . Ed Balls is facing serious questions about his economic credibility after Mr Darling suggested he and Gordon Brown were in total denial about the budget deficit. Mr Darling’s memoirs paint a surreal picture of the Labour Government’s handling of the economic crisis, with Mr Brown and his closest lieutenants refusing to accept the scale of the crisis facing Britain. Mr Brown attempted to replace Mr Darling with Mr Balls in a 2009 reshuffle – and even at one point offered him David Miliband’s job as Foreign Secretary. Mr Darling stood his ground, saying he refused to be ‘trashed and sacrificed’. The move was dropped after James Purnell’s sudden resignation from the Cabinet weakened Mr Brown’s hand. Mr Balls is now in charge of trying to restore Labour’s economic credibility, but the Tories said the revelations raised fresh questions about his suitability as Shadow Chancellor. Tory deputy chairman Michael Fallon said: ‘Gordon Brown’s protege Ed Balls is still in denial by sticking to the same course of more spending and more borrowing. And it’s extraordinary that he was putting political plotting ahead of the national interest in the middle of an economic crisis.’ Mr Darling wrote that in the summer of 2008, when the Treasury was warning that Britain faced the worst recession since the Second World War, Mr Brown simply refused to believe it, and began crafting his own economic strategy based on the idea that the downturn would only last six months. This refusal to accept the need for spending cuts led to ‘pitched battles’ with Mr Darling. The former Chancellor said his relationship with Mr Brown was ‘driven to breaking point’ in the run-up to the 2009 Budget. He said: ‘Gordon and I were unable to agree about growth forecasts and strategy; our disagreement can be boiled down to investment in the economy versus the need to cut borrowing. Forty-eight hours before its presentation, we had no Budget. It’s a tribute to the Treasury team that they worked through the night to get the thing done. ‘The tension levels are extraordinary, and this Budget was the worst of my time as chancellor. We were rewriting it literally until the last minute.’ Mr Darling said he was eventually forced to present a budget forecast that ‘simply lacked credibility’. However Mr Brown pressed on with his claim that the forthcoming election would be fought on the argument of Labour investment versus Tory cuts – a strategy which led to ‘some very angry exchanges’ with his Chancellor. Mr Darling said: ‘He told me I was undermining him and it had to stop. I certainly was not, I said. Why would I do that? Didn’t he understand that I was trying, desperately, to give him, the government, a realistic platform on which to go forward? I told him we could not continue to argue a case that did not stand up. The evidence was there for all to see.’","Says he failed toe act because of 'residual loyalty'

Kate Winslet was yesterday labelled a ‘silly and irresponsible celebrity’ for apparently endorsing a campaign to legalise cannabis. The Oscar-winning actress left herself wide open to criticism following an ill-judged decision to appear in a 17-second YouTube clip alongside Sir Richard Branson to promote Breaking the Taboo, a documentary made by his son Sam which supports decriminalising drugs. Miss Winslet, 37, who is currently dating Sir Richard’s nephew Ned Rocknroll, does not appear in the documentary but features in the black-and-white promotional clip saying: ‘I’m Kate Winslet and I’m breaking the taboo.’ Scroll down for video . Black and white: Kate Winslet has appeared in a YouTube video to promote Breaking the Taboo, a documentary which sets out the case for decriminalising drugs . Sir Richard Branson, whose son Sam made the documentary, appears alongside the actress in a 17-second YouTube clip . It is understood Miss Winslet got involved with the film because of her relationship with Mr Rocknroll. More than a dozen stars, including Sting, historian Niall Ferguson and John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, listed as supporters of Breaking the Taboo, which calls on governments to ‘end the war on drugs’. The campaign is run by the Beckley Foundation – the drug charity behind Channel 4’s recent Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial – in association with Sir Richard’s Virgin Unite foundation and his son Sam’s film company Sundog Pictures. A source close to Miss Winslet, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her role in The Reader in 2008, said she was happy to promote the film and encourage debate but was not calling for the legalisation of drugs. However, Mary Brett, of anti-cannabis campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense (CanSS) described Miss Winslet’s actions as ‘completely irresponsible'. Big names: The campaign is supported by a host of famous faces including Yoko Ono and Sting . She continued: 'She’s a role model for all sorts of young people. A lot of these celebrities jump on the bandwagon to be trendy and cool. It’s this message from celebrities going to kids that drugs are ok and they’re not. ‘She’s not a kid but a 30-something. I would hope she realises how silly she is.’ Kate Winslet, who was awarded a CBE for services to drama last month, has now been released from a list of supporters on the campaign's website . Miss Winslet’s name and photograph have been removed from a list of supporters on the campaign’s website. The campaign is being run in conjunction with the film and suggests ‘solutions’ to the ‘war on drugs’, including proposals to ‘fully legalise and regulate the drug market’ and ‘decriminalise all drugs’. It was later claimed Miss Winslet’s name had been included on the  website without her knowledge or permission. Sources said the actress’s involvement ‘starts and ends with [the YouTube] gesture of support for the film’. A source said: ‘There was a mistake, she shouldn’t have been on there. We’ve had her taken off. ‘She doesn’t support all the things on that list, she supports the film. ‘Kate got involved with the film because of her relationship with Sir Richard’s nephew, Ned. Kate does not, and never has, used drugs. 'Her support for the film is because she supports the film’s attempt to open the debate on alternative and more effective ways to end the misery that the drug trade causes.’ A spokesman for the Bransons admitted: ‘Kate Winslet has been supportive in joining the viral campaign for our documentary. 'Kate should only have been featured in the film/viral section, where [the video clip] now sits – this was rectified as soon as we realised the error.’ The debacle will be a source of embarrassment for Miss Winslet and her boyfriend of 15 months, Mr Rocknroll, 34, who works in marketing and ‘astronaut relations’ for Sir Richard’s Virgin Galactic, the company which plans to take the first tourists into space.

Warning: Dr Fred Kavalier told four directors of Harmoni in December 2010 of his urgent concerns. Two years later Axel Peanberg King, pictured with his mother Linda, died . A doctor who worked for England's largest independent provider of out-of-hours care has warned standards are so poor patients are being put at risk. Dr Fred Kavalier claims to have told four directors of Harmoni in December 2010 that he had an 'urgent concern about the quality and safety of the service Harmoni is providing.' Two years later, baby Axel Peanberg King died following 'wholly inadequate' decisions made by an out-of-hours Harmoni doctor based on a one-minute phone call. Dr Muttu Shantikumar ignored the pleas from Linda Peanberg King for her seven-week-old son, who was suffering from pneumonia, to be seen as soon as possible, an inquest last week was told. He downgraded her call from ‘urgent’ to ‘routine’ and left her waiting for nearly four hours for an appointment because he did not deem the baby’s situation an emergency. With her dying son in her arms, the 35-year-old mother, from Islington, London, then had to wait in line behind six non-emergency patients at the private out-of-hours GP service Harmoni, at Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London. St Pancras Coroner’s Court heard that it was only when an off-duty nurse spotted that Axel had turned ‘grey and floppy’ that he received emergency care – but by then it was too late and he died at the hospital from bronchopneumonia five days after falling ill. Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Radcliffe described the brief phone conversation between Dr Shantikumar and Mrs Peanberg King as ‘wholly inadequate’, adding that the doctor ‘asked insufficient questions’. Harmoni have released a statement saying the coroner was clear that she found no evidence of systems failure in the Harmoni service . Dr Kavalier says Axel's death was the kind of incident he was trying to prevent when he sent the letter to directors. Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, he said: 'It is what happens when services are fragmented and commercial interests become more important than patient care. 'Despite Harmoni's claim they treat patients 'like family' in reality they treat them like rail passengers.' Harmoni have released a statement saying the coroner was clear that she found no evidence of systems failure in the Harmoni service. It said it was not possible to totally eliminate the possibility of an individual's error or misjudgement. Dr David Lee, medical director for Harmoni, said: 'I can confirm that Harmoni responded fully to Dr Kavalier’s concerns and our communication was sent by both email and recorded delivery letter on March 11, 2011. 'We shared his concerns with both the PCT commissioners and the local medical committee (LMC). 'Harmoni refutes absolutely any suggestion that concerns raised by any clinician, patient or commissioner have not been properly and fully investigated. 'The coroner’s comments relating to the tragic death of Axel Peanberg King confirmed that there was no evidence to suggest that Harmoni staffing levels were unsafe. 'The coroner also stated she was satisfied Harmoni has made considerable efforts to ensure the competence of the GPs working in the out of hours service and that Harmoni had plans in place to ensure this process is ongoing including improving paediatric training for all its GPs. 'The coroner was clear that she found no evidence of systems failures in the Harmoni service.' Harmoni was founded by five London GPs in 1996 and was bought last year by Care UK for £48million. Last year it turned over £100m and has won more than a quarter of the contracts for the new 111 non-urgent phone line. It is not the first time private out-of-hours care has been scrutinised. Dr Daniel Ubani was working for an out-of-hours medical service in Cambridgeshire when he mistakenly gave 70-year-old renal patient David Gray ten times the safe dosage of diamorphine. Coroner William Morris ruled the death was ‘gross negligence and manslaughter’ and Ubani was struck off by the GMC in Britain.","Dr Fred Kavalier claims he told doctors in 2010 that he had concerns about care provided by Harmoni .

Police in Sydney have confiscated a haul of methamphetamine worth £297million after they were tipped off by an anonymous source. They are hailing the find, the largest shipment of crystal meth they have ever seized, as a crippling blow to a powerful drugs syndicate, reports CNN. The shipment was intercepted as it came into port from Southern China after a call made five months ago from an anonymous tipster in New South Wales to the state's Asian Crime Squad, police said.

An Australian, a Singaporean and a Hong Kong man have been arrested and more arrests could follow. 'That one phone call was the one thread that allowed us to pull and unravel a syndicate that will be stopped forever,' New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said at a news conference. The drugs were found thanks to the involvement of numerous law enforcement agencies and months of monitoring shipments coming into Sydney. They were found last week hidden in bags of chemicals for cleaning products in a container from the southern Chinese trading hub of Shenzhen, according to police. Three men from Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong were arrested when they tried to recover the drugs . Crystal meth is a growing problem in Australia and police are trying to stamp it out . Stash: The drugs were hidden in a shipment of cleaning chemicals . In total, authorities seized more than half a tonne of methamphetamine, a drug that is growing in popularity throughout Australia. They were replaced with a harmless substance and delivered to a warehouse in Sydney, said Australian Federal Police Commissioner Tony Negus, and police swooped when the three suspects arrived and removed what they thought were the drugs. They have been charged with multiple offenses including attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug. Stake-out: The shipment was detected after months of monitoring shipments coming into Sydney . Officers say the seizure could be a death blow to the drugs gang and more arrests could follow . If convicted they could face life in prison and a fine of £840,000. Officers also found a secret drug manufacturing laboratory during the operation. Officials described the bust as an important victory in the fight against the growing threat of crystal meth, which until recent years was only seen as a problem in North America. 'Make no mistake, this is a hideous, insidious drug,' Scipione said.

Now Facebook can lay bare the secrets of our love lives. Researchers at the social network have been trawling user data to analyse changes from non-coupled relationship statuses, such as 'single' or 'divorced', to coupled statuses, such as 'in a relationship' or 'engaged'. Revealed: Researchers have used two years' worth of relationship status changes to chart how users' love lives change over the course of the year (picture posed by model) By totting up and comparing the number of users posting the opposite change, letting friends know they're newly single, Facebook staff were able to figure out the boom and bust seasons for romance. June came out as worst month for love, with the highest ratio of breakups to new relationships for all three age groups of under 25, 25-44 and 45 and over. Summer in general proved to be a time for broken hearts: the months from May to August showed a higher than average proportion of newly single Facebook users. Peak time: The study confirmed Valentine's Day as the date with the highest proportion of new romance to breakups (posed by models) With such a vast and rich source of data at their disposal, the website's analysts were even able to pinpoint specific days for surges and slumps in breakups and newfound love. The statistics, gathered from U.S. users in 2010 and 2011, show Valentine's Day and Christmas are peak times for new relationships, with relatively few breaking up. Predictably, February 14 lives up to its reputation, with 49 per cent more new relationships than splits. And on Christmas Day, 34 per cent . more users let the world know they had found someone special than those . who broke news of a breakup. Neither . of these peaks is isolated to a single day, with Christmas Eve and . February 15 marking the third and fourth biggest increases in . relationships. The data, of course, comes with the concession that not everyone on Facebook is completely honest about their relationships. Though . many users are incredibly open about their personal lives, and indeed . some live to regret it, nobody is obliged to tell the truth on their . profile. Some long-standing couples may never . think it necessary to broadcast their relationship status, while other . users see it as a chance for a joke or a prank. It's Friday, I'm not in love: The balance of relationship status changes shifts towards breakups as the week wears on. Negative percentages mean more users are becoming single . April Fool's Day is the fifth biggest day for new relationships, registering 20 per cent more new romances than splits. But the fact that the very next day this swings to 11 per cent in the opposite direction means many of the pairings probably were not what they seemed. In terms of days of the week, there was a net gain in relationships after the weekend - Sunday, Monday and Tuesday showed the biggest gains for Cupid. The proportion of breakups increased in the run-up to the weekend, although for users aged under 25 the balance shifted back towards new romance by Saturday. The research was carried out by data scientists Jackson Gorham and Andrew T Fiore. On the trends seen over the course of the week, their report suggests: 'One explanation could be that people looking for a change tend to end their old relationships in time to spend the weekend with friends or get back in the game with someone new. 'Or maybe, as the song goes, breaking up is hard to do, and having a difficult conversation has to wait until the work week winds down. 'As for the net gain in relationships at the start of a new week? That may be a visible echo of the weekend's festivities - and the new social ties that result.'","Analysts find out which day of the week sees the most hearts broken .

Provocative pop diva Lady Gaga may be forced to cancel her Indonesia concert after police refused her a permit following protests by Islamic extremists. The controversial singer who once donned a meat dress to the MTV music awards is due to play in the country's capital Jakarta on June 3 as part of her Born This Way Ball tour. A total of 52,000 tickets have so far been sold for the gig which is the biggest show on the Asian leg of her world tour. Anger: Protests by Islamic extremists on the streets of Indonesia have led to police refusing a permit for Lady Gaga to perform in the capital Jakarta . Gaga's outlandish and often skimpy outfits sparked criticism from both conservative politicians and Islamist extremists. Promoter Michael Rusli had hoped police would still grant the megastar permission to perform, but spokesman Boy Rafli Amar confirmed that the application has been rejected. Indonesia's Muslims are mostly moderate but a hardline fringe has become increasingly vocal with radical groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front and the Muslim Defender Team threatening that 'bad things might happen' if the show goes ahead. Controversial: Lady Gaga is known for her evocative sexy clothing. Left, a photo she posted on her own Twitter account and right in the controversial met outfit at the MTV awards in 2010 .

According to South East Asia Real Time Munarman, who like many Indonesians goes by just one name and is a spokesman for ultra-conservative Islamic Defenders Front, known for its staunch opposition to vice and liberalism, said: 'Lady Gaga insults all religions. Even Christians in Korea opposed her. She is promoting the worship of Satan.' While there have been vocal street protests against Gaga making an appearance on Indonesian soil and voices of dissent from some politicians the Christian Secretary General of the Indonesian Council of Churches  today backed the international pop star. Girl in the mirror: Gaga was seen today smiling as she visited the Tokyo Sky Tree in Tokyo . Standing out from the crowd: Gaga wore a mirrored geometric dress with matching silver heels . As reported in the Jakarta Globe Gomar Gultom said sexy outfits would not lead young people into looking at pornography, rather it was down to religious guidance to ensure they have a 'clear mind and stand against temptation. He added: 'Don’t teach our young generation with pseudo-formality by wearing good outfits but being bad on the inside.' Lady . Gaga's recent concerts in South Korea were limited to fans 18 or older . because conservatives raised objections and Mr Rusli has said the US pop . diva will tone down her concert for Indonesian audiences. Sell-out: Half the the tickets for Lady Gaga's 52,000 seat concert in Indonesia sold out within two hours . On Monday an additional 2,000 tickets were released on sale for the gig at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium after half the tickets were snapped up within the first two hours following the first release.

His injury comes about two months after it was revealed that he was leading a 'triple life' - accused of cheating on his wife with multiple women. Caroline Meanwell, the mother of Louise Neathway - one of Cashman's alleged mistresses - filed an explosive lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court  in January, accusing Cashman of being a 'manchild' who conspired to have his ex-lover committed so the affair would never be revealed.

Development: A local TV station claims the new evidence could have resulted in Casey Anthony's conviction . A bombshell new investigation reveals that a key piece of evidence that could have resulted in the conviction of Casey Anthony for the murder of her two-year-old daughter was missed. On the last day Caylee Anthony was seen alive, someone searched 'foolproof suffocation' on the Anthonys' home computer, police confirm. Somehow, investigators never discovered this before the month-and-a-half-long trial last year. Casey Anthony was acquitted of murder charges in July of last year. WKMG-TV claims the revelation, which was never brought up by prosecutors in the case, is a new development that 'points right to Casey' and 'could have changed the jury's mind.' The 'foolproof suffocation' search was known to Anthony's defense attorney Jose Baez, who admitted that he was waiting for the damning evidence to be brought up during the trial. But Baez told the network that he was 'shocked' when the evidence, which the defense team was planning to pin on Casey's father George Anthony, was never mentioned. The station claims that prosecutors in the case didn't even know about the suspicious search until reporters brought it to their attention last week. According to WKMG's timeline of the day Caylee was last seen, Casey was in her parents' home - as confirmed by cell phone pings - when the search was typed in at 2:51pm (which was misspelled as 'suffication'). Seconds later, the user was pointed to a website with writing that suggested: 'Poison yourself and then follow it up with suffocation' by placing 'a plastic bag over the head.' Acquitted: Casey Anthony reacts as she is found not guilty in the murder of her daughter Caylee. She is flanked by her attorneys, Jose Baez, left, and Dorothy Clay Sims, right . One minute after that, a MySpace account . was accessed. Casey was the only person in the house who used the . social networking site. Sheriff’s Capt Angelo Nieves admitted to WKMG that the investigators may have botched the investigation by not compiling the full browsing history of the day. 'There was an oversight,' Nieves said. Prosecutors argued that Anthony suffocated Caylee with chloroform, then taped her mouth shut. Her partially-decomposed body was found in a garbage bag dumped in a swamp on December 11, 2008 - nearly six months after she was left seen alive by her grandparents. Murdered: Caylee, 2, was last seen on June 16, 2008, the same day that 'foolproof suffocation' was searched on the Anthony family computer . Horrific: Prosecutors believe that Caylee's killer suffocated her with the anesthetic chloroform and then taped her mouth shut . That same day, Casey visited her parents at their home in Orange County, Florida, along with her daughter Caylee. It was the last time the child was seen alive. The next day, Caylee went missing and George and Cindy repeatedly asked Casey what had happened to their granddaughter. Prosecutors tried to convict Casey Anthony using key pieces of information that they claimed proved her guilt in the murder. It was alleged that that Anthony used chloroform to knock out her daughter Caylee. While the girl was unconscious, prosecutors said Anthony put duct tape over Caylee’s mouth, which suffocated the toddler. The word ‘chloroform’ was searched on a computer in the Anthony home 84 times as well as 'neck breaking' and 'household weapons' before the girl's disappearance. In addition, a police K-9 agent testified that his cadaver dog, Gerus, detected human decomposition in the trunk of Anthony’s car. Another agent testified that her dog, Bones, had detected human decomposition in the backyard of the Anthony family home. When she was first questioned by police, Anthony insisted that she had not seen Caylee since she left her in the care of a babysitter, whom she identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, a woman who police could never link to the murder. However, a woman with that name was not involved with Caylee’s disappearance. That woman is now suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she was fired from her job, kicked out of her apartment and subjected to death threats as a result of her questioning. Finally, on July 15, 2008 - 31 days after that visit - Cindy Anthony called police to report that Caylee had vanished. On March 17, 2008 - months before the . toddler's disappearance - chloroform, neck-breaking, head injuries, . ruptured spleen, chest trauma, inhalation and internal bleeding, were . all searched in either Google on Wikipedia on the family computer. The . fragmented search results were recovered from the hard drive, even . though the computer's internet browsing history had been deleted. The . search for 'chloroform,' typed in 84 times before Caylee's . disappearance, became a key piece of the prosecution's case - brought . up during opening statements and several times during the trial. Cindy . Anthony claimed she was the one who had searched for the word, saying . that she thought her dog was being poisoned by eating bamboo leaves from . the garden. She said the . initial search was for 'chlorophyll,' Cindy said she later found herself . searching for information on the toxic chemical. Prosecutors later proved the Cindy was at work when most of the searches took place. Chloroform vapors can knock even healthy adults unconscious when they are inhaled. In large doses, the gas can be fatal. 'There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car,' she told a 911 operator. It is unknown how detectives missed that key piece of evidence. Other searches on the Anthonys' computer had been introduced into evidence. Baez rejected the report as an example of 'the standard anti-Casey spin.' He told the Orlando Sentinel that any revelations coming from the WKMG report are '100 per cent false.' Concerned: George and Cindy Anthony last saw their granddaughter on June 16, 2008 - the day she came to visit with Casey . Tragedy: Caylee's body was found in December 2008 - about six months after she was last seen. Her mother Casey was the prime suspect in her death .","Evidence was never brought up at trial because prosecutors did not know about it .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 21:42 EST, 4 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:30 EST, 5 March 2013 . Thailand has vowed for the first time to take steps towards putting an end to the country's ivory trade, as wildlife groups warned the slaughter of elephants will continue until a ban is imposed. The country's domestic ivory trade is currently legal, but activists say smuggled African tusks are mixed in with native stocks, and that skyrocketing demand in Thailand is helping to fuel the worst poaching crisis in sub-Saharan Africa in 20 years. Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra has pledged to tighten controls on the country's local tusk trade and to 'work towards' putting an end to the trade altogether, but failed to give a timeline for implementing a ban. Trade: A Thai woman examines two elephant tusks on display in the window of a Bangkok jewellery shop . Ms Yingluck made the pledge during the opening meeting of the 178-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Bangkok this week. She said her government would tighten controls on Thailand's local tusk trade by systematically registering domestic elephants and ivory products. Then, 'as a next step, we will work towards amending the national legislation with the goal of putting an end to (the) ivory trade and to be in line with international norms', she said. But there was no timeline and Theerapat Prayurasiddhi, deputy director of Thailand's department of parks and wildlife, said there were no immediate plans for a domestic ban. He said that could happen 'step by step in the future - maybe', but called it 'the long-term goal'. For now, the government will focus on boosting measures to tighten domestic trade controls and slow the flow of African ivory from entering Thai markets. Thai traders currently have the right to buy or sell ivory obtained legally from domesticated stocks, and Mr Theerapat said taking those rights away could be tantamount to the struggle to ban assault weapons in the United States. 'You cannot change everything overnight,' he said. 'It's going to take time.' Warning: Conservationists say Thailand's thriving ivory trade is helping to fuel illegal poaching in other countries including Africa . Asked how Thailand's legislation might be amended, he said there was a push to add African elephants to Thailand's own lists of protected species, a move that would allow authorities to impose higher fines and harsher jail terms on smugglers. Carlos Drews, head of the World Wildlife Fund's delegation to Cites, welcomed Ms Yingluck's pledge but said 'the fight to stop wildlife crime and shut down Thailand's ivory markets is not over'. 'The fight to stop wildlife crime and shut down Thailand's ivory markets is not over' Carlos Drews, World Wildlife Fund . Ms Yingluck 'now needs to provide a timeline for this ban and ensure that it takes place as a matter of urgency, because the slaughter of elephants continues', he said. Around 70 years ago, up to five million elephants are believed to have roamed sub-Saharan Africa. Today, just several hundred thousand are left. Last year, 32,000 elephants were killed on the continent, according to the Born Free Foundation, which says black-market ivory sells for around £865 per pound; much of it ends up as tourist trinkets. Thailand is one of the world's top destinations for smuggled ivory - second only to China, according to the wildlife monitoring network TRAFFIC. The group has called for Cites members to impose economic trade sanctions against Thailand, along with Nigeria and Congo, which would halt those nations' ability to trade in all 35,000 species regulated by the convention. Cites banned the international ivory trade in 1989. But the move never addressed domestic markets like Thailand's, where trading remains legal as long as only ivory from domesticated elephants is involved. Animals such as rhinos, tigers and orangutans will not be left in the wild in 30 years' time, more than half of Britons believe. The poll finding comes as the Government launches a new 'If They're Gone' campaign to highlight the threats to some of the world's highest-profile endangered species - rhinos, elephants, tigers and orangutans - and the action people can take to help them. Launching the campaign, involving more than 20 wildlife groups, zoos and safari parks, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he did not want future generations to think of the four species in the same way he thought of the dodo. Under threat: More than half of Britons believe there will be no rhinos left in the wild in 30 years time . The survey of more than 1,700 people for the campaign found that 54% did not think those animals will be left in the wild in 30 years' time. The concern over the fate of species such as rhinos is mirrored by the experts, with Tusk Trust's chief executive Charlie Mayhew warning that this year one rhino has been lost to poachers every 11 hours, on average. He said: 'If this poaching continues to escalate, a species which has existed on this planet for 40 million years faces the very real prospect of extinction in our lifetime. 'We cannot be the generation that allows this to happen and Tusk is working hard to preserve all endangered species.' The Government's campaign comes as countries meet in Thailand for the latest meeting of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), where efforts to protect species such as rhinos, elephants and sharks are on the agenda. The Duke of Cambridge, royal patron of the Tusk Trust, has urged the conference to do more to protect rhinos and elephants from illegal killing for their ivory and horn, which has become extremely valuable for use in traditional Asian medicine. 'We cannot be the generation that allows this to happen' Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust chief executive . The UK Government is calling for countries attending the meeting to maintain the ban on ivory sales and to protect rhinos by bringing in stricter controls on the export and re-export of rhino horn. The campaign, launched today, also outlines how the public can help protect endangered species, urging them to think before they buy anything that could be made from or contain body parts of endangered species, ask where products have come from and get involved with wildlife conservation projects. Launching the campaign at the Cotswold Wildlife Park, Mr Paterson said: 'If They're Gone aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to take action to protect four of the planet's most iconic species, rhinos, elephants, orangutans and tigers, from extinction. 'It's by working together that we show international leadership in the fight against the disastrous trade in wildlife and the devastating impact of deforestation.' He added: 'There are no medicinal benefits to traditional Asian medicines that contain animal parts and by turning your back on them you can help to protect these iconic animals.' Meanwhile, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has gathered 40,000 signatures for a petition calling on Cites to implement a full ban on any trade in ivory to stop the poaching of African elephants. A recent report by conservation charity WWF warned that trafficking of wildlife products, from rhino horn to illegal timber, is one of the world's biggest trades, worth £12 billion a year, and is driving species towards extinction, funding war and damaging communities.","Thai prime minister says country will 'work towards' imposing a ban .

World's top civilian cyber defender: Chris Doman, 26, from Essex finished second overall in the 2012 Digital Forensics Challenge . A British software developer has been named the world's top civilian computer security expert in a competition run by the U.S military. Chris Doman, 26, from Essex finished as the highest-ranked civilian and second overall in the 2012 Digital Forensics Challenge, held by the U.S. Department of Defense Cyber Crime Centre. He beat competition from almost 2,000 cyber defenders from 53 countries, losing out only to a professional team from multibillion pound U.S. aerospace and defence firm Northrop Grumman. The final standings provided further . good news for the health of the country’s home-grown cyber talent pool . as the UK contributed more participants than almost any other country. Two more British amateurs, Matt Bartlet and Chris Moore, finished in the top 12. The DC3 Digital Forensics Challenge is . a global competition designed and hosted by the US Department of . Defense Cyber Crime Center. Considered one of the toughest . forensic competitions in the world, it takes the form of scenario-based . exercises replicating the complexity digital forensics examiners face . extracting and scrutinising data to solve cybercrime. Areas covered include file signatures, hashing metadata, data hiding, communication recovery, and information concealment. Chris Doman is a computer science . graduate, a former web developer, and the co-founder of Ignite Research, . a start-up he set up in 2009 with a school friend to tackle various . projects using their software expertise. Ignite’s latest project, Hotelsweep, represents the world’s largest collection of hotel data collected into a single system. Despite . his obvious talents with information technology, success in the DC3 . competition came as a surprise and has prompted him to start applying . for his first job in cyber security. Mr Doman's success has made him eligible to take part in the Cyber Security Challenge UK: Here a team tackle the challenge in an event this year . The man who hacked email accounts belonging to a swath of A-list celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Christina Aguilera has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Christopher Chaney, 36, pleaded guilty to nine felony counts earlier this year - including identity theft, wiretapping, and unauthorized access - after he leaked several nude and revealing photos of the women online. During the sentencing, Chaney was also ordered to pay $76,000 in restitution to Johansson, Aguilera and Renee Olstead. Chaney, of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested last October as part of a year-long investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi.' He was hunted down by federal agents using a battering ram to his run-down brick home home which he had once shared with his late grandmother. The depth of his hacking - which kept the unemployed Chaney glued to his computer screen for days at a time - enabled him to witness exchanges between celebrities, their family members and their doctors. In all he was accused of illegally accessing the private information of around 50 stars with virtually no technical computer training. 'It’s . a year-long competition but I only decided to enter a month before it . closed so time was a bit of an issue,' Mr Doman said. 'I looked through all 34 challenges and wrote a plan of how to do them all and how long it would take. 'It’s . all certainly possible to solve but it’s not easy and you have to think . carefully about the time required for each challenge. 'Security has always been an interest. At school I would publish computer security and operating system design . tutorials. However setting up my own company left me with less time to . pursue this interest. 'The . Cyber Security Challenge has certainly reignited my love for cyber . security and problem solving. I did better than I expected, and it’s . given me a boost to start applying for work in this field.' Jim Christy, Director of Futures Exploration at the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center said:  'This year’s DC3 Digital Forensics Challenge saw the highest ever number of players and submissions, and a significant increase in the standard of the competition. 'All this makes Chris’s achievement - finishing second as an individual, and beating teams of professionals from some of the largest companies in the world and government’s cyber workforces - all the more remarkable.' Mr Doman's success in the DC3 competition has also booked him a place to take part in the next competition run by Cyber Security Challenge UK, the Sophos Malware Hunt in January. There 30 talented amateurs from various virtual first stage Challenge competitions will take on the role of forensics and defence specialists working for the UK Government facing attack from both both cyber criminal gangs and hostile nations. He will be joined at the Malware Hunt by his fellow top ranked UK candidates from the DC3 competition, IT professional Matt Bartlett, who finished ninth and Chris Moore, a fourth-year student at Durham University, who finished 12th, the highest ranked undergraduate in the world. Next step: Thirty talented amateurs from various virtual first stage Challenge competitions will take on the role of forensics and defence specialists working for the UK Government . Stephanie Daman, CEO of Cyber Security Challenge UK, said: 'Chris’s success in this global competition and the performance of UK competitors more generally is a powerful demonstration of the level of amateur talent we have here in the UK. 'Unfortunately for a profession like cyber security where employers are desperate to find new talent, Chris’s story of an early interest in the subject that wasn’t pursued in later life is worryingly familiar. 'Without the opportunities provided by the competitions like the DC3 Digital Forensics and the Cyber Security Challenge UK, Chris and many others like him will be lost to the profession completely despite their undoubted ability.'","Chris Doman from Essex lost out only to a professionals team from U.S. defence giant Northrop Grumman .

Innocent: Rachel Ehmke, 13, killed herself after a group of girls scrawled 'slut' across her locker and sent her texts telling her to leave the school . Bullied: Rachel Ehmke, 13, is believed to have sent an anonymous text branding herself a 'slut' before her suicide as a way to get kicked out of school . A 13-year-old girl who hanged herself days after a text message branding her a 'slut' was sent to girls at her school may possibly have composed the message herself, it has emerged. Rachel Ehmke's father believes she sent the message as a way to be kicked out of middle school, where she had suffered months of bullying at the hands of a clique of girls. A group of 'mean girls' had scrawled 'slut' across her locker and put chewing gum in her books. They also cornered Rachel in the locker room, where she had taken to eating lunch to avoid them. Officers in Kasson, Minnesota have been . investigating the suicide of seventh grader. The Dodge County Sheriff's Office has now announced it believes she hanged herself due to 'harassment and bullying' at school - but no charges will be charged against those responsible. 'There is not one incident or action done by any particular student(s) that we believe is responsible for Rachel's death,' the Dodge County Sheriff's Office reported in a news release. 'Because of this, the County Attorney's Office had determined that there is insufficient evidence to file charges against anyone regarding this case. 'However, the students responsible for harassing these students who were singled out will now risk being charged if their conduct continues.' Tragic: Rachel was found hanging in her bedroom with a note saying 'I wish I could tell you how I really feel' Tormented: Although police determined she died after bullying, they are not going to file any charges . The investigation also revealed that the threatening text message forwarded to girls at the school was sent from Rachel's father's home through an iPod messaging service that uses the internet. The sheriff's office said it was difficult to say why Rachel might have sent the text, but conversations before her death indicated she was unhappy with how her concerns were being dealt with. She had told her family she wanted to move schools after the bullying had not stopped months after it began, and officers found a note in her locker indicating she was thinking of leaving the school. Her father Rick told KTTC-TV he thinks Rachel sent the message in order to get removed from the school to avoid further bullying. He added that he was surprised when . authorities decided not to charge any of the children who allegedly . tormented her. He said the school did not take her complaints seriously. 'There were no kids taken out of sports . because of it, no kids made to say they are sorry,' he said. 'There were . no kids that had to clean up the mess to her locker or return the stuff . they stole.' Grief: Rachel's parents Rick and Mary. Rick said the school did not do enough to punish the girls responsible . But he said he does not want to see anyone punished - but to realise what bullying does to people. 'Those words,' he said, 'Not everybody can handle those words and it killed her. I will go to my grave knowing that's what did it.' He added that he did not want the four students who reported the text to be blamed for her suicide, as is believed to have happened. The sheriff's office said Rachel said she got along with these girls. Rachel was found hanging in her mother's home with a note nearby which read: 'I'm . fine = I wish I could tell you how I really feel.' Also scrawled on the . note was a drawing of a broken heart. She had told her brother Jonathan she had . homework to do, so he dropped her off at her mother's house while she was in Las Vegas. Jonathan . then called his father to ask him to collect Rachel and Rick arrived at . the house around 25 minutes at her big brother had left. Investigation: The parents do not blame the school but wish the bullies had faced greater consequences . Findings: The Dodge Sheriff's County Office said no one incident led to her death so could not file charges . When he walked up to the door, he saw Rachel hanging by a noose from a beam of the ceiling inside through the window. He broke into the home by smashing . the door with a baseball bat and got his daughter down, before calling . 911. She was still alive but had sustained damage to her brain, heart . and lungs and later died. Rick said he spoke with his . daughter the evening before she killed herself and she begged him not to . get involved after the text messages calling her a slut had been sent out. He added . that he was stunned to learn six weeks after Rachel's locker was . defaced that it had not been cleaned. He said that changed only after he . sent an email to the middle school principal. 'She . tried to deal with it. We thought she was dealing with it and the . school thought she was dealing with it,' Rick Ehmke told KARE TV.

An ambitious British project to drill two miles under the Antarctic ice to look for signs of life has been abandoned. Researchers said they were unable to create a large underwater cavity needed to circulate water to the team's drill. It follows a last minute dash to send a spare part for the drill from Britain - which had allowed them to restart drilling. The team's test drill hole. They now face a race against time to drill 2 miles into the ice to try and reach a frozen lake where they will look for signs of microbial life . The team's 12 scientists have been working around the clock to try and save the mission . The malfunction could mean that the project, which took 16 years to plan, would have to be abandoned . The first borehole was drilled to a depth of 300m and then left at that . depth for 12 hours to create a cavity. The second, main borehole . (located 2m away from the first) was then drilled to 300m depth and . should have immediately connected with the first cavity. This main borehole . would then continue through the cavity and down to the lake while the . first borehole would be used to recirculate water back to the surface . using a submersible pump. In this way, the ice cavity can be used to . balance the level of water in the boreholes and hence balance the . pressure from the lake upon breakthrough. For reasons that are yet to be determined the team could not establish a . link between the two boreholes at 300m depth, despite trying for over . 20 hours. During this process, hot water seeped into the porous surface . layers of ice and was lost. The team attempted to replenish this water . loss by digging and melting more snow, but their efforts could not . compensate. The additional time taken to attempt to establish the . cavity link significantly depleted the fuel stocks to such a level as to . render the remaining operation unviable. Reluctantly the team had no . option but to discontinue the programme for this season. 'In the early hours of Christmas Day . Professor Martin Siegert, Principal Investigator of the Subglacial Lake . Ellsworth experiment, confirmed that the mission to drill into the lake . has been called off for this Antarctic season,' The British Antarctic Survey said. Drilling was proceeding . well during the weekend after a replacement part was fitted to the . boiler used to heat water for drilling. However, Drilling stopped after the team was unable to form properly the . water-filled cavity 300 metres beneath the ice. This cavity was to link . the main borehole with a secondary borehole used to recirculate . drilling water back to the surface. 'On Christmas Eve we took the decision to cease our efforts to directly . measure and sample Subglacial Lake Ellsworth,' said Professor Siegert. 'Although circumstances . have not worked out as we would have wished, I am confident that through . the huge efforts of the field team, and our colleagues in the UK, we . have done as much as we possibly could have done, and I sincerely thank . them all. 'I am also hugely grateful to the UK Natural Environment . Research Council for making it possible for us to attempt the direct . exploration of subglacial Antarctica. 'Sixteen years ago, we hypothesised . that deep-water subglacial lakes are viable habitats for life, and . contain important records of ice and climate history. For now, these . hypotheses remain untested. Once back in the UK I will gather our . consortium to seek ways in which our research efforts may continue. I . remain confident that we will unlock the secrets of Lake Ellsworth in . coming seasons.' The project was also hit by mechanical problems. The drill is powered by . hot water, but was halted when the resister inside a boiler burned out. A spare was sent from Britain via Chile to the remote camp in West Antarctica. Twelve . scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have worked around the . clock over the past fortnight to bore 10,000ft down to ice-locked Lake . Ellsworth to collect samples of water and sediment. Aerial view of the site, where the the 12 scientists, from the British Antarctic Survey, are now in a race against time to complete the mission . Drill testing at the base, where staff now face a race against time . The 12 scientists, from the British Antarctic Survey, are now in a race against time to complete the mission before the borehole reseals as they only have enough fuel for one attempt . They . hope to find unique microbial life forms there which have been isolated . for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer. However, the team has vowed to return. This is of course, hugely frustrating for us, but we have learned a lot . this year,' said Professor Siegert. 'By the end the equipment was working well, and much of it . has now been fully field tested. 'A full report on the field season will . be compiled when the engineers and programme manager return to UK. The . BAS team have been trying to melt their way down to Ellsworth using a 2 . mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water . heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch.

The cavity is what controls the . pressure of the liquid being drawn from Ellsworth, stopping a geyser of . prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and . spilling out over the surface of the ice.

Police officers were left with nothing but a picture when a rape suspect posing for his mugshot bolted through an open door and escaped, a court heard. Craig Goldstone, 28, had been arrested on suspicion of dragging a drunken schoolgirl into bushes and attacking her. He was taken into custody where he was placed in front of a camera for his official booking photo. But seconds after the snap was taken he ran out an open door and fled the police station - leaving police with just his photo. The suspected rapist was on the run from Plymouth's Charles Cross police station for several hours before officers managed to hunt him down, a court heard. Details of the escape on July 5 emerged at Plymouth Crown Court where Goldstone denies rape. Prosecutor Lee Bremridge said: 'What happened next was extraordinary. As he was waiting at the police station for his photograph to be taken, he bolted. 'He ran off from the police station through an open door and ran into the centre of Plymouth. A police manhunt was started and in fact he was found later that night.' The court head Goldstone was out walking his dog in a park when he noticed the victim drinking with a friend. After allegedly waiting for the friend to leave, Goldstone pounced on the girl who had drunk so much cider she was sick and could not stand, it was said.

Genetically modified salmon could soon be found on supermarket fish counters after the U.S. food safety watchdog ruled it posed no environmental risks, it emerged today. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it could find no valid scientific reasons to ban production of Atlantic salmon engineered with extra genes from two other fish species. If it is now given final approval, the fish will be the first GM animal to hit supermarket shelves anywhere in the world - and in the U.S. they may not even be labelled as modified. Growth spurt: The overwhelming size comparison of a genetically modified AquAdvantage Salmon, compared to a non-transgenic Atlantic salmon sibling in the foreground of the same age, are seen . The FDA has already indicated the . AquAdvantage salmon was safe for human consumption, but published a . draft ruling on Friday declaring it unlikely to damage the environment. Their two extra genes make the fish grow . twice as fast as normal Atlantic salmon and supporters say it could . make land-based fish farms much easier and cheaper to run. But opponents of the 'Frankenfish' technology warn it could escape and interbreed with wild fish, . undermining the genetics of the already-endangered Atlantic salmon - . known as the 'king of fishes'. They also argue that commercial . production of the salmon could be beginning of concerted efforts to . concoct other GM animals for human consumption, raising concerns about . animal welfare and human health. There are now few hurdles remaining . before the GM fish can be lawfully produced and sold in shops in the . U.S., which could put pressure on the UK and Europe to follow suit. Several government and EU bodies would . have to review the technology before it could be approved in the UK, . but sucessive government chief scientists have already backed GM as a . concept for increasing food production. So far, it is only consumer opposition . that has blocked the approval of GM foods in the UK, although some . products on supermarket shelves already contain GM ingredients and they . are regularly found in animal feed. Restrictions: Some of the fish eggs are seen which are born all female and sterile, though AquaBounty says a small percentage may still be able to breed . AquAdvantage salmon are all female, . possess three chromosomes instead of the usual two, and grow to market . size in 16 to 18 months instead of the usual 30 required for Atlantic . salmon. AquaBounty Technologies, the company . behind the fish, claim the risk of interbreeding with wild salmon is low . because their fish are all sterile and grown in secure containers on . land-based fish farms. The FDA's draft assessment, part of a . New Animal Drug Application (NADA), agrees with the company, ruling that . the possibility of the GM salmon escaping into rivers and the sea is . 'extremely unlikely', The Independent reported. The document concludes that the fish . 'will not have any significant impacts on the quality of the human . environment of the United States (including populations of endangered Atlantic salmon) when produced and grown under the conditions of use for the proposed action.' But anti-GM groups have raised . concerns about the report. Peter Riley of pressure group GM Freeze told . The Independent: 'The sterility system does not guarantee that there . will be no escapes into the wild and some of them will be fully fertile. 'It's also debatable whether anyone wants to buy GM salmon, even in the U.S., it it is properly labelled.' The FDA will take comments from the . public for 60 days before making the report final. The agency said more . than two years ago that the fish appears to be safe to eat, but the . agency had taken no public action since then. Executives for Massachusetts-based . Aquabounty speculated that the government was delaying action on their . application due to opposition from groups against genetically modified . food animals. Method: The AquaAdvantage salmon, seen growing in their facility's tanks, has an added growth hormone from the Pacific Chinook salmon that allows the fish to produce growth hormone all year long . Experts view the release of the environmental report as the final step before approval. AquaBounty has maintained that the . fish is safe and that there are several safeguards against environmental . problems. The fish would be bred female and sterile, though a very . small percentage might still be able to breed. The AquaAdvantage salmon has an added . growth hormone from the Pacific Chinook salmon that allows the fish to . produce growth hormone all year long. The engineers were able to keep the . hormone active by using another gene from an eel-like fish called an . ocean pout that acts like an 'on' switch for the hormone. This means AquAdvantage salmon grow to market size in 16 to 18 months instead of the usual 30 required for Atlantic salmon, which produce the growth hormone for only part of the year. It is still unclear whether the public . will have an appetite for the fish if it is approved, however it may . not matter since consumers may not even know if they are eating them. According to U.S. guidelines, the fish . need not be labelled as genetically modified if the agency decides it . has the same material make-up as conventional salmon. AquaBounty says that genetically . modified salmon have the same flavour, texture, colour and odour as the . conventional fish, and the FDA so far has not shown any signs of . disagreeing. No change: AquaBounty says that genetically modified salmon have the same flavor, texture, color and odor as the conventional fish, and the FDA so far has not shown any signs of disagreeing . Wenonah Hauter, director of the . advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said forgoing labelling not only . ignores consumers' rights to know what they are eating, but 'is simply . bad for business, as many will avoid purchasing any salmon for fear it . is genetically engineered.' She urged members of Congress to block . the impending approval of the fish. Congressional opposition to the . engineered fish has so far been led by members of the Alaska delegation, . who see the modified salmon as a threat to the state's wild salmon . industry. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, for . Alaska, said on Friday she is working to convince fellow senators that . approval for the fish should be stopped. 'This is especially troubling as the . agency is ignoring the opposition by salmon and fishing groups, as well . as more than 300 environmental, consumer and health organisations,' she . said of the preliminary approval.","AquAdvantage salmon would be the first genetically altered animal approved for human consumption anywhere in the world .

'I was absolutely gutted and searched the back yard for weeks but I eventually gave up thinking the ring had gone forever.

David Cameron is being urged to undergo anti-sexism training to help boost the number of women in Government. Tory MP Therese Coffey revealed she is encouraging the Prime Minister to undergo so-called ‘unconscious bias’ training in a bid to help make both the Government and the Conservative Party more diverse. Mr Cameron has been accused of displaying schoolboy sexism towards female MPs in the Commons – once telling shadow Treasury chief secretary Angela Eagle to ‘calm down dear’, and, on another occasion, joking that maverick Tory Nadine Dorries was ‘extremely frustrated’. David Cameron was criticised after telling Labour MP Angela Eagle to 'calm down dear' during Prime Minister's Questions in April 2011 . He has also made little progress towards meeting his pledge of ensuring that one-third of his ministers are women by the end of the Parliament. Unconscious bias training is increasingly used by major corporations to help executives overcome the innate prejudices that mean they often overlook promising women and candidates from ethnic minority backgrounds. Miss Coffey, Parliamentary aide to the Business Minister Michael Fallon, said the issue had been discussed by the Conservative Women’s Forum as a way of helping talented women get on in the party. She said she would be presenting Mr Cameron with a report on unconscious bias later this month and urging him to introduce training to tackle it throughout the Conservative Party. Tory MP Therese Coffey said the Tories needed to tackle complaints that middle class white men are more likely to get a safe seat . Miss Coffey said it could help tackle complaints that middle class white men are more likely to get a safe seat, and more likely to get a job in Government. ‘I think it would be useful for the Conservative Party to select our candidates,’ she said. ‘I think the Prime Minister would be open to it. He went out of his way in our candidate selection process to put into place certain things. ‘From my perspective that would be about finding the best process to make sure that people of all talents get to the top. ‘A lot of people dismiss unconscious bias training as mumbo jumbo but more and more companies in the FTSE 100 are starting to use it. ‘It’s designed to tackle the innate prejudices in all of us that mean people often recruit people like themselves and help explain why here are many more white men at the top of our companies.’ Asked whether Mr Cameron should undergo the training himself, Miss Coffey replied: ‘I don’t see why not.’ Recent polls suggest David Cameron has lost his appeal to women voters following a series of measures perceived as anti-women. He has presided over a highly controversial cut to child benefit for better-off families, the impact of which will be felt directly by women. Flagship plans to reform childcare provision and funding have become mired in Whitehall infighting. Unconscious bias training has become commonplace in the corporate world and is spreading to this country. Accountancy giant PwC recently made the training compulsory for all staff as part of a drive to improve diversity at the top. Executives are taught to try to analyse their innate prejudices and set them aside.","Conservative backbencher Therese Coffey says Prime Minister needs 'unconscious bias' training .

A portrait of Cherie Blair had to be corrected after the artist accidentally painted her eyes the wrong colour. The painting, which forms part of Adam Birtwistle's retrospective at Kings Place, London, went through the emergency correction after Mrs Blair spotted the mistake. Mr Birtwistle sent Mrs Blair a photo of the finished work after she sat for the portrait in 2011, but she sent a note back asking 'what colour are my eyes?' Guess who: This portrait of Cherie Blair needed to undergo an emergency correction after artist Adam Birtwistle got the colour of her eyes wrong . To his shock, the artist realised he had painted her dark brown eyes a shade of deep blue, the London Evening Standard has reported. He had to jump on a train to London to make the correction after the error had been spotted, which the artist said took all of five seconds to fix. Mr Birtwistle said: 'As always with people like that, they don’t have much time. 'She was sitting for me for less than an hour and most of it she had her . head in her iPad. 'I had to keep telling her to sit up and look . natural.' And in real life: Mrs Blair, pictured giving a speech with noticeably brown eyes, was uninterested in buying the artwork even after the correction had been made . Mr Birtwistle, son of composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle, is an acclaimed artist whose former subjects include David Hockney and Elvis Costello. Even with the change made however the artist still could not get Mrs Blair to buy the painting. Mr Birtwistle said: 'She had it hanging up in her house for two weeks, after which my gallerist messaged her to see if she’d be keen on buying it.' Acclaimed artist Adam Birtwistle, whose former subjects include David Hockney and Elvis Costello, painted the portrait of Cherie Blair in 2011 . But Mrs Blair is reported as saying: 'No thank you. Interesting painting but I’m not in the mood for buying art.' It is not the first time Mrs Blair has posed for a portrait. She . was painted in nude by her friend Euan Uglow when she was only 22. It . was most recently shown at the Browse & Darby gallery in Mayfair, . with a price tag of £600,000. At . the time it was rumoured that she and her husband bought a sketch that . was being exhibited alongside the painting, and which cost £4,000. Since Mr Blair stepped down as Prime Minster, Mrs Blair has used the . prominence she gained as his wife to raise both funds and awareness for a . wide range of charities at home and overseas. Among . others, she is patron of Breast Cancer Care, Refuge, Scope and the .

He is suffering from skin cancer related to his time spent in the tropics . Canoe conman John Darwin has been treated for skin cancer which he believes may have been caused by the tropical sun while he was on the run in Panama, it emerged today. Darwin spent some two years in the Latin American country after he faked his own death by apparently disappearing in a canoe in the North Sea. The father of two has undergone surgery to help overcome the illness, but doctors have warned him the condition is likely to reoccur, reports say. They have told the convicted fraudster, 62, who was jailed for a million pound life insurance scam, that his cancer was caused by 'high ultra-violet sunlight', according to the Sunday Mirror. Darwin, who now lives in Hartlepool, told the Sunday Mirror: 'I do have skin cancer. I've had an operation. Did I get it in Panama? Well I've been told it was caused by intense sunlight.' The former prison officer and teacher in 2002 conspired with his wife Anne to fake his own death and claim almost £1million in life insurance. A death certificate was issued after the empty wreck of a canoe was found in which he had been seen paddling into the North Sea near the family home in Seaton Carew, County Durham. The couple's grown up sons, Mark, 36, and Anthony, 32, were left heartbroken. They were unaware their father was alive and living in a bedsit next door to Anne, 61, which could be accessed through a wardrobe. Under the assumed identity John Jones, taken from a local child who died in infancy, Darwin travelled around the world planning a new life for himself and his wife. The home in Seaton Carew where Darwin lived with . his wife: Darwin, who turned up five years after he was feared drowned, . was jailed for six years and three months after failing to convince . police he had amnesia . The couple bought a flat and land in Panama, where temperatures average 27C, and hoped to open a hotel and canoeing centre focusing on eco-tourism. But in 2007 he returned from the country and walked into West End Central police station in London, claiming to have no memory of the past five years. His lies were quickly uncovered after pictures were found on the internet of him and Anne posing for a photograph in the office of an estate agency in Panama City. Hoodwinked: Darwin's sons, Anthony, right, and Mark leave Teeside Crown court after their parents Anne and John were sentenced to over six years in prison each on July 23, 2008. They were not in on the scam . The fraud saw Darwin jailed for six years and three months and Anne for six years and six months. They were forced to sell everything they owned to repay the insurance companies and pension funds they had defrauded. Now Darwin's attempt to start a new life in the sun has apparently had another unintended consequence with his diagnosis of and treatment for skin cancer. An unnamed source told the Sunday Mirror that doctors had told Darwin that his cancer is linked to the time he spent in the tropics and the failed-fraudster is convinced it is down the time he spent in Panama. 'He went to Panama to escape justice but he couldn't get away from the sun,' the source said.","Father of two has had surgery, but doctors warn it is likely to return .

John Smith's Extra Smooth is to be watered down from 3.8 per cent alcohol to 3.6 per cent next month . The brewer of one of Britain's best known beers is watering down its famous drink in a move which could see it make savings of £6.6million in duty annually. John Smith's Extra Smooth is to be reduced from 3.8 per cent alcohol to 3.6 per cent, but its manufacturers say research suggests the reduction does not compromise on the taste. Dutch brewer Heineken, which owns the John Smith's brand, is to bring the reduction into effect next month, along with a price increase of about 2.5p a pint. It has said the 'no nonsense beer' will be brought more in line with the smooth ales of competitors which are already at or below the 3.6 per cent mark. With UK beer duty rising at two per cent above inflation annually, since the introduction of the beer escalator introduced in 2008, beers with weaker alcohol content pay a lower rate of duty than higher strength rivals, The Financial Times has reported. A Heineken UK spokesman said the savings would be invested into the brewing and marketing of the beer. The spokesman said: 'Extensive research conducted with retailers and consumers consistently confirmed that a 0.2 per cent reduction in [alcohol content] does not compromise on the taste and quality.' Heineken has blamed the increase on the rising cost of energy and ingredients, along with the higher beer duty. Meanwhile, members of a working men's club in Grimethorpe, a mining village 25 miles from John Smith's brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorshire, have warned the move to raise the price and weaken the beer has not gone down well. Club secretary Philip Evans said: 'We are going to sit the rep down and tell him it either goes down or it goes out.' The Treasury raises £9.2bn annually from the production and sale of beer, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. The association has said while British drinkers were developing a liking for ales at a weaker strength, it did not expect many brewers to alter the alcohol percentage of its products as they had to be sure it wouldn't affect the flavour.

Traditional flannel bed sheets which kept millions of people on the home front warm during the Second World War are back in fashion as heating bills soar. Demand for bed linen made from the cosy, naturally warm fabric is rising rapidly because gas and electricity bills are now so expensive. Sales figures show flannel sheets are now out-selling many silk varieties, according to department store Debenhams. Traditional flannel bed sheets are back in fashion after more than half a century as heating bills soar, department store Debenhams has said . Ed Watson, a spokesman for the store, said: 'Customers are snuggling up to a piece of British history once again.' He said the surge in sales is the first time flannel sheets have been in vogue in Britain for more than half a century. Mr Watson said: 'The natural texture of flannel sheets holds tiny pockets of air between bed and sleeper - the ideal design to trap heat, regardless of the freezing weather outside. 'For decades they had been the bed linen of choice in homes where central heating was unheard of, and the only heat came from a single fire in the kitchen. The increase in demand for sheets made of the naturally warm fabric is believed to be due to soaring gas and electricity bills . 'However, the introduction of new, man-made materials following post war shortages of natural products saw flannel sheets sales begin to decline in the 1960s and early 70s.' Mr Watson said nylon became popular with new households, where working mothers no longer had time to iron, because of its crease-proof qualities. And cotton sheets became popular in the 1980s as worldwide production made even the finest weaves affordable for the first time. He said: 'The increasing popularity of central heating spurred demand still further as customers opted for bed linen with a cooler feel. 'Silk sheets whose vivid colours made the message from the bedroom abundantly clear first became all the rage in the 1990s, reflecting the reign of the ‘Medallion Man’ as well the tastes of popular footballers and their wives.' Experts believe the current surge in demand for flannel has been created by soaring gas and electricity bills. Mr Watson said: 'Customers have discovered that buying cosy, traditional flannel bed linen is much, much cheaper than leaving their central heating on in the bedroom all night. 'They tell us that there’s a wonderful sense of comfort when slipping between flannel sheets, a feeling of being snugly wrapped and looked after which doesn’t come from any other material. 'They’re the ideal answer to tough times.'","Bed sheets made of the naturally warm fabric is back in fashion as bills rise .

I started to cry and everyone was crying and saying ‘why did they kill the little girl?’ Crying: The grandmother of British schoolgirl Imani Green, who was killed on Friday in Jamaica, said she found her granddaughter's body.

The girl's cousin Brandese Brown, a witness to the incident, told ITN: 'I could see the shot coming out of the gun, just a spear of fire.' She said that the gunman had been wearing a hood at the time. Eight suspects have been 'intensively interrogated' by police over her murder. The island's authorities have said they are confident of solving the killing. One line of inquiry is that Imani was the innocent victim of gangsters fighting a turf war over an illegal lottery scam, according to Jamaica's Security Minister Peter Bunting. The scam, which targets elderly . Americans in the hope that they will wire money to Jamaica after being . told they have won the lottery, is thought to have earned Jamaican gangs . £50 million (£31.8m) last year.

At the age of just 28, Carly Perkins is facing the fact she has a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer as she is a carrier of the deadly BRCA1 gene. Now Carly, from Crawley, has taken the brave decision to have a double mastectomy this month to reduce her chances of one day developing the disease. The young mother told the MailOnline her decision to have surgery was a 'no brainer' but her ordeal has been helped thanks to Michelle Heaton going through the same procedure. Cancer risk: Carly Perkins, pictured with her daughter Tilly, is a carrier of the deadly BRCA1 gene . She said: 'Michelle Heaton has been a role model for me to look up to. There's not much support for people my age going through this but she has brought it into the public eye. As she has been so open about what she's been through, it has made me feel like I can be more open too. 'Before some of my friends didn't understand why I was having my breasts removed when I don't actually have cancer. Now it's easier to say, 'I have what Michelle Heaton has,' and they understand. Michelle, 33, had a double mastectomy last year after discovering she was a carrier of the  BRCA2 gene. The gene means carriers have an 85 per cent chance of getting breast cancer and a 60 . per cent chance of contracting ovarian cancer in her lifetime. She said at the time she was under-going the operation for the sake of her daughter, Faith, 14 months. Putting the condition in the public eye: Carly said it has helped her seeing another young mother, singer Michelle Heaton, pictured with daughter Faith, going through the same thing . 'As a mum you never want to anticipate leaving your child . without a mum. The whole point of this was to get the dark cloud away . from my head and to get on with life, and I'm on that path now so I just . want to look towards the future,' Michelle said. Carly, who is a mother to Tilly, 16 months, said she feels exactly the same way. Her own mother developed breast cancer when she was a teenager (she since recovered after treatment) and her aunt died last year in her fifties after contracting ovarian cancer. After seeing what her mother and aunt went through, Carly said she would hate for her own daughter to see her battling cancer. 'I don't want my daughter to see me . suffering from cancer. As soon as I found out I carried the gene, it was a not a . case of 'if' but 'when' I would have a mastectomy' She said: 'I saw my mum suffer from cancer growing up, . it's really hard to see someone you love like that. 'I don't want my daughter to see me suffering. As soon as I found out I carried the gene, it was a not a case of 'if' but 'when' I would have a mastectomy. Having it now means Tilly will be too young to remember any of it.' Carly said she has the full support of her family and partner, Damian, which made the decision to have a  mastectomy easier. 'Damian has been completely supportive, he just wants me to get it done. If I wasn't in a stable relationship I might have felt differently but as I know I've met my partner for life, it doesn't bother me to have a mastectomy,' she said. Carly is scheduled to have her operation on March 22 and said seeing Michelle back performing with Liberty X on the Big Reunion tour so soon after her surgery has been reassuring. Reassuring: After having a double mastectomy at the end of last year, Michelle has already returned to performing with reformed Liberty X. Carly said it has helped seeing how quickly she has recovered . 'It has been nice to see how quickly she has recovered,' she said. As Carly wants to have more children, she will not yet have her ovaries removed. Doctors also recommend women don't do this until their late thirties or early forties because the risk of developing ovarian cancer is lower and the operation can bring on symptoms of the menopause. There is a chance that Carly will have passed the  BRCA1 gene on to her daughter but said she will wait until she is at least 18 to discuss it with her and see if she then wants to be tested. She said: 'I found out at 28 and it was a lot to get my head around. So I won't tell her till she's at least 18, even then she might be too young to handle it. If she does have the gene I will fully support her and I can help her from my own experience.' BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that belong to a class known as tumor suppressors. Mutation of these genes has been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer . A woman's risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer .

Troubled football star Paul Gascoigne is understood to be heading back to Britain after a month spent tackling his alcohol problem in rehab in the U.S. Celebrity friends of the former England legend, 45, clubbed together to help fund his £6,000-a-week treatment in Arizona after he suffered a public meltdown at a charity event in Northampton in January. Now Gascoigne, who has vowed to quit drinking, is said to be 'back on track and coming home'. Emotional: The footballer has admitted drinking binges have almost killed him in the past . A source close to the star told the Sun: . ‘We’re just delighted that Paul’s back on track and coming home, where . he can get back into his routine of doing the things he enjoys – without . the booze getting in the way ever again.' The footballer is now said to have pledged to quit drinking once and for all. Rehab: Gazza is understood to be heading back to Britain after a month in a clinic in Arizona . Following his shambolic appearance in Northampton, a . former friend of the one-time midfielder released video footage of . Gascoigne mumbling, groaning, and struggling to stay conscious. His ex-flatmate Shane Abbott claimed Gascoigne was drinking two litres of gin and 15 cans of Stella Artois a day in the period leading up to his stint in rehab. The 36-year-old also said he was taking up to 30 anti-depressant Valium pills daily and injecting cocaine. After being admitted to the Cottonwood Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, Gascoigne was rushed . to intensive care amid fears alcohol withdrawal could have triggered a major organ failure, the report in the Sun said. Glory days: Paul Gascoigne was one of the best football players of his generation . Celebrities . such as Chris Evans, Alan Shearer, Alan Sugar and Ronnie Irani have . lent support to a Twitter campaign to raise the £100,000 needed to cover Gascoigne's treatment. English players Frank Lampard, John . Terry, Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere had contributed funds, while FA . Charity the England Footballers Foundation also contributed £40,000 from . the national team. The campaign followed the former footballer's public appearance at An Evening With Paul Gascoigne held at Northampton's Park Inn Hotel in January. Hundreds of audience members watched as he mumbled stories and swore repeatedly in response to questions from his agent Terry Baker, who was interviewing him on stage at the event. Gascoigne began by announcing: ‘I’ve had a f****** hard month. F****** hell.’ He also seemed to sob, and repeatedly raised his hand to his face. While holding the microphone with his right hand it shook so uncontrollably that he had to steady it with his left. At one stage Gascoigne mumbled ‘I’ve been on a whisky diet’. One onlooker said he seemed to be ‘dying in front of our eyes’.","Friends of the star say he is 'back on track' after month in rehab .

Statins are not the best way to prevent heart disease, according to new research. The cholesterol-lowering drugs are taken by seven million people in the UK, costing the NHS £450million a year. Conventional medical wisdom states they are a good 'cure-all' treatment for heart disease, but making dietary changes could be a more effective tactic, say scientists. Professor Kausik Ray, of St George's Healthcare Trust in London, said statins are an effective treatment for many people with heart problems, especially if they have already had a heart attack or stroke. However, this accounts for only a small amount of patients who are actually prescribed statins. The majority are given to people seen to be 'at risk' of the disease. Professor Ray says it is very difficult to predict who is at risk. He told Mail Online that cost was the biggest driver to prescribe statins to people at lower and lower risk from heart disease. He said: 'Statins are cheap and fairly safe. The costs of the drugs are as low as £1.30 a month compared to £24 a month a few years ago. 'However, the cost from heart disease for hospital admissions, investigations, stents and bypasses is huge.' He added to The Sun: 'For people with no family history of heart problems and others deemed a low risk, other approaches should be used, like eating a good diet full of fish, lean meat, vegetables and low in saturated fat.' He is one of the experts who has taken part in a documentary due to be released in September, called 'Statin Nation.' The director Justin Smith claims the benefits of statins are routinely exaggerated and that the pharmaceutical industry is partly to blame. He told Mail Online: 'Creating a drug is a costly and lengthy process so they are encouraging more patients to take existing drugs.' Mr Smith worked for four years as a personal trainer and nutritional coach before writing the book '$29 Billion Reasons to Lie About Cholesterol' in 2009. He said he made the crowd-funded documentary because he believes doctors are being provided with too much information that favours the drugs industry. However, Professor Peter Weissberg, from the British Heart Foundation, contested this saying: 'The most commonly used statins are off patent, which means the drug cmopanies no longer have any financial incentive in expanding the market. 'It is the medical community who is pushing for wider use of statins since they are convinced by the evidence this will reduce heart attacks and strokes in the future.' Mr Smith also pointed to a 2008 study by Allender et al in Coronary Heart Disease Statistics, which found the heart disease rate did not decline between 1994 and 2006 in men aged 65 to 94 yet high cholesterol levels dropped by 40 per cent. He added that average cholesterol levels in the UK are low when compared with the rest of Europe,  yet the UK has one of the highest rates of heart attacks . Mr Smith said: 'I hope that the film will prompt more people to ask their doctor questions like: if I take this cholesterol medication, how much longer might I live? 'This question is important because most people will not receive life extension from statins.' He added that negative side-effects of statins were not given enough prominence. However, Maureen Talbot, Senior . Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Statins are now a . very important part of the lives of millions of people and play a vital . role in both lowering cholesterol and helping prevent heart attacks. 'Their importance shouldn’t be . underestimated and the potential risk of side effects are outweighed by . the proven benefits. The use of statins is the main reason why fewer . people have high cholesterol levels now compared to 20 years ago. 'Your body will always make . cholesterol so if you stop taking a statin it’s likely your cholesterol . levels will rise. So, if you’re prescribed a statin make sure you take . it every day because they’re most beneficial when you take them on a . long-term basis. If you develop side effects see your GP as the medicine . or dose can be changed. ' But she added: 'It’s worth remembering though that you may be able head off the . prospect of being prescribed statins by eating a healthy balanced diet, . keeping physically active and maintaining a healthy weight and body . shape.'","NHS spends £450million a year on cholesterol-lowering drugs .

A father-of-four from Chepstow in south Wales has become a real-life man who would be king after he was crowned 'King Bazza' to head a tribe in India. English-born Barry Watson, 60, has been given the lofty title by the Yanadi tribe, from Andhra Pradesh, India, who have named a new village after him - Barrypuram. The charity worker and father-of-four, who runs social media company Let Us Be Social, helped rescue the villagers from life on a rubbish tip. Barry Watson, from Chepstow, has become a real-life man who would be king after he was crowned King Bazza to head a tribe in India . Mr Watson, who runs social media company Let Us Be Social, helped rescue the villagers from life on a rubbish tip . He paid £20,000 for land for farmers to construct 31 huts with lighting, install water pumps, a chicken farm, a school and church. The fascinating project began by chance, when ex-insurance broker Mr Watson met Julie Davies, who runs her own Indian village support charity in memory of her 16-year-old daughter, at a meeting. In the 1975 film The Man Who Would be King starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine - Connery's character Danny is crowned leader of a fictional tribe on the Indian sub-continent in a case of mistaken identity. Things soon turn sour however when Danny is found out and killed but unlike the film Barry's 'royal' reign is having a happier ending. He said: 'I love my name King Bazza, I am their guard. I wanted to give them a better life without the trappings of Western civilization, keeping their own cultures. 'On the tip they had nothing, their life expectancy was only about 40.' Mr Watson was inspired by the Elizabeth-Ann charity, so he travelled with the Davies family overseas to see how he could help. The 60-year-old has been given the lofty title by the Yanadi tribe, from Andhra Pradesh, India, who have named a new village after him . Mr Watson is now trying to make the village sustainable, training 16 women to sew for a business and making the buildings more permanent out of stone . As the entrepreneur felt as they were doing an amazing job in Burlavaripalem, he discovered another sector of the community, the Yanadi tribe, could benefit from similar work. Mr Watson founded his charity Help the Village in 2009, a branch of Elizabeth-Ann, and raised funds partly from a trip in Mini cars to France the year after. Since then, the father to twins Kate and Zola, 29, Zak, 23 and Luke, 19, has achieved notable milestones in building the village. Mr Watson, pictured here with members of the community, founded his charity Help the Village in 2009 . Mr Watson, at his home in Chepstow, south Wales, with a picture of the Indian tribe . King Bazza on his way to Barrypuram, where the villagers he rescued from a rubbish tip now live . Two months ago, he and 15 others flew to Chennai and rode on rickshaws to Barrypuram, raising £10,000 for locals. The Chepstow businessman is now tasked with making the village sustainable, training 16 women to sew for a business and making the buildings more permanent out of stone. He said: 'India is like Marmite, you love it or hate it. I love the chaos, it's totally different to anything else I have done. Once it's in your blood you have to go back.' Local children the Yanadi in the village in Andhra Pradesh, India . Villagers lived in small huts like this before Barry Watson raised money for construction . Children play on a swing surrounded by rubbish at their former home . Mr Watson said his Indian odyssey actually began in the 1970s when he used take 'hippie' friends to Kathmandu, Nepal, aged 21 as a 'public school idiot' in his own words. Mr Watson said: 'I first went to India as a public school idiot who didn't have a job and saw an advert for overland drivers wanted to go to India, so I applied and they said ""you're going in a week"". 'Three years later I came home and vowed I would never return to India until I had a real purpose to go back for. Things turned sour for Sean Connery's character Danny in the 1975 film The Man Who Would Be King . 'Forty years later that purpose happened, when I met a fantastic woman called Julie Davies and she wanted me to go to India with her. When I saw what she had done with one village I told her I wanted to do the same.' Mr Watson said when he first met the Yanadi tribe he was told he was expected. He said: 'They said there was an ancient prophecy one day a white man would come and build them a village. 'It really was I was like Sean Connery and the man who would be king, when I said I was going to build them a village, about half believed me and half didn't.' 'The main man behind all this has been Vinay Kumar who has been able to make everything happen, I couldn't have done it without him.' Mr Watson, who lives with wife Shirley, 47, said in November and December they were returning to the village again to continue the good work. He said: 'We have no aspirations to be a national charity, we just want to help this village, my wife was not too sure at first and said she wouldn't go back after the first visit. 'But now she's coming in December, once you've been to India it's in your blood.'","Englishman Barry Watson given title by Yanadi tribe, from Andhra Pradesh .

Ministers are trying to measure loneliness amid concerns it is having devastating consequences on the nation’s health. The Department of Health is drawing up a map which will pinpoint which areas of the country have the highest levels of isolation. It is a particular problem among the elderly and research has found that as many as half of the over 75s regard the television as their main source of company. Figures show that 1 in 10 elderly people only see friends and family once a month, with the same proportion saying they feel cut-off from society . But there is growing evidence that loneliness can cause health problems and lead to higher rates of dementia, heart disease and high blood pressure. It also leads to people going to their hospital or GP more frequently - just for the company - and they are more likely to move into a care home earlier. For the first time, officials will ask local councils and NHS health trusts to carry out surveys of the levels of loneliness within their communities. If they are found to be high, authorities will be urged to provide extra support such as befriending services and transport to day centres. Research has found that as many as half of the over 75s regard the television as their main source of company . Norman Lamb, the care and support minister said: ‘For the first time we will be aiming to define the extent of the problem by introducing a national measure for loneliness. ‘We will be encouraging local authorities, NHS organisations and others to get better at measuring the condition in their communities. ‘Once they have this information, they can come up with the right solutions to address loneliness and isolation.’ The charity Age UK estimates that as many as 1 in 10 pensioners are lonely most of the time, which equates to 90,000 people. Another 1 in 10 only see friends and family once a month, with the same proportion saying they feel cut-off from society. Laura Ferguson, Director of the Campaign to End Loneliness - which was set up by charities last year said: ‘Loneliness is a major health issue. ‘An effective measure of isolation and loneliness is an important step to improving the lives of the hundreds of thousands of older people who are chronically lonely. ‘This national measure can only help those making local health and care decisions to prioritise loneliness as a health issue, and one that they will tackle.’ The campaign says being lonely is linked to high blood pressure and depression and has been shown to increase the risk of dementia by 50 per cent. Dr Anne Hayden, a GP in Dorset, said she trimmed £80,000 from the NHS’s budget by setting up a befriending scheme for elderly patients who frequently came to the surgery. The patients did not have any obvious symptoms and doctors suspected that they were lonely and felt unable to cope with life. As part of the scheme, volunteers visit the patients and help out with jobs around the home as well as offering advice and support.","Growing evidence that loneliness can cause health problems .

The Liberal Democrats are a 'bunch of nutters and cockroaches', the party's president Tim Farron has claimed in an astonishingly frank interview about their future prospects. Mr Farron admitted the Lib Dems are in a 'critical state' but he was trying to 'breed and train a bunch of nutters' willing to work tirelessly to defy the opinion polls and win elections. Despite being rocked by sex and court scandals, he claimed the party had the resilience and ability to survive of 'cockroaches' but warned: 'One day someone will stand on us if we are not careful. Nutter: Lib Dem president Tim Farron warned the party was in a 'critical state' and future survival could not be guaranteed . As the Lib Dems prepare for their spring conference in Brighton, starting tonight, Mr Farron warned the party faithful that they cannot take their future survival for granted. It comes as a new poll shows fewer than a third of Liberal Democrat voters at the last election plan to back the party again, a major poll reveals today. A survey commissioned by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft suggests there is little room for complacency for Nick Clegg despite the by-election victory in Eastleigh last week. Mr Farron told parliamentary journal The House: 'We are a bit like cockroaches after a nuclear war, just a bit less smelly, we are made of sterner stuff. Survival: Mr Farron said the party's resilience is 'a bit like cockroaches after a nuclear war, just a bit less smelly' 'The party is in a critical state. We may well be cockroach-ish, but we shouldn't take that for granted. One day someone will stand on us if we are not careful. We shouldn't assume our survival is guaranteed.' He said the party could not depend on safe seats, so anyone who chose to stand for election needed to be a 'nutter. 'Essentially we are trying to breed and train a bunch of nutters, absolutely dedicated and who have the skill set and understanding that what it takes is not just doing a good hustings, it’s not just about being able to do a nice TV interview, it’s actually about having the immense fighting spirit.' In recent weeks the party . has been rocked by groping allegations  - strongly denied by Lord Rennard - that women activists were sexually harassed by the former chief exeuctive. Mr Farron - who previously appeared to make life difficult for the Deputy Prime Minister by suggesting the party had 'screwed up' - said the Lib Dems 'certainly appear to have let people down' but insisted it was crucial that they did not now go into 'institutional self-defence mode'. He added: 'I think 99 per cent of the people out there just don't care, it's not been raised. I've done a lot of door knocking both in Eastleigh and in my patch this last week. It was mentioned to me once, and that was in sympathy.' However, the Lord Ashcroft poll reveals the Lib Dems have a real fight for survival. While . many left-leaning former Lib Dem voters want the party to be more vocal . in opposing the Tories, such a move would put off more moderate, . Conservative-leaning voters who might otherwise stay with the party or . even switch to it. Research: There is little room for complacency for Nick Clegg despite the by-election victory in Eastleigh last week, according to a survey commissioned by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft (right) Lord Ashcroft’s research, based on a poll of more than 20,000 voters, finds that only 29 per cent of those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 say they would do so again tomorrow – just 5 per cent of the electorate. The other 71 per cent say they would vote for another party, or don’t know. However, nearly a quarter of those who say they would vote Lib Dem in an election tomorrow did not vote for the party in 2010 – indicating the party has picked up significant support since entering government. The party's reputation for scandal . has also been bolstered by both the Rennard scandal and the resignation of Cabinet minister Chris . Huhne, who now faces jail after admitting perverting the course of . justice over his wife Vicky Pryce taking his speeding points. Today Sir Menzies Campbell, the . former Lib Dem leader said: 'Obviously we’d have much preferred that . neither of these things should have arisen.' But he told BBC Radio 4: 'Rumours of our death are grossly exaggerated.' According to the Ashcroft poll, some . 29 per cent of Lib Dem voters in 2010 now say they would vote Labour or . Green – with many angry that the party joined the Coalition. Another 8 . per cent of 2010 Lib Dem voters would now vote Conservative, with 7 per . cent backing UKIP. More than a fifth – 22 per cent – of those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 do not know how they would vote tomorrow. Though many have lost confidence in the Lib Dems, they are resistant to Labour and do not know who to trust on the economy. The Lib Dems’ flagship economic policy – raising the income tax threshold to £10,000 – is backed by an overwhelming 85 per cent of voters, but four in ten think it was a Tory proposal. The most recognisable Lib Dem policy is an amnesty for illegal migrants, which only 25 per cent of voters support and has not been implemented in government. Lord Ashcroft, who is now a leading pollster, said: ‘After the Eastleigh by-election Lib Dem activists will be relieved to think that despite the polls, strong local government and an invincible leaflet-dropping network will see most of their MPs safely back to Westminster. ‘But that is not the whole story. Localness matters, but a general election decides who walks up Downing Street. Clegg must have something to say about the Liberal Democrats and government.’ Lord Ashcroft warned the Tories would learn the ‘wrong lessons’ from the Eastleigh by-election if they chased the UKIP vote as this would leave moderate and centre-right voters ‘wide open to the Lib Dems’.

Family: The teen's family said in a statement 'our hearts are broken and our lives will never be the same' Next, he said he went back to his apartment, which was across the hall, and packed some clothes before telling his girlfriend he had to be at work early. 'I was nervous, you know. I was trying to figure out what I was going to do because I just did a terrible crime,' he said. Yesterday, Hooten said the attack wasn't premeditated. 'I didn't really plan it. I went into her apartment. She was a pretty girl,' he said. 'I didn't know she was 17, I thought she was 19 or 20.'

This is the moment a young man walking past a building site narrowly escaped death when a careless worker dislodged a 17lb block of concrete from 26ft up. A split second after he stepped around a workman moving a barrier, the missile  fell, missing his head by a few inches in a stroke of good fortune that almost certainly saved his life. With lady luck on his side, the 29-year-old pedestrian was struck a glancing blow on his right shoulder and knocked to the pavement.

A recently discovered comet is closer to Earth than it has ever been - and stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere are finally going to be able to see it. Called Pan-STARRS, the comet passed within 100 million miles of Earth on Tuesday, its closest approach in its first-ever cruise through the inner solar system. The ice ball will get even closer to the sun this weekend - just 28 million miles from the sun and within the orbit of Mercury. Comet Lemmon and Pan-STARRS were both visible over the Atacama Desert in South America last week . Last week Asteroid 2013 EC, . between 10 to 17 metres wide, passed between the moon and sun 246,000 miles away. On February 15, almost 1,000 people were injured when a meteor hit the town of Yekaterinburg, in the Ural mountains in Russia. A bright comet show is also now on the way -Comet ISON may come close to outshining the moon in November. The comet has been visible for weeks from the Southern Hemisphere but now the top half of the world will get a glimpse as well. The best viewing days should be next Tuesday and Wednesday, when Pan-STARRS appears next to a crescent moon at dusk in the western sky. Until then, glare from the sun will obscure the comet. California astronomer, Dr Tony Phillips, said the comet's proximity to the moon will make it easier for novice sky watchers to find it. Binoculars likely will be needed for the best viewing, he said, warning onlookers to avoid pointing them at the setting sun. ‘Wait until the sun is fully below the horizon to scan for the comet in the darkening twilight,’ Dr Phillips advised. Pan-STARRS' name is an acronym for the Hawaiian telescope used to spot it two years ago - the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System. Pan-STARRS was observed on August 9, 2012, by British astronomer David Asher in Australia . This picture of Pan-STARRS was taken on February 8, 2013, in Australia . The volcano-top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and comets that might be headed our way. - and in recent months there have been several . Last week, Asteroid 2013 EC is between 10 to 17 metres wide - roughly the same size as the one which exploded above Russia's Ural mountains last month, injuring 1,000 people. It was discovered on March 2, and passed between the moon and sun 246,000 miles away in the early hours of this morning. Thought to be billions of years old, the comet originated in the distant Oort cloud - a cloud of icy bodies well beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto - and somehow got propelled toward the inner solar system. It has never passed by Earth before, Dr Phillips said. Close-up of comet C/2011 L4 PANSTARRS as seen from Mount Dale, Western Australia . This, however, is far from the only comet that has been making headlines this year. On February 15, almost 1,000 people were injured when a meteor hit the town of Yekaterinburg, in the Ural mountains in Russia. A thunderous ‘sonic boom’ shattered windows, rocked buildings and interrupted mobile phone networks. The burst of light and thunderous sound were caused by a 40-ton meteor penetrating the Earth’s atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,000mph. As it raced through the sky, the 50-foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time. For those in search of comet L4 PANSTARRS, look to the west after sunset in early and mid-March. This graphic shows the comet's expected positions in the sky . A comet hurtling into our solar system from deep space could next year score a direct and cataclysmic impact on Mars, astronomers say.According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet.But the unpredictable nature of comet orbits, which can change as jet-like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the Sun, means it could pass further away, or veer into a direct collision course. Respected astronomer Phil Plait, author of Slate's Bad Astronomy blog, has calculated that even if the comet is just nine miles across - a low estimate - an impact with Mars would cause a one billion megaton explosion.That, he says, is 25million times larger than the largest nuclear weapon ever tested on Earth. A bright comet show is also now on the way -Comet ISON may come close to outshining the moon in November. It was discovered last September by Russian astronomers and got its acronym name from the International Scientific Optical Network. Scientists have also identified a comet that is hurtling into our solar system from deep in space, and which could next year hit Mars with potentially catastrophic force.

Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell has revealed that motherhood saved her from depression when her ballet career ended . Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell has revealed that when her ballet career ended it was motherhood that saved her from plunging into depression. Miss Bussell, 43, principal ballerina with the Royal Ballet, admitted she felt lost after the curtain came down for the final time in 2007 after 20 years on the stage. She said: ‘I realised that was my last dance. There was a massive comedown.’ After her last show at Covent Garden, Miss Bussell and her husband Angus took daughters, Phoebe, now 11, and Zoe, eight, to live in Sydney. Speaking at the Bath Literature Festival, she admitted she had to pick herself up. She said: ‘I wouldn’t say I got depressed, but I got low. I was very fortunate to have two children. All of a sudden all of my attention turned on them. I think they were like, “woah!”.’ Miss Bussell returned to the spotlight last year when she replaced singer Alesha Dixon on the Strictly judging panel. Married to banker Angus Forbes, the couple have two daughters Phoebe, and Zoe. She retired from the Royal Ballet aged 38. Providing an insight into her previous role she revealed she tried but failed to be a diva. Miss Bussell said: ‘I was very desperate to try and be the diva but it never happened – there were times where I would think I’m going to stand up for myself and I’m going to make them think this but it didn’t happen very often. There were times when people would walk all over me.’ And she admitted the world of ballet is a sexist one with men also getting paid more. Miss Bussell said: ‘I found ballet very sexist, I think people think of ballet as being women-orientated because choreographers write pieces around their female lead and often it is the female people come to see, but it is based around men. You can’t do most things without men, take lifts for example. ‘We don’t get paid much and it is disheartening to know that the man always gets more money. But any art is never going to make money, that is why so many companies are struggling now.

Much-loved: Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry as the popular PG Wodehouse characters Wooster and Jeeves . Sebastian Faulks is to breathe new life into the much-loved characters Jeeves and Wooster after being approached by the estate of PG Wodehouse. The writer, whose acclaimed works include Birdsong and A Week In December, has had a lengthy love of the duo after first reading a story at the age of 12. Jeeves And The Wedding Bells is to be published in November by Hutchinson, which issued all of Wodehouse’s later novels. Faulks, 59, gave his own take on another established character when he was asked to write a James Bond novel, Devil May Care. Wodehouse, who died in 1975 aged 93, has been loved by generations and is seen as one of the great humorists of the 20th century. He wrote more than 90 novels and 300 short stories during a literary career spanning more than 70 years. He also worked on plays and musicals such as Anything Goes. Publishers of the new book said it will be ‘faithful to the history and personality of Wodehouse’s characters but by shining a different light on them will also show how robust, durable and lovable these creations are’. The characters of Jeeves and Wooster – a butler and his foppish, upper-crust employer – were brought to life in the early 1990s for a television series by Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie.

Basic mistakes in the design of Ed Miliband’s original scheme to encourage a new generation of offshore wind farms will cost households £17billion, MPs warn today. In a devastating report, the Commons public accounts committee (PAC) said millions of families faced years of higher electricity bills as a result of a poorly designed scheme to link wind farms out at sea to the national grid. The scheme was drawn up under the Labour leader during his time as Climate Change Secretary in the last government. It was then implemented by his Lib Dem successor Chris Huhne. The report comes just days after the Daily Mail revealed Mr Miliband’s controversial scheme to encourage people to put solar panels and windmills on their roofs is set to cost families an extra £1billion in higher bills by 2015. The committee’s Labour chairman Margaret Hodge said it was ‘shocking’ the offshore wind deals went ahead, given the billions wasted on PFI in the past. The contracts will provide firms with inflation-proof returns lasting for 20 years. Yet if they fail to deliver they face a maximum penalty of just 10 per cent of one year’s income. And, as with past PFI deals, firms do not have to share windfalls with the taxpayer if they able to refinance on much cheaper terms in future. The unduly generous deals will cost consumers £17billion over the period, according to the report – or about £700 for the average family. Mrs Hodge said: ‘Not only is it unlikely this new licensing system for bringing electricity from offshore wind farms onto the national grid will deliver any savings for consumers, it could well lead to higher prices. ‘Indeed, the terms of the transmission licences appear to have been designed almost entirely to attract investors at the expense of securing a good deal for consumers.’ The report said those involved had failed to learn lessons of costly deals in the past. Tory MP Richard Bacon, a member of the committee, said it was ‘Groundhog Day for PFI’. Scrutiny: Margaret Hodge, Labour MP for Barking, has called the failures 'shocking' The Department for Energy and Climate Change hopes offshore wind farms can provide up to 15 per cent of electricity needs by 2020. But that will require major investment in transmission infrastructure such as platforms, cables and substations. Competition for the contracts was launched in March 2009, with the first contracts let in 2011. Mrs Hodge said the department and the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority had wanted to create a ‘competitive market’ for offshore transmission – yet the first six licences were awarded to just two firms, Transmission Capital Partners and Macquarie. A department spokesman said energy regulator Ofgem was looking again at terms for future contracts. He said the scheme ‘harnesses competitive forces to drive value for money’. He added: ‘With six licences now granted, now is the right time to re-examine some of the terms.’","Botched scheme will cost UK taxpayers billions says Commons committee .

Perhaps this is because in many Georgian and Victorian houses, they were originally used as quarters for servants working for the wealthy owners residing upstairs. Their reputation was hardly enhanced in the 20th Century when, having been turned into independent apartments, some were put to use as brothels or illegal drinking and gambling dens. However, in recent years canny developers have realised that subterranean apartments in upmarket areas of London can be bought comparatively cheaply and then, with inventive lighting, be transformed into highly desirable abodes. Down home: Kate Maitland at the entrance to her flat on exclusive Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, London, which she is selling for £700,000 . Kate Maitland, 43, a horse-breeder from Hampshire, has certainly done well out of realising the potential of basement flats. She has bought a succession of apartments in West London, renovated them, rented them and used the equity she has made to move up the property ladder. She bought her first in West Brompton, West London, for £310,000 in 2008 and is now selling her latest project, in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, for £700,000. ‘I mainly work with lower-ground-floor flats as I know they are generally not the dark, damp, pokey basement many people seem to visualise them as before viewing them,’ she says. ‘The lower-grounds I look for are usually part of large, impressive houses, with steps leading upstairs to the ground floor.’ Transformed: Kate Maitland's two-bedroom basement flat in London's Chelsea on which she spent £90,000 to convert into a bright and inviting home below ground . After her success with the West Brompton flat, Kate successfully developed two basement apartments in Earls Court, including one she bought for £371,000 in April 2010 that had been home to 19th Century Irish painter John Butler Yeats and later the notorious ‘madam’ Cynthia Payne. Kate spent £80,000 refurbishing it and sold it for £560,000. She bought the two-bedroom flat in Cheyne Walk with her property-developer brother Rupert for £405,000 in February last year. In terms of location, they knew they were on to a winner – Cheyne Walk is one of the most upmarket addresses in the country, with a long list of famous residents that includes Rolling Stones Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, 19th Century engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, footballer George Best and actor Laurence Olivier. The property looked particularly pokey due to a number of large cupboards that lined the rooms, and it had been on the market for some time. But Kate and Rupert instantly recognised its potential. They removed a fireplace in what was the front sitting room to allow plenty of space for a good-size double bedroom, and by disposing of one of the larger cupboards they were able to create a wet room. They turned the kitchen into an entrance . hall, opening on to a study/second bedroom with doors that slide into . the wall, and freed up the back rooms so they could be used as a sitting . room and kitchen, with a door to the shared garden. Exclusive address: The flat is located on Cheyne Walk in Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea . It took about six months to complete the £90,000 conversion, mainly due to objections from the other freeholders in the building. The flat is now for sale with Cutler & Bond, an estate agent that specialises in lower-ground-floor properties in prime areas of the capital. Tim Day, the 43-year-old  Londoner who set up the firm, says that the very mention of a basement flat can send shivers down the spine of prospective buyers. ‘If you take ten buyers, eight of them will not even consider them,’ he says. ‘European buyers, for example, can’t get their head around them. ‘The whole notion of subterreanean dwelling is alien to them. Middle Easterners won’t touch them either. ‘But they offer excellent value for money,’ he adds, ‘typically going for 40 per cent less per square foot than the floors above.’ Day also points out that because lower-ground-floor flats tend to have their own entrances, they feel more private than the flats on the floors above. They also often have the advantage of access to a garden at the back. But what Day and Maitland both insist is that often the biggest advantage of basements when it comes to selling is that they appeal to buyers who will not compromise on location – and they don’t come much more exclusive than Chelsea’s Cheyne Walk.

Cardinals will begin their conclave to elect the new leader of the Catholic Church in Rome on Tuesday afternoon. A Vatican spokesman announced on Friday that cardinals will hold the private meeting  in the Sistine Chapel after a morning mass in St. Peter's Basilica. Apart from eating and sleeping, they will not be allowed to leave the meeting until they have chosen who will succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who announced his surprise abdication on February 10. On Friday morning, the cardinals accepted letters of explanation from two cardinal-electors who are eligible to vote for the next pope but will not attend. Retirement: The former Pope pictured blessing his followers for the last time as he arrived at Castel Gandolfo last Thursday . Preparations: Workers are pictured installing the stoves where ballots are burned during Conclave . Decision time: The stoves are hooked up to the chapel's chimney and white smoke billows from them when a decision on the new Pope is made . One of the two was Keith O'Brien of Scotland, who cited personal reasons. All those taking part in the vote have now arrived in Rome, ready for Tuesday. As the . meetings for the conclave were delayed in Rome this week, the ex Pope Benedict XVI, 85, was . pictured walking with the aid of a stick through the gardens of his . summer residence at Castelgandolfo on the outskirts of Rome where he . will be living until his new apartment - a renovated convent in the . grounds of the Vatican are read.

He will then move to a specially prepared apartment at a convent in the Vatican. The retired pontiff has reportedly taken with him a number theology books as well as music to listen to. He was also hoping to play the piano - one of his favourite pastimes - in the evenings. Emotional: Thousands of people gathered to hear the Pope's final address last Thursday . Farewell: The former Pontiff left the Vatican in a helicopter after making his last speech as Pope last week . Sistine Chapel closes: Master of Liturgical . Celebrations Archbishop Piero Marini closes the door of the Sistine . Chapel . More than 150 cardinals attended the third day of the preliminary meetings to sketch a profile for the next pope following the shock abdication of Pope Benedict last month. The preliminary meetings are taking place as the crisis involving sexual abuse of children by priests and inappropriate behaviour among adult clerics continues to haunt the Church and has rarely been out of the headlines. Under Church law the cardinals have until March 20 to start a conclave to choose a new pope to lead the 1.2 billion-member Church. While many observers had expected the conclave to begin as early as this Sunday or Monday, there have been increasing indications that the cardinals want more time to ponder who among them might be best to lead a Church beset by crises. Workmen have begun preparing the in the Sistine Chapel, building a new, suspended floor to protect the centuries-old tiles. Workmen were pictured installing stoves into the chapel where ballots are burned when a vote is undertaken. The stoves are hooked up to chimneys on the roof and white smoke billows out of them when a new Pope is chosen. Other preparations were also being made with the Pope Emeritus's coat of arms being removed from a floral display in front of the Vatican Governor's Palace, ready to be replaced with that of the newly elected Pope. Nonetheless, the Vatican spokesman said it was important that no one felt ""pressured"" into going into the conclave before they were ready and that more time would be needed for ""reflection"". One cardinal leaving the meeting said there had been no formal discussion on Wednesday of the so-called ""Vatileaks"" scandal, which led to the arrest of Paolo Gabriele, the pope's butler, further besmirching the Church's reputation. Gabriele was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. The documents alleged corruption and infighting over the running of its bank. A trio of elderly cardinals prepared a report on the scandal for Benedict, who later pardoned Gabriele, and a number of cardinals attending the preliminary meetings said they wanted to be briefed on the report. Before: An aerial shot of the floral decorations in front of the Vatican Governors Palace pictured on Tuesday complete with Benedict XVI's coat of arms . After: The same floral decoration is pictured today, minus the Pope Emeritus's coat of arms, ready for it to be replaced with that of the new Pope . Thousands gathered in St Peter's Square to hear Benedict's retirement speech last Thursday. After the end of Benedict's papacy on . Thursday, every department head in the Vatican vacated their job - . except for those who are considered crucial for the smooth running of . the transition period.

Former British Army officer Robert Jolleys has been jailed for 12 months for defrauding the taxpayers out of nearly £200,000 . An Army officer who defrauded taxpayers of nearly £200,000 to educate his children at a top private school was jailed for 12 months today. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Henry Jolleys, 53, claimed the cash  from the Army's continuing education allowance (CEA) to send his three sons to the exclusive £28,000-per-year Roman Catholic Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. The CEA financially helps service personnel to send . their children to boarding school to prevent disruption to schooling caused by . postings around the UK and abroad. But Jolleys, who is known as Henry, had actually separated from his wife Judith but told his superiors they were still together and she lived with him in his Army quarters so he could claim the money. His ruse was only rumbled when his now ex-wife rang his superior officer in the summer of 2009 and asked 'Where's Henry?', sparking an investigation. Jailing him at Swindon Crown Court today, Recorder Jeremy Wright told Jolleys he had committed a 'serious, substantial fraud' over five years between 2004 and 2009. 'This is not just a case of letting things slip,' the judge said. 'On each of these occasions you deliberately ... made declarations to obtain the money you obtained and make the fraud.' He added: 'You are an intelligent man and knew what you were doing.' Jolleys sent sons Rupert, 22, Charles, 20, and his youngest, aged 15, to Stonyhurst - motto Quant Je Puis (As much as I can) - using the Army's continuing education allowance (CEA). The officer, of Woodlands Park in Whalley, Clitheroe, Lancashire, used the 'eye-watering' sums of money - totalling £188,060.11 - to provide a privileged education for five years that he could not have otherwise afforded, his trial heard. As the Army investigation began, Jolleys realised the 'balloon had gone up' and he set about trying cover his tracks by changing his personal status. The court heard that Jolleys was legitimately claiming the allowance, which pays up to 90 per cent of the school fees, until he separated from his wife. He was accused of not informing his superiors of the split - therefore creating a change in his personal status - meaning he may have no longer have received the allowance. Jolleys claimed money from the Army's continuing education allowance (CEA), which is used to prevent disruption to service personnel's schooling, to send his three sons to Stonyhurst College, pictured, despite having separated from his wife . Jolleys was convicted of three charges of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three charges of fraud and one charge of the forgery of his ex-wife's signature on a bank form, after a trial in January. Luke Blackburn, representing Jolleys, said his client, who has retired from the Army on a pension equivalent to a 'modest salary', had a distinguished career as an educator serving in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Sierra Leone. The latter of these three had seen him catch an infection which had led to degenerative kidney disease, he added. Jolleys had not pre-planned the fraud, having started off claiming the money honestly, Mr Blackburn said. 'It is plain that Mr Jolleys had everybody's model of a happy life,' he said. 'He was married, had stability and he and his wife had three children together. 'Slowly and painfully all that came to an end from 2002 to 2009. There may be a number of factors that caused him to act as he did. 'You may feel he was too proud, or too blinkered or too stubborn or too embarrassed about the change fate had wrought on his life to do his duty. 'It may have been a combination of these factors. Had he told the army the right information at the right time none of us would be here and his three sons would have been educated in the same way at the same school with the same benefits. 'The fault for that lies squarely at his door.' But the judge said he had seen no evidence that Jolleys would have been legitimately entitled to the money. He accused him of 'dithering' while giving evidence in his trial 'in an attempt to hide your dishonesty'. He also attacked him for trying to block his wife's access to a joint bank account by forging her signature. 'It's clear you were a good carer for your children,' he told the bespectacled defendant. '(But) you treated the rights of your then wife with what I regard as contempt.' According to the Ministry of Defence the CEA is available to all ranks, not just officers. Service personnel can claim up to £6,074 per child per term but must pay at least 10 per cent of the school fees themselves. The MOD announced changes to the rules in December 2010 with the aim of saving more than £20 million per year. The Army will be seeking to recoup the money it paid out.","Lieutenant Colonel Robert Henry Jolleys was today jailed for 12 months .

"By . Tim Shipman and Becky Barrow . UPDATED: . 19:09 EST, 29 February 2012 . Scrap: George Osborne was told by business leaders that the 50p tax band is strangling entrepreneurship . More than 500 business leaders last night called on the Chancellor to axe the 50p top rate of tax in the forthcoming budget. The leaders of some of Britain's most successful small firms warned George Osborne that he should ditch the 'politically motivated' tax on those earning £150,000 because it will 'damage the economy'. They pointed out that the tax plus National Insurance means that the entrepreneurs the government wants to create jobs are being taxed at 58p in the pound once National Insurance is considered. Responding to claims from the Liberal Democrats that the rich must shoulder more of the burdens of austerity, the business leaders said that the top 1 per cent of taxpayers are already paying 28 per cent of income taxes. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, they said: 'Penalising high earners through an unfair, politically-motivated tax puts populist politics before sound economics. 'The result is that the 50p tax is set to reduce government income, and damage the economy, the public services and charitable giving.' The letter will fuel demands by Tory MPs for the Chancellor to slash the 50p rate, which is seen as a class war measure introduced by Labour that does nothing to raise tax revenues since it simply drives entrepreneurs abroad. Demand: 500 business leaders have called for George Osborne to scrap the 50p tax band . But the Lib Dems have said there can be no moment on the 50p tax rate until the threshold at which people pay the basic rate of income tax to £10,000. The letter continued: 'The tax, which is in effect a 58p tax after national insurance is taken into account, puts wealth creators like us in a very awkward position. 'We believe the richest should help the poorest in society. But 1 per cent of taxpayers are forecast to contribute nearly 28 per cent of income taxes. 'As businesspeople, we want to see our industries, our economy and the third sector thrive. 'Repealing the 50p tax would be a good demonstration of the Chancellor's wish to celebrate British entrepreneurialism, stimulate British industry and contribute to the Government's growth agenda. The sooner this tax is repealed, the better.' It comes as official figures suggest the controversial 50p tax rate, which hits everybody earning more than £150,000, has been a flop. In January, the tax take from people who do self-assessment tax returns collapsed by more than £500million, compared to the same month in 2011. Tax calls: The Chancellor, pictured out jogging yesterday, is unlikely to ditch the 50p tax in this month's budget . The receipts dropped from £10.86 billion in January 2011 to £10.35billion in January 2012, a fall of £509million. It confirms repeated warnings from accountants that many wealthy people would simply do everything possible to avoid paying the tax. For example, many business executives decided to pay themselves a big bonus or dividend before it came into effect in order to avoid losing half of it in tax. Mr Chris Jenkins, Managing Director of BWS Security Systems Ltd, who signed the letter, said: 'Since the 50 per cent tax band was introduced I have stopped taking a salary or dividend that takes me into this higher tax band. I am living off my savings and reduced my over-all spending. Basically, I have chosen not to pay this higher level of tax. 'The loser in this case is HMRC. First, they miss out on income tax revenue. And second, my reduced spending means I am contributing less VAT. My advice to the Government is simple: stop killing the goose that lays the golden egg.' Andrew Denny, Managing Director of Fix-a-Form International, said: 'I am simply trying to create wealth for me, my kids and my loyal staff. Why are high earners treated like they have committed a crime and should be punished?' Charlie Mullins, Managing Director of Pimlico Plumbers, who signed the letter said: 'Ultimately, the 50p tax is self-defeating and will end up hurting the whole of society, not just the rich. 'I don't mind paying my fair-share of taxes. We all want to live in a fairer society. This is what makes Britain great. But the 50p tax is excessive and anti-entrepreneurialism.' Treasury sources say the Chancellor has always made clear the 50p tax rate is 'temporary' but that nothing will happen until an assessment of the tax has been completed.","Entrepreneurs are paying 58p in the pound tax with National Insurance - hitting jobs drive .

This is a cat who has certainly used up one its nine lives - after it survived a 3,400 journey from Egypt to the UK when she was accidentally packed in her owner's suitcase. Mervat Ciuti only realised her mistake when she was called by relatives in Cairo as she sat in a taxi in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on her way to visit her sister. She was so convinced her beloved pet Bisou, a seven-year-old Persian would be dead that she had to get the taxi driver to check her luggage. Scroll down for video . Trip of a lifetime: Bisou the cat who travelled in his owners luggage from Egypt to the UK . An unimpressed-looking Bisou recreates the moment a taxi driver opened her owner's luggage and discovered the back-packing pussy . But when he opened the case they found that Bisou was happily curled up along with her clothes and enjoying a cat nap. Vets said it was a 'miracle' the animal survived after its long journey in the cargo hold of a plane. But Bisou has not yet been able to return home as he has been put in quarantine for six months. Ms Ciuti, 42, believes she unwittingly zipped her pet inside the case after Bisou crawled in for a nap. The cat somehow managed to go unnoticed . through security at Cairo airport and was stacked into the hold of the . plane with hundreds of other bags. She was called by relatives, who realised the cat was missing, as Ms Ciuti  travelled from Heathrow along the M1 to her sister's home. Her sister Monica, 40, said: 'When she realised what had happened she said she was trembling. She thought she would be dead. Mike Binks, owner of Calagran Kennels in Chesterfield, says it's a miracle that Bisou survived the plane journey . 'How could she survive? At the airport the cases could have been thrown and banged about.' Mervat, 42, returned to Egypt after spending a few weeks staying at a flat in Mapperley, Nottingham, and visiting her sister. But she had to leave Bisou in quarantine at a kennels in Chesterfield, where she is still waiting for the all-clear to be shipped safely back to Egypt in the summer. Mike Binks, owner of the centre, described the cat’s adventure as a 'miracle'. He said: 'She’s a healthy, happy, laid-back Persian who likes sitting outside in the sunshine. 'I’ve never heard anything quite like . it before. Apparently she was fine and when the bag was opened was like . ""well this is comfortable, if a bit different"".' Air miles moggy: Bisou slipped through security at Cairo unspotted and was stacked into the hold of the plane with hundreds of other bags for the six-hour flight . He . added: 'I spent 21 years working for British Airways before I did this . and in holds you get the same air as you get upstairs but it’s not . circulated or heated. 'But . if you think about it she would have been well insulated with all the . other bags around her and she’s very furry with a massive coat. 'In my experience cats and dogs have got into holds and its just luck whether or not they survive.' Ms Ciuti was in a cab on the M1 en . route to her sister Monica’s home in Nottinghamshire when a relative in . Cairo called on her mobile to say it was thought she had accidentally . packed her own pet. Monica, 40, said: 'They stopped the . cab and the taxi driver offered to look as she was so upset. He said . ""don’t look"" as he opened the bag for her. 'But Bisou was alive. My sister just had her in her lap in the taxi the rest of the way to Nottingham. The Persian cat is more used to Cairo than Nottinghamshire - and will soon be allowed to return home . 'When she got into the flat in . Mapperley where my sister was staying she was scared because it was a . strange place and hid under the bed.' 'We just couldn’t believe it. Our family had looked everywhere and they realised she must have got into the suitcase. It was so unexpected.' After Mervat took her cat to the vet for a check-up following her ordeal on December 28, Bisou was put into quarantine at Calagran Kennels Chesterfield, where she is still waiting for the all-clear to be shipped safely back to Egypt in the summer. Notts County Council’s Trading Standards department arranged for Bisou to be kept in quarantine after they were contacted by the vet which Mervat had taken her to. Animal importation issues fall under the remit of trading standards. Trading Standards manager Mark Hughes said: 'It is a very unusual situation as we have dealt with cats coming into the UK in cargo containers - but never a suitcase! It was New Year’s Eve when we got the call; we just didn’t believe it. I’m amazed it survived.' It is illegal to bring a pet into the UK without the right travel documents, which from Egypt include proof of rabies vaccinations, which Monica said Bisou had had done. Trading Standards said they took no further action in Bisou’s case as they were satisfied she had been brought in by mistake.","Persian Bisou was accidentally packed inside owner Mervat Ciuti's luggage .

Arkansas is set to have America's most restrictive abortion law - a near-ban on the procedure from the 12th week of pregnancy - unless a lawsuit or court action intervenes. Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature defied Governor Mike Beebe, overriding the Democrat's veto as the House voted 56-33 on Wednesday, a day after the Senate voted to do the same. The votes come less than a week after the Legislature overrode a veto of a separate bill banning most abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy. That bill took effect immediately after the final override vote, whereas the 12-week ban won't take effect until this summer. Controversial: Senator Jason Rapert, pictured at the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday, was the Bill sponsor . Abortion rights proponents have said they'll sue to block the 12-week ban from taking effect. Beebe warned lawmakers that both measures would end up wasting taxpayers' money with the state defending them in court, where, he said, they are likely to fail. The measures' supporters, who expected court challenges, were undaunted. 'Not the governor, nor anyone else other than the courts, can determine if something is constitutional or unconstitutional,' Rep. Bruce Westerman, a Republican from Hot Springs, said in urging his colleagues to override Beebe. Bill sponsor Senator Jason Rapert, a Republican from Conway, watched the vote from the House gallery and said a number of law firms have offered to help the state defend the laws in court, if it comes to that. 'The Arkansas Legislature has once . again disregarded women's health care and passed the most extreme . anti-women's health bill in the country. 'With this bill, the Arkansas . Legislature will force many women to seek unsafe care.' - Jill June, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland . 'I'm just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed. The eyes of the entire nation were on the Arkansas House of Representatives today,' he said. Beebe rejected both measures for the same reasons, saying they are unconstitutional and that they contradict the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion until a fetus could viably survive outside the womb. A fetus is generally considered viable at 22 to 24 weeks. 'The Arkansas Legislature has once again disregarded women's health care and passed the most extreme anti-women's health bill in the country,' said Jill June, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland. 'With this bill, the Arkansas Legislature will force many women to seek unsafe care.' Sen. Linda Coleman, center, offers an amendment to an abortion bill during a meeting of the Senate Health Committee at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, yesterday . The 12-week ban would prohibit abortions . from the point when a fetus' heartbeat can typically be detected using . an abdominal ultrasound. It includes exemptions for rape, incest, the . life of the mother and highly lethal fetal disorders. The 20-week . prohibition, which is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel . pain by the 20th week and therefore deserves protection from abortion, . includes all of the same exemptions except for fetal disorders. Six Democrats joined with Republicans in voting to override the veto of the 12-week ban. Last week, only two Democrats voted to override the veto of the 20-week ban. 'I think a lot of people felt some pressure after the last vote,' said House Minority Leader Greg Leding, a Democrat from Fayetteville. The measure is among several abortion restrictions lawmakers have backed since Republicans won control of the House and Senate in the November election. Republicans hold 21 of the 35 Senate seats, and 51 of the 100 seats in the House. It takes a simple majority in both chambers to override. The Bill makes abortion illegal at 12 weeks - the toughest laws in the US . Beebe has signed into law one of those measures, a prohibition on most abortion coverage by insurers participating in the exchange created under the health care law. Rep. Ann Clemmer, a Republican of Benton serving her third term in the House, asked her colleagues to support the override attempt, saying her votes on anti-abortion bills this year were the first time she could fully express her view on the issue at the Capitol. When Democrats held control, such bills never made it this far. 'If I say that I'm pro-life, at some point I have to do something about what I say I believe,'said Clemmer, the bill's sponsor in the House. Unlike the 20-week ban, which took . effect immediately, the 12-week restriction won't take effect until 90 . days after the House and Senate adjourn. Lawmakers aren't expected to . wrap up this year's session until later this month or April. In . vetoing both measures, Beebe has cited the costs to the state if it has . to defend either ban in court. The American Civil Liberties Union of . Arkansas has vowed to sue if the state enacts the 12-week ban and said . it is considering legal action over the 20-week restriction as well. 'I think today, for whatever reason, the Arkansas House turned its back on the women of Arkansas and said, we don't think you're capable of making your own decisions,' said Rita Sklar, ACLU of Arkansas' executive director. Sklar said the group planned to file suit in federal court in the next couple weeks. Beebe noted that the state paid nearly $148,000 to attorneys for plaintiffs who successfully challenged a 1997 late-term abortion ban. The original version of Rapert's bill would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, but he changed the measure after facing resistance from some lawmakers worried that it would require the use of a vaginal probe. Women who have abortions would not face prosecution under Rapert's bill, but doctors who perform abortions in violation of the 12-week ban could have their medical licenses revoked.","New law, the most restrictive in the U.S., voted in 56-33 .

"By . Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 20:16 EST, 7 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:20 EST, 7 March 2013 . A Mexican man has pleaded no contest to beheading a man in Arizona who police say stole drugs from the El Chapo drug trafficking organization launching the grisly attack authorities fear to be spreading across the U.S. border. Crisantos Moroyoqui-Yocupicio, 39, entered his plea on Monday to second-degree murder in the death of Martin Alejandro Cota-Monroy, 38, who was killed at a Phoenix apartment in 2010 after allegedly tracked by three hit men sent from Mexico. Police believe Cota-Monroy's gruesome killing was intended to send a message that anyone who betrays the traffickers will get the same treatment. Slaughter: From left, Isai Aguilar Morales, 22, Crisantos Moroyoqui, 39, and Jose David Castro Reyes, 25, who were all in the U.S. illegally are linked to the Arizona stabbing and beheading . But the case has been cited as an . extreme example of Mexican cartel violence spilling over the border, . with cartel killings in the U.S. rare due to fear of attention from . American authorities. Mexico has been plagued by decapitations in the drug war against cartels. Headless . bodies have been dangled from bridges by their feet; severed heads have . been sent to victims' family members and government officials; and bags . of heads have been dropped off in high-profile locations. The Arizona beheading also factored into the state's contentious immigration debate. A month before the October beheading, . Republican Gov. Jan Brewer drew criticism for claiming that headless . bodies were being found in the Arizona desert as she sought to bolster . her argument for confronting the state's immigration woes. She later backtracked on those claims, but said such violence in the broader border region is cause enough for alarm. Tracked down: Martin Alejandro Cota-Monroy, left, was beheaded in a Phoenix apartment after the hit men were allegedly sent from Mexico by the PEI-Estatales/El Chapo drug cartel, their leader right, to kill him . George . W. Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William & Mary in . Williamsburg, Va., said he isn't aware of any other cartel-related . beheadings in the United States and noted that cartel killings in the . United States are rare, citing bosses of the criminal groups not wanting . to draw attention from American authorities. Ramona . Sanchez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in . Arizona, said the state hasn't seen a cartel killing in the last few . years and is experiencing fewer cases of smugglers stealing trafficking . loads from each other. Arizona has served as a hub for immigrant and drug smugglers for many years. Forty-four . percent of all marijuana seizures near the nation's borders were made . in the Border Patrol's Tucson sector from October 2011 through September . 2012. Ms Sanchez said such drug rip-offs are now infrequent in Arizona, while in the past they were somewhat common. Prayers: A man who overheard the victim and the three other suspects talking before the killing heard them discuss La Santa Muerte, a Mexican folk saint, pictured, who counts cartel members among its devotees . ‘There are consequences to be paid,’ Ms Sanchez said of drug rip-offs. ‘Those kinds of issues aren't resolved in a court. They are resolved with violence.’ A police report that cites Border Patrol intelligence said Cota-Monroy had stolen 400 pounds of marijuana and some meth from the PEI-Estatales/El Chapo drug trafficking organization. Cota-Monroy told the cartel that the Border Patrol had seized the drugs, but the cartel learned the truth and hired men to kidnap and kill him in Nogales, Mexico. But Cota-Monroy was able to talk his way out of being killed, saying he'd pay back the money and use his house for collateral, the report said. It turned out that the house wasn't Cota-Monroy's, and he fled to the Phoenix area, leading the cartel to hire assassins to go to Arizona, befriend Cota-Monroy and kill him. Moroyoqui-Yocupicio, a day laborer who had been living in the apartment complex where the killing occurred, is the only man to be charged in Cota-Monroy's death. Three men who were with Cota-Monroy around the time of his death are believed to have fled to Mexico. Jerry Cobb, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, which prosecuted the case, said on Thursday that no witnesses or evidence definitively placed the three men at the scene of the murder. The police report said a rival drug cartel, the Beltran-Leyva organization, was possibly planning on killing the three men. Cota-Monroy was reportedly a mid-level member of that drug cartel, for which his brother also worked. Authorities who responded to the shooting say Moroyoqui-Yocupicio was wearing pants covered in blood. Moroyoqui-Yocupicio's lawyer, James Hann, had argued authorities had no evidence that Moroyoqui-Yocupicio actually killed the victim and had said his client was intoxicated and didn't remember anything and didn't know the victim. A message left for Hann at midday on Thursday wasn’t immediately returned. Sentencing for Moroyoqui-Yocupicio, who faces 10 to 16 years in prison, is set for May 8. Prosecutors say a man who lived in the apartment where the killing took place overheard the victim and the three other suspects talking shortly before the killing about La Santa Muerte, a Mexican folk saint who counts cartel members among its devotees. The underground saint, which is not recognized by the Catholic Church, has gained in popularity in the U.S. among immigrants, artists and gay activists.","Crisantos Moroyoqui-Yocupicio, 39, has pleaded no contest to 2010 beheading in Phoenix apartment .

A gang of conmen who tricked investors into paying £35million for almost worthless plots of land in a 'grotesque, cynical and merciless' fraud have been jailed today for a total of more than 26 years. Christopher Demetriou, 30, Daniel Webster, 29, Stephen Allan, 30, and Steven Percival, 29, duped more than 400 clients into the swindle by promises of vast profits. Potential buyers were told the plots . of land were to be used for the Olympics and were enticed with glossy brochures . between 2005 and 2010. But the plots actually turned out to be low-value farm land, in the Green Belt or no had planning permission. Ruthless: Christopher Demetriou, pictured left, was described as a 'dominant figure' in the fraud and jailed for six years and four months. Stephen Allan, pictured right, was instrumental in helping to trick the wife of a cancer sufferer into investing in the fake scheme and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years . Worthless: A group of conmen duped more than 400 clients into investing in plots of land, including this one near Chapel Lane, Dover, pictured, by claiming they would be used for the 2012 Olympics . The ruthless crooks duped one woman, who husband was diagnosed with cancer, out of more than £600,000 in the 'land banking' scam. Other victims of the gang, who hid behind false names and front companies, lost their homes and suffered nervous breakdowns. Judge Martin Beddoe said: 'In short this was a grotesque, cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage they were doing. 'The investors were persuaded by a team of brokers trained in the black art of pressure selling to part with money which in some cases was all they had saved. 'Many, once sucked in to making investments from which they had no return, were then pressured to go on and invest more in the hope something might materialise, trusting the assurances of those they believed to be working in their interests, people who they often came to think of as friend.' He said the four men had treated investors as 'contemptible prey to be chewed up and contemptibly spat out', adding: 'Many, many people have been ruined or brought very close to ruin by this con'. Webster was described by Judge Beddoe as a 'callous and greedy' man who attempted to use his 'arrogance and ridiculous self-belief' to convince jurors he was innocent. He was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail, having pocketed around £260,000 form the fraud. Allan, who was jailed for seven- and-a-half years, was slammed for the 'fake care and concern' he employed to trick the wife of cancer sufferer David Wright. Percival, who netted around £207,000, was also jailed for six-and-a-half years. Judge Beddoe said: 'Like Daniel . Webster you thought your skills as a conman and the employment of . crocodile tears might work here before the jury, they did not.' Demetriou who earlier admitted conspiracy to defraud investors was described as a 'dominant figure' in the fraud. He was jailed for six years and four . months after the court heard he set up five companies to launder almost . £9million of the profits and personally netting around £2million. He used the pseudonym 'Chris . Anthony', Webster gave himself the surname 'Legend', and Allan called . himself George Hackett and even set up a front company Allan and Hackett . Ltd, named after himself and his alter-ego. Percival named himself after . Spiderman star Toby Maguire as he gave the aggressive sales pitch to . lure customers into the web of deceit. Daniel Webster, pictured left, was described as 'callous and greedy' and jailed for six-and-a-half years in prison while Steven Percival, pictured right, who netted around £200,000, was also jailed for six-and-a-half years . Deception: The conmen inflated the value of the land and convinced their victims to invest using high-pressure sales techniques . 'Investors were persuaded to buy the plots by various high-pressure sales techniques, typically by cold-calling,' said prosecutor Andrew Bird. 'They puffed up the value of the plots of land, and making representations that planning permission was being obtained or that a blue-chip purchaser is interesting in purchasing the land. 'Promises were made that the investor could sell the land back to the marketing company.' One plot in Birling Road, Leybourne, West Malling, Kent, which was bought from Kent County Council for £80,000, was divided into 220 mini plots valued at just £363.63 each. The con artists then set about selling each plot for £10,000 a piece, promising rich rewards to investors and drawing up a brochure showing a 'wholly unrealistic' housing project. The scam used front companies including Countrywide Land Holdings Ltd, Countrywide Land, Regional Land, and Plateau Development and Land Ltd, all of which were linked to the same office on the 29th floor of an office block in Canary Wharf. Cancer sufferer Mr Wright and his wife Sandra-May were among those sucked into the scheme, investing a total of £628,013 in Countrywide Land after being promised hefty profits in return for buying land. The retired couple from Shoreham-on-Sea, West Sussex, were first approached in March 2005 by Allan posing as George Hackett. They were persuaded to part with more than £220,000 for plots in Folkestone, Kent, Aylesbury, Berkswell, in Coventry, Hillesden in Milton Keynes, and Marple in Stockport. 'In short . this was a grotesque, cynical and merciless fraud conducted by the . greedy who could not have failed to have realised the very great damage . they were doing.' Judge Martin Beddoe . The couple had received titles for the land but seen no return by November 2007, but were urged to buy more land in Meopham, in Kent. 'They were expecting Countrywide to take steps to get planning permission and for an opportunity to sell at a profit when the land was snapped up by a developer', said Mr Bird. By March 2009, the Wrights were growing anxious but were met with excuses over the delay and encouraged to invest another £17,500 in the West Malling site. Percival, as Toby Maguire, then told the couple some of their land was being bought up by an American investor, but another £100,000 was needed to seal the deal. The conmen strung them along with claims they were 'privileged clients', asking for increasing sums of money to ensure their investment returned a profit, until eventually they refused to pay any more and were told the money could not be returned. 'Mrs Wright felt that they had to keep paying or that they would lose everything', said Mr Bird. 'They had been promised financial returns and got nothing. 'They had been strung along and persuaded to make more and more payments.' The scam eventually unravelled after probes by police, trading standards, and the Financial Services Authority, as well as 2010 exposes in the Mail on Sunday. Paperwork showed plots of land in Slough, Sevenoaks, Plymouth, Horsham, Ely, Ascot, and Dover, were used in the scam, all of which were either green belt land or had no planning permission. Raids of the trio's homes revealed a host of fake passports, paperwork under aliases, and details of their victims. Percival's home computer had been used to search on Google for 'Countrywide Land Holding Scam' as the net tightened on the gang. The mastermind is believed to be a man called James Maynard, who is on the run and is thought to have fled the country. Percival, of Brenchley Close, Chislehurst, Webster, of Southborough Road, and Allan, of Langham Place, both Bromley, Kent, were all found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Demetriou, of Cranbourne Gardens, Ilford, Essex, admitted the charge. False promises: The conmen convinced investors the land was needed as part of plans to build the Olympic Village and Stadium in London among other lies . Landbanking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Companies . divide land into smaller plots and sell it to investors on the basis . that once it is available for development it will soar in value. Fraudsters will use high-pressure sales tactics by cold-calling names and numbers from publicly-available shareholder lists. They can also use email, post, word of mouth or talk at a seminar or exhibition. In . fact, the land is often in areas of natural beauty, historical interest . or has little chance of being built on and the people behind these . companies are actually highly-skilled criminals. The Financial Services Authority estimates landbanking schemes have so far cost UK investors more than £200million. Although . not all landbanking schemes are a scam, it is often not made clear to . investors that there are restrictions on the development of the land or . that it is otherwise protected. They offer this advice on how to protect yourself: . - . Contact the local council where the land is located and asking them . whether the land might ever be released for development.

If you have already invested in a scheme and are concerned, stop . sending money to the firm and individuals involved. If you have given . them your bank account details, tell your bank immediately.- .

A man called Charles Mukano allegedly helped the 25-year-old get to the Miss Angola UK pageant, which only includes Angolan women living in Britain - despite her reportedly living in Angola. Taking the crown: Miss Angola, Leila Lopes, was crowned Miss Universe by the 2010 winner Miss Mexico, Ximena Navarrete in Sao Paulo, Brazil .

So you may wonder what on earth a TV satellite dish is doing nestled among the walls of its famous ramparts. This picture shows the very modern piece of technology clearly visible on the roof of the Tower of London. Mixing the old with the new: This picture shows a satellite dish on the rooftops of the Tower of London . An onlooker said: 'It's a real eye-sore. This is one of the most beautiful buildings in London - it shouldn't have ugly pieces of modern equipment tacked on to it. 'I walk past the Tower most days and it's a shame that a small thing like a TV satellite dish has been allowed to ruin the look of the building. 'I would have thought they could have found a way to make it less obvious and to blend in.' The Tower of London, which was first constructed in 1080 by William the Conqueror before being expanded by numerous monarchs, is a Grade Listed building. This means that planning permission is required for any changes to the building - including the addition of a satellite dish. The dish appears to be located on one of the newer parts of the building which is residential rented out to around 170 tenants - mainly Yeoman who are palace warders and their families. No one at the Tower of London was available for comment and couldn't confirm whether permission was granted for this satellite dish. Watching the history channel? The dish appears to be located in the residential part of the building where around 170 tenants live . The Tower of London, which underwent a three-year-long £2million restoration in 2011, has played a prominent role throughout English history. The Tower has served numerous roles over the years - of armoury, treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public records office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. But as well as being the centre of momentous Royal occasions, it has also been the home of some of Britain's greatest scandals. In the late 15th century the castle was the prison of the 'Princes in the Tower' - whose disappearance from their cell still remains a mystery today. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and provided the backdrop for numerous beheadings including that of Anne Boleyn - King Henry VIII's second wife. The peak period of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, were held within its walls. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison, and witnessed the executions of 12 men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired and the castle reopened to the public. Today the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. It is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site.","Tower of London was first constructed in 1080 by William the Conqueror .

The average Briton between 18 and 30 spent just £500 on their first car - whereas they blew an average £700 on their first television. Britons aged 18 to 30 admitted that they spent £500, on average, on their first car - enough to secure a fine vehicle such as this Renault . That's rather a lot considering you can easily pick up a 32-inch HD flatscreen for less than £300. But for the 1,993 adults polled, a TV was an 'investment'. The majority said that their reason for doing so was because they would have their TV for longer. Those that said they had spent more on their current TV than on their first car were asked to explain why. The majority, 67 per cent, said it was a better investment because ‘it would last longer’ - which certainly may be the case when a car is just £500. Priorities: Young Britons now spend £700 on average on their first television, compared to just £500 on their first car - saying TVs were liable to last longer . Another 29 per cent said it was simply because they would ‘rather have a decent TV’.

As Mayor, Mr Johnson has oversight of Scotland Yard, where a police investigation into the phone-hacking scandal that has engulfed the media mogul’s newspapers is still under way. Into the spirit: London Mayor Boris Johnson poses with Team GB fans as he faces questions about his decision to invite controversial media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to the Olympics as his personal guest . 'Long-standing invitation': The News Corporation boss (left) and his wife Wendi Deng (right) are among a group of business leaders invited by Mr Johnson to attend a swimming final on Friday .

The Prime Minister has distanced himself from the tycoon since setting up the Leveson inquiry into media standards and ethics. The London mayor was initially highly critical of an investigation into phone hacking, describing it as ‘codswallop’. Mr Johnson is thought to have invited Mr Murdoch to attend because of his firms’ investment in British sport over many years, particularly BSkyB.

Great Britain's two silvers and two bronzes leaves them trailing in 21st place in the medal table, way behind the leaders China, who have a total of 19. Mr Johnson said: 'Everyone seems to be enjoying it (the Games). The transport system is holding up very well, and we still have plenty of medals to win. 'We have shown natural restraint and politeness in not hogging the medals board so far.' Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, whose . newspaper has led a campaign against Mr Murdoch’s empire, is understood . to have been invited but was unable to attend. Mr Murdoch and his wife are expected to sit pool-side with Mr Johnson to watch Team GB star Miss Adlington go for gold in the 800m freestyle event. She won gold in Beijing four years ago in the 800m, an will go into the event as one of the favourites, providing she makes it through Thursday’s heats. Mr Johnson was also pictured yawning yesterday as he and his family took in the beach volleyball on Horse Guards Parade. However, his boredom appeared to manifest itself only during the men’s matches, and he seemed to perk up once the bikini-clad women competitors came on. Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London Assembly said: ‘There are serious questions as to the appropriateness of Boris Johnson taking Mr Murdoch to the Olympics. ‘An internal City Hall investigation is still underway after it was discovered the Mayor had failed to declare meetings with Mr Murdoch.

David Cameron faces a probe by the statistics watchdog after giving the clearest hint yet that the British economy is out of recession - before official data showed the economy grew by 1.0 per cent. An increasingly buoyant Prime Minister told MPs that after falls in inflation and unemployment 'the good news will keep on coming'. But the Prime Minister faced claims of breaking the law, because senior government figures get to see the economic growth figures 24 hours before they are made public - but must keep them secret. The UK Statistics Authority is now investigating whether the Premier broke the rules. David Cameron said drops in inflation and unemployment would be followed by more positive economic data . Mr Cameron’s remarks have been widely seen as confirmation that the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War is finally over. Economists have predicted that today’s figures will show a return to growth, but Labour accused the PM of ‘playing fast and loose’ with the official data due to be released by the Official for National Statistics at 9.30am today. A spokesman for the UK Statistics Authority said it had received a number of queries about the Prime Minister’s words, adding: 'We are going to look into it.' UKSA chairman Andrew Dilnot has previously called for pre-release access to statistics to be removed. 'I just do not understand how a reasonable person could say that was necessary.'' Yesterday Damian McBride, a former Treasury and Downing Street advisor to Gordon Brown, tweeted: 'Just to be clear, the PM received tmrw's GDP figs at 9.30am today. His ""good news"" slip will cause a big row with the ONS, maybe more. 'Law is clear: ""No indication of their content [may be] disclosed.""' Gross domestic product (GDP) - a broad measure for the total economy - grew by a higher than expected 1.0 per cent between July and . September, ending three consecutive quarters of declining output. There has been a run of good economic news for the government in recent weeks. There are now more people in work than at any point since records began in 1971, it emerged last week. The Prime Minister said every new set of good figures sent Labour 'into a complete decline' In the three months to August, . unemployment dropped by 50,000 to 2.53million. Youth unemployment fell . by 62,000 to 957,000, the lowest figure for over a year. And in inflation in September dropped to 2.2 per cent, its lowest level for three years. Labour leader Ed Miliband mocked Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions for a 'disastrous week' which had seen the resignation of his chief whip and the unravelling of an energy policy. But the . PM told the Commons: ‘It's only a bad week if you think it's bad that . unemployment's coming down, it's only a bad week if you regret inflation . coming down.’ He said ‘every piece of good news’ sends Labour ‘into a complete decline’, adding: ‘I can tell him, the good news will keep on coming.’ Downing Street sought to play down the idea that he was referring to today’s GDP figures. But a spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister clearly believes the government has the right policies. The economy is healing.’ However, Labour said Mr Cameron was wrong to pre-empt the ONS. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said:  'The Prime Minister seems to have let slip what we already knew – that the Olympics will help Britain finally emerge from the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. The question is what the underlying growth rate of the economy is when we strip out the one-off Olympics and Bank Holiday effects. 'What really matters for jobs, living standards and the deficit is whether there is a strong and sustained recovery and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years. 'Growth of one per cent would simply mean the economy is the same size as a year ago. A one-off boost from the Olympics is no substitute for a long-term strategy and should not breed yet more complacency from David Cameron and George Osborne.' However, Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron was not directly referring to the official figures. Britain emerged from recession in late 2009, but two years later the economy started shrinking again. While the end of the recession will be good news, the British economy is still struggling. Record numbers of people are now in work, according to figures last week. This graph drawn from figures from the Office for National Statistics shows how many have had jobs since 1992 (in thousands) In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based Fund said it expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4 per cent this year - far worse than the 0.2 per cent growth forecast in July. The bounce back to growth will also be tempered by warnings about the underlying health of the economy, with the recovery likely to be driven by one-off factors like the Olympics. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, warned any recovery was looking 'fragile, feeble and far from guaranteed'. 'Looking through the distortions to GDP in the second and third quarter, the likelihood is that the economy is eking out limited growth,' he added. The economy shrank by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year, according to the ONS, which was revised up gradually from an initial estimate of a 0.7 per cent decline.","The Prime Minister said drops in unemployment and inflation would be followed by more positive economic data .

It is hoped that by quickly determining whether a suspicious lump is cancerous, the test will spare women time and worry, as well as cutting the cost for the NHS. More than 1.5million British women have breast X-rays, or mammograms, each year. If their result is abnormal, the patient will often have a sample of cells withdrawn via a needle. Up to 90 per cent of these needle biopsies come back negative. More than 1.5million British women have breast x-rays, or mammograms, each year. Now an instant laser test for breast cancer is being developed by scientists . In contrast, a technique developed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council in Oxfordshire uses a laser to pinpoint dangerous changes without breaking the skin. Carried out at the same time as the mammogram, the test would remove the need for a second hospital appointment, as well as the nerve-shredding wait for a result. Nicholas Stone, of the University of Exeter, the project’s lead scientist, said: ‘This technique, if applied at mammography, could have a huge impact on those 75,000 patients a year having to return for biopsies, with associated anxiety, when they are found to have nothing wrong.’ The test involves shining a laser on the suspicious area and analysing the reflected light. The pattern and colour of the light that is bounced back depends on the chemical composition of the breast – with cancerous lumps producing a different ‘signature’ to benign ones. Tests on pieces of pork have produced promising results and work on human breast tissue is due to start. However, the need to prove the test to be highly accurate, as well as safe, means it will be a decade before it is routinely used in hospitals. The laser could also be used in airport security checks to spot liquid explosives and in quality control tests for drugs and medicines. The test involves shining a laser on the suspicious area and analysing the reflected light . Scientist Marleen Kerssens, who proved that the so-called Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy, or SORS, technique could be used to detect if a lump is malignant or benign, said: ‘It is an exciting field of research and translation of the SORS technique to a clinical setting has the potential to reduce the amount of false positives and therefore reduce patient anxiety.’ Professor Pavel Matousek, who pioneered the technique with the STFC, said: ‘It is very gratifying to see this technology, originally developed on our large facilities, being applied in so many different ways that will have such an impact on society.’ Dr Laura McCallum, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘If the researchers can prove this technology can tell what is cancer and what’s not, it could save some women from an invasive test and an anxious wait. ‘This is the beginning of a long research journey, but shows how revolutions in technology could help improve medicine in the future.’ Eluned Hughes, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘Accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial so we are encouraged to see the development of new techniques which help identify the disease. ‘We look forward to the results of this study to see how successful the laser technique proves to be. ‘We welcome all research that moves us even closer to providing better diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer patients.’ Women aged between 47 and 73 are entitled to a mammogram every three years, and it is estimated that the screening programme saves 1,400 lives a year. Breast cancer is Britain’s most common form of the disease and almost 50,000 cases are diagnosed each year. Most are in women aged 50-plus but younger women, and men, are also affected and the disease claims almost 1,000 lives a month.","1.5million British women have breast x-rays, or mammograms, each year .

Jeremy Hunt will warn hospital bosses about the dangers of simply aiming for 'not coming last' Too many middle-of-the-road hospitals are 'hitting targets but missing the point', the Health Secretary is to warn. Jeremy Hunt will say that hospitals which simply meet minimum standards should tackle 'mediocrity and low expectations before they turn into failure and tragedy'. During a speech at the Nuffield Trust’s health policy conference in Dorking, Surrey, Mr Hunt will warn hospital bosses about the dangers of simply aiming for 'not coming last'. Average hospitals which meet national targets but are not doing anything to improve their services are 'not good enough', he will add. He is expected to say: 'Imagine for a moment that the main objective for our Olympic athletes was not to win but to ‘not come last’. How many gold medals would we have won then? 'It sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? But today I want to suggest that too much of the NHS is focused on doing just that. 'Not on achieving world-class levels of excellence - the gold medals of healthcare - but meeting minimum standards, the equivalent of ‘not coming last. 'Coasting can kill. Not straight away, but over time as complacency sets in, organisations look inwards, standards drop and then, suddenly, something gives. 'The lesson of Mid Staffs is surely that we need to understand why they fail in the first place - which means tackling mediocrity and low expectations before they turn into failure and tragedy.' He is expected to add: 'There are plenty of other hospitals where their staff friends and family scores are about the same today as they were in 2009. They’re hitting their targets, they’re not failing but, on the basis of this indicator anyway, they’re standing still. 'Hospitals must not be allowed to cruise along, hitting the targets but missing the point. “Because ‘not bad’ is not good enough. Not if we want the NHS to be the best in the world. Not if we want everyone to have access to the best healthcare. Not if we are to meet the challenges of increasing expectation alongside increasing age.' Harsh lessons: Mr Hunt will add that the NHS must learn from the failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust . He said that one hospital significantly improved standards by listening to patient feedback and introducing a 'new culture of patient-centred ambition'. 'In the 2010 national patient survey, Walsall Manor Hospital scored in the bottom 20 per cent on more than half the questions asked,' he will say. 'They were not in a good place and they knew it. So they introduced the friends and family test. They now ask every patient, very simply, how likely they are to recommend Walsall Manor to their friends or family and to name one thing they could do to improve their stay. 'From TV remote controls, to warmer rooms to staff shortages, patient feedback led to fast corrective action, including focusing more resources in wards that were under pressure. 'A year ago, their own patient satisfaction scores averaged 65 per cent. Today, they’re up to 75 per cent. 'In that same period, C. Diff infections are down 80 per cent, pressure ulcers are down 30 per cent and falls down 20 per cent. Not all of this is because of patient feedback, but it is thanks to a new culture of patient-centred ambition - as Richard Kirby, the chief executive says: ""It’s changed the nature of the discussion"".'","Jeremy Hunt will say that hospitals should not simply aim for bare minimum .

It avoids the scatter-gun approach of chemotherapy, which kills healthy as well as cancerous cells. Instead, it focuses on the protein involved in supplying tumours with blood, interfering with their work. Alongside chemotherapy, it can shrink and remove tumours. One of its many advantages over other treatments is that it is extremely well tolerated by patients. The drug is available to patients in England but three requests to Powys Local Health Board from doctors at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital have been declined. The Gill family say they are being treated as second class citizens because they live in Wales, not England. Clockwise from left: Mr Gilll's son Dea, Kate Hardy, Karen Jones, Harvey Gill, Mr Gill senior and his wife June Gill . Mr Gill was initially diagnosed with an inoperable liver tumour in 2011.

In a further frustration, he has also . been refused Cetuximab chemotherapy and without that or Avastin he is . not eligible to take part in medical trials which could also prolong his . life. His son, Dean, said: 'We just want him to be treated as an equal. We . all feel really let down.

'During the summertime he would be out doing gardening for the elderly. Now we just want to give something back to to him.' His daughter added: 'It breaks your heart. There’s a patient in the bed next to him and you are seeing the nurses there giving them Avastin, just because they live somewhere else. 'It’s dreadful, it’s so upsetting. We just want the best treatment that’s out there. We want other people to be aware of what the situation is. It shouldn’t be like this and we hope it won’t be for other people.'

Harvey, who lives in Welshpool, was born with Microtia Ear – a congenital deformity where the outer ear does not fully develop. Until now, he has been treated for the condition at Birmingham Children’s Hospital (BCH). His operation was due to take place at BCH after he had reached his seventh birthday but it now refers all patients to a specialist at a private hospital in London – with the NHS paying for operations. An application for the operation was made in June, however, it was turned down because Harvey lives in Wales. Harvey’s parents, Kate and Dean, have now been told the operation can take place in Manchester – but only if a funding application to the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee is approved. However, if Harvey lived in England he would be referred to the specialist in London leaving Kate furious at what she says is second class treatment. His parents have called on the Welsh .

A report by Lord Deighton - who helped run the Olympics - will outline a wide number of options to let firms levy tolls on new roads and existing routes where road capacity is increased through extra lanes or widening schemes. Senior government sources say a green paper published by the Department of Transport at the same time - the week before the Budget on March 20 -- will make clear that ministers are most keen on a scheme to charge motorists extra for using popular roads if they have a heavy car or a gas guzzler with high CO2 emissions. The government wants to combine the higher fees for heavy use of popular roads with a reform of vehicle excise duty, which currently raises £6 billion a year. One option would see all motorists pay a new, lower level of the tax, allowing them to drive on local roads and smaller A-roads. Those who want to use the country’s trunk-road network - motorways and major A-roads - would pay further charges based on how often the roads are used and the weight or emissions of the vehicle. Senior sources say a flat-rate charge would penalise the drivers of the most environmentally-friendly cars most, since they already pay lower rates of road tax and would not benefit from a cut in the basic rate of a new levy. ‘A flat rate charge is not likely to work because there will be too many losers and it is politically unsaleable,’ the source said. ‘The more realistic options will mean making distinctions on the basis of weight or emissions. They would vary from car to car.’ The move will be highly controversial. The AA has warned that a two tier duty would mean better-off households would pay for the motorway charge, while poorer households would opt to use only local roads. Edmund King, the AA’s president, described the ideas as a ‘poll tax on wheels’. Number plate recognition technology could be used to force motorists with higher emissions to pay to use popular roads . But the necessary number plate recognition technology to levy the charges has already been pioneered by London’s congestion charging scheme and is also to be used for the Dartford road crossing of the Thames. Insiders say regulations setting up the Dartford spy cameras can be used as enabling legislation for future pay-as-you-drive tolling schemes. Another option is to replace the annual road duty charge on cars with a one-off, upfront charge on new vehicles when they are sold. The Deighton Report and the green paper will outline a range of radical possibilities for funding new roads, which could see whole regions of the road network handed over to private firms. Big construction and infrastructure companies - such as Costain, Balfour Beatty, Mouchel and Carillion - could run and maintain the existing roads, build new roads and add new lanes to existing highways. They could receive a ring-fenced share of the near £6billion raised each year from road tax as a ‘shadow toll’ or subsidy paid directly from the Treasury according to how many vehicles used their roads. Firms given long franchises or leases of ten to 20 years on sections of motorway or major dual carriageway could widen them to create additional ‘pay-as-you-go’ lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion. These are dubbed ‘Lexus lanes’ in the USA because only wealthy drivers of executive cars can afford to use them. To counter the power of private sector operators, the plan envisages the creation of a watchdog regulator, which some have already dubbed the Office of Road Regulation or ‘OffRoad.’ The plans, which have the support of David Cameron and the Treasury, are less popular in the Department for Transport, where ministers are concerned they will have to sell controversial plans for road charging to sceptical voters. The source added: ‘The Prime Minister has made clear that he is keen on getting private finance into the roads network,’ a senior source said. 'Roads have been underfunded under successive governments and we know investment in roads can do a lot of good. But there are no easy solutions.' The Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘It looks like the greenest of Green papers with lots of options left open. It seems the Treasury, which will receive the money, are far keener on this than the Department for Transport which will have to fend off all the brickbats. They know they’ll get the blame.  They know that there is already resistance to paying for a service such  which currently costs them nothing.’Maria Eagle, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary said: ’This shows that there are still massive questions for the Government to answer on the future of roads, and taxpayers and road users need answers. ‘The Government needs to make clear if any proposals on new road financing will make it more expensive to drive, and if so where and who will set any new charges? ‘Will it be the Government, or another regulator modelled on the toothless ORR, or will Government cave in again to private companies and give them a free pass like they have for rail fares?’She added: 'Importantly the Government need to explain why higher charges on our motorways won't just fuel an explosion of traffic on smaller roads and in towns and villages, adding to congestion and reducing air quality in the places where people live.’","Motorists with high emissions could pay extra for using popular roads .

Cracking down: Keir Starmer is introducing a raft of measures within the criminal justice system to ensure there is not another 'Jimmy Savile moment' Hundreds of dropped child sex abuse cases are to be reviewed as part of radical plans to head off 'another Savile moment', the Director of Public . Prosecutions said today. Keir Starmer QC is introducing a raft of measures intended to ‘draw a line in the sand’ in the way child sex offenders are handled by the authorities. He said prosecutors have . been ‘too cautious’ in their approach and a new tough strategy is needed . to bring more sex offenders to justice. He is also expected to admit that the number of victims in the Jimmy Savile case ‘may be considerably higher than previously thought.’ Mr Starmer said police and prosecutors are ‘still adopting the wrong approaches in cases of sexual assault.’ Speaking this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said a 'scoping panel' will be set up to take a 'second look' at historic cases before advising chief constables on whether they should be reopened. Asked how many cases will be examined, he said: 'This is likely to be hundreds, rather than thousands.' Mr Starmer warned 'the pendulum has swung too far against the child', meaning police are now inclined not to believe children reporting abuse. Mr . Starmer said he will replace the 19 practice guidelines that have been . introduced over the last 10 years with new single policy for England and . Wales. He said that in future prosecutors and police will be expected . ‘explore patterns of behaviour and links to other cases’ instead of just . focusing on the account of the victim. He said: 'We have got to clear the decks and craft the way we prosecute cases. Anyone who has ever prosecuted any of these cases will know they are extremely difficult.' Mr . Starmer unveiled the measures with the Association of Chief Police . Officers’ lead on violence and public protection, Chief Constable David . Whatton. Speaking earlier, he said: 'We cannot afford . another Savile moment in five or 10 years' time. Whatever approach is . now agreed it has to be fully informed, coherent, consistently applied . across the country and able to withstand the test of time.' The late DJ Jimmy Savile was one of . Britain's most prolific sexual predators, but slipped under the radar . and was allowed to abuse on a massive scale. Police in Operation Yewtree - the . investigation into Savile - currently estimates he abused around 450 victims. Horrific: The Director of Public Prosecutions is . also expected to admit that the number of victims abused by Jimmy Savile 'may be considerably higher than previously thought' Mr Starmer said: 'Police and . prosecutors have significantly improved the way we investigate and . prosecute sexual offences in recent years, particularly those involving . children. 'The results have been encouraging . with more cases being brought to court, higher conviction rates and more . defendants pleading guilty. 'Yet, despite all this, events over the last 12 months raise fundamental questions about our approach to these cases.' He added: 'We are clear that the . yardsticks for testing the credibility and reliability of victims in . sexual abuse cases do not serve the police or prosecutors well and risk . leaving an identifiable group of vulnerable victims unprotected by the . criminal law.' In a speech this evening in London to . an invited audience of representatives of charities, campaigners and . Government officials, the DPP will set out the results of discussions . undertaken with leading police officers, including Mr Whatton. Teamwork: Mr Starmer unveiled the measures with the ACPO's lead on violence and public protection, Chief Constable David Whatton (pictured) Mr Whatton said: 'By working shoulder . to shoulder with the Crown Prosecution Service and the College of . Policing, ACPO is keen to ensure that we continue to build on progress . in the area of sex offence investigation. 'We have proposed a package of . measures, including a rationalisation of guidance, training and . consideration of a review panel mechanism to ensure we have truly . learned from the lessons of the past.' The CPS and ACPO have agreed: . Mr Starmer said: 'There is an urgent . need for an informed national debate about the proper approach to the . investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. 'That debate needs to extend well . beyond the CPS and the police. 'Above all, a national consensus needs to . be reached on the issues.' To this end, ACPO and the CPS will . host a series of 'round tables' with bodies and individuals with . responsibility, interest or expertise in the field in order to explore . and test the revised guidance on investigating and prosecuting sexual . assault cases.

A schoolboy with an 'extreme' hair style was escorted home by teachers who told him he wouldn't be allowed back in the classroom unless he had it cut. The teachers at the Catholic school even offered to pay for Robert Hudson, 12, to visit a barber but his guardians refused. Robert had his hair cut on Tuesday. The sides were shaved off but the top and back were left untouched. 'Extreme hair': Robert Hudson, 12, was escorted home by teachers at the English Martyrs School in Hartlepool, because of his trim . When he got to the English Martyrs School in Hartlepool, Cleveland, the following morning, after his £6 trim, he was told by teachers that he wouldn't be allowed into class. They insisted that he would only be allowed to return if he had his hair cut into a more acceptable style and was escorted home within 20 minutes. Staff at the school even offered to pay for a new haircut, but Robert's grandfather and legal guardian Brian Hudson refused the offer and said he was 'livid' with the whole situation. But the school says their policy on haircuts is clear and children's attainment is linked to their appearance. Mr Hudson, 58, accused the school of putting Robert's hairstyle before his education. He said: 'They won't educate him because of his haircut but it doesn't state in their rules and regulations what type of haircut is permitted, all they say is it's not school policy. 'They say it is an extreme haircut. The member of staff explained because it is not level all the way round he won't be allowed in school until he gets it cut. Robert's grandfather and legal guardian Brian Hudson (right) said he was 'livid' with the whole situation . 'If it was a Mohican or something I would agree, but it is away from his face and eyes.'They have even offered to take him to the barbers and pay to get it re-cut. 'I will certainly not let them do that. It annoys me to death. I am livid.' English Martyrs' guidance says pupils' haircuts are expected to be 'reasonable' with no hair dye and adds incorporated shapes and patterns are not acceptable. But Mr Hudson, unemployed, of the Oxford Road area of town, says they do not specify which styles of haircut are acceptable and which are banned. Robert's attendance at school has recently dipped to 79 per cent because of health worries including asthma and a condition that makes his feet swell up, and his granddad is anxious the youngster does not miss any more time off school than is absolutely necessary. He added: 'I think it is a smart haircut. They are putting a haircut over his education, which is wrong. If they think a haircut style is more important than a child's education, they want their heads looking at. 'If we kept him off school deliberately we will get prosecuted but they send him home because of his haircut. He wants to go to school. He thinks it's stupid.' Michael Lee, headteacher of English Martyrs RC School and Sixth Form College, said: 'The school's hairstyle policy is in the School Prospectus and on our website along with other policies to ensure that parents/guardians are well aware of the standards we set at English Martyrs. 'The policy clearly states that hairstyles incorporating shapes/patterns are not acceptable and that any student attending with an unacceptable hairstyle will be unable to access lessons in the normal way until this has been attended to. 'In an effort to get Robert back into school, we did offer to pay for another haircut but unfortunately this was rejected by his family.

"PUBLISHED: . 10:56 EST, 7 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:22 EST, 8 March 2013 . A 'Romeo and Juliet' couple renounced their religion to have the first civil wedding ceremony in Lebanon - and then had to keep it secret for two months. Kholoud Sukkariyeh and Nidal Darwish, both Muslims, did not tell anyone they had tied the knot after deciding to take a secret stand against the country's restrictive marriage laws. They are from different Islam sects, Shiite and Sunni, and had to erase their Islamic faith from their ID cards before they were allowed the civil ceremony. The couple then convinced a mayor in the east of the war-torn country, which was riven by civil conflict from 1975 to 1990, to marry them under an ancient loophole that allows non-religious people to be wed. Now they are at the centre of a nationwide backlash over whether civil ceremonies should be introduced. A day to remember: Kholoud Sukkariyeh (left) and Nidal Darwish (right) are pictured on their wedding day. The pair are the first to have entered a civil union in Lebanon . Happy: The couple's civil union has sparked a fierce debate on marriage laws in the country and the pair hope that their example will see the law eventually relaxed . Couples from one of the country's 18 . different religions normally have to travel 125 miles to Cyprus, the . nearest place they can enter a civil partnership. But Kholoud and Nidal became the first pairing to hold such a ceremony on Lebanese soil, marrying in Bekaa in the east of the country last November. English teacher Kholoud, 29, told The National: 'Lebanon is a country based on sectarianism, once civil marriage is legalised, this means that the first column of sectarianism is broken.' In order to hold the ceremony, the pair had to remove their religious sects - Shiite and Sunni - from their national identity cards, a practice which has been legal in the country since 2009. After obtaining papers from their local mayor, they could then take advantage of an obscure 1936 law that allows people who do not belong to a particular religious denomination to enter a civil union. The pair kept the wedding secret for two months while the interior ministry approved the marriage but decided to go public when confirmation of their union had still not arrived last month. Going public: The pair kept their union secret while they waited for registration paperwork to come through, but they went public after waiting two months without getting the union rubber stamped . The pair have since received overwhelming support on social media websites . A Facebook group called Tazawajna Madani ... w a'belkoun (We had a civil marriage ... may you as well), set up for those married in civil unions abroad to share their pictures  has attracted 25,000 'likes' within days of its launch. But Prime Minister Nijab Mikati said that civil union is a contentious issue that Lebanon doesn't need right now. Lebanon's Grand Mufti, the leader of the country's Sunni Muslim community, issued a fatwa against civil marriage in January but Kholoud says that the pair were expecting their union to spark outrage in some quarters. In love: As Muslims, the pair could have legally married in Lebanon, but decided to take a stand against the country's laws by entering a civil union . She said: 'Civil marriage threatens the politicians, because once sectarianism is broken, this means we won't be following them blindly by our sects, we will be following our loyalty to the country.' The newlyweds hope that other couples will follow their lead but they currently have no legal backing governing civil marriage. According to family lawyer Chawkat Houlla, two Muslims who wed would be subject to Sharia. The lawyer said that it is difficult to see the law changing in the near future. But for couples from different religions, civil unions have no legal grounding. Previous attempts to legalise civil marriage in the 1950s and in 1998 have failed.","Kholoud Sukkariyeh and Nidal Darwish wed last November in Bekaa .

UKIP leader Nigel Farage enjoyed dinner with media boss Rupert Murdoch this week, in a fresh sign of the anti-EU’s emergence as a significant political force. The UK Independence Party is riding high after coming second in the Eastleigh by-election, pushing the Tories into a humiliating third place. News that Mr Murdoch has hosted Mr Farage for dinner – thought to be the first of its kind – will be seen as a fresh blow for David Cameron’s Conservatives, who had previously relied on the support of the Murdoch empire. Write caption here . The two men dined at Mr Murdoch’s London flat on Tuesday night. They discussed the possibility of a UKIP pact with the Tories, but only if Mr Cameron was ousted as leader. UKIP is growing increasingly confident of winning the elections to the European Parliament next year, and Mr Farage told Mr Murdoch he could win half of all the seats up for grabs, the Daily Telegraph reported. Last night Mr Murdoch claimed Mr Farage was ‘reflecting opinion’ and suggested new leaders are ‘emerging on distant horizon’. In a new opinion poll, carried out by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft, 12 per cent of people said theyb would vote for UKIP in a general election, compared to nine per cent for the Lib Dems. While UKIP has traditionally been seen as a threat mainly to the Tories, appealing to party traditionalists on issues like Europe and immigration. Mr Farage's success has spooked the Tories, but Lib Dem president Tim Farron has warned the Conservatives not to trumpet policies which appeal to 'the man in the pub' But a separate survey carried out in the wake of the Eastleigh by-election suggested that much of the UKIP support came from voters from all the major parties, keen to deliver a stinging rebuke to the Westminster elite. It revealed that 22 per cent of 2010 voting Tories switched to UKIP, along with 19 per cent of Lib Dems. David Cameron tried to move on from the Eastleigh result with a major speech on the economy in Keighly, West Yorkshire . Another poll this week suggested that 38 per cent of people would now ‘consider’ voting for UKIP. Mr Murdoch took to Twitter last night with political observations about his European visits this week - drawing parallels between the UK and Italy. ‘Politics both places very fluid, economies going nowhere. New leaders emerging on distant horizon,’ he wrote in one post. ‘Stagnant Europe wracked by discontent and resentment of EU. Glad we contributed to UK resisting the Euro over many years, . ‘Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, few excellent, frustrated ministers. Farage reflecting opinion.’ Meanwhile, Lib Dem President Tim Farron has warned the Tories against trying to woo UKIP supporters with populist policies. Mr Farron told The House magazine: ‘What David Cameron has not understood, what William Hague got so wrong, is that saying things that the man in the pub tends to chime with doesn’t win you an election. ‘Because those people when they’ve sobered up realise it sounds ridiculous. The other thing is UKIP prove that their vote is not just about Europe at all. ‘It’s a general discontented, broadly right wing but not exclusively, protest vote. So Cameron is fighting the wrong issues.’","Rupert Murdoch invited UKIP leader to dinner in London .

And I was really upset for a few days,' Ms Manns told the Chillicothe Gazette. 'Then I thought, ""Maybe I can’t be happy right now, but I can do things to make other people happy.""' Inspired: Ohio teen Samantha Manns has set out on a mission to complete exactly 89 random acts of kindness in memory of her grandmother Virginia Booth's 89 years of life, both pictured here . Sharing: Since Ms Manns' page's creation late last month, five day's after her grandmother's death, she has received more than 7,000 'like's while documenting her work . It was at that moment she set out to share the same love and happiness that her great grandmother, whom she had nicknamed Jinjey, had bestowed upon her. 'I am performing 89 acts of kindness to remember the 89 years my great grandmother spent sharing her kindness,' she wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to documenting and sharing her effort. And in effect, she has remarkably inspired others to do the same. 'Act One; Tuesday, February 19, 2012,' she documents on her Facebook page of her first act while driving with her mother. 'I went through the McDonald's . drive-through and placed my order, then continued to the first window . like normal. I paid for the woman behind me, too,' she writes. 'When I . watched her reaction upon receiving her paper instead of a receipt with a . cost on it; she started to cry and smiled huge! It made me very happy . to see her reaction.’ In memory: Ms Manns posted this photo of her grandmother, she nicknamed Jinjey, holding one of her great granddaughters on her lap . Paying it forward: After losing her grandmother, center, Ms Manns, right, set out to fill the hole left in her heart with random acts of kindness that she believes expresses her grandmother's own life . Traveling: Ms Manns is carrying her project to Columbus after starting school at the Vet Tech Institute where she hopes will lead her to a career fighting animal cruelty . But trying the act for a second time two days later proved to be even more rewarding as she found. 'Act Two; Thursday, February 21, 2013: Again, another drive-through pay it forward :) But this time, the act began a chain, and the man paid for the car behind HIM! What an awesome experience!' she writes. The Ohio teen has continued on, documenting her effort that so far includes several donations to her local humane society, a surprise birthday cake for a friend and in her latest effort giving blood. In a matter of days since her page was created on February 20, her page has received more than 7,000 'likes.' She's asked that those with other ideas toward her goal - which she acknowledges will take many months - directly contact her on her site. 'I want to really stress that even though I'm gaining (a lot) of popularity, it's really all about helping people, and about what Jinjey would have wanted for something like this,' she wrote on her page on Wednesday. 'I want people to feel the happiness that comes with giving selflessly and with caring uncontrollably. While it's a good feeling to be known, it's an even better and more rewarding feeling to know I'm inspiring people to commit their OWN acts of kindness! Thank you, everyone who has been supporting me and Jinjey through this!'","Samantha Manns, 18, has so far paid for meals in drive-thrus, donated blood, blankets and newspapers to shelters, and baked a cake for a friend ."

Seven teenage thugs involved in a riot that forced a shut down at a young offenders institution could be in line for compensation - after a judge ruled the facility violated their human rights by banning them from the gym as punishment. The seven, all serving sentences for serious crimes, were amongst a baying mob of 24 youths who invaded a football pitch at Ashfield Young Offenders Institution in February last year. In terrifying scenes at the institution, near Bristol, the teenagers tore up astroturf and used parts of demolished goal posts as weapons to threaten staff. Riot: The violence at Ashfield young offender institute forced a shut down of the facility . A command centre had to be set up and the riot continued for about three hours before officers wearing full protective gear finally managed to quell the violence. The group of seven, two of whom had to be physically restrained and held in a segregation unit after they refused to surrender, were stripped of various privileges for the part they played. Breach: The verdict came after a costly four day hearing at the High Court, paid for out of the public purse . Their association with other prisoners was cut down for a few days, telephones and televisions were removed from their cells - and they were banned from using the gym for two weeks. Yesterday, after an enormously costly four-day High Court hearing - all paid for by the public purse - Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled that correct disciplinary procedures had not been followed and the human rights of all seven had been breached. Five of the thugs had had their freedom of association wrongly restricted for three days after the riot and all seven had been ‘unlawfully’ banned from using the gym, she ruled. The seven, whose case was backed by the Howard League for Penal Reform, had also been denied a fair hearing before an independent adjudicator because relevant documents had not been handed to their lawyers in advance, the judge said. The Director of the institution, which is operated by Serco Ltd under contract with the Ministry of Justice, had argued that restrictions on the seven’s privileges and association rights were entirely reasonable given their role in a 'concerted act of indiscipline'. The temporary suspension of the seven’s gym privileges was ‘proportionate and reasonable’, particularly as the violence had occurred in the context of physical education. But the judge ruled the treatment of young people in custody had to be rigorously scrutinised and prison rules laying down strict disciplinary procedures were there to be followed. The ruling opens the way for the seven, all now adults, to seek compensation for their unlawful treatment. The sums due to them will be assessed by a judge at a later date, unless settlement terms are agreed before then.","Invaded football pitch at Ashfield YOI and used goal posts as weapons .

Dr. Eduardo Quesada was taken to hospital in Manchester, New Hampshire for treatment while his wife was pronounced dead at the scene of the home they were both staying in . Authorities in New Hampshire have ruled out foul play in the death of a prominent doctor's wife - who was found dead next to her unconscious husband on Monday - but remain quiet about the circumstances of her death. The body of Sonia Quesada was found at her mother-in-law's home in Bedford  - nearly two months after they were both savagely beaten during a home invasion robbery at their $1.4million residence. Her husband, Dr Eduardo Quesada, was alive - but unconscious - nearby. Police would not speculate on the cause of Mrs Quesada's death, pending the results of toxicology tests. New Hampshire medical examiner Dr Thomas Andrew told the Boston Herald that Sonia Quesada's death is 'not being investigated as a homicide. 'Certainly there is no evidence of a traumatic cause of her death. There’s no trauma.' Sonia Quesada was declared dead on arrival in a suspected suicide by paramedics at her mother-in-law's Bedford condominium and Dr. Eduardo Quesada was taken to Catholic Medical Center in Manchester for treatment. Police Chief John Bryfonski said that police were able to communicate with Dr Quesada, but would not elaborate on what was said except that a 'large amount of prescription medication' was recovered from the scene and neither husband or wife showed any signs of trauma. The couple's 2-year-old daughter was not at the home during the incident and police said that she was in the custody of a family member. Emergency services were called by relatives to the home at around 10am on Monday after family members could not reach the Quesadas by telephone, after they failed to show up for a planned meeting earlier in the day. Unusual: The circumstances of the woman's death are now being investigated as neither she nor her husband showed any signs of trauma . Chief Bryfonski said that there were no signs of forced entry and that police had to break down the door to gain entry to the home of Norma Quesada, 81, the mother of the doctor. In addition, no forced entry was evident prior to officers . entering the home and no one else was found inside the residence. In November, Quesada and his wife were both hospitalized with serious injuries after an attack at their Bedford home. The couple provided police with a description of a six-foot-tall man wearing a black ski mask and dark clothing who broke in and beat them both unconscious. At the time police said that the attack . may have been random and following this incident, authorities said that . they were treating it as a separate matter. Dr. Quesada's wife Sonia was discovered dead inside this Bedford, New Hampshire home - the doctor was also found inside unconscious . Investigators arrive at the Bedford home to begin examining why the successful anesthesiologist's wife died . Julie Taylor, president of The Mews at Bedford, the 55-plus community where Dr and Mrs Quesada were living, said she had made no connection between Norma Quesada and Eduardo Quesada. 'I think that's one of the reasons why the whole incident on Proclamation Court was upsetting ... (was) the fact that there weren't answers for it,' Taylor said. 'Everybody wants to know we're safe because this was an isolated incident, and maybe it was, but the police couldn't confirm any of that for whatever reason. 'Everyone that knows about it now doesn't seem particularly frightened because they believe it is an isolated incident that finished playing out,' she said. The couples $1.4 million home is in Manchester, New Hampshire and was invaded by an intruder on Saturday evening . In November, Dr Eduardo Quesada, 52, and his wife Sonia were attacked in their Bedford home on after an apparent break-in at their 2.7 acre $1.4million property. Though they initially reported it as a home invasion-burglary, all theories were being investigated in the wake of revelations that the doctor was arrested last year for a domestic assault. Dr Quesada faced simple assault and obstructing the report of a crime or injury from the November 2011 domestic disturbance call but they were dropped. 'We're not making any connections at this point,' said police chief John Bryfonski after the November 24th home attack. 'The homeowners were obviously confronted by a person or persons of interest. 'We're looking for and expanding the search for evidence at the scene to help investigators unravel what may have happened there.' Police investigating the home invasion have turned to the Drug Enforcement Administration to help with their inquiries . After the November incident police were called by Sonia Quesada. The doctor's . wife was able to rush to her neighbor's home covered in blood after escaping her assailant and knock . on their door to raise the alarm. At the time, police said that Mrs Quesada had been attacked but was only able to provide a vague description of her assailant. 'Very, very general and nonspecific and not something that would be useful or helpful to release at this point,' Bryfonski said. Arriving at the home, police . discovered the couple's two-year-old child and Dr Quesada lying on the . floor so injured that police initially thought he was dead. Bedford Police have insisted that they do have a person of interest but are not going to ask the public for their help with their investigation . Back in November, authorities did not say whether the family was targeted, or whether anything was stolen. The house was put on the market for $1.4million and was in contract at the time of the attack. While . the police keep their cards close to their chest the involvement of the . DEA and Dr Quesada's position as a respected anesthesiologist at the . Elliot Hospital Pain Management Center in Manchester may be linked. 'It could have potentially been a . hostage situation,' chief Bryfonski said. 'That was a . consideration, that was part of the plan, but the overarching concern . was the safety of the homeowner and the child.'","Sonia Quesada was declared dead on arrival by paramedics at her mother-in-law's Bedford condominium .

House Speaker John Boehner is hitting back at claims by a former colleague that he's more interested in women, golf and booze than his job, calling his book 'baseless and false.' The book was written by Bob Ney, the former chairman of the House administration committee, was forced to resign his post after he was wrapped in a corruption scandal. In Sideswiped: Lessons . Learned Courtesy of the Hit Men of Capitol Hill - out this week - Ney . recounts his life in politics and battle with alcoholism - and offers a . harsh rebuke of Boehner. The top Republican is described as 'a bit lazy,' and a man 'who was all about winning and money,' according to the National Journal.

Sideswiped, Ney wrote: 'If the Justice Department were ever to make . John produce receipts for his addiction to golf just for the years from . 1995 to 2004, he would be hard-pressed to comply. 'John got away with more than any other member on the Hill.' Ney . said that he and Boehner were once close - bonded by their mutual home . state of Ohio - and that Boehner offered support, even after Ney was . slapped with corruption charges. In response, Boehner told reporters today: 'This is a disgraced congressman who went to jail who's made a lot of baseless and false accusations to sell a book. It's sad.' Ney was a Republican leader in the House who famously led the charge to rename French fries 'freedom fries' after France refused to support the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. But his legislative career ended in disgrace in 2006, when he was linked to a bribery scandal and resigned from Congress. Rebuke: In Sideswiped, Ney calls Boehner a 'chain-smoking, relentless wine drinker who was more interested in the high life - golf, women, cigarettes, fun, and alcohol' Ney claims that Boehner told him: 'If you resign, I will personally guarantee you a job comparable to what you are making, and raise legal defense money for you that should bury... this Justice Department problem for you.' 'Because of Boehner's promise, I stepped aside.' But it was a promise that the Republican would not keep, according to Ney. Lamenting on Boehner's alleged double-cross, Ney wrote: 'I had been lied to and ditched.' The Boehner camp is dismissing Ney's claims, calling them the desperate act of a man trying to peddle a book. Michael Steel a spokesman for Mr. Boehner told MailOnline in a statement: 'This is a convicted felon with a history of failing . to tell the truth making a lot of baseless accusations to try and sell [a book]. More than anything it's sad.' Friends or foes? Ney said that he and Boehner were once close - bonded by their mutual home state of Ohio - and that Boehner offered support when Ney was slapped with corruption charges . Ney's book is not just about Boehner, as he also lambasts George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, former Bush chief of staff Andy Card, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. In 2007, Ney was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting that he traded political favors for pricey gifts and campaign donations arranged by notorious lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

New maps of the subsurface of Mars show for the first time buried channels below the surface of the red planet. Mars is thought to have been cold and dry over the past 2.5 billion years, but the channels suggest evidence of flooding, the scientists say. The location of the 1000 km Marte Vallis channel system on Mars. The dashed box highlights the area shown in the next image. The background shows the global topography of Mars . They are now investigating whether such floods could have induced climate change. The channels were found in Elysium Planitia, an expanse of plains along the equator, and the youngest volcanic region on the plane. The 3D maps were constructed using data from the shallow radar on board the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. The team included researchers from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Planetary Science Directorate in the Southwest Research Institute and the Smithsonian Institution. They are now studying the source and scale of the channels to comprehend recent Martian hydrologic activity and determine whether such floods could be behind climate change on our planetary neighbour. Geologist Gareth Morgan, at the National Air and Space Museum's Centre for Earth and Planetary Studies, said the work was an important advancement in understanding how water shaped Mars. 3D visualization of the buried Marte Vallis channels beneath the Martian surface. Marte Vallis consists of multiple perched channels formed around streamlined islands . He said: ‘Our findings show that the scale of erosion was previously underestimated and that channel depth was at least twice that of previous approximations. ‘The source of the floodwaters suggests they originated from a deep groundwater reservoir and may have been released by local tectonic or volcanic activity. ‘This work demonstrates the importance of orbital sounding radar in understanding how water has shaped the surface of Mars.’ The orbiting spacecraft, using sounding radar, was able to map the buried channels and establish that the floods originated from a now buried portion of the Cerberus Fossae fracture system.

Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said Monday. He added: 'Right now, we have no clear-cut suspect. I don't want to strike fear in the community tonight, but we do have an individual or individuals who murdered four people. Do we know if there was a motive, like a jealous lover? We don't know that. We can't say if it was random or if someone knew [the victims].'

At the run-down apartment complex, bed sheets or cardboard hang as improvised draperies in many windows behind a black wrought-iron gate. The guard shack is empty and signs read 'Curfew 10 p.m. for everyone, everyday' and 'Photo ID required to be on property.' Three of the units are burned out and boarded up with plywood. Riverwood has long been plagued by crime, and Tulsa police say there were two murders in the Fairmont Terrace Apartments in 2012. Residents say gunfire and break-ins are part of the pattern of their everyday lives. 'We're in the eye of the storm,' says Charles Burke, a 48-year-old construction worker. 'You're on your toes. You can't be too careful.' Neighbor Jamie Kramer, a 28-year-old mother of two young children, has lived at the apartment complex for 10 years. She said the crime seems to come in cycles and that things had been pretty quiet for several months until Monday. 'It escalates and goes back down, it escalates and it goes back down,' she says. 'Usually, it's bad when it gets hot.' Mystery: Officers have canvassed the area for witnesses but have yet to determine a motive or lead . Neighbor Ladawn Mack, a 25-year-old cashier, says she's used to seeing police cars in the street, and that Monday's quadruple homicide is enough to make her take extra precautions. 'We have a house alarm and I've always had a gun for my home,' Mack said. Resident Alexis Draite, 20, recently moved to Tulsa from Oklahoma City, believing it to be safer. Her strategy for staying alive: 'Lock the doors, lock the cars and don't stay outside longer than you need to.'

"By . Reuters Reporter, Thomas Durante and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:43 EST, 8 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:48 EST, 9 January 2013 . Movie theater shooting suspect James Holmes set up an elaborate booby trap system in his apartment, which included improvised napalm and thermite, to pull cops away from the massacre, it was claimed in court on Tuesday. Holmes, who is accused of opening fire at moviegoers during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises last July is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder. The previously unheard details of Holmes' plot were laid out in court today during an ongoing hearing as prosecutors presented their case against the 25-year-old. Rigged to blow: James Holmes set booby traps in his apartment that included homemade napalm and nutrite . Shooter: A bearded James Holmes is pictured in a court sketch being led into the hearing . Plot foiled: Police investigated the apartment after Holmes had admitted to the officers who arrested him that he had set booby traps . FBI bomb technician Garret Gumbinner testified that the traps included improvised napalm and thermite, which burns so hot that water can't put out the flames. Three different ignition systems were found in Holmes' apartment, Gumbinner said. There was a thermos full of glycerin leaning over a skillet full of another chemical. Flames and sparks are created when they mix, and a trip wire linked the thermos to the door. Police said Holmes had hoped that boom box set to blast music on a timer would lure someone to the apartment. The revelations came one day after police officers testified that Holmes admitted his apartment had been booby-trapped as they took him into custody. Prosecutors are trying to show in what is expected to be a weeklong hearing that the attack in which 12 people were killed and 58 wounded on July 20 was a premeditated act. Defense attorneys say he is mentally ill. Horror: Authorities say Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and propped open a door, went to his car and returned with weapons . Daniel King, one of Holmes' lawyers, on Monday pointedly asked a pathologist who had just detailed each of the fatalities: 'You're aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?' When officers arrived at the theater, they found Holmes standing next to his car. In addition, the magnitude of the attack could be heard in the first 911 call to police, which was played today in court. It lasted 27 seconds and police say at least 30 shots could be heard. The call came in 18 minutes into the showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises.' Police also played a 911 call from a teenage cousin of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person killed. A dispatcher tried to talk her through CPR but she sounded panicked and said she couldn't hear. A bearded and disheveled Holmes stared straight ahead as the calls were played and didn't show any emotion. Holmes watched intently yesterday as one detective showed a surveillance video of him calmly entering the theater lobby, holding the door open for a couple behind him, and printing out tickets to the midnight showing of the film that he purchased electronically about two weeks earlier. Authorities did not show a video of the attack but say Holmes, wearing body armor, tossed two gas canisters into the packed theater, then opened fire. Legal analysts say that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes may well accept a plea agreement before trial. Details: There was a thermos full of glycerin leaning over a skillet full of another chemical. Flames and sparks are created when they mix, and a trip wire linked the thermos to the door . Jailed: Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 when he opening fire at a Dark Knight Rises screening in the Denver suburb of Aurora last July . While prosecutors have yet to decide on whether they will seek the death penalty, such a plea could get Holmes a lesser sentence, such as life in prison; help the state avoid a costly trial; and spare survivors and families of those who died from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial. Yesterday, the first responders to arrive after Holmes waged the shooting rampage gave harrowing accounts of the massacre in court. The first to speak was Officer Jason Oviatt from the Aurora, Colorado Police Department. He was the one who ordered Holmes onto the ground and handcuffed him after he spotted the alleged shooter 'just standing there' in full swat gear. The hearing will be the best . opportunity yet for survivors to find out about Holmes' mental state and . the sequence of events that led up to the attack. The hearing will allow the judge to . determine whether the prosecution's case is strong enough to warrant a . trial, but it's rare for a judge not to order a trial if a case gets . this far. Account: Officer Jason Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was wearing a helmet and gas mask and 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze . Somber account: Aurora Policeman Justin Grizzle leaves the courtroom after testifying that he slipped in blood on the floor of the theater . Cops: Officers Justin Grizzle, left, and Jason Oviatt, right, gave emotional testimony during the pre-trial hearing yesterday . Officer Oviatt said: 'He seemed very detached from it all. Very, very relaxed,' according to NBC. Oviatt was among several officers who spoke in court on the first day of pre-trial hearings for Holmes. The policeman had been working the late shift when 911 calls came through. Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of . blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was . wearing a helmet and gas mask. He said at first he thought Holmes was a fellow cop, because he was . dressed in body armor, but he grew suspicious as he noticed Holmes was sitting calmly, and not running toward the murder scene. Oviatt said he pointed his gun at Holmes, who 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze. He then handcuffed him and searched him. He . said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes' car, adding that an ammunition magazine also fell out of Holmes' pocket . and he found another one on the ground. Sick: Defense attorneys told the judge Holmes was mentally ill, and may call witnesses in the preliminary hearing to testify to his mental health . Holmes was dripping of sweat and his pupils were wildly dilated as he told the officer that his apartment had been booby trapped. Officer Justin Grizzle testified that Holmes had a 'smirk' on his face as the carnage unfolded around him. Fighting back tears, Officer Grizzle recalled today how he saw 'several' bodies - and slipped on blood that was on the floor as he entered the theater. Grizzle recalled . taking some of the wounded to the hospital and said he had to stop one . man who was worried about his seven-year-old daughter from jumping out . of the moving patrol car. He said there was so much blood in his car that he could hear it sloshing around. A third officer, Aaron Blue, recalled . arriving on the scene to find 'a lot of people coming out of the theater . screaming,' and testified about how he and his partner transported one . woman to the hospital as he sat in the back seat cradling her head.

"By . Hayley Peterson . PUBLISHED: . 00:00 EST, 5 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:26 EST, 6 March 2013 . President George H.W. Bush has released a series of letters and e-mails spanning the last decade that reveal a deep resentment toward the media over what he believed were unfair attacks against his son. 'I am really down about the way the President has been attacked,' Bush wrote in a 2005 letter to journalist and long-time friend Hugh Sidey about the criticism against the government's response to Hurricane Katrina. 'Over and over again the networks attack him. First for being late in moving. Then for over flying Louisiana on the way back to Washington. Then on the snail like pace of relief.' Defending his son, Bush wrote, 'My heart went out to him. Here is a guy who cares deeply. Who wants every possible resource of the Federal Government brought in to bear to help people, yet he is being roundly accused of not giving a damn... the critics do not know what is in 43's heart, how deeply he feels about the hurt, the anguish, the losses affecting so many people, most of them poor.' Resentment: President George H.W. Bush has released a series of letters and e-mails spanning the last decade that reveal a deep resentment toward the media over what he believed were unfair attacks against his son . Former First Lady Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush and his son, George W. Bush exit Marine One in 2006 . He compared the media attacks on George W. Bush to when he was a Navy pilot and the Japanese shot down his plane 61 years earlier. 'Now I see some of his most nasty critics trying to shoot down my beloved son - shoot him down by mean spirited attacks,' Bush wrote. 'I was a scared kid back then. Now I am just an angry old man hurting for my son.' The newly released letters are included in an updated version of the book, 'All the Best, George Bush; My Life in Letters and Other Writings.' The book, which was originally published in 1999, was re-released on Tuesday. In another letter, the elder Bush recalled his pride when his son won the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He said he felt a chapter in his life had been closed and that he could finally pull out of the political limelight. Family affairs: George W. Bush (front) and his father are pictured. The elder Bush said he tried to stay out of his son's affairs while he was in office . 'I felt that finally my political days were over – the record sealed and finished, with the historians left to decide,' he wrote in a letter to former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 'The baton had indeed been passed; and when Bar ]Barbara] and I left the hall, proudest parents in the world, we felt that a wonderful chapter was closed, finished!' When the Florida recount of votes was finally finished and Bush had been declared the winner, the elder Bush wrote in a letter to Sidey, 'The fat lady sang. The ordeal ended.' After his son's acceptance speech, he recalled talking to him over the phone that night. 'What did you think Dad?' the newly elected president asked his father of the speech. 'I told him how perfect I felt his speech was. I also told him I had lost it,' the elder Bush wrote. After his son was sworn into office, Bush said he was overcome with emotion. 'Our son was President of the United States of America,' Bush wrote. 'It was for real. Our pride knew no bounds. We managed to contain our emotions but they shook us to the core. Wonder. Joy. Amazement. Honor. Happiness. I don't know how to describe what I felt, but it was good, real good.' He added: 'I am not sure if there was one specific moment in time when I finally realized that my son was President. If I had to single out one such moment it would be right after the oath taking.' Not long after Bush won the presidency, the nation suffered the worst terrorist attack in history on September 11, 2001. Shortly after the attacks George H.W. Bush talked to his son, who was in Florida at the time. 'I talked to George,' Bush wrote in a letter to Sidey. 'I did tell him the sooner he got back to Washington the better. He totally agreed with that.' Going forward, the elder Bush said he tried to stay out of his son's affairs. Proud: After his son was sworn into office, Bush said he was overcome with emotion. 'Our son was President of the United States of America,' Bush wrote. 'It was for real. Our pride knew no bounds . Concerned grandpa: Bush Sr. wrote in a 2003 email to his granddaughters, Jenna (right), Barbara (left) and Lauren (not pictured) that he was worried during spring break that they were 'off trying to get on the Wild College Women TV show' After George W. Bush won the Republican nomination in 2000, his father wrote: . 'I felt that finally my political days . were over – the record sealed and finished, with the historians left to . decide... The baton had indeed been passed.' When George W. Bush was criticized for his handling of the recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina, his father wrote: . 'Now I see some of his most nasty . critics trying to shoot down my beloved son - shoot him down by mean . spirited attacks... I was a scared kid back then. Now I am . just an angry old man hurting for my son.' After his son was sworn into office, Bush Sr. wrote: . 'Our . son was President of the United States of America... It was . for real. Our pride knew no bounds. We managed to contain our emotions . but they shook us to the core. Wonder. Joy. Amazement. Honor. Happiness. I don't know how to describe what I felt, but it was good, real good.' When his son won re-election, the . elder Bush recalled going over to the White House and sitting with the president-elect in the Oval Office: . 'The two of us sat alone in that historic office,' he wrote. 'For me it was magic.' 'George . W. said to me, ""Dad, do you realize that this is the first time since . 1988 that a President has won with a clear majority of the vote?""' the . elder Bush recalled. 'My mind raced back to my win over [Democratic . nominee Michael] Dukakis in 1988. Who would have thought back then that I . would be bonding with my own son in that manner?' 'It is not easy, dear friend, to sit on the sidelines now, not easy to make decisions or take actions,' Bush wrote to Sidey. 'But I must continue to stay out of the limelight, out of the news, giving quiet support to #43.' Not all of Bush's newly released exchanges were political in nature. Bush's sense of humor also shone through in exchanges with his granddaughters and with President Bill Clinton. In March of 2003, he wrote in an email to his granddaughters, Jenna, Barbara and Lauren, 'It is Sunday morning. I am at my duty station in the office. I am worrying about three of my older granddaughters. Spring Break causes the worry. I wonder - are all three off somewhere trying to get on the Wild College Women TV show?' 'Are they having a good time? Are they sticking near their three campuses so they can do what, well, what I used to do during spring break back in the good old days, circa 1946-47-48. Namely, stick near the Library. I found it was almost free of noise and people during spring break. Maybe you three have discovered the same thing. 'I am here all week in Houston in case . you need adult leadership. In spite of these worries, maybe because of . these worries, I love all three of you ""guys"" (who says the Gampster . can't be ""with it""?)' This 2004 photo includes (left to right) daughter Barbara Bush, Laura Bush, George H.W. Bush, Barbara Bush, Dorothy Bush, Maria Bush, brother Neil and family friend Lois Betts . Humor: In a letter to President Clinton (second from right) George H.W. Bush (far left) teased him for falling asleep during a sermon . Several years later in a letter to President Clinton, Bush joked about catching the former president dozing off during a sermon. 'My heart went out to you when I saw you trying to keep your eyes open during an MLK Day sermon,' Bush wrote in 2008. 'I could indeed ""feel your pain."" I have been there myself, more than once I might add, and it physically hurt as I tried to keep my eyes open. I don't remember if I ever told you about the prestigious Scowcroft Award, given during my White House days to the person that fell most soundly asleep during a meeting. Points were added for ""recovery.""' 'A standard recovery,' he added, was to 'awake from a sound sleep, and start by nodding one's head in agreement to something just said in the meeting, something you had not heard at all.' Extra points were awarded for 'writing something on a pad, anything at all.' 'I remember when [Dick] Cheney won the award one time,' he wrote. 'We presented it to him at a nice dinner in the Rose Garden. Modest fellow that he is, he proclaimed himself unworthy, though his solid sleep in the Cabinet meeting had been witnessed by all assembled.' When his son won re-election, the elder Bush recalled going over to the White House and sitting with the president-elect in the Oval Office. 'The two of us sat alone in that historic office,' he wrote to Sidey. 'For me it was magic.' 'George W. said to me, ""Dad, do you realize that this is the first time since 1988 that a President has won with a clear majority of the vote?""' the elder Bush recalled. 'My mind raced back to my win over [Democratic nominee Michael] Dukakis in 1988. Who would have thought back then that I would be bonding with my own son in that manner?' 'Victory,' he wrote.

The US space agency beamed Leonardo Da Vinci’s iconic painting, the Mona Lisa from its Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) at the moon. The image travelled 240,000 miles by piggybacking on laser pulses that are already fired at the spacecraft and are used by the LRO to track the moon's surface. Scroll down to video . A digital version of the Mona Lisa has been beamed to space using lasers. The picture was then sent back to Earth using radio waves. Transmission errors distorted the picture but NASA scientists were able to restore it using coding . NASA laser beamed pixels from a digital version of the Mona Lisa 240,000 miles to the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter currently flying round the moon for the first time ever . ‘This is the first time anyone has achieved one-way laser communication at planetary distances,’ says principal investigator, David Smith of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. To send the picture, Xiaoli Sun, a Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) scientist at Nasa Goddard, and his colleagues divided the Mona Lisa image into 30,400 pixels. Each pixel was then turned into a shade of grey, represented by a number between zero and 4,095. The laser that beamed the Mona Lisa to the moon was sent from the Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging station at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. The laser is already used to measure the moon's terrain . Individual pixels were sent using laser pulses fired at LOLA on the LRO, orbiting around the moon. The pixels were sent in order from top left to bottom right. And the complete image was sent at a rate of 300 bits per second. Once the laser pulses were received by the LOLA instrument, it reconstructed the image based on the order each pixel was fired in from Earth. NASA timed the pulses to make sure the experiment wouldn’t interfere with the LRO's current mission of recording the moon's terrain. To test the transmission, the image was then returned to Earth using the spacecraft’s radio telemetry system. When Sun and his team got the image back, they realised that turbulence in the Earth’s atmosphere had caused transmission errors. The picture came back in worse quality than it was sent. To correct the image, Sun used Reed-Solomon coding -  the same type of error-correction code used to fix CD and DVD qualities. These errors did turn out to be useful, though, because the team could get statistics and learn more about signal fluctuations caused by the Earth's atmosphere. A digital version of the Mona Lisa was divided into 30,400 pixels. Each . pixel was sent at different time intervals using laser pulses fired at . the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), on the Lunar Reconnaisance . Orbiter (LRO) – a spacecraft that orbits the moon and tracks its terrain . and elevation. LOLA reconstructed the image in the order the pixels were fired. The image was then sent back to Earth using radio waves. Because of transmission errors caused by the Earth’s atmosphere, the picture came back distorted. Scientists used Reed-Solomon coding - technology designed to fix CD and DVD qualities - to restore the image back to its original quality. Laser technology is already used to send . data from CDs, for example. NASA said it can now use lasers to speed up delivery of . data sent from space. 'Because LRO is already set up to receive laser signals through the LOLA instrument, we had a unique opportunity to demonstrate one-way laser communication with a distant satellite,' says Xiaoli Sun. LRO stands for Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. It’s a robotic spacecraft that is orbiting the moon, taking pictures and gathering information about the moon's surface. It launched in June 2009. NASA . is using LRO to create maps of the entire lunar surface, including . searching for water ice that could be used for rocket fuel. One instrument NASA is using to create 3D maps of the moon is called the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) LOLA uses lasers to find high and low points on the moon, as well as shadows where ice may be hiding. This 3D information will show places where it is safe for spacecraft to land. NASA hopes this experiment will pave the way for lasers to be used as a backup to the current communication technology. David Smith of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says, 'In the near future, this type of simple laser communication might serve as a backup for the radio communication that satellites use. In the more distant future, it may allow communication at higher data rates than present radio links can provide."" NASA also plans to develop this technology for getting live, high-definition video feeds from other worlds within the solar system, including Jupiter. 'This achievement sets the stage for the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration (LLCD). This is a high data rate, laser-communication demonstration that will be central to NASA's next moon mission' says Goddard's Richard Vondrak, the LRO deputy project scientist.The next step after LLCD is the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD). This would be NASA's first, long-duration optical communications mission. LCRD will help develop deep-space communication technologies.","Thousands of pixels fired by laser pulses from Nasa into space .

James Holmes smirks for the camera and sticks out his tongue in photos taken on his iPhone just before he allegedly sprayed bullets inside a Colorado movie theater. The photos, shown in court on the final day of his pre-trial hearing today, also show the accused gunman holding a Glock pistol under his face and displaying his high-powered arsenal arranged on his bed. Also found on the phone were photos of the Colorado movie theater taken weeks before the shooting, implying that he had cased the theater in the weeks before the bloody shooting.

Without emotion: Holmes is pictured in a court sketch from the last day of his pre-trial hearing . One photo shows an exit door that . looks like the one police say Holmes propped open the night of the . shooting so he could re-enter the theater after getting weapons from his . car. The pre-trial hearing laying out the evidence against the accused gunman ended Wednesday with the defense deciding not to call witnesses to attest to Holmes' mental health. Prosecutors argued that they had . shown that Holmes acted with deliberation and extreme indifference before the attack . that killed 12 and injured 58. Prosecutor Karen Pearson said Holmes picked the perfect venue for his alleged crime. 'He didn't care who he killed or how many he killed, because he wanted to kill all of them,' she said. There is not, the agent replied. Maniacal: Holmes poses with his Glock pistol in this self-take cell phone photo, pictured in a court sketch . Weapon: A photo of a handgun is shown in courtroom sketch from Holmes' preliminary hearing . Jailed: Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 58 others during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises screening in the Denver suburb of Aurora last July . The judge said he will rule by Friday on whether Holmes should stand trial. If the judge decides he should be tried, Holmes could enter a plea at a hearing scheduled that day. Cases rarely advance to this stage without a judge agreeing to set a trial. Defense attorneys decided not call any witnesses, saying the rules of the preliminary hearing severely limited what evidence they could present. They had been granted permission to call two people to talk about Holmes' mental state. His lawyers are expected to present an insanity defense.

Defense lawyer Tamara Brady pointedly asked a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent in court Tuesday whether any Colorado law prevented 'a severely mentally ill person' from buying the 6,295 rounds of ammunition, body armor and handcuffs that Holmes purchased online. Horror: Authorities say Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and propped open a door, went to his car and returned with weapons . On Tuesday, the case was dominated by the litany of Holmes' preparations. He spent months amassing tear gas grenades, two Glock handguns, a shotgun and an AR-15 rifle, along with 6,295 rounds of ammunition, targets, body armor and chemicals, prosecutors said. He also purchased chemicals including improvised napalm, as well as thermite, a substance which burns so hot that water can't extinguish the blaze. Holmes' purchases were for two planned attacks, prosecutors said - the theater shooting and the booby-trapped apartment that would have blown up if anyone had entered. The attempt at a distraction speaks to a plan to escape, but the traps weren't triggered. Holmes, clad from head to toe in body armor, was found standing by his car outside the theater. He told investigators that the booby-trapped apartment was an effort to pull police away from the theater. He didn't expect to see officers so quickly. Police said he volunteered information about the booby traps. Authorities went to the apartment and carefully dismantled them.

Grizzle recalled taking some of the wounded to the hospital and said he had to stop one man who was worried about his seven-year-old daughter from jumping out of the moving patrol car. He said there was so much blood in his car that he could hear it sloshing around. The hearing will be the best . opportunity yet for survivors to find out about Holmes' mental state and . the sequence of events that led up to the attack. The hearing will allow the judge to . determine whether the prosecution's case is strong enough to warrant a . trial, but it's rare for a judge not to order a trial if a case gets . this far. Dark night: Defense attorneys have not said whether Holmes will enter an insanity plea . If Holmes is found sane, goes to . trial and is convicted, his attorneys can try to stave off a possible . death penalty by arguing he is mentally ill. Prosecutors have yet to say whether they will seek the death penalty. If he's found not guilty by reason of insanity, he would likely be sent to the state mental hospital, not prison. Such a defendant is deemed not guilty because he didn't know right from wrong and is therefore 'absolved' of the crime, said former Jefferson County District Attorney Scott Storey. Last year, Bruco Strong Eagle Eastwood was acquitted by reason of insanity of attempted first-degree murder in the wounding of two eighth-graders outside a school not far from Columbine High School. Eastwood is spending time in a mental hospital. His case will be reviewed every six months until he's deemed sane and released.","Judge will make ruling about whether Holmes will face trial on Friday .

After Lanza's body was removed from the school, it was kept in a refrigerated area at the medical examiner's compound in Farmington where an autopsy was performed. But before that, Henry allegedly went inside the room - with her husband in tow - unzipped the body bag and allowed him to get a good look. Sources told the paper that Henry's husband does not work at the state, and her supervisor was aware that he had been there. Neither Henry - who was placed on administrative leave - nor Chief Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver III would comment when reached by the Courant. Coroner: Chief Medical Examiner H.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:59 EST, 2 August 2011 . Syrian troops advanced through the central city of Hama in a fresh crackdown a day after government forces killed 24 people. Machine gun fire rang out through the city as a fresh onslaught against protesters was launched a day after the bloody fighting. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said most of Monday's 24 deaths were in Hama, which has been the target of a heavy military operation since Sunday. The current crackdown appears aimed at preventing protests from swelling, with today being the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, activists said. Violence: An injured Syrian man is carried on a mattress today as government forces advanced through Hama where some 24 people have been killed . Muslims converge on mosques for the special nightly prayers after breaking their dawn-to-dusk fast and activists said that the gatherings could then turn into large protests throughout the country. Around 1,700 civilians have been killed since the largely peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's regime began in mid-March, according to estimates. The regime disputes the toll and blames a foreign conspiracy for the unrest, saying religious extremists - not true reform-seekers - are behind it. Hama-based activist Omar Hamawi said that troops advanced around 700 yards from the western entrance of the city overnight, taking up positions near homes and buildings in an area known as Kazo Square. Bombardment: Syrian protesters surround an injured man after the army stormed the city of Abu Kamal, near the Iraqi border, yesterday . Bloody: Protesters carry a body in the flashpoint city of Hama. Around 1,700 civilians have been killed since the largely peaceful protests against President Assad's regime began in March . He said the force consisted of eight tanks and several armored personnel carriers. Hamawi added that troops were also reinforced on the eastern side of the city around the Hama Central Prison, an overcrowded jail. He said that residents there saw smoke billowing from the prison overnight and heard sporadic gunfire from inside the premises, leading some to believe that the inmates were rioting. Unrest: A giant Syrian flag is held by the crowd during a protest against President Assad after prayers in Hama last Friday . Detested: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is the target of the unrest . He added that it was impossible to know what was exactly going on in the prison or whether there were casualties inside the tightly controlled facility. The activist also said that parts of Hama were this morning hit with  heavy machine gun fire after sporadic shelling overnight. He said a shell hit a compound known as the Palace of Justice in the city centre, causing a huge fire that burned much of the building, that is home to several courts. The Syrian Observatory said that Monday's death toll included 10 people in Hama, six in the Damascus suburb of Arbeen and three in the central province of Homs. Two were killed in the eastern town of al-Boukamal, two the coastal city of Latakia and one in Maadamiyah near Damascus, the group said. Hama has a history of being opposed to the Assad family's 40-year dynasty in Syria. In 1982, President Assad's father, Hafez Assad, ordered the military to quell a rebellion by Syrian members of the conservative Muslim Brotherhood movement. The city was sealed off and bombs dropped from above smashed swathes of the city and killed between 10,000 and 25,000 people, rights groups say. The real number may never be known as foreign officials were not allowed to reach the area.","Heavy government gun fire hits city .

The Obama administration today dismissed a threat by North Korea and warned that U.S. is 'fully capable' of defending itself from a ballistic missile attack by the communist regime. White House spokesman Jay Carney was responding to the North's vow to launch a nuclear strike against America. North Korea state media warned of a 'thermonuclear war' as an unidentified spokesman for . Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said the North will exercise its right for .

Korean capital Pyongyang today after the regime threatened a . 'pre-emptive' nuclear strike against the U.S. That threat came in retaliation for tough new U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang following its recent nuclear test. Carney says the sanctions further isolate North Korea and show its leaders what will happen if they defy the international community. He said the breadth and severity of the sanctions show the world takes seriously the threat of North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea boasts of nuclear bombs but isn't thought to have the ability to produce a warhead that could be used on a missile capable of reaching the U.S. In response to North Korea's third nuclear test on February 3, the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten financial restrictions on Pyongyang and crack down on its attempts to ship and receive banned cargo. The U.S.-drafted resolution, which . was approved unanimously by the 15-nation council, was the product of . three weeks of negotiations between the U.S. and China after North . Korea's nuclear test on February 12. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a former South Korean foreign minister, . said the resolution 'sent an unequivocal message to [North Korea] that . the international community will not tolerate its pursuit of nuclear . weapons.' Threat: Kim Jong-Un claps at the launch of the Unha-3 rocket. North Korea vowed to launch a . pre-emptive nuclear strike against the U.S. as revenge for new sanctions . In response to the threat of a nuclear strike two days ago, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy, Glyn Davies, said America will take necessary steps to defend itself and its allies. Referring to threats from Pyongyang made in 'recent hours and days', he . called on the North not to miscalculate and said the U.S. was working . with South Korea to ensure it's ready for any threats that arise. Democrat . panel chairman Robert Menendez said the North's 'absurd' threat of a . nuclear strike on the U.S. would be tantamount to suicide. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice said: 'North Korea will achieve nothing by . continued threats and provocations. 'These will only further isolate the . country and its people and undermine international efforts to promote . peace and stability in northeast Asia'. The latest U.N. resolution specifies . certain luxury items that North Korea's elite will not be allowed to . import, such as yachts, racing cars, luxury automobiles and certain . types of jewelry. This is to close a loophole that previously allowed countries to decide for themselves what constitutes a luxury good.

Pyongyang was hit with U.N. sanctions for its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests, measures that were subsequently tightened and expanded after several rocket launches. In addition to the luxury goods ban, there is an arms embargo on North Korea, and it is forbidden from trading in nuclear and missile technology. It imposes an obligation on the United Nations' 193 member states to block any financial services or monetary transfers that 'could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear or ballistic missile programs.' It also adds a binding obligation on countries to 'not provide public financial support for trade with the DPRK' if it could in any way support North Korea's nuclear or missile work.

Kerry Kennedy was reportedly under the influence of the sleeping drug Ambien when she smashed into a tractor trailer rig then fled the scene on Friday. Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, who is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs when she was found slumped over the wheel of her car after a collision in Westchester County, New York. The collision comes just two months after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse. Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York . Heartbroken: Ms Kennedy speaking before the funeral of her best friend and sister-in-law, Mary Richardson Kennedy, in Bedford, New York in May . Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig . about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged . her car and left it with a flat tire. Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway. They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers. She apparently told police that she had taken prescription sleeping pills - said to include the drug Ambien - before the accident, according to WABC. After her arrest, Ms Kennedy was charged with driving while impaired with drugs. Political marriage: Ms Kennedy is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left . Family: Kerry with her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and his (now deceased) wife Mary at a gala event in 2006 . She is due to appear in court in North Castle on Tuesday. A spokesman for Ms Kennedy denied that she was under the influence. Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests – all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system. 'The charges were filed before the test results were available.' If Ms Kennedy is found to have been under the influence of Ambien, she could have a legal basis for combating the driving under the influence charge. Driving while intoxicated? Ms Kennedy says she had taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving' The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions. However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas. Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy. Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002 . Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign. She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010. The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage. Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

The Queen of Malaysia certainly agrees, if her gifts to the Duchess of Cambridge are anything to go by. When Kate visited last year, Her Majesty Raja Permaisuri Agong packed her off with no fewer than six designer pairs, as well as two clutch bags and a stunning traditional dress. Goodwill mission: William and Kate pose in traditional Island clothing as they visit Honiara, Guadalcanal Island on their Diamond Jubilee tour of the Far East on September 16, 2012 . Details of the extravagant presents lavished on Prince William and his wife during their Diamond Jubilee tour to South-East Asia and the South Pacific last September  – as well as those given to Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry on their trips abroad – were revealed yesterday by Clarence House and St James’s Palace (See below for full gift breakdown). The value of the presents is never specified – perhaps to avoid embarrassing the buyer – and some are described vaguely as jewellery or ‘ornaments’. Some will have cost little but may hold huge sentimental value, such as the ‘his and hers’ cardigans given to Charles and Camilla by the King and Queen of Norway. Harry is now the proud owner of his a personalised ‘HARRY’ car numberplate thanks to a well-wisher in Brazil, as well as a bottle of the country’s potent local brew known as Cachaca, or burning water, which is made from 80 per cent proof fermented sugarcane juice. It's a nice knife: This ornate ceremonial dagger was given to Prince William by the King of Malaysia . Clothes: Kate was given six pairs of shoes, two . clutch bags, left, and a traditional dress, right, Her Majesty, Raja . Permaisuri Agong of Malaysia . His sister-in-law Kate returned from Singapore, Malaysia and the South Pacific with six new pairs of shoes, eight handbags, six scarves, shawls and sarongs and several more dresses and blouses. One – a pink batik dress worn in the Solomon Islands – provoked controversy after it emerged that it had actually been made by a designer in the Cook Islands. Her husband’s presents included a golden Kris – an ornamental dagger – from His Majesty The Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. Tour: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, arrive at the Istana Negara, in Kuala Lumpur, prior to a official dinner with the King of Malaysia in September . In all, the couple brought home more than 200 presents, while the list of gifts given to globe-trotting Charles and Camilla runs to 18 pages. In Denmark, the Prince of Wales was given an environmentally friendly ‘bio fireplace’, as well as an armchair. His wife was particularly thrilled when, on a visit to the set of the country’s critically acclaimed crime drama The Killing, she was given a Faroese jumper by the show’s lead, Sofie Grabol. On a trip to Canada in May, the couple received e-readers, handbags and model canoes. They also received two dog bandanas for their pet Jack Russells, dozens of books and CDs and a pair of baseball caps. The couple also received dozens of other presents – including cuff-links, brooches and bags – from officials they met in Australia. They received nothing from the Commonwealth country’s republican prime minister Julia Gillard. They did, however, return home with two jars of Tasmanian honey, a merino wool sweater, a decorated emu egg and an opal cabochon – a highly-polished and shaped gem. On the November visit they were also given – rather presciently – a pair of baby booties for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple announced they were expecting their first child in December. Prince Harry’s first formal solo tour to  Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas saw him return home with several armfuls of goodies including a Mayan calendar, shell cuff-links, a polo stick and plenty more sports gear – including trainers and a specially designed T-shirt from the world’s fastest man, Usain Bolt. Fittingly, the prince – well-known for his love of a good night out – also received two bottles of rum, as well as six Brazilian rugby shirts, a friendship bracelet and a block of amethyst quartz. The giving and receiving of gifts is considered to be an important part of the Royal Family’s work in developing good relations with other countries – although courtiers are supposed to discourage the offering of presents of high monetary value. Any jewels received by members of the Royal Family are not, officially, considered to be their personal property, because otherwise they would be taxable. They are allowed to wear them during their lifetime, after which they are passed on to the monarch. He or she then decides whether they should be handed over to the Royal Collection, or loaned out.

He surreptitiously mentioned a total of 22 songs by the group on the four-part nightly BBC2 series this week. Packham gave his first hint what he was up to with his introduction to Monday's opening show when he announced he was wearing ""Baggy Trousers"", one of Madness's most successful records. Discussing the best places to spot rare breeds of bird on Wednesday he said: ""My Uncle Sam, he lives in NW5,"" name-checking two lesser-known singles - Uncle Sam and NW5 - in one sentence. And in the same episode, sly Chris managed to mention ""Tarzan's Nuts"", the band's most obscure number, which was released only in the Netherlands, by saying: ""These squirrels out there swinging in the trees like little Tarzans. Nuts is what they're after."" Yet incredibly he failed to fit in the Suggs-fronted group's only UK number one chart-topper, House Of Fun. Scroll down for video .

When it came to her parting sentiments after eight years of employment, typist Jennifer Barkess chose not to mince words. The 64-year-old was upset that Derby City Council had turned down her request for voluntary redundancy and then asked her to take on the work of two others who had been allowed to leave. In a fit of rage, she decided to resign then set up an out-of-office reply which said: 'No longer work for the council, p*** off the lot of you'. Upset: Former council typist Jennifer Barkess said she left the out-of-office email because she hadn't been given voluntary redundancy by Derby City Council . It is understood thousands of people received the email, both at the council and elsewhere. But it didn't stop there. After walking out on January 10, Ms Barkess then sent another group email, calling one member of staff 'a lump of canine excrement'. It said: 'I am told to do the work of people who have got voluntary redundancy, it ain’t gonna happen.' Ms Barkess has since apologised to council chief executive Adam Wilkinson and says she regrets her actions. She said: 'We were told before Christmas we could contact the chief executive if we weren't happy if we were told we couldn't go. 'On the actual day I blew up I was told I had to do the work of the girls that had been granted voluntary redundancy. I got a phonecall and I said 'I'm not doing it'. I said I'm resigning as of now.

My head was going round and round, I'd gone to work on a normal day, I hadn't wanted to go but I've always been a grafter. But half an hour after that I was out. I know I wasn't thinking logically. 'Voluntary redundancy was very important to me, by that stage I was desperate to away from the council.  I'm so glad I'm not working for them any more.' Regret: Jennifer Barkess said she 'wasn't thinking logically' when she sent the email telling thousands of colleagues to p*** off . Ms Barkess, from Spondon, Derbyshire, . who worked in the adults, health and housing department, said her . application for voluntary redundancy was turned down because of 'demands . on the service'. She said: 'I hadn’t enjoyed it for a long time. 'I . always intended to work until I was 65, which was in July, but it (the . voluntary redundancy package) would have paid my wages to cover me so I . could leave earlier. 'They . made two girls in another team redundant and told me to do the work . they would have been doing if they hadn’t taken voluntary redundancy.'

A young soldier hanged himself the day after the funeral of a fallen comrade whose killer he shot dead, an inquest heard yesterday. Ryan Ward, 20, had gunned down an Afghan policeman who had killed two of his colleagues in a 'shocking and horrible' ambush. He had later gone to pay his last respects to Sgt Gareth Thursby, 29, at his funeral in Skipton, just 24 hours before his own death, the hearing was told. Soldier Ryan Ward hanged himself the day after the funeral of a fallen comrade whose killer he shot dead, the inquest heard .

A rogue Afghan policeman pretended to be injured in the road so they would help him, but then opened fire on the pair. Kingsman Ward reacted swiftly and 'appropriately' by killing the Afghan police officer. It . was one of a string of 'blue on green' incidents where police officers, . supposedly loyal to the Afghan government, have instead turned their . guns on British soldiers. Kingsman . Ward, who served in Alma Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, . had gone to the funeral of Sgt Thursby on October 26. The next day he was found hanged by his mother at the family home in Kendal, Cumbria. Sergeant Gareth Thursby, left, and Private Thomas Wroe, right, who were killed in the ambush by the Afghan policeman shot dead by Ryan Ward . But the inquest at Kendal Magistrates' Court heard his death was 'inexplicable' as Kingsman Ward had shown little, if any, signs of distress at what had happened in Afghanistan. Kathryn Ward said her son appeared himself and did not talk about the incident when he returned to the UK in October last year, and it 'never entered my head' that he may take his own life. Hours before his death he had spoken to an Army colleague via Facebook to arrange meeting up and had bought some new army boots. And there was nothing troubling him financially or in his private life with girlfriends, the hearing was told. The inquest heard Private Ward had been deployed to Afghanistan in April and that he 'thrived in his job' (file picture) Major Finlay Bibby told the inquest Kingsman, or Private, Ward had deployed to Afghanistan in April and that he 'thrived in his job' before giving details of the fatal incident in Helmand. He said: 'It was a shooting that took place that he witnessed, of two of our soldiers that subsequently died, and Ryan reacted by shooting the shooter.' Maj Bibby told the court Kingsman Ward went through a process of risk assessment, monitoring and interviewing to assess his response to what he had witnessed and done. He had also gone to Cyprus with other soldiers on the way back to the UK for a period of 'unwinding' and 'decompression' with a 'day on the beach' and beers with his colleagues, the Major said. 'There were no signs,' he added, 'in fact there were positive signs, he talked about re-deployment.' But Kingsman Ward's father, Richard Ward, told the inquest of an incident just a month before his son's death, which suggested some problems. He said: 'He showed signs he was stressed, I have never seen that before, since he was a young lad, arms behind his back, shuffling, looking at the floor.' Mr Ward said he asked his son how he was feeling and told him he had to 'be strong' and 'shake it off'. 'He put his hands around me and gave me a kiss,' Mr Ward added. 'He was absolutely in my opinion stressed out. He hugged me and said, ""Thanks Dad.""' Mr Ward said his son's mood appeared to improve in the following weeks and agreed he found his death a 'shock and surprise'. 'There's just no explanation,' he added. 'It is different from a suicide because the decision to end it all is just not capable of being seen from the evidence heard' - Coroner Ian Smith . Ian Smith, coroner for South and East Cumbria, said: 'He was involved in a truly shocking and potentially traumatic incident in Afghanistan. He did his role apparently admirably. He did what he should have done and did not crack up under the stress of that truly shocking incident he was involved in. 'The Army took appropriate measures afterwards. 'There is certainly no expectation he might self-harm, and yet he did.' Mr Smith said he would record a verdict that Kingsman Ward died as a consequence of his own actions - not a suicide. He added: 'He did what he did, but we have no idea why he did it or what his intentions were. 'I'm not going to infer intentions, there would have to be a clear note, there's nothing of that at all. It is different from a suicide because the decision to end it all is just not capable of being seen from the evidence heard.' He told Kingsman Ward's parents: 'I'm sorry I can't answer what was going through your son's mind, but nobody will ever know I'm afraid.'","Ryan Ward, 20, shot Afghan policeman who killed two colleagues in ambush .

The image of James Bond's creator Ian Fleming is set to be shaken and stirred by a £4million TV drama exposing the dark side of the bestselling author's glamorous lifestyle. The Man Who Would Be Bond will show how the novelist turned his wartime experiences working for Naval Intelligence into one of the most lucrative literary franchises ever produced. But it will also reveal details of his X-rated sex life, which led to him being thrown out of the prestigious military academy Sandhurst after he contracted gonorrhea. Legend: Ian Fleming's life story is set to hit TV screens this autumn in The Man Who Would Be Bond . Actor Dominic Cooper will play Fleming in the four-part series, which begins filming next week and will air on Sky Atlantic in the autumn. The drama will also feature the author's own collection of 'Bond girls', above all his socialite wife Ann Charteris, who will be played by Lara Pulver. It will draw on the couple's sexually explicit letters to each other, in which they discussed their obsession with kinky behaviour such as flagellation. Both Fleming and his wife had countless affairs with other people. Womaniser: The author with his wife Ann Charteris; the series will document their rocky relationship . ‘It tells the story of how Fleming desperately wanted to be someone he couldn’t be, so he created the person he wanted to be on the page and that person was James Bond,’ said an executive involved with the production. The TV series will also explore Fleming’s complex relationship with his mother - who once forced him to break off an engagement because she disliked his fiancée - and with other women in his life. Mr Cooper, who starred in Alan Bennett’s play The History Boys as well as its film adaptation, plus movies Mamma Mia! and An Education, will portray Fleming from the late 1920s, when he failed as a stockbroker but transformed himself into a successful lothario. He was a talented linguist - enabling him to chat up women in four languages. Hit: Fleming with the first James Bond actor Sean Connery on the set of Dr No in 1962 . But he found his true vocation when he was commissioned as a lieutenant commander and became assistant to the director of Naval Intelligence. His boss, Admiral John Godfrey, was to become the model for M in the Bond novels. Many of the counter-intelligence operations Fleming was involved in during the Second World War found their way into his 007 thrillers. The author wrote his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952. A heavy drinker and smoker, he died of a heart attack in 1964, aged 56. Stars: The Sky Atlantic series will feature Dominic Cooper, left, as Fleming with Lara Pulver, right, playing Ann . Franchise: Daniel Craig in Skyfall, the latest James Bond film which has grossed $1billion worldwide . Filming on the story of his life starts next week on location in Budapest, London and Jamaica, the Caribbean island where Fleming built his dream home Goldeneye . The house was named after the code-word for one of his wartime operations, and would later become the title of a Bond movie. In a statement, Mr Cooper said he has always been a huge Bond fan. ’To play a world icon like Ian Fleming is a great challenge for an actor,' he said. 'I’m really excited to have the opportunity to bring him to life.’ The current Bond film, Skyfall, has taken a record-breaking £110million at the UK box office alone, and over $1billion globally. It has been nominated for several Bafta awards and five Oscars.","New TV series set to show the dark side of best-selling spy novelist .

Doctors are fighting to save the sight of the artistic director of Russia's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet after an acid attack on a Moscow street. Sergei Filin, a 42-year-old former Bolshoi star, said a man threw the acid into his face late on Thursday evening near the gate of his apartment building. The dancer is thought to have suffered weeks of personal harassment ahead of the attack, apparently at the hands of feuding performers and their supporters. The historic theatre, first opened in 1776, is known for its bitter, ego-driven disputes, with some describing the situation as 'gangsterism'. Scroll down for video . Gangsterism: Sergei Filin, 42, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, was the victim of an acid attack. He was interviewed from the Moscow hospital where he is being treated, left, after the incident . The attacker wore a hood and either a mask or a scarf, so only his eyes were visible, he said. 'I got scared and I thought he was going to shoot me,' Filin, his face covered with white bandages, told REN TV. 'I turned around to run, but he raced ahead of me.' Bolshoi spokeswoman Yekaterina Novikova said Filin would be flown to a . specialist burns centre in Brussels later today after an urgent . operation on his eyes. First Channel TV said doctors were 'trying to preserve his eyesight.' She told Channel One that Filin had received threats before and that they suspect that that he fell victim to the notorious infighting and rows between different groups of dancers and managers at the theatre. 'We never imagined that a war for . roles - not for real estate or for oil - could reach this level of . crime,' she said. The theatre in the heart of Moscow is an enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals and foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers and directors during its more than 200-year history. Treatment: The artistic director of the Bolshoi ballet Sergei Filin was interviewed at the hospital in Moscow where he is being treated . Prestigious career: Sergei Filin in 2011 with the then president Dmitry Medvedev and his wife Svetlana attending a gala opening of the Bolshoi in Moscow . The Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow. As a symbol of Russian culture for more than 200 years, it is a big draw for both locals and foreign tourists, and has seen power struggles among both dancers and directors throughout its history. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of those conflicts, whether driven by egos or artistic convictions, have been played out in public. After the tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in 1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before Filin's appointment. In 2003 Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, dismissed ballerina Anastasia Volochkova after reportedly saying she was too heavy for male dancers to lift, and in 2011 a senior ballet manager resigned after a scandal over sexually explicit photographs. Filin, a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic director in March 2011. Sergei Filin, a former leading dancer at the Bolshoi who has been in the high-pressure job at the heart of Russian culture for nearly two years, was attacked outside his Moscow apartment building as he returned from the theatre late on Thursday. Filin, a Moscow native, joined the . Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic leader in . March 2011, after three years in a similar position at another Moscow . theatre. There was 'fierce rivalry' for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to RIA Novosti. Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry. Filin had already reported having his car tyres slashed and his emails hacked, as well as receiving repeated nuisance calls from someone who stayed silent when he answered. 'He said, `I have a feeling that I am on the front lines,'' Iksanov quoted Filin as telling him Thursday before the attack. The culprit should be sought among those for whom it was beneficial to compromise the theatre leadership', Iksanov told reporters. 'This two-week campaign has ended tragically and despicably,"" he said. Iksanov said Filin had told him he believed he had been followed home, and that the attacker had called him by name before throwing acid on his face. 'There are very serious burns on his . face, in his ears, his forehead, his mouth, and of course there are . serious concerns about his eyesight,' he said. Filin's mother, Natalya, said he had . been threatened but that she did not know who could have been behind the . attack, state-run RIA news agency reported. 'What's important to me now is the health of my son, that he not lose his eyesight,' she said.

Through the telescopic sights of their sniper rifles the marksmen of Algeria’s Special Forces watched as exhausted, frightened foreign hostages were pushed through the wooden doorway of the block where they had been sheltering towards a fleet of jeeps. Some would have had a clear shot at the Jihadist kidnappers from the ‘Blood Battalion’ but no order was given to open fire when the convoy started moving. Instead, heavily armed gunships opened fire on the speeding vehicles - hitting and destroying four and causing a fifth to spin over and to crash. Scroll down for video . Two of the vehicles exploded and . another burst into a ‘ball of flames.’  It was a scene of carnage with . bullets flying, explosions, fires, smoke billowing into the clear bright . blue sky. 'There were bodies everywhere,’ one witness said, ‘the Algerian forces were firing at anything that moved.’ One was blown several feet into the air. Few, if anyone, could have survived, witnesses said. Patrol: Algerian soldiers patrolling in the desert at an undisclosed location in the south of the country. This week's air attack left 35 kidnappers and 15 hostages dead . Deadly: It was unclear whether the cars were struck by missiles fired from helicopters or by ground forces, but the air attack was deadly . The horrific details of the immediate . aftermath of Thursday’s assault on the gas plant emerged yesterday from . Algerian hostages and the family of Stephen McFaul, of West Belfast, . who was in the vehicle that crashed and had explosives tied around his . neck. Exactly why the Algerians opened fired on 4x4 wheel vehicles packed with hostages and terrorists remains a mystery. The Algerians said the kidnappers . were ‘making a run’ for it but with the barren Sahara desert stretching . for hundreds of miles around the sprawling BP gas plant, there was . nowhere to go. Amazingly, Mr McFaul a 36-year-old father-of-two, was able to sprint to safety at the height. The electrical engineer told his . family he had narrowly escaped death twice - first when bound and gagged . by the gunmen who fastened explosives around the hostages’ necks and . then in the convoy of five vehicles driving across the complex. Questions: The attack suggests either a lapse in stringent security at the base, or an emboldening of Islamist insurgents . ‘(The gunmen) were moving five jeeploads of hostages from one part of the compound,’ his brother Brian McFaul said. ‘At that stage, they were intercepted by the Algerian army. ‘The army bombed four out of five of . the trucks and four of them were destroyed ... He presumed everyone else . in the other trucks was killed ... The truck my brother was in crashed . and at that stage Stephen was able to make a break for his freedom.’ Hostages were used as human shields . as, in the space of minutes, the hostage crisis had gone from one of . containment and negotiation to a bloodbath and running battles. Dozens of desperate foreign and . Algerian workers had found hiding places when the kidnappers had stormed . the complex in what appeared a well planned operation - their ease of . movement and familiarity with the vast complex suggestion an ‘inside . knowledge.’ Remote: The In Salah gas project is located in the Sahara desert in Algeria. Although the desert complex was heavily guarded, it is vulnerable to attack due its lone proximity . At least three Britons found a . sanctuary in the ceiling of the canteen area only emerging yesterday . when they were sure Algerian forces had regained control of the area. One French hostage, Alexandre . Berceaux, who works for the CIS catering company, said he hid in a room . away from other foreign hostages, arranging planks of wood to conceal . his presence. ‘I stayed hidden for nearly 40 hours in my bedroom, under the bed,’ he said. ‘When the military came to get me, I . did not know whether it was over,’ he added. ‘They arrived with . colleagues (Algerians who worked with him), otherwise I would never have . opened the door.’ Bloodbath: Helicopters began strafing the plant in In Amenas (above) this morning, hours after the rebels had threatened to blow up the hostages if they intervened . Berceaux said Algerian soldiers found . some British hostages hiding on the roof and were still combing the . sprawling gas site for others when he was escorted to a nearby military . base. ‘They are still counting them up,’ he said. Many had been in hiding at the . supposedly secure and well energy facility, which produces some 10 per . cent of the natural gas on which Algeria depends for its export income, . since the militants moved-in on Wednesday morning. Anger: Prime Minister David Cameron gives his statement to the House of Commons on the hostage crisis in Algeria today, and revealed that 'less than 30' Britons are still at risk from the terrorists . Survivors: Four British workers who have escaped the Algerian refinery taken over by Al Qaeda have spoken for the first time about their ordeal . More than 600 Algerians work on the complex and it became clear quickly they were not the targets. An Algerian engineer, Khaled, said : . ‘I heard gunfire, sustained shooting. Then the guy who was clearly the . head of the armed group spoke to us. He said he was called Abu al-Baraa . and he said he would let us go quickly. It was the foreigners who . interested them, they only wanted them. 'The Islamists left us our phones so . we could call our families. But quite quickly it became impossible to . contact anyone. Someone told me they had freed the women, but I didn’t . see that. Map locates the In Amenas natural gas facility in eastern Algeria . ‘The women who work on the site are . mostly interpreters. Later in the morning there was an assault. I was in . the games room at the time. There was a lot of pushing and shoving, . some people managed to open the security door, and we all just ran for . it.’ Another Algerian added : ‘It was clear they would not harm Muslims, they wanted Christians and infidels.’ Brahim, an Algerian technician employed by BP, said the Algerian workers were held separately from the foreigners. During Wednesday night, Brahim said, . he and his colleagues helped threee foreign members of staff escape . through a wire fence into the safer Algerian side of the compound. ‘We hid them and reassured them. The . first skirmishes between the Algerian army and the terrorists came at . about 1pm on the Thursday. ‘Despite our fear, from the beginning . of the shooting we decided to try our luck. We cut the wire fence with . clippers, and ran for it, all together, 50 or so of us with the three . foreigners. ‘We were welcomed by the special . forces who were only a few dozen metres from the base. I didn’t look . back. The only thing I saw was a plane overflying the site. The army . frisked us and questioned us, then we were handed over to the gendarmes . who took us to In Amenas airport.’ Around 40 international hostages were . taken and the Jihadists are said to have appeared confident and ‘not . afraid to die’ as they made their initial demand that French military . action stop in Mali and Algeria stop allowing warplanes to use its . airspace to bomb Al Qaeda-linked rebels. Clearly, they expected expected to . negotiate, Abu al-Baraa, the chief hostage taker, taking to the Al .

Al-Baraa, who is now thought to have . been killed, also used his mobile phone to speak to military commanders . gathering in the area, saying he would ‘spare’ all those held in return . for a series of demands. These ranged from Islamist prisoners . being released, to the terrorist gang being allowed a safe passage to . neighbouring Mali, and an end to French military action. The Algerians said yesterday the . Islamists were a mixture of nationalities - the 18 militants so far . found dead have included three Egyptians, two Tunisians, two Libyans, a .

During . the two-week trial, the jury heard Dent had a history of drug use going . back many years and was prescribed methadone to try to rid her of the . habit.

Binfield . told the court he forgot to move the cup because he had got caught up . with putting the family bins out and the childcare routine after getting . up on March 13. He fought back tears as he admitted he missed three opportunities to move the cup, which the child must have managed to get hold of and drink from. Prosecutor Yvonne Coen QC asked him: 'It’s not the possibility then that you thought to yourself ‘Ah, the methadone’s in there still but it’s safe’, or are you saying ‘I never even thought about the methadone at all’?' Binfield answered: 'I never even thought about it.' Dent called 999 and paramedics arrived at the house to find Riley lifeless. His heart had stopped beating and his lips were blue, the court heard. The child was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after arriving and post-mortem tests showed that Riley had enough methadone in his blood, stomach and urine to prove fatal. He is believed to have consumed between 10ml and 20ml of methadone, the court heard. Heartbreak: Tributes were left outside the flat in Belper, Derbyshire, where Riley Pettipierre died soon after paramedics were called to the flat last year . The jury took just four hours to convict Dent and Binfield of manslaughter at Nottingham Crown Court. Dent was also found guilty of a separate charge of cruelty to a child under the age of 16 for failing to keep methadone out of the reach of her child. Following her conviction, the court heard Dent had previous convictions for possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply, assault and prostitution. Judge Milmo adjourned sentencing until February 19 at Nottingham Crown Court. Following the conviction, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Cox, of the East Midlands major crime unit, who was the investigating officer in the case, said: 'Our sympathy goes out to everyone in Riley’s family. 'The tragic death of this little boy was entirely avoidable. Methadone is a highly dangerous drug which never should have been put in a child’s beaker. 'Drugs such as this should always be locked away and kept well out of the reach of children.'","Riley Pettipierre died after drinking the heroin substitute at his family's flat in Belper, Derbyshire, last March .

'Died of shock': WWII veteran Raymond Grinyer, 85, died of a heart attack hours after discovering his home had been burgled . A war hero who fought the Japanese died after discovering burglars had ransacked his home and stolen his treasured campaign medals. Second World War veteran Raymond Grinyer, 85, shook with shock, wept and struggled to breathe after finding his house had been repeatedly raided. The great-grandfather was taken to hospital but had a heart attack only hours later, surrounded by his distraught family. The burglars stole the medals Mr Grinyer had risked his life to earn and a diamond eternity ring he had given his wife Ann, 83, to mark their 60th wedding anniversary. Mr and Mrs Grinyer were staying with relatives over Christmas when their home in Romford, Essex, was broken into. The thieves forced open a back window at the home some time between December 26 and January 6 and the family suspect they returned repeatedly to loot the unguarded property. They also stole passports, bank cards, jewellery, piggy banks containing cash for the couple’s grandchildren and £3,500 in cash. Mr Grinyer’s son, Raymond Junior, 55, of Romford, was with his parents when they discovered the break-in. He said: ‘It was sickening. They had gone through everything. My dad sobbed his heart out. He was very agitated. Then he began to look unwell. When the paramedics came they could hardly find a pulse. The shock of it killed him.’ Mr Grinyer, a former fire station officer in Hornsey, North London, was taken to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, on January 6 before being transferred to the London Chest Hospital, East London. But he died in the early hours of January 7 after a heart attack. A serviceman: Mr Grinyer was stationed in Japan during WWII before going on to become a fire station officer, pictured, in Hornsey, north London . His daughter Valerie Ribbons, 49, of Thurrock, Essex, said: ‘Our dad did not die peacefully, that’s what’s so hard to come to terms with. ‘He had a troubled death and was in a heightened state of anxiety and immensely distressed when he found the house had been burgled. ‘I don’t think any of us will rest until the burglars are caught. ‘My dad had done nothing to them apart from fight for their freedom. This is just so undeserved and unfair.’ Mr Grinyer, an army signaller, fought the Japanese with General William Slim’s 14th ‘Forgotten’ Army in Indonesia, Burma and Malaysia. He was stationed in Japan after it surrendered in August 1945 following the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mr Grinyer, who raised money for charities in his spare time, had made an emotionally-charged 12,000-mile round trip to his old base at Iwakuni in Japan last October under the Lottery-funded Heroes Return 2 scheme.

A Liberal Democrat MEP has been severely condemned by Nick Clegg for a ‘sick and offensive’ tweet saying terrorists had won a victory against David Cameron over the Algerian hostage crisis. Sir Graham Watson, who represents the south west of England in the European Parliament, took to Twitter to say: ‘Al Qaeda 1, @David_Cameron 0’. It was a reference to the Prime Minister’s decision late last night to cancel a much-trailed speech in Amsterdam on Britain’s future in Europe, so he could be in Downing Street to deal with the unfolding hostage situation. Lib Dem MEP Sir Graham Watson sparked a furious reaction with his tweet, and was heavily criticised by party leader Nick Clegg . Provocative: Sir Graham Watson's Tweet which mocked the Prime Minister for postponing his speech to focus on rescuing British nationals from Algeria . Sir Graham, a former aide to ex-Liberal leader David Steel, was forced to apologise after Mr Clegg reprimanded him for the tweet, which a party spokesman said was ‘wholly inappropriate and offensive.’ Mr Clegg was ‘furious’, the spokesman said. ‘It's clearly sick and offensive and is utterly condemned by Nick Clegg.’ Users of Twitter called for Sir Graham’s resignation over the ‘disgusting’ message. Last night Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘This tweet is revealing. It shows what the federalist fanatics really think. ‘They are so obsessed about protecting their great European project, that they can’t even see common sense.’ The offensive tweet was an apparent jibe at Mr Cameron's decision to postpone his planned trip to Amsterdam, where he was due to deliver a long-awaited speech on Europe yesterday morning. Instead of being in Amsterdam to deliver his speech, Mr Cameron left Downing Street this morning to deliver a statement on Algeria in the Commons, with chief of staff Ed Llewellyn . But late on Thursday, the speech was postponed so Mr Cameron could stay in Downing Street to deal with the hostage crisis in Algeria. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Graham defended his tweet. ‘It's a great shame that the prime minister has postponed the speech that he's allowed to become so over-hyped,’ he said. But later, he sent another tweet, saying: ‘I wish to apologise profusely for the insensitive tweet I issued earlier. I have taken it down.’ Sir Graham represents south-west England and Gibraltar in the European Parliament. He is also president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, which consists of more than 50 liberal parties from across Europe. The Scottish-born son of a Royal Navy officer and a teacher served as head of the then Liberal leader David Steel’s private office between 1983 and 1987. The offensive tweet was sent at a highly-sensitive moment in the hostage crisis, amid reports up to 30 foreign hostages are dead after a helicopter air strike by Algerian forces on the BP gas plant seized by Al Qaeda-linked terrorists led by veteran jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar (pictured) He then worked for HSBC in their London and Hong Kong offices for six years, before becoming the first Lib Dem to be elected to the European Parliament. In October 2011, the father-of-two was knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours. On his website he boasts of being able to speak four European languages, and that he is currently learning Mandarin Chinese. His tweet attracted anger on Twitter. Conservative blogger and broadcaster Iain Dale said Sir Graham was a ‘disgrace’, adding: ‘What a disgusting thing to do.’ Twitter user @Biltawulf wrote: ‘Unelectable insensitive idiot. You just turned people's families into a football score.’ And @hughbs, tweeted: ‘Sorry, apology not accepted. You have revealed just how petty and self-serving you really are. Hope electorate will judge.’ Last night a Labour source said: ‘He’s been incredibly stupid. It was right that he apologised, and he should be more cautious in future.’","Sir Graham Watson took to Twitter to mock the Prime Minister for postponing Europe speech .

The world's largest auction house Christie's saw record sales of £3.9billion last year, boosted by a growing demand in contemporary art. The London-based auction house saw sales of works by post-war and living artists grow 33 per cent in 2012, as it set a company record for the third successive year. Among the works behind last year's boom for the company, which saw sales rise by ten per cent on last year, was Mark Rothko's Orange, Red, Yellow, which fetched a record £53.8m, and Claude Monet's Nympheas, which sold for $43m. Rothko's Orange, Red, Yellow (left) sold for £53.8m while Andy Warhol's Statue Of Liberty (right) fetched $43.7m as Christie's saw record sales last year . Francis Bacon's 'Portrait of Henrietta Moraes' was among the works which helped boost Christie's sales by ten per cent in 2012 . Steven Murphy, the first American to head the auctioneer since its creation in 1766, said the key to future success relied on a broad pool of art lovers. The 58-year-old said: 'One of the things that is driving the opportunity for a company like Christie's is cultural. 'There is a huge cultural surge around the world toward the experience of art. 'Museum attendance is way up on the previous year and the year before that... People are accessing art on their iPads, on their laptops, on their iPhones.' The overall increase in 2012 came despite a slump in Christie's auction sales of Asian art, which fell by a quarter to £415m after providing the engine for growth in recent years. The auction house has said its sales were boosted by a surge around the world 'toward the experience of art' Competition from Chinese auctioneers and the end to a speculative bubble in some Asian art contributed to the decline, but Mr Murphy said the region had the potential to grow again longer term. In contrast, Christie's saw private sales surge 26 per cent to £631m, and Mr Murphy expected deals behind closed doors to be key in maintaining growth in 2013 and beyond. He said: 'Look for a big increase in our private sales activity. 'Our current clients want to do more of that.' A key part of Mr Murphy's strategy since arriving has been to build its online presence, both by attracting visitors to the website and encouraging them to bid over the internet. Claude Monet's Nympheas, which was the second most expensive item sold at Chrsitie's last year when it went for $43.7m . From six online-only auctions in 2012, the company will hold more than 30 in 2013, and while digital sales tend to be for more modestly priced items, Edward Hopper's 'October on Cape Cod' sold for $9.6 million to an internet bidder in November. By expanding its online presence, Christie's aims to capture more business in the mid to lower-tier markets, away from the multi-million-dollar deals that grab the headlines. Murphy pointed to a 20 per cent rise in sales at Christie's South Kensington offices, which specialise in lower-end art and antiques.

The husband of an Indian dentist who died after she suffered a miscarriage in Ireland said his late wife is giving him the strength to fight for the truth. Savita Halappanavar died in hospital on October 28 last year from suspected septicaemia. The 31-year-old's husband, Praveen, said after her inquest was opened: 'It's not easy to sit there in the court to see all the proceedings. 'I believe I'm getting that strength from somewhere to look forward. 'I suppose I believe it is coming from Savita. She was that type of a person. She was always there for me so I'm getting the strength from that.' He claims that doctors at Galway University Hospital refused to carry out . an abortion 17 weeks into her pregnancy because a foetal heartbeat was . present. He says they were told Ireland 'is a Catholic country'. As the inquest into Mrs Halappanava's death today, the Coroner for Galway city, Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin, promised her husband that her inquest will be transparent and open to public scrutiny. He offered his condolences to Mr Halappanavar and vowed to conduct the hearing with solemn respect, dignity and courtesy to him and to the memory of his 'beloved Savita'. Dr MacLoughlin said: 'It is my duty as coroner to ensure that the inquiry shall be independent, effective and prompt - that the procedures are open, transparent and accountable and are subject to public scrutiny.' He also added that her next of kin would be involved to an appropriate extent.

'I'm getting strength from that' Grieving husband: Pictured on their wedding day, Mrs Halappanavar's husband Praveen Halappanavar begged doctors at Galway University Hospital to terminate the pregnancy after she began miscarrying and now refuses to assist investigators . The hearing, which is expected to last more than a week, will begin on April 8 at Galway Courthouse. Dr MacLoughlin was told 48 statements have already been furnished by health chiefs and gardai, with six more to be ready within a week. However, John O'Donnell, junior counsel for Mr Halappanavar, raised concerns about two more witnesses who have not, and may not, be able to assist the inquest due to personal difficulties. The pair, who had written in the patient's hospital records, have been unable to give statements for confidential reasons which were recognised and accepted by the coroner. Speaking about his wife's final moments, last month, . Mr Halappanavar said: ‘In the night, at around one o'clock, the nurse . came running, as I was standing outside ICU. ‘She just told me to be brave, and she took me near Savita, and she said: “Will you be ok to be there, living her last minutes? ‘I said: “Yes, I want to”. I was holding . her hand, they were trying to pump her heart, there was a big team . around. The doctor just told me they lost her.’ Devastated: Praveen Halappanavar (pictured with his wife Savita at their home in Galway) says he watched helplessly as she died from blood poisoning from a miscarriage after doctors refused to perform an abortion . Mr Halappanavar, who works as an . engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, came to Ireland from India with . his wife four years ago to start a new life together. She had a job in . Westport, Co Mayo and the pair lived in Galway city. They were so excited about the expected . birth of their first child, which was due on March 20, that they had an . early baby shower in recent weeks when Mrs Halappanavar’s parents were . visiting. But their world began to fall apart, . when Mrs Halappanavar’s back pain worsened and she was forced to seek . medical help at University Hospital Galway on the morning of Sunday . October 21. After routine tests the young mother-to-be was told everything was fine and the couple were sent home. But within an hour of returning, Mrs Halappanavar was positive something was wrong after using the bathroom. Refused begging: Doctors at Galway University Hospital (pictured) refused Mrs Halappanavar refused an abortion because she was 'in a Catholic country' and the foetus's heartbeat was still present . ‘She was in tears, she was in shock,’ said Mr Halappanavar. ‘So immediately we rushed back to the hospital.’ After similar tests again showed up nothing unusual, Mrs Halappanavar asked to be seen by a doctor. Following a more in-depth examination, . she was told around noon that there had been a cervical dilation and the . medics would not be able to save the baby. The pair were told it would all be over . in four to five hours, and then the dentist could go home. But she . remained in agony and two days later her health began to sharply . deteriorate. Happy couple: Savita and her husband Praveen dancing at 2010 Diwali festival in Galway, video from YouTube . ‘On Tuesday night, things really started . getting worse... All of a sudden Savita started feeling cold, she . started shivering terribly,’ said Mr Halappanavar. She was taken into the hospital's high dependency unit before being transferred to intensive care. By Friday morning, Mr Halappanavar was . asked by a midwife if he had told wife’s family, who were travelling . back to India, about the severity of her condition. She had not wanted . to worry them until they returned home. ‘I just told them she is still in the . hospital and that she is fine, she is doing well. I only told them about . the miscarriage,’ said Mr Halappanavar, speaking to RTE from Belgaum, in . Karnataka, in south west India. ‘But (the midwife) said you have to tell . them that she is critically ill. She said it is better that her parents . and all her family know about it.’ In the early hours of Sunday, October 28, Mrs Halappanavar died. Mr Halappanavar said he believed his wife, a Hindu, would have survived if she had been given an abortion. Tribute: People light candles in Galway after the 31-year-old's death . Campaigning for change: Thousands took to the streets of Dublin to pay tribute to Mrs Halappanavar and demanded changes to abortion laws in Ireland . It is believed one of the areas the . hospital's Risk Review Group will investigate is the experience of the . consultant who oversaw the case. ‘Savita was in agony,’ he added. ‘She was very upset, but she accepted she was losing the baby. 'When the consultant came on the ward . rounds, Savita asked if they could not save the baby, could they induce . to end the pregnancy. ‘The consultant said, “As long as there is a foetal heartbeat we can’t do anything”.’ He said he had gone from being ‘on top of the world’ to having his world torn apart in just days.

Hervàs, who is the creative and art . director of Advertising firm JWT Barcelona, is believed to have created the images through Photoshop, leaving audiences perplexed. Shadow of his former self: Catalan photographer Pol Úbeda Hervàs said a couple of experiences left him unsure of himself to the point he didn't recognise himself in photos .

'I’m Not There' is an ongoing series of portraits by Hervàs who divides his time between his work at the Barcelona advertising agency and photography. Hervàs doesn't explain the nature of the experiences that forced him to question his own identity, but he wrote a few lines that accompany the images, in which he says: I am changing at this very moment of my life. I do not react in the same ways I used to. These pictures are the way I see myself now.' Neither does he say whether his choice to leave shoes rather than any other item of clothing was a conscious one. Shoes, according to psychologists reveal much about the wearer's personality. Last year psychologists from the University of . Kansas found that the style, . value, colour and condition of the footwear can paint a picture of the . owner's emotional, political and other vital personality traits. 63 students from the university looked at photographs showing 208 different . pairs of shoes belonging to volunteers in the experiment.

David Cameron revealed that 'less . than 30' British workers are unaccounted for as he gave terrifying . details of the 'ongoing' hostage crisis in the Saharan desert. It is now . understood that 12 Britons are among the casualties. In an extraordinary development, Algeria today refused repeated offers of help to bring its worst terror attack on Westerners under control. But the Prime Minister is to send specialist Met Police negotiators and SAS forces to the capital city Algiers in the hope Britain can step in. Norway, who also has citizens caught up in the crisis, will be sending its own special forces to the BP plant, regardless of whether the Algerians agree to it, as the situation could continue for days, sources say. Siege: Algerian forces are believed to have struck after the Al Qaeda gunmen reinforced their position around a liquid gas installation (file picture) Under siege: An aerial shot of the Amenas Gas Field in Algeria, which is jointly operated by BP and Norway's Statoil and Algeria's Sonatrach . In a statement to MPs the Prime Minister blasted the Algerian government for staging the secret 'all guns blazing' rescue mission despite offers of SAS help and his demands to be told of any operation that could put British lives at risk. 'We were disappointed not to be informed of this in advance... this is a large and complex site and they are still pursuing terrorists and possibly some of the hostages in other areas of the site,' he said. ‘I offered UK technical and intelligence support – including from experts in hostage negotiation and rescue - to help find a successful resolution. And I urged that we and other countries affected should be consulted before any action was taken. The Prime Minister said a terrorist group believed to be operating under Mokhtar Belmokhtar launched a ''well calculated heavily armed' assault on buses en route to the airfield at In Amenas before attacking the residential compound and gas facility. Two of those travelling in the convoy to the airfield were killed, including a Briton. Scene: The plant is located in In Amenas, around 60 miles from the Libyan border and 800 miles from the capital in Algeria's vast desert south . 'According to the information we have . from the Algerian authorities, the terrorists first attacked two buses . en route to the In Amenas airfield before attacking the residential . compound and the gas facility at the installation,' he said. 'It appears to have been a large, well-co-ordinated and heavily armed assault and it is probable that it had been pre-planned. 'Two of those travelling in the . convoy to the airfield were, very sadly, killed, including one British . national and his family were informed on Wednesday. 'A number of other workers were taken . hostage by the terrorists in separate locations, both at the . residential compound and the gas facility. 'The precise numbers involved remain . unclear at this stage but the hostages included British nationals, along . with nationals of at least seven other countries and, of course, many . Algerians.' BP, the joint operator of the gas . plant, has also begun evacuating staff from Algeria, with 11 being flown . back to London yesterday. 'There is perhaps more we need to do . to make sure the companies have a really good up-to-date list of not . only the people who work for them but also of subcontractors,' he said. 'On this occasion there were some issues and difficulties with that.' 'We will continue to do everything we . can to hunt the people down who are responsible for this and for other . such terrorist outrages'. In the worst terror attack on Britons . since 7/7, the UK has been plunged into a diplomatic crisis when at . least 30 hostages were killed in the Sahara Desert, with at least two . Britons among the dead after Algerian troops attacked their captors. Algerian . sources said this afternoon 573 of total 650 hostages now free, . including 77 of 132 foreign nationals, meaning the whereabouts of 55 . foreigners are still unknown.","Mark Grant, 29, worked as an oil worker at the compound in the Sahara .

A benefits cheat who conned taxpayers out of thousands of pounds while selling £125 burgers in a gourmet gastropub begged not to be jailed – because he is too fat. Bentley-driving Stephen Sussams, 59, fraudulently claimed nearly £15,000 in housing and council tax benefit but argued he should not be sent to prison because he is obese. Matthew Groves, defending, told Croydon Magistrates’ Court that a custodial sentence 'would be a great burden for him to carry . because of his ill health', which includes 'diabetes, heart disease, . hypertension, obesity and depression'. Jailed: Landlord Stephen Sussams, pictured outside Croydon Magistrate's court, claimed nearly £15,000 in benefits despite running a gourmet gastropub in Dartmouth . Double life: Landlord Sussams ran popular gourmet gastropub The Royal Dart in . Dartmouth, pictured right, where diners are served ostrich and truffle and champagne burgers costing £125, pictured left . But Judge Peter Gower ignored the plea on Friday and ordered that Sussams, who also stole £17,000 from a dead man’s bank account, be jailed. Sussams was the landlord of The Royal Dart pub in Dartmouth where customers dined on crocodile, impala and ostrich while a champagne-marinated burger meal with black truffle costs £125. But the court heard how he began stealing £17,600 from the account of an elderly man he used to care for just one day after he died. He withdrew funds from Keith Dickenson’s account in five instalments following his death in 2008, before taking over the tenancy of his house in Croydon for which he fraudulently claimed housing and council tax benefits until September 2011. Carers’ supplements also continued to be paid into Mr Dickenson’s account, for which Sussams was a signatory, after he died because the benefit cheat did not inform the authorities of his death. Court hearing: Lawyers requested that the landlord of the award-winning pub, pictured, be spared jail because he is struggling with obesity-related illnesses including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension . Life in the country: The picturesque town of Dartmouth where Sussams ran The Royal Dart Pub . As Sussams continued to withdraw funds from the dead man’s account, Croydon Council grew suspicious and investigated. Sussams, of Marston Way, Norbury, denied . four counts of benefit fraud and one count of theft, but was found . guilty after a trial. Sentencing Sussams to eight months’ imprisonment for the count of theft, Judge Gower said: 'Your claiming of these benefits was fraudulent from the outset and you failed to notify the council of the highly successful business you were running in Dartmouth.' Referring to money he stole from the bank account of a dead man, he added: 'It is clear from the outset that you knew full well that was money the council had mistakenly paid into the account of Keith Dickenson after he died. 'I have no doubt that you knew that money was intended by the council to cover the cost of providing care services to him appropriate to the level of his disability and knew it was no longer needed for that purpose. 'Instead of returning these you applied them in accordance with your own wishes.' Sentencing him to a further four months for the counts of benefit fraud, he added: 'Your claim for these benefits was fraudulent from the outset.'","Stephen Sussams ran the gourmet gastropub The Royal Dart in Dartmouth .

"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter and Alex Gore . PUBLISHED: . 07:58 EST, 18 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:31 EST, 18 January 2013 . Bond girls who had intimate relationships with the promiscuous 007 could have suffered lasting psychological damage, a senior judge has said. Mr Justice Tugendhat made his comments when ruling on whether a compensation case brought by group of environmental activists, who discovered their former long-term partners were police spies, should go ahead. The High Court judge compared the clandestine work of the undercover officers to James Bond, a well known fictional womaniser who uses women in the line of duty. Promiscuous: James Bond, played by Sean Connery, up to his usual tricks with Shirley Eaton in Goldfinger . He said: 'James Bond is the most famous fictional example of a member of the intelligence services who used relationships with women to obtain information, or access to persons or property. 'Since he was writing a light entertainment, Ian Fleming did not dwell on the extent to which his hero used deception, still less upon the psychological harm he might have done to the women concerned. 'But fictional accounts, and there are others, lend credence to the view that the intelligence and police services have for many years deployed both men and women officers to form personal relationships of an intimate sexual nature, whether or not they were physical relationships, in order to obtain information or access.' The activists are suing Scotland Yard for damages after discovering their former long-term partners were undercover police officers. The 10 women, one of whom had a child with a police officer, are seeking damages for misconduct, deceit, assault and negligence. Some them had relationships with Mark Kennedy, an officer who spent seven years spying on green activists posing as drop out climber Mark Stone. Compensation: High Court judge Mr Justice Tugendhat is considering a case brought by group of environmental activist, some of whom allege to have had relationships with undercover police officer Mark Kennedy, right . An 11th person, a man, is also suing the police. It is believed his girlfriend left him for a police officer. They all claim to have suffered serious personal injury including mental illness and ongoing distress. The mother wants the Met to bear some of the cost of her child’s upbringing. Madeline . Smith, who played Bond girl MIss Caruso in the 1973 film Live And Let . Die, said after the hearing she did not question at the time whether . 007's behaviour could cause harm. She told The Telegraph: 'I was a dizzy, dippy little character in my frilly knickers, and that was OK then. 'It . was entertainment and I don't think anyone questioned it. With all . films and computer games, there is a big danger of people crossing into . fantasy or fiction from real life.' Womaniser: 007, played by Sean Connery in From Russia With Love, is well known for using women . Valerie . Leon, a star of the Bond films The Sky Who Loved Me and Never Say Never . Again, added: 'I think back then we didn't question it. 'Bond was what all women wanted and all men wanted to be. But we live in a different world now.' Mr Justice Tugendhat ordered that a significant part of the case must be heard behind closed doors because it is so sensitive. Bond girl: Valerie Leon, who appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me and Never Say Never Again . As . a result their claims will be considered by the Investigatory Powers . Tribunal (IPT), which usually considers complaints against MI5. Solicitor Harriet Wistrich, of . Birnberg Peirce, said the decision means the women may never discover . why they were ‘violated’ by the state. She said: ‘This decision prevents both . the claimants and the public from seeing the extent of the violations of . human rights and abuses of public office perpetrated by these . undercover units. 'The claimants have already suffered a gross violation of their privacy and abuse of trust by the police. 'If the case is dealt with by the IPT they will be denied access to justice and may never discover why they were thus violated by the state.’ The move is the latest chapter in an extraordinary saga that has laid bare how police infiltrated protest groups across Britain and Europe over the last two decades. Rejecting a bid by the Met to strike out the whole case, Mr Justice Tugendhat said the allegations are of the ‘gravest possible interference’ with the claimants’ private lives. He said police have used deception before, including a woman police officer who befriended Colin Stagg when he was suspected of murdering Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common. Monica Carss-Frisk QC, for the Met, said: ‘This case is not about denying remedy for any legitimate grievance. It is about the right forum for determining these claims.’ The IPT is so secret it does not even have an address, instead directing people to an anonymous PO Box in South London. It was set up in 2000 by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which governs how police use covert techniques and surveillance to investigate crime.
