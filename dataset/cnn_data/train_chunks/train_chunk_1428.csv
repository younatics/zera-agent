"Archaeologists with the Army Corps of Engineers are searching for what may be the sole photograph of  Civil War-era ironclad CSS Georgia as they salvage its remains from the Savannah River. So far, the only person able to verify details about the photo is the man who found it at a yard sale in Georgia in the 1980s - John Potter. Potter said he was looking through a collection of antiques at a home in Waycross when he stumbled upon a picture frame that caught his eye. Scroll down for video . Recovery: The Army Corps of Engineers hope to locate the  photograph that purports to be of the CSS Georgia, seen in this picture taken by John Potter of the original . In the frame was a photograph with a silhouetted individual in a coat and hat positioned in the foreground of the hulking frame of a boxy object. Potter described the photo itself as blurred and stained by damage from water or chemicals, but said an inscription on the back of the frame that read 'CSS Georgia' may accurately identify its subject. 'I knew exactly what it was,' said Potter, who now lives in North Carolina. 'I thought, ""This belongs in a museum.""' Potter did not have the $175 that the seller wanted for the photo, though he snapped a picture of it, a copy of which was later sent to the Georgia Historical Society. 'The photo is just as much a mystery as the CSS Georgia, because nobody has seen it in years,' said archaeologist Julie Morgan of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps is currently working on a $14million project to recover the wreckage of the ironclad from the bottom of the Savannah River. YouTube.com . Illustrated history: No blueprints or photographs have yet been verified, meaning the only visual record of the CSS Georgia is made up of illustrations, whose details vary between images . Undertaking: The Army Corps of Engineers, with a group of archaeologists and divers, is working to salvage the wreck of the CSS Georgia from the bottom of the Savannah River . With no photographs or blueprints to confirm the boat's original structure, researchers have only a handful of illustrations to go on. The armored warship CSS Georgia was part of an ironclad-building craze during the Civil War though it did nothing to aid the Confederacy's war efforts. The Ladies Gunboat Association of Savannah raised $115,000 in funds to build the CSS Georgia as a way to protect the city. The ship's engines were too weak to fight the Savannah River's currents, and the 1,200-ton ship was left floating off Fort Jackson as a gun battery. It finished the war without ever firing a shot, scuttled by its Confederate crew in December 1864 as General William Tecumseh Sherman captured the city of Savannah. The former curator of the National Civil War Naval Museum, Robert Holcolmbe, says the copy of the  photograph made by Potter all but confirmed the original was of the CSS Georgia. Holcombe said the shape in the photo conforms to the unique 45-degree angles of the CSS Georgia's armor casement that covers its deck. 'If it's an original, it's certainly the Georgia, just by process of elimination,' Holcombe explained. That or 'it's an awfully good fake.'","James Potter, a Savannah native, saw what he claims to be a photo of the CSS Georgia at a yard sale in the 1980s .

"Nasa's Curiosity rover has discovered a mysterious metal object emerging from rock on the surface of Mars. These images were captured by a camera on Curiosity, and reveal the bizarre finger-like structure protruding from the Martian surface and casting a shadow on to the rock below. Science buffs have suggested the small, shiny-looking object, which makes for an incongruous sight amid the rocks, could be composed of material less susceptible to erosion than its surroundings. Robotic finger? An image captured by Nasa's Curiosity rover shows the strange metallic object protruding from the surface of the rock . Incongruous: The unidentified object is seen nestled on the rocky surface . A report on Universe Today said the structure was likely to measure just 0.5cm or less. It was spotted in the picture beamed back from Mars, which was taken on January 30. Pictures of the mysterious object emerged after Curiosity drilled its first hole in the surface of Mars, to generate dust it can analyse to detect any traces of life which may once have existed on the planet. Pictures beamed back from the Martian surface showed a small hole surrounded by a pile of pulverised rock dust, which Nasa hopes to use in sample-collection tests. In a statement the space agency said Curiosity used both percussion and rotation to bore about 0.8in into the Mars rock as a test in advance of a later full drilling to collect samples. Searching: Curiosity rover has discovered what looks like a door handle on Mars . Pulverised: Nasa's Curiosity rover drilled this 0.8in deep hole on the surface of Mars as a test in advance of more drilling to collect samples for analysis to see if it could ever have harboured life . Completion of this 'mini drill' test was confirmed in data from Mars received late Wednesday at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Mission scientists will now assess the drill cuttings around the fresh half-inch diameter hole to determine whether they are suitable for processing by the rover's on-board lab. If they pass muster, the rover team plans to proceed with commanding the first full drilling in the coming days, Nasa said. The test was performed on a patch of flat, vein-bearing rock called 'John Klein', which observations suggested had once been weathered by water erosion. 'Pre-drilling observations of this rock yielded indications of one or more episodes of wet environmental conditions,' Nasa said. 'The team plans to use Curiosity's laboratory instruments to analyse sample powder from inside the rock to learn more about the site's environmental history.' Drilling for life: Completion of the 'mini drill' test was confirmed in data from Mars received late Wednesday at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California . The drill is just one of 10 scientific instruments on-board Curiosity which Nasa scientists hope to use to analyse the surface of Mars more closely than they have ever been able to before. The one-ton rover has been studying the area around the Gale Crater on Mars to see whether it could have ever been habitable by microbial life. The drilling comes after scientists last month said they believe the discovery of minerals below the Red Planet's surface is the 'strongest evidence yet' it may have supported life. A new study led by the Natural History Museum, with the University of Aberdeen, found that all the ingredients for life were present just below the planet's surface for much of its history. When meteorites strike the surface of Mars, they act like natural probes, bringing up rocks from far beneath the crust. It's continuing mission.... The one-ton Curiosity rover has been studying the area around the Gale Crater on Mars to see whether it could have ever been habitable by microbial life. Looking at data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA's Mars Express spacecrafts, they analysed rocks and found they contain clays and minerals whose chemical make-up has been altered by water. With up to half of life on Earth consisting of simple microorganisms that live in below the surface, scientists have suggested that the same may have been true for Mars. Dr Joseph Michalski, lead author and planetary geologist at the Natural History Museum said: 'All the ingredients were there for life, but only small single-cell organisms could have survived in those conditions. 'But I would now be more surprised if there was never any life on Mars, than I would be if we did one day discover that simple life lived in that environment. 'And if life existed then, there is a chance it could still exist now.'","Images show bizarre shiny object protruding from the surface .

"Rio Ferdinand says Roy Hodgson has to find the right formula and get his England players performing at the level they do for their clubs. Hodgson's men were largely uninspiring in Wednesday's 1-0 international win over Norway, when just 40,181 people turned up to watch at Wembley. And QPR defender Ferdinand, who captained England seven times during a 14-year international career which saw him amass 81 caps, believes the responsibility lies with the manager to get them playing at their best. Right formula: Roy Hodgson needs to find a system that suits his players, says Rio Ferdinand . Wasted: Former England captain says previous managers did not get the best out of the 'golden generation' Asked why the country's best players have struggled to reproduce their club form on international duty, Ferdinand looked at the recent past. Managers such as Sven-Goran Eriksson, Fabio Capello and Steve McClaren were unable to inspire the so-called 'golden generation' to major success on the international stage. Established internationals such as John Terry, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ferdinand have now all retired from the international game. The 35-year-old told Football Focus on BBC1: 'Look at the 'golden generation'. Why didn't they succeed? Partly it was down to us - but maybe we weren't set up the right way. 'I wouldn't want to play against that England squad. I'm excited about the frontline - young, hungry talents who should flourish within a system.' If the cap fits: Ferdinand has backed Hodgson call to name Wayne Rooney as captain . Spot on: Rooney scored the winner in lacklustre friendly against Norway with a penalty . Ferdinand believes Hodgson has done the right thing giving Wayne Rooney the captain's armband. The Manchester United skipper netted the only goal from the penalty spot in midweek and Ferdinand continued: 'We can romanticise about how it was done before but within that squad I think he's the right man. 'He wants to leave his mark on the game and he's got an opportunity to do that.'","Roy Hodgson needs to find the right formula to get England players performing in the same way they do for their clubs, says Rio Ferdinand .

"If Manchester United’s new-look frontline is going to start firing fours and fives, there’s a still a danger the boys at the back could concede one more. While we have been salivating over the prospect of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria joining forces with Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, reinforcement at the other end of the park was somewhat neglected. Yes, Marcos Rojo arrived from Sporting Lisbon, but a 24-year-old debuting in the Premier League hardly fills the void left by the exits of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. VIDEO Scroll down to watch five reasons Louis van Gaal signed Radamel Falcao . Plenty to ponder: Louis van Gaal (centre right) has a wealth of talent going forward but is vulnerable at the back . And then there is Louis van Gaal’s preferred choice of formation: 3-5-2. Rather than mask the shortcomings of those in defence, the system has, thus far at least, left them exposed and seemingly confused. It does not matter how an opponent attacks them – be it land or air, centrally or wide – panic ensues at every advancement. Two were conceded at home to Swansea and four at League One MK Dons in the League Cup, the latter seeing Jonny Evans terrorised by lower-league frontmen. Even at Sunderland – a 1-1 draw – United’s backline was shambolic and was spared only thanks to some errant finishing. Tough start: Manchester United are yet to win this season and are out of the League Cup . Phil Jones is on trial for club and country at present – he’ll line up for England in Switzerland on Monday night – while the international credentials of the injured Chris Smalling will also be under scrutiny on his return. Luke Shaw remains absent through injury and Tyler Blackett has less professional appearances (16) than his age (20). There has even been talk of Michael Carrick – another confined to the treatment room – reverting from midfield to centre-back in a bid to aid their cause. Attacking talent: Manchester United signed Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria in the transfer window . Settled it is not and Van Gaal and his backroom team will need to put in some serious hours on the training pitches of Carrington over the coming months. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer at look at who they’ll be working with… . Phil Jones . Sir Alex Ferguson once said Jones could become one of the club’s greatest-ever players. In his defence he’s still only 22 and has ample time to prove Ferguson right, but on recent evidence his former manager’s words appear folly. He is error prone and lacks the defensive cunning of a Ferdinand or Vidic. (Defensive) Rating: 6.5/10 . Error prone: Phil Jones is struggling to live up to the hype of his early career . Marcos Rojo . He was labelled Argentina’s weak link prior to the World Cup but played his part in the team which finished second to Germany and emerged with his reputation enhanced. But at £16m and given the defensive woes at Old Trafford, there is already pressure on him to right their rearguard wrongs – and that is perhaps too much expectation given his lack of experience. Rating: 7/10 . Unknown quantity: Marcos Rojo has not played for Manchester United yet following his move . Jonny Evans . He’ll be in no hurry to return to Stadium MK. But League One looked about his level during the Capital One Cup humbling and that would have done little for his confidence. He is, of course, far better than that showing but questions remain over his credentials as a United starter. Rating: 6.5/10 . Poor display: Jonny Evans had a nightmare evening against MK Dons in the League Cup . Chris Smalling . Smalling and Jones were supposed to be the future of United and England. Both, however, are fighting to restore damaged reputations. Smalling is yet to mature into the leader many hoped he would and, at 24, this is a big season for the former non-league defender. Rating: 6.5/10 . The future? Chris Smalling has yet to mature into the leader that many expected him to become . Luke Shaw . There has already been much debate over his fitness and physique and, before he’s even kicked a Premier League ball for the club, the 19-year-old finds himself under the spotlight. If Van Gaal is to persist with 3-5-2 then Shaw – an orthodox left-back – will have to learn how to adapt his game to a wing-back posting. Rating: 7.5/10 . Teenage kicks: Luke Shaw became the most expensive teenager in England when he joined for £30m . Tyler Blackett . The 20-year-old has started the season in the side but isn’t expected to stay there. At Sunderland, in particular, he was torn between his centre-back duty and filling the hole at left-back exposed by Ashley Young’s reluctance to defend. This backline is hardly the preferred environment to blood a promising youngster. Rating: 6/10 . Young hope: Tyler Blackett has made a number of appearances this season but could soon be replaced . Rafael . Injury means he is yet to feature this season but a wing-back role would surely be to his liking and there is little competition at right-back should Van Gaal switch to a traditional four. Rating: 7/10 . On the sidelines: Rafael has missed the start of the season due to injury . Michael Carrick . He has previously impressed at centre-back but that was in a team on the front foot. It will be a different scenario entirely were the midfielder to find himself under siege. Rating: 6/10 . Moving back: Michael Carrick is a midfielder but has impressed at centre back in the past . Daley Blind . He’s been brought to the club as a midfielder but he nonetheless appeared in defence for Holland under Van Gaal and could well find himself back there were their problems to persist.

"An horrific image has emerged of a baby girl moments from being beheaded by IS. The picture is among several recovered by Kurdish soldiers from the mobile phones of dead fanatics in the Syrian town of Kobane. It shows the child being pinned to the floor, in clear distress as a knife is held to her throat. It is feared she may have been beheaded along with her family for being an Alevi Muslim, a branch of Islam whose followers have been targeted by IS. Horror: The harrowing image of the 'beheaded' baby girl was found on the phone of a dead Islamic State militant. Others images showed beheadings and jihadis playing football with the severed heads of victims . Other pictures show beheadings and jihadis playing football with the severed heads of victims. They were found by Kurdish YPG fighters defending the besieged town, where more than 1,100 are thought to have been killed since last month. The photo of the girl is believed to have been taken a week last Friday. There were no shots of her decapitation and her body has not been found, leading some to hope she had a miraculous escape. The many fighters who have circulated the picture on Facebook have nicknamed her ‘Melek’, meaning angel. Blast: The picture is among several recovered by Kurdish soldiers from the mobile phones of dead fanatics in the Syrian town of Kobane, pictured this afternoon during an American airstrike . One source, Ali, who obtained the picture from YPG soldiers, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The people of Kobane are desperate for the world to see with their own eyes the atrocities inflicted by these filth. Each time I look at this picture it makes me weep. ‘You can see how frightened she is. I can almost hear her scream.What kind of depraved monsters are they? What pleasure can killing this child bring anyone?’ Soldiers said Melek, a woman and an older child – thought to be her mother and sister – were witnessed being dragged out of hiding by IS around the time of an air strike. ‘Some have a flicker of hope in their hearts that they might have escaped,’ added Ali.","Sickening image shows child pinned to floor with knife held to her throat .

"Jihadi fighters have been told to remove metadata from their tweets and stop posting names, locations and identifiable photographs to stay one step ahead of Western spies. Radical group, Isis, has had a prolific social media output, but leaders are concerned that fighters have been inadvertently leaking data through their online activities. Pictures of jihadis brandishing severed heads and taunting their enemies have provided a wealth of valuable information to Western intelligence agencies such as the US NSA or Britain's GCHQ. Metadata is information generated as you use technology, which could include the  date and time you last tweeted as well as where you sent it from. Scroll down for video . Isis terrorists have led a prolific social media campaign, releasing several videos which purport to show beheadings. Alan Henning is shown being paraded in front of camera (above) British muslims have been recuited using propaganda videos, such as this one featuring Abu Muthanna al-Yemeni, who grew up in Cardiff . Now Isis is taking steps to deal with the leaks and it has handed out an Arabic language manual among Isis fighters which gives  detailed instructions on how to remove this data. 'A number of security gaps have appeared that have benefited the enemy and have helped expose the identities of some brothers or identify some sites used by the mujahideen with ease,' it says. The document then goes on to explain what those gaps are and the way they expose 'data that could turn your hair gray', according to the Financial Times. 'We know this issue is not only tied to pictures, but to PDF files, word files and video files,' it adds. Jihadi fighters have been told to remove metadata from their tweets and stop revealing names, locations and identifiable photographs . Arabic language manual handed out among Isis fighters gives detailed instructions on how to remove metadata . The Isis 'media restraint' campaign also stresses the importance of avoiding identifiable pictures of individuals. One Isis account tweeted in support of the measures, referring to the group's victories in Iraq's Anbar province in the face of US air strikes in recent days: 'Your abstention from posting details and your brothers' movements during [the] Hit camp blessed battle two days ago was the reason God granted you victory.' Darien Kindlund, director of threat research at FireEye, a US cyber security company said metadata – latent information in digital files – can be extremely valuable to intelligence agencies. He said: '[It] can contain information about the identity of the author, when the content was created/modified, and potentially reveal location information around where the content was authored.' Metadata is information generated as you use technology, and its use has been the subject of controversy since the NSA's secret surveillance program was revealed. Examples include the date and time you called somebody or the location from which you last accessed your email. The data collected generally does not contain personal or content-specific details, but rather transactional information about the user, the device and activities taking place. In some cases you can limit the information that is collected – by turning off location services on your cell phone for instance – but many times you cannot. A still from the newly-released video of British Hostage John Cantlie. The photojournalist has been a captive of ISIS for two years . In Raqqa, Isis's nominal 'capital' in Syria, the group has also grown increasingly paranoid about the use of WiFi and WiFi 'boosters' used to extend internet coverage in the city. Patrick Skinner, a former CIA official and now counter terrorism expert at the Soufan Group, said: 'You don't see any of Isis's most important figures on Twitter and you see even less now of the more minor ones too . . . the people who make big speeches are the ones that end up dead.' Islamic State terrorists recently released another propaganda video featuring British hostage John Cantlie, who warns of an impending third war in the Gulf. In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist, who describes himself as the 'British citizen abandoned by my government', accuses the western media of being complicit with America and its allies in trying to drum up support for a ground war against ISIS. A former director of public prosecutions said any attempt to charge British jihadists with treason would be seen as a badge of honour by them. Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, QC, said they should be treated as straightforward criminals, rather than using the archaic legislation. He said: 'The worst thing you could do is attach some spurious glamour to them by attaching a title like traitor or a crime like treason. 'They ought to be treated like straightforward criminals. We have plenty of laws to deal with what they are doing. 'Britons who join Islamic State want to be treated as ideological and political foes of its allies rather than ordinary criminals. We shouldn't treat them as something different. We should treat them as criminals.' Mr Macdonald made the comments after Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, raised the possibility of the Treason Act being used against British jihadists. It was last used to prosecute the Nazi propagandist William Joyce.","Jihadi fighters told to stop tweeting names, locations and identifiable photos .

"He was already in line for a five-figure windfall after finding a Rolex watch in a drain. Now contractor Arron Large could treble his money to £60,000 after discovering three more expensive watches. The 28-year-old spotted the first timepiece while jet-washing a roadside drain a week ago. Finders keepers? Street cleaner Arron Large found a £21,000 Rolex in a drain but the owner has now stepped forward to claim it . Striking gold: Mr Large was cleaning a drain near Chalkwell train station in Essex when he saw a glimmer amongst the dirt. Three of the four watches he found turned out to be fakes . Rather than quietly pocketing it, he handed it in to police who told him he could keep it if no one claimed it within 30 days. The day after speaking to the Daily Mail about his good fortune, he found an identical watch in a drain 100 yards away. Hours later, another two watches . turned up in the same place where he made his first lucrative discovery. Experts say the four watches would cost £60,000 to replace. Mr Large, from Rayleigh, Essex, said: ‘I told my colleague, “You’re not going to believe me but I’ve found another one”. ‘He said “Shut up” but when I took it . out and wiped it off, I realised it was another Rolex.

"The earliest copy of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, Mona Lisa, has been found in the vaults of a Spanish museum, looking younger and more ravishing than the original. Art historians have hailed the discovery, made during conservation work at the Prado Museum, as one of the most remarkable in recent times. Museum officials said it was almost certainly painted by one of Leonardo da Vinci's apprentices alongside the master himself as he did the original. Replica: Painted alongside the original (left), historians say the copy (right) gives another insight into what the model for one of the world's most famous paintings actually looked like . Rare discovery: Employees of Madrid's Prado Museum stand next to the authenticated contemporary copy of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa . It is not the Mona Lisa, but you might think of her as Mona Lisa's sister, who - after more than five centuries - is finally having her debutante party. Painted alongside the original, historians say it gives another insight into what the model for one of the world's most famous paintings actually looked like. The copy has been part of the Prado collection for years but officials said they did not realise its significance until a recent restoration revealed hidden layers. The artwork features the same female figure, but had been covered over with black paint and varnish. Two years ago, to get the copy ready for a da Vinci exhibition to be held in Paris this year, tests were done and restorers discovered something hidden under the black coat. When the black covering was removed, a Tuscan landscape very similar to the one in the original emerged. Unveiled: The copy has been part of the Prado collection for years but officials said they did not realise its significance until a recent restoration revealed hidden layers . The Prado painting was long thought to be one of dozens surviving replicas of the masterpiece made after Leonardo's death but it is now believed to have been painted by one of his key pupils, Francesco Melzi, working alongside the master. Prado's technical specialist, Ana González Mozo, said: 'It is quite possible that Leonardo's assistant met Lisa and may even have been present when she sat for the master. 'She may also have come to the studio when finishing touches were being applied to the face in the painting.' Different perspective: The copy gives art lovers and experts a chance 'to admire the Mona Lisa with totally different eyes' Ms Mozo said the underdrawing of the Madrid replica was similar to that of the original, which suggests both were begun at the same time and painted next to each other, as the work evolved. The Louvre original, displayed behind glass, is obscured by cracked darkened varnish, making the woman appear middle aged. Because of its fragility, cleaning and restoration is thought to be too risky. But art historians believe the Prado's Mona Lisa which is in the process of being painstakingly stripped of a dark over-paint reveals her as she would have looked at the time- as a radiant young woman in her early 20s. Miguel Falomir, the Prado's director for Italian painting, said the copy gives art lovers and experts a chance 'to admire the Mona Lisa with totally different eyes.' Besides the black background, one other difference from the original is the woman in the copy has eyebrows and the Mona Lisa in the real masterpiece does not. There are dozens of the surviving replicas of the masterpiece from the 16th and 17th centuries. The sitter is generally believed to represent Lisa Gherardini, the wife of the Florentine cloth merchant Francesco del Giocondo and is thought to have been painted between 1503 and 1506. After five hundred years, the two versions will be reunited again later this year. The Prado plans to put it on display later this month before it travels to the Louvre for the da Vinci show, giving specialists and visitors the first chance to compare the two works.","New painting also reveals model had sculpted eyebrows .

"Over-anxious parents make their children ‘work’ for more than 54 hours a week by pushing them into too many activities, researchers warn. The figure, which is seven hours more than the average adult spends in the office, has been attributed to ambitious 'tiger parents' who fill their offspring's diaries with extracurricular activities and extensive educational play. Most children spend 32.5 hours a week at school from Monday to Friday, as well as seven hours and 28 minutes of homework each week. Exhausting: Extracurricular activities and 'learning through play' mean children 'work' 54 hours a week . But on top of this, the typical child is enrolled into at least two activities a week, such as swimming, football, dance classes or music lessons. This adds a further two hours and 26 minutes to an already gruelling timetable of events, the study by Haliborange Kid’s Vitamins found. In addition, most parents say they actively read with their children for at least 43 minutes a day - or five hours and one minute a week. And to make absolutely sure their child has the very best chance of getting ahead, the average parents also spends one hour a day, or seven hours a week, teaching their children through play. Dr Claire Halsey, parenting expert and clinical psychologist and spokeswoman for the Haliborange Kids Vitamins study of 2,000 parents said: 'This study indicates just how much parents want to do the best for their children. 'Parenthood is filled with decisions and responsibilities, and sometimes it can be hard to get it right all the time.

'All any parent wants is for their child to be happy and reach their full potential. While it’s great for kids to have hobbies and explore new activities, the best thing for their mental and physical development is to spend time playing and having fun, letting them shine naturally.' The study suggests that more parents than ever before are open to educating their children away from school with extra tuition. Indeed, one in three people polled admitted their child also attends at least one extra class a week studying either English, maths or science. As a result, a third of the nation’s children are actually working for over 55 hours a week. The poll reveals that four out of five parents feel it is right to try and educate their children as much as possible when they are not in the school environment. And it seems some parents are competitive too, with 41 per cent admitting they have always been concerned about their child’s development and worry whether they know as much as other children in their age group. At least half of parents asked have spent hours trying to teach their children how to recite their alphabet, numbers, days of the week, cities and months of the year. Catching a ball, swimming, learning how to dress and undress, understanding about healthy eating and being able to cook a little, and knowing about the solar system are among things parents think children should know by the time they go to school. However, 28 per cent of those polled admit they worry their child does too much, and 43 per cent have considered that their child should spend more time having fun. Concerned: The workload has left some parents worried that their child doesn't get to play enough . When Amy Chua's The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother was published in 2011, it became immediately notorious. Based on Chua's experiences of giving her two daughters a 'traditional' strict Chinese upbringing, it spoke of calling one 'garbage' for failing to adequately complete a task and included a controversial 'white elephant' anectdote. The offending passage read: 'I hauled Lulu’s dollhouse to the car and told her I’d donate it to the Salvation Army piece by piece if she didn’t have The Little White Donkey’ perfect by the next day. When Lulu said, ""I thought you were going to the Salvation Army, why are you still here?"" I threatened her with no lunch, no dinner, no Christmas or Hanukkah presents, no birthday parties for two, three, four years. When she still kept playing it wrong, I told her she was purposely working herself into a frenzy because she was secretly afraid she couldn’t do it. I told her to stop being lazy, cowardly, self-indulgent and pathetic.' Although many commentators were horrified, many more applauded Chua's efforts, while a Wall Street Journal poll found two thirds of parents were in favour of Chua's methods. What's more, 27 per cent of parents revealed that they have taken their child out of classes such as music, dance or languages, with 54 per cent of these claiming it was because their child looked exhausted from all the activities they were doing. A further 45 per cent were worried about the cost of the additional clubs their children were participating in, while a fifth said they weren’t spending enough time together as a family. The study also shows a quarter of parents are worried their children are not getting the adequate nutrition they need because they are so busy. On at least three nights a week families don’t sit down together to eat, so four in 10 parents support their child’s diet with vitamins to boost their health. Nutritionist Dr Frankie Phillips comments: 'It can be hard to fit in three nutritious meals a day when the children are being ferried between school, clubs and extra tutoring. 'But time to eat together as a family is very important. We know from research studies that families who eat together regularly tend to be better off nutritionally speaking; they eat a healthier diet. 'Children need good nutrition to grow and develop, and providing adequate nutrients, vitamins and minerals is an essential part of this, both immediately to get through the busy school day, and long-term for their future well-being. 'Vitamin and mineral deficiencies, as well as dehydration, can lead to fatigue and poor health; tiredness resulting from poor nutrition can compromise concentration and consequently performance in school. 'Children are leading increasingly hectic lives, but it’s important that their diets don’t suffer. Parents can boost low nutritional levels with great tasting vitamins. 'Omega-3 may help support concentration and the right amount of iron can combat fatigue whilst B vitamins are important to help release energy.'","In addition to school, children also have extra tutoring and homework .

"If you thought Fifty Shades and Harry Potter porn pushed the boundaries of good taste, then prepare to be shocked. Dinosaur erotica looks set to be the latest niche craze in the world of sexy fiction as a trio of books on the topic is released to buy for the Kindle. The naughty novels, with titles such as Running From The Raptor and Taken by the T-Rex focus on the fantasy of helpless young women being attacked and seduced by dinosaurs. I wanna T-Rex you up: The erotic titles are by two authors who also produce orc and dragon porn . Jezebel reports that the books, which are short stories of no more than 20 pages long, are the work of two authors, Christie Sims and Alara Branwen, who also write dragon, orc and weretiger erotica. The books, which are available to buy on Amazon, state in their seller description: ’Warning: This is a tale of beast sex. This story was written to unlock your darkest fantasies and innermost desires. It is not for the faint of heart and is not your mother's erotica.’ The book covers feature a scantily dressed young woman gazing lustfully out from some wild scene, with a dinosaur lurking sinisterly - or sexily, if that's your thing - in the background. In the Velociraptor's Nest centers around a cave woman called Azog . The dinosaur porn imagines a world where humans and dinosaurs existed together. For the tale of In the Velociraptor’s Nest the protagonist Azog is a cavewoman, under appreciated in her tribe. The synopsis says: ‘The cavemen treat her like a piece a meat. Azog cannot resist unless she proves herself as a hunter. ‘When she goes out in search of fresh meat, she discovers a clutch of baby velociraptors and decides to kill them and triumphantly bring them back to her tribe. ‘That is, until their father shows up and blocks Azog’s way out of the cave. Azog must use all of her womanly wiles to get out of the cave, which includes doing things she had never dreamed of.’ The dinosaur stories come in the wake of a flurry of unusual porn genres, which have flourished thanks to the Kindle. The success of EL James's Fifty Shades trilogy was put down largely to the fact that women could download the books to their e-reader, thus preventing them the embarrassment of buying the books and reading them in public. Sims and Branwen's books are books are available to download from Amazon to the Kindle. 'Azog stood, back to the wall, clad only in damp buckskins, waiting for the beast to slash at her torso until she lay helpless and bleeding on the damp cave floor. 'She wondered if it would kill her first, or if her limbs would be sliced from her body as the beast gorged on her. 'Instead, it reached out with a clawed hand to snatch at her damp animal hide as it clung to one shoulder. 'Azog felt the kiss of sharp claws against her skin as the hide slid from her shoulder and exposed on naked, heaving breast. 'The raptor paused, curious, sniffing at her as she pressed desperately against the wall. A reptilian tongue, stiff and hot, dashed out to lick at the tender, naked flesh so suddenly exposed. Azog gasped at the touch, then gradually relaxed as her body warmed to the intoxicating sensation of the beast's flesh against her own.'

"Statins should be given to all over-50s, regardless of their health history, because they dramatically cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes in later life, one of the UK's leading experts has said. Currently statins are given only to high-risk patients, around eight million people, who have high cholesterol or have a risk of heart disease. But there is 'clear evidence' that healthy people can also benefit based on their age alone, says Professor Sir Rory Collins. Statins are taken each day by eight million adults in the UK but there is 'clear evidence' that healthy people can also benefit, it is claimed (posed by model) He led the world's largest study to investigate statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease which proved that cutting levels of 'bad' LDL cholesterol in the blood saved lives. The risk of having a major vascular event such as a heart attack is cut by one-fifth for each 1.0mmol/L (millimoles per litre) fall in LDL, whether in high or low risk patients. But current guidelines on their use - and misguided safety fears about muscle pain and memory loss - are restricting the range of people who can take them, he said. 'At 50 you should be considering it and whether you should be taking them at an earlier age is an open question' he said. 'If you start treatment earlier and continue for longer the benefits will be much greater, you're not trying to unfur the arteries, you're preventing them from furring in the first place' he said. Prof Collins, who was giving a keynote lecture at the European Cardiology Congress in Munich, said evidence from 130,000 patients taking statins in trials show they are safe. Professor Sir Rory Collins says statins should be given to all over-50s, regardless of their health history . Yet drug safety watchdogs here and in the US have insisted on flagging up relatively minor side effects which are putting patients off the drugs, he said. These include memory loss, depression, sexual difficulties and depression, while recent research suggests cataracts and diabetes may be more common in patients taking statins. Trial data shows only one significant side effect, myopathy or muscle pain, which affects one in 10,000 patients, said Prof Collins. He said: 'We need to look properly at the safety of statins. The reality is that these drugs are remarkably safe, but the problem is that high risk patients are getting the message that these drugs have side effects.' Prof Collins, 57, went to his GP a fortnight ago to ask about taking statins despite a relatively low cholesterol level, and was dismayed to learn she could not get high risk patients to take them because of fears about side effects. Research earlier this year co-ordinated by the Clinical Trial Service Unit Oxford University, where Prof Collins is co-director, reviewed findings from 27 statin trials involving 175,000 people, some of whom were at low risk of heart problems. The drugs cut the risk of heart attacks, strokes and operations to unblock arteries by one third or more. The benefits were gained no matter what level of cholesterol patients started out with. Healthier people who were given statins also had lower overall death rates than those who were given a placebo. It concluded the positives greatly exceeded any side-effects from taking the drugs. More than eight million adults are already taking statins, but it is estimated that routine use by the over 50s would lead to 10,000 fewer heart attacks and strokes a year, including 2,000 fewer deaths in the UK. The small cost of the drugs - as low as £16 a year - would be outweighed by NHS savings due to the reduced number of heart attacks and strokes. At present, statins are restricted to those with at least a 20 per cent risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next five years. But, said Prof Collins, trial data shows very low risk groups can benefit where individuals have just a five to 10 per cent chance of heart disease, and even lower. He said there did not appear to be a threshold at which the drugs didn't work and the longer they were taken, the greater the benefit. 'We need to review the guidelines and the current thresholds should go,' said Prof Collins, who claimed medical tests such as liver function were also unnecessary. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The issue is where do you set the threshold between low, normal and high risk. 'The current arbitrary threshold was decided by cost but now statins are off patent (and much cheaper) it may be appropriate to see if there are benefits for more people - the threshold is a bit too high,' he added.","Currently statins only given to around eight million high-risk patients .

"The father of girl who claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew has apologised after claiming she met the Queen while on a trip to London with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Virginia Roberts' father Sky, 58, had boasted this weekend that his daughter, who said she had sex with the royal while under-age, was introduced to Her Majesty on a trip organised by Epstein. Buckingham Palace emphatically denied that any such meeting took place. But today Mr Roberts retracted his claim. In a statement sent to MailOnline, he said: 'I want to clear up that many years ago Virginia stated to me she was to meet the Queen's son Prince Andrew and not the Queen herself. I'm sorry for any misunderstanding.' Scroll down for video . Decial: The Queen has said she did not meet Virginia Roberts after her father Sky (pictured with her aged seven) said she met the monarch on the same trip she met Prince Andrew . He added that he had not demanded that Prince Andrew be prosecuted, but said that 'any person whether it is a Prince or a pauper, if anybody has sex with a minor, they should be prosecuted.' Mr Roberts said this weekend that his daughter told him 'a few years back' that she had met Prince Andrew and the Queen after she had been flown to London by Epstein. The claim of a meeting with the Queen was not made by Miss Roberts herself. Responding to Mr Roberts' claim, a Palace spokesman said: ‘There is nothing to suggest that this claim is true. We have no record of such a meeting.’ Prince Andrew vehemently denies the claims made in a new legal action by Miss Roberts that he abused her as an under-age girl at an orgy where she was being used as a ‘sex slave’. The legal allegation states that Miss Roberts was ‘forced’ to have sex with the royal at parties in London, New York and the Caribbean. She claims she was told to ‘give the prince whatever he demanded’ by his friend Epstein – the US paedophile who hosted the parties – and that she was converted ‘into what is commonly referred to as a sex slave’. Sky Roberts spoke out this weekend to support his daughter, who is now 30, and said her claims should be tested in court. Prince Andrew photographed with Virginia Roberts in 2001 . Her father said: ‘I brought up my children and that includes Virginia to always tell the truth … Why would she lie?’ Mr Roberts, who lives on a five-acre ranch in Summerfield, near Ocala, Florida, said he had never talked to his daughter about her allegedly being kept as a sex slave by Epstein and loaned out to other rich men. But he insisted that if Prince Andrew did have sex with his daughter when she was 17 and under the legal age limit, he should be prosecuted. ‘I don’t care if he is a prince or the guy who lives down the road … it should not have happened and they must face the consequences,’ he said. ‘Having under-age sex is against the law and he should be prosecuted.’ Mr Roberts, who divorced from Virginia’s mother Lynn eight years ago, said he has not spoken to his daughter in three months. Miss Roberts and husband Robert left their home in Titusville, Florida, and are now in Colorado. Her father said he never suspected she was being abused by Epstein and his friends; adding: ‘At the time we thought it was all OK. Virginia never once said anything about any sexual activity. I never asked her because I did not think that was going on. ‘Mr Epstein seemed an upstanding kind of guy. She would go to his house in Palm Beach but always come home. When he started flying her all over the world we just thought what a life she was having … All Virginia ever said was that she was hired to give massages.’ He said his daughter was never in trouble with police and avoided any involvement in drugs while growing up in California and Loxahatchee, Florida. Mr Roberts also claims his daughter (right) was introduced to the Queen. Left, Prince Andrew with former friend Jeffrey Epstein in 2011 . Prince Andrew was seen leaving Verbier ski resort in Switzerland today as he made his way back to the UK . Marriage: Miss Roberts pictured with her husband Robert on their wedding day in Thailand in 2002 . ‘There was one occasion when she was taken to hospital with alcohol poisoning … She was about 15 years old. That was the only time she had been in trouble. Growing up she had everything she wanted. It was a good family life with her brothers Sky [now 25] and Daniel [now 35].’ Mr Roberts, who is retired, admitted he has not read any of the allegations made by his daughter and avoided reading her account in 2011, when she waived her right to anonymity and talked about her time with Epstein. FRIDAY: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’ SATURDAY AFTERNOON: ‘A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further.’ SATURDAY EVENING, in response to specific claims about Andrew’s alleged conduct: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’ He said: ‘I still don’t want to know. Virginia has never talked about it with me, as it’s not the sort of thing a father wants to hear from his daughter. I might be putting my head in the sand, but that is the way I want it … What Virginia did back then is in the past.’ Mr Roberts said he visited her several times when she lived in Australia. She moved back to the US 18 months ago to be closer to her family. In court documents, Miss Roberts – who is not named – says she was ‘procured for sexual activities’ for Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell. Miss Maxwell is alleged to have facilitated the prince’s ‘abuse’ of the girl. The legal documents, lodged with a Florida court, name Miss Maxwell as a ‘madame’ and a ‘primary co-conspirator in [Epstein’s] sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’. She has previously branded all claims against her as ‘untrue’ and ‘obvious lies’. The court papers name Andrew, 54, as one of three men allegedly involved in abusing ‘Jane Doe #3’ when she was 17 – under-age according to Florida state law. Epstein, a long-term friend of Andrew, was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for under-age prostitution. The pair remained friends and were seen together in 2011 after Epstein’s release. On Friday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said ‘any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue’. Andrew’s accuser countered the statement, saying via her lawyers that she is an ‘innocent victim’ and: ‘I’m not going to be bullied back into silence.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Virginia Roberts alleges she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York .

"One of Pope Francis' newest cardinals has sparked outrage by claiming that homosexuality is a 'physical defect' that can be 'cured with the proper treatment'. Recently elected Fernando Sebastian Aguilar from Spain, 85, who takes up his office in the Vatican in February, angered gay rights groups by likening the sexual orientation to long lasting physical aliments like his own high blood pressure. The comments are in direct contrast to Pope Francis' recent assertion that the Catholic church should not marginalise gay people, but should instead treat them with acceptance and compassion; comments that were immediately attacked by local politicians. Cardinal-elect Sebastian Fernando, whose outspoken views on homosexuality have been lambasted by the LGBT community as 'medieval' and 'out of touch' In an interview with Diario Sur, the newly elected cardinal, who lives in Malaga in Costa del Sol remained defiant against comments from LGBT groups that his words were 'medieval' and 'out of place in this time'. Aguilar, the only Spaniard among the 19 new cardinals, insisted the Pope's message about gay people had been manipulated. He said: 'All he is doing is offering comprehension and compassion and showing a desire to welcome those who have gone astray.' 'Homosexuality is a defective manner of expressing sexuality, because this has a structure and a purpose, which is procreation. 'A homosexual who can't achieve procreation is failing. Our bodies have many defects. I have high blood . pressure, a defect I have to try and . correct in whatever way I can.

It is one thing to be compassionate towards homosexuals, and another thing to morally justify the practice of that homosexuality.

"A feminist stripper who has been working in the industry for 22 years has spoken out in defense of her controversial profession, insisting that she feels more empowered as a woman because of her time spent dancing on the pole in strip clubs. Antonia Crane, who also works as a writer and a teacher, told CNN's Lisa Lang that she feels incredibly 'sexy' whenever she takes to the stage and believes that stripping allows her to embrace her womanhood and her sexuality. 'Generally it's a sexy dance and you just kind of get into the mode,' she said. 'When the music plays you just go and you become kind of an animal. You become part of that world, like a sensual world of heat and sleaze.' 'It's hot and empowering': Antonia, 42, believes that stripping can actually enable women to better embrace their femininity . Center stage: Antonia says that dancing on the pole makes her feel 'sexy' 'My goal was to pay my tuition': Antonia initially began stripping as a means of paying her way through college . The 42-year-old is adamant that society's perception of stripping as a degrading and shameful profession is entirely wrong. 'I think it's hot and empowering,' she added. 'I think that our culture tells us that it's bad and that it's inherently degrading but I don't subscribe to that.' Having entered into the industry at the age of 20, when her friend took her along to one of 'San Francisco's oldest, sleaziest clubs', Antonia has since clocked more than 10,000 hours working in a variety of strip clubs across America. 'Initially, my goal was to pay my rent and afford my exorbitant college tuition while taking down the patriarchy one lap dance at a time,' she wrote in a piece for CNN. 'I was studying post-structural feminist theory and the civil rights movement and stripping complemented the art and literature I was exploring at that time.' She is clear, however, that there are some drawbacks to working in what can  be an incredibly dark - and sometimes even dangerous - profession and admits that there have been nights when she has been 'grabbed' and the people have been 'awful'. But despite her growing career in writing and teaching - Antonia has already published one memoir, Spent, about her mother's illness and the sex industry and is currently writing a new self-help book for strippers - she admits that she has no plans to retire from the pole any time soon. Spreading the word: Antonia is currently writing a self-help book for other women working in the industry . Money matters: The writer, who has already published her memoir, Spent, insists that stripping is the most profitable profession for her to work in . 'My plan was to strip for a month or two, pay some bills and walk away unscathed with a cushion in the bank... 'Every stripper... I have ever met assumes they're just going to strip for one weekend to pay a stack of parking tickets or buy a plane ticket, but that's not what happens... 'I hope to build a life so huge outside the strip club that I won't need to dance anymore because I am too busy writing and teaching; creating other moments of joy and human connection in the classroom and on the page; to rise so far in that field that I won't need to land into laps again, but until that happens, I will strip.'","Antonia Crane has been stripping for 22 years and says she has no plans to retire .

After being released from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and fronting a press conference, the Dallas nurse was transported straight to the White House for a meeting with President Obama. The President warmly greeted the health worker with a hug. 'I feel fortunate and blessed to be standing here today,' the 26-year-old told reporters at the press conference. 'I would first and foremost like to thank God, my family, and friends. 'I would especially like to thank Dr Kent Brantly for his selfless act of donating plasma to me. 'I believe in the power of prayer, because I know so many people all over the world have been praying for me.' Scroll down for videos .

Support:  Nina Pham, center, with her mother Diana Berry, right, and sister Cathy Pham, left, smiles as members of the NIH staff outside applaud during a news conference in Maryland on Friday . Blessed: Nina Pham told reporters she felt 'fortunate and blessed to be standing here today' as she left the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) hospital outside Washington D.C. Quarantined: Miss Pham's beloved dog, Bentley, has been placed on a 21-day incubation following his owners Ebola diagnosis. He is due to be released on November 1 . 'Although I no longer have Ebola, I know it may be a while before I have my strength back.' Dr Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease chief at the NIH, was sure to reiterate at the press conference: ‘(Nina) is cured of Ebola.’ Miss Pham was one of two nurses in Dallas who became infected with Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the virus October 8. She was diagnosed on October 12, but has since tested negative to five DNA exams . Amber Vinson, the second nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola, was cleared of the virus earlier this week, her family said. Miss Pham received a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who was given the all-clear from Ebola after controversially being flown into the U.S. from Liberia. Those who have survived Ebola have antibodies in their blood which can help new sufferers beat the disease, doctors believe. Pham was transferred to the biocontainment unit of the NIH facility last week from Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where she contracted Ebola. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told The New York Times that Obama requested a meeting with Miss Pham when she heard she was about to be discharged. Earnest told the newspaper that no extra precautions were taken by having Miss Pham inside the Oval Office because a 'clean bill of health' is precaution enough. Earnest added that the President wanted to thank Miss Pham for caring for Thomas Eric Duncan. Miss Pham was expected to leave for her home in Dallas following the White House visit. At the press conference today, Miss Pham said she was eager to be reunited with her dog, Bentley, who was quarantined following his owner's diagnosis. Bentley will have see out a 21-day incubation, which is due to end November 1, before his properly reunited with Miss Pham. She is expected to visit Bentley before his release. Tragic: Nina Pham, 26, was fighting for her life after contracting Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan earlier this month. She has now been declared virus free and was released from hospital on Friday . Treatment: Nina Pham is seen here inside Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on Thursday October 16, 2014, before being flown to the National Institutes of Health outside Washington . Despite wearing protective gear that included gowns, gloves, masks and face shields while caring for Mr Duncan, Miss Pham became the first person to contract the disease on U.S. soil. Pham's parents live in Fort Worth, where they are part of a closely-knit, deeply-religious community of Vietnamese Catholics. Dr Brantly's blood donation is the third time the medic has helped an Ebola victim. He was found to have the same blood type as previous patient Dr Nick Sacra and NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who is still being treated. Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly 'selflessly' provided blood for a transfusion for Nina Pham . Incredibly, the nurse also matched with Dr Brantly and was given a transfusion of his blood in a move that doctors believe could save her life. Brantly is believed to have traveled to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Pham worked, to make the donation. Dr Kent Brantly was flown back from Liberia to the U.S. after contracting Ebola during his missionary work for Samaritan's Purse. He survived after receiving a dose of the experimental serum Z-Mapp and round-the-clock care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. On September 10, Dr Brantly donated blood to a fellow doctor, Dr Rick Sacra, who also contracted Ebola during his work in West Africa and survived the disease. He also offered his blood to Thomas Eric Duncan but their blood types didn't match. Pham was diagnosed after admitting herself to hospital when her temperature spiked – one of the first symptoms of the deadly virus. On Friday the Texas Department of State Health Services acknowledged the release of Miss Pham, who was moved to Maryland to recieve better care. On the mend: Miss Pham, seen here in a 2010 yearbook photo from Texas Christian University, will now return home to Dallas . 'I’m happy that Nina Pham is now free of Ebola, and her health continues to improve,' the department's commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, said in a statement. 'Ms. Pham’s recovery is a testament to her perseverance in the face of the disease, the excellent care she has received and the support she had of so many here in Texas and across the nation. 'Ms. Pham is returning to Texas where she will continue to rest and regain her strength, but there is nothing medically that will prevent her from resuming a normal life.' 'Based on all of the clinical findings and lab tests, we are completely confident that she has cleared the virus and is of no risk to transmit the virus to others.' Her release came on the day when New York was still reeling from the diagnosis of its first Ebola sufferer. Dr Craig Spencer, a Doctors without Borders volunteer, was diagnosed as carrying the virus on Thursday night after returning to the city from Guinea where he had been helping sufferers for a month. The doctor's fever spiked to 100.3 on Thursday which caused him to alert officials. He said he felt sluggish two days before but didn't necessarily think it was a sign of the illness. He enjoyed seven days in New York while carrying the disease and sparked terror across the affected areas. The 33-year-old went on a jog near his Harlem home, ate dinner at a restaurant and even went bowling. His fiancee is currently quarantined in New York's Belle Vue Hospital alongside him but is showing no signs of having caught the virus. Two friends the couple spent time with are also in self-isolation and are being monitored for signs of the disease. Route: Dr Craig Spencer made several stops across New York on Wednesday night just hours before his diagnosis . September 16: Dr Craig Spencer flew to Guinea to treat Ebola patients as a member of the French organization Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers) October 14: Dr Spencer  departed Guinea on a flight to Brussels. He reported no symptoms. October 17: He boarded a flight to the U.S. on Brussels Airlines Flight SN0501. Reported no symptoms. Arrived at JFK and was screened with no symptoms upon arrival. October 21: At 7 AM, he reported fatigue and exhaustion. No fever, vomiting, diarrhea. At around 3:00 PM, Dr Spencer visited The Meatball Shop for 40 minutes. The Meatball Shop is located at 64 Greenwich Avenue. Around 4:30 PM, the he visited the High Line. Walked on High Line and stopped at the Blue Bottle Coffee stand (10th Ave & W 16th St) At around 5:30 PM, he got off the High Line at 34th Street and took the 1 train to the 145th Street station. October 22: At around 1:00 PM, Dr Spencer went running along Riverside Drive and Westside Highway . Around 2:00 PM, he went to pick up Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm share at 143rd St and Amsterdam Avenue (Corbin Hill Farm) and picked up a box which he took to his apartment. At around 5:30 PM, Dr Spencer left for The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with two friends. For his arrival at Gutter, he took the A train at 145th Street and transferred at 14th Street and took the L train to Bedford Avenue. Around 8:30 PM, Dr Spencer left The Gutter. For his return trip, he used Uber as his means of transportation. October 23: Around 10:15AM, he first reported a fever. At this point, he called Medecins Sans Frontieres and the New York City Health Department. He was immediately taken to Bellevue by FDNY EMS.","Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas, caught the Ebola virus while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, in Dallas .

"Many women who juggle career and travel plans fear 'leaving it too late' to have a baby. But one professor has dismissed the theory that once women pass 30 they will immediately begin to suffer fertility problems. Psychologist Jean Twenge has controversially claimed that there's not really a difference between trying to get pregnant in your late twenties and your late thirties. Psychologist Jean Twenge has controversially claimed that there's not really a difference between trying to get pregnant in your late twenties and your late thirties . The San Diego State University professor has refuted statistics that claim there is a significant difference in the odds of getting pregnant in your late twenties. Prof Twenge claims that many women are reading statistics based on outdated records, taken from a time before antibiotics, electricity and advanced medical treatment were in use and the quality of life was much lower. The professor has dismissed statistics that claim there is a significant difference in the odds of getting pregnant in your late twenties . Writing in The Atlantic, the author - who has written the book 'The Impatient Women's Guide to Getting Pregnant' - says that she too feared she would be left childless as she had not tried for a baby and had passed 30. She said: 'Most books and websites I read said that one in three women ages 35 to 39 would not get pregnant within a year of starting to try. 'The first page of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's (ASRM) 2003 guide for patients noted that women in their late 30s had a 30 per cent chance of remaining childless altogether. 'The guide also included statistics that I’d seen repeated in many other places: a woman’s chance of pregnancy was 20 percent each month at age 30, dwindling to five per cent by age 40. 'Every time I read these statistics, my stomach dropped like a stone, heavy and foreboding.' She counsels that there is a just a . marginal difference between falling pregnant at 27 and 39 - despite what . the majority of websites and books say. Instead, she says that some statistics . widely touted today are actually based on data from French birth . records from 1670 to 1830. She also rubbishes the widely cited . statistic that one in three women ages 35 to 39 will not be pregnant . after a year of trying, which is based on a 2004 article in the Human . Reproduction journal, which used the historical record as its source. She says that women are now basing their pregnancy plans on these antiquated reports, and should focus on modern studies, that show a more encouraging outlook when it comes to getting pregnant. She rubbished the widely cited statistic that one in three women ages 35 to 39 will not be pregnant after a year of trying . She said a 2004 study in Obstetrics & Gynecology studied the chances of pregnancy among 770 European women, and found positive results. The study, led by David Dunson, discovered that of the subjects who had sex at least twice a week, 82 per cent of 35-to-39-year-old women conceived within a year, compared with 86 per cent of 27-to-34-year-olds. This showed that the fertility rates of women in their late 20s and early 30s was almost identical - which will bring considerable relief to worried women who fear that their chasing other priorities has wiped their chances of motherhood. The author seeks to calm the panic many women feel, using herself as an example - she had three children and all after the age of 35. She says fertility problems are not solely based on a woman's age, and points to endometriosis and blocked fallopian tubes for causing difficulties in conceiving. But her comments have been met with criticism from other experts, who insist that age does significantly affect fertility. Lord Winston, The Times reports, claims that medical data collated over 20 years shows a definite decline in fertility with age and, while warning doctors from urging women to have children at a young age, says that there is good evidence of a decline with age. The newspaper also reported that consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Valentine Akende said that generally, women's fertility rates began to slip at 31, dropped at age 37 and sharply fell after age 41. But despite Prof Twenge's reassurances, it would seem that the statistics have had a lasting impact on women's views of motherhood. According to a new survey, nearly 70 per cent . of British women think a woman having a baby in her forties is too old - . with the most critical being the older generation. Of those surveyed, over three quarters aged 55 and over were against woman having a baby in their fifth decade. The . survey, undertaken by YouGov on behalf of First Response Early . Pregnancy test, appears to show a deep-rooted discomfort with women who . delay motherhood until their fifth decade.","Psychologist Jean Twenge claims that there is a just a 'marginal difference' between falling pregnant at 27 and 39 .

"It is the kind of talk Alejandro Sabella is trying to discourage. This almost unbreakable belief, among Argentina’s players, that not only will they create chances but that Lionel Messi will almost certainly take them. It is some position to be in at a World Cup. A source of confidence that must empower every member of the Argentina squad. But Sabella keeps stressing the need to be less reliant on their captain and  inspiration and the chat among his players after securing safe passage to the last 16, and an encounter with Switzerland in Sao Paulo next week, will do little to appease him. Fernando Gago spoke of two certainties in the life of this Argentina team. Firstly: ‘That we’re going to have two or three great chances to score every game.’ And secondly: ‘That we’ve got the best player in the world.’ Vital: Lionel Messi has scored four goals for Argentina already at the World Cup . Side by side: Messi and Fernando Gago train for Argentina at their base just outside Belo Horizonte . Preparation: The Argentina team are put through their paces at their World Cup base . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . The four goals Messi has already scored in this tournament, the first two securing victory in their opening two group matches, would suggest Gago has a point. And in fairness to the Boca Juniors midfielder, he also acknowledged ‘the need’ for Argentina ‘to improve in other areas’. But Federico Fernandez echoed the view of his colleague on the remarkable Messi. ‘Well I think he’s demonstrated it again, hasn’t he?’ he said. ‘Another great goal, he always pops up.’ True enough he does, with impressive frequency. But Nigeria, like Iran before them, exposed a degree of vulnerability at the opposite end of the field and Peter Odemwingie sees a fragile defence as Argentina’s ‘weak link’. ‘They can definitely be opened up,’ said Stoke’s Nigerian international forward.  ‘No disrespect but there is not much pace in the middle and the second-half showed that. ‘If you don’t let them just play slowly from the back they are in trouble. The key to success against this team is to force them to kick it long. We did that, intercepted their long balls and went fast on the counter-attacks. Off his chest: Gago addresses the media at a press conference at Argentina's HQ . Laughing and joking: Messi, Javier Mascherano and Co are all smiles during training . Breaking the news: Team doctor Armando Daniel Martinez revealed Sergio Aguero will miss the next game . ‘I think even Iran had success against Argentina by doing that. We had seven, eight, nine shots we could have scored from today. ‘We also saw that when Argentina played Bosnia; how they played, there were chances for the opposition. Defence is not the strongest part of their game.  Iran could have scored a few so we went into this game knowing we could get goals. We got two and we could have had more.’ Sabella describes his side as an ‘offensive team’ and Odemwingie would not disagree. ‘The quality they have is all up front’ he said. ‘The movement of Higuain, Aguero, Di Maria, who surprised us with long-range shots today, that is their strength. Laid back: Messi and Angel Di Maria relax on the training field in Belo Horizonte . Full stretch: Goalkeeper Mariano Andujar tests his shot stopping skills . ‘But the defence, that’s their weak link. The way they play, to get their results, they have to take the game to the other half of the pitch. They know they have to do that because if they play in their own half they are going to be in trouble. They are doing the right thing, playing too their strengths.’ An interesting debate emerged from the post-match interview area at the Estadio Beira-Rio. Javier Mascherano thought there was already evidence to suggest the South American teams had an advantage because of the unique conditions in this part of the world. While Odemwingie thought the decisive factor would simply be fitness. ‘It’s not easy to play in America,’ said Argentina’s Mascherano. ‘I think now people are realising that. It’s different. World Cups here are more difficult. The pitches are not like they are in Europe. They’re drier, the climate is different, the time, there are lots of variables. The football is not played with the speed with which European teams are used to playing. Maybe that suits the South American teams more. Hopefully those variables will favour the South American teams because that would mean that we have a chance. Although Holland are not South American and they are playing very well.’ VIDEO Aguero set to miss Switzerland last-16 clash . Thirsty work: Former Liverpool star Maxi Rodriguez . Finger pointing: Argentine coach Alejandro Sabella . Test: Argentina play Switzerland in the last 16 in Sao Paulo next week . Odemwingie had a different view. ‘Any team can surprise anyone at this World Cup,’ he said. ‘My first impression from this tournament is that the fittest team will win it. If you don’t let the opposition play and you are fit, you are going to get scoring opportunities. And if you are very fit you don’t let them play. And that is the key to winning this World Cup. The second-halves are longer than you wish them to be here.’ Whoever turns out to be right, Argentina’s players accept they must show more discipline at the back. ‘There’s a lot to think about,’ said Marcos Rojo, who was not at his best in defence but did manage to score Argentina’s winning goal. ‘In defence we have to improve because they’ve put two past us and that puts pressure on those up front.’ As for the man himself, he sounded a little more positive. ‘It’s always good to win games at any level but there’s much more to come,’ said Messi. His team-mates expect nothing less.","Barcelona forward has been instrumental in Argentina's progress .

"Amazon sold more than three million items last Monday, making it the firm’s busiest day ever. The first Monday in December has earned the nickname ‘Cyber Monday’ as it is the busiest day for internet shoppers keen to ensure their order arrives in time for Christmas. Amazon’s British arm beat last year’s Cyber Monday total of 2.3million items, as the Christmas rush finally got started. Christmas rush: Amazon took orders for more than 3million items on 'Cyber Monday' The online retailer’s bestseller was its own Kindle e-reader, which costs £89. Christopher North, managing director of Amazon.co.uk, said: ‘This year, Cyber Monday saw the most items ever ordered in a single day with Kindle being the stand-out product.’ Christmas web sales are expected to rise 15 per cent this year, accounting for £7.75billion in sales. But there was also some relief for traditional retailers as millions of shoppers hit the High Street this weekend. It comes as chains across Britain slash their prices to lure Christmas shoppers into their stores, with many starting ‘panic sales’ long before Boxing Day. Boxed up: Amazon workers pack goods ready for shipping at the distribution centre in Swansea, Wales . Their takings are tipped to fall 2.1 per cent to £55.7billion. Top gadget: Kindle e-readers were the best-selling product that shoppers snapped up . More than 1.5million shoppers spent £180million in Central London on Saturday alone, according to the New West End Company, which represents around 600 traders in Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street. The company said it expected a further £100million to be spent yesterday (sun), and said technology and winter fashion had proved to be the best sellers. Chief executive Richard Dickinson said: ‘Based on past experience we were confident that despite the slow start to seasonal spending, shoppers would get the tills ringing over the next two weeks, but this weekend has exceeded expectations.’ Capital Shopping Centres, which operates 14 malls across Britain, including the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Thurrock, said more than eight million shoppers had visited its malls in the last week. Retail sales figures for November, out on Thursday, are expected to show that consumers have been forced to economise. High inflation has forced up the price of food, leaving shoppers with less money in their pockets. Unseasonably warm weather in October and November also meant there was low demand for winter fashion until the last two weeks. Oxford Street: More than 1.5million shoppers spent £180million in Central London on Saturday alone . Ongoing fears of a double dip recession and the possible collapse of the Eurozone are also expected to have hit High Street sales. Forecaster Capital Economics suggested there would be a last-minute rush for presents, but that it would probably lead to a very weak start to spending in the New Year. The success of e-readers, which can store between 1,000 and 10,000 e-books, has bucked the trend for dwindling sales figures. Kindle’s maker Amazon reported earlier this year that it was selling 105 e-books for every 100 printed books. The gadget is now facing increased competition from rivals Kobo, Sony and Apple’ s iPad.","Kindle e-readers best selling product snapped up .

"Having been flushed with the success of seeing Hull City reach the FA Cup final, a local bathroom maker has decided to commemorate the occasion with none other than... a limited edition 'Steve Bruce Tigers Toilet Seat'. Rather than being a poor excuse for toilet humour, Ideal Standard has created a toilet seat featuring the club's tiger stripes on one side - which could still cause some fans an upset stomach after owner Assem Allam's derided attempts to rebrand the club. But, perhaps even more concerning, is the image of Steve Bruce that greets the user once the lid has been lifted, supposedly a tribute to the first manager to lead Hull to a FA Cup final.

Not to be outdone, Hull have confirmed they would be staging their own celebrations, although at least the statement was less self assured: 'Should our historic appearance in the FA Cup final next weekend result in theTigers lifting the iconic trophy, a victory parade through the streets of Hull will take place on Sunday 18 May. 'The parade will start at the KC Stadium and take in many areas of Hull including Anlaby Road, the city centre, Holderness Road, Sutton Road, Greenwood Avenue, Hall Road, County Road, Pickering Road and Hessie.'

'This is certainly something a little bit fun and a little bit different, but because of our heritage and our innovative designers, we understand bathrooms better than anyone else and know that people want personalised solutions for their bathrooms at home.

"Adolf Hitler faked his own suicide and fled to Argentina where he lived until a ripe old age, according to extraordinary new claims. Authors of the new book ‘Grey Wolf: The Escape Of Adolf’ believe evidence of the tyrant’s suicide is flawed – and that he actually escaped in 1945 to begin a new life with his wife, Eva Braun. But the claims have been ridiculed by leading historian Guy Walters who today branded them ‘2,000 per cent rubbish.’ 'Junk history': Claims that Adolf Hitler, left, and his partner Eva Braun, right, fled Germany and survived in Argentina have been branded 'utter nonsense' by a leading historian . Hitler and Braun’s ‘flight’ from . Berlin is laid out in lavish detail by British authors Gerrard Williams . and Simon Dunstan in their new book. They refute the widely accepted view . that the Fuhrer shot himself in his Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945, and . Braun committed suicide by taking cyanide. Instead, they claim, there is . ‘overwhelming evidence’ to suggest that the couple escaped at the end of . the Second World War for a new life in a Nazi-controlled enclave in . Fascist Argentina. Mr Williams and Mr Dunstan go on to state the pair had two daughters before Hitler died in 1962 at the age of 73. Mr Williams, a historian and journalist who has written extensively about the Second World War, told Sky News: ‘We didn’t . want to re-write history, but the evidence we’ve discovered about the . escape of Adolf Hitler is just too overwhelming to ignore. ‘There is no forensic evidence for . his, or Eva Braun’s deaths, and the stories from the eyewitnesses to . their continued survival in Argentina are compelling.’ Escape: This map shows the route that Hitler and Braun are said to have used to escape from the Fuhrerbunker in Berlin when the Russians were approaching . The book also claims American . intelligence officials were complicit in the escape, in return for . access to war technology developed by the Nazis. It also says that skull fragments . thought to be those of Hitler currently held by the Russians are . actually that of a young woman under the age of 40. Hitler was 56 when . he died. Mr Williams said he and Mr Dunstan - an author, film-maker and photographer who specialises in military history - . carried out their research on the ground in Argentina, interviewing . eyewitnesses to Hitler’s presence there. He added: ‘It’s only now that Argentina is once more a thriving democracy that the real stories are beginning to come out. ‘Even so, two of our eyewitnesses received death threats from persons unknown while working with us on this book.’ The sensational claims have already . been ridiculed by historians, including Mr Walters, who has studied Nazi . Germany extensively and written a series of books about the war. He labelled the idea that Hitler . lived in South America until the 1960s as the ‘worst sort of junk . history’ that relied on ‘dubious secondary sources.’ He said: 'The theory that Hitler survived rubbishes decades of research by proper historians and intelligence officers. Hideaway: Decades of research has concluded that Hitler and Eva Braun died at the Fuhrerbunker in Berlin, pictured . New home: Hitler lived until the age of 73 in the foothills of the Andes mountains in Argentina, according to Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler . 'The two authors should be ashamed of . themselves for peddling this kind of utter nonsense. It's simply . unbelievable that publishers would give them the time of day. 'It's an absolute disgrace. There's . no substance to it at all. It appeals to the deluded fantasies of . conspiracy theorists and has no place whatsoever in historical research. 'There have been thousands of . theories over the years that Hitler might have escaped but they are . nothing more than parlor games. 'The evidence that Hitler was killed in simply overwhelming. For these authors to claim otherwise is simply staggering.' Mr Walters conceded that the authors are right in stating that the skull taken by the Russians was not that of Hitler. He said: 'There were many people in . the bunker and it takes a giant leap of the imagination to get from a . museum in Russia to him living a life in Argentina. 'The idea that everybody in the bunker was in on the plan is infeasible. It just would not have happened. 'The whole point of Hitler was that he would die after the war. It was not in his psychology to carry on living in Argentina.' Nazis: Josef Mengele, known as 'The Doctor of Auschwitz', left, escaped to South America after the War, as did Otto Adolf Eichmann, right . Rochus Misch, 94, Hitler’s former . radio operator and the last survivor of the Berlin bunker, says he saw . the bodies of ‘the boss’ and Eva Braun with his own eyes. He said: ‘I was in the room next door . when he shot himself. I did not hear the shot but I saw his uncovered . corpse when the door was opened. ‘I saw Hitler slumped with his head on the table. ‘I saw Eva Braun sitting dead in the . corner of the sofa, her head turned to Hitler, her knees pulled up to . her chest. She had a dark blue dress on and a white frill on her . collar.’ Dispelling the myths: Leading historian Guy Walters said the Hitler escape theory was 'junk' Historians hold him up as a reliable . source and he is the author of a book, published several years ago, . called The Last Witness. Grey Wolf focuses on the crucial days in 1945 as the allies closed in on Hitler’s bunker. Mr Williams and Mr Dunstan claim a body double took Hitler’s place and an actress stood in for Eva Braun on April 27. It was at this point that the pair . were able to flee Berlin, travelling to Tonder in Denmark before . returning to Travemunde in Germany. From here it is claimed that they . flew to a Spanish military base at Reus, south of Barcelona, before . General Franco supplied a plane to take them to Fuerteventura in the . Canary Islands. A day later the two fugitives are . said to have boarded a U-boat and the two body doubles were executed and . their bodies subsequently burned. The book points to declassified FBI . documents which contain references to Hitler having escaped Berlin to . begin a new life in South America. It also includes testimony from the . pilot who supposedly flew Hitler and Eva Braun out of Berlin to Mar Del . Plata on the Argentinian coast. Here they say he lived in a wooden chalet in a remote village where they survived on the money from looted gold and jewellery. The book quotes a number of sources, . such as cooks and doctors, who claim to have knew the Nazi leader before . he died aged 73 on February 13, 1962. They claim that Hitler's . bloodline survived through two daughters he had with Braun. If Hitler had escaped to Argentina, . he would have been following in the footsteps of his henchmen, Mengele, . Eichmann and Barbie who all fled after the war to South America. A film based on the claims called Grey Wolf is currently being made and is due to be released early next year. It is not the first time that Hitler has been rumoured to have fled to Argentina. Author Abel Basti claimed the same in his 2003 book Hitler In Argentina. He said Hitler and Braun fled to Argentine shores aboard a submarine and lived for many years in the vicinity of San Carlos de Bariloche, a tourist site and ski haven some 1,000 miles southwest of Buenos Aires. In his book Bariloche Nazi-Guía Turística he reproduced documents, affidavits, photographs and blueprints aimed at steering the reader to the sites that sheltered Hitler and his top henchmen. He claimed the Incalco Ranch, located in Villa la Angostura on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi, was the refuge chosen by Argentine Nazis to hide the couple. Set amid a pine forest, it could only be reached by boat or hydroplane, and belonged to Argentine businessman Jorge Antonio, one of the most trusted friends of three-times president Juan Domingo Perón. Basti also claimed Hitler had lived at Hacienda San Ramon, six miles east of Bariloche, which belonged at the time to Schaumberg-Lippe principality.","Rumours suggest the couple fled to South America by submarine .
Claims have been ridiculed as '2,000 per cent rubbish'"
"For those of a certain age with longer memories, it doesn’t seem like yesterday that Arsenal captains were suffering shoulder pain from lifting so much silverware and dropping Steve Morrow on his head.

"A father-of-two was arrested in front of his children after a mix-up over his phone number led to him being wrongly investigated for fraud. Robert Turner was thrown into police cells for nearly three hours after a morning arrest at his home in Throop, Dorset last month. After weeks of waiting, he was told he would not face charges earlier this month. He believes the mistaken arrest was due to him being given a 'recycled' phone number when he switched to Virgin Media last year. Robert Turner was arrested in front of his eight-year-old daughter Megan after he was investigated for fraud because of a mix-up with his 'recycled' phone number . Mr Turner switched to the company from BT last year and was promptly given a new number by his new landline supplier. He then started receiving mysterious phone calls from debt collectors for a business completely unknown to him. He said: 'We were getting six, seven or more calls a day. There were calls from debt collectors demanding money.' Mr Turner found his new number listed on a website for a company and tried to contact them to ask them to remove it, without success. Mr Turner believes his arrest was due to him being given a 'recycled' number when he switched telephone companies last year . He says he called Virgin Media a number of times but there were long delays to having his number changed. He said: 'They just said nothing could be done unless the company removed the number from its website and advised me it could be identity theft.' Describing his arrest, which took place on December 14, he said: 'I had just done breakfast for my girls when the door went at 8.45am. 'They told me I was under arrest for fraudulent representation. I was still in my dressing gown and my eight-year-old daughter was stood next to me. 'Then they followed me upstairs to get dressed. It was humiliating.' Mr Turner said police told him his telephone number had been registered to a debit card which had made four fraudulent transactions. However, his name and address were not registered to the card. After weeks with the arrest hanging over him, he was told on January 7 that he would not face charges. He said he does not blame police for investigating but was angry with Virgin Media. A spokesman for Virgin Media said they do 'recycle' phone numbers of former customers but only after a certain period of time had lapsed. The spokesman said: '(Mr Turner) signed up to the company in May 2014 and did not register for a number change until October. 'Mr Turner's account was in arrears when he first requested his number changed. Once paid he declined our offer to do this for several months. We supplied his account file (to him) as requested.' Dorset Police declined to comment on the case.","Father changed phone companies and was given 'recycled' number .

"Author William Hanson says there is a pandemic of party rudeness that has gripped the nation . The story about the parents of a five-year-old being sent a ‘no show’ invoice for £15.95 for failing to honour their word about their son’s attendance at his friend’s ‘slide and ride’ birthday party at a ski centre in Plymouth has hit the headlines. The bill senders (the birthday boy's parents) are getting some flack for issuing the invoice in the first place – I agree, a tad weird and certainly not the correct thing – but I do applaud their courage. Especially given the Nash family had replied officially confirming their son Alex’s attendance but decided to go with, what will appear to the jilted hosts to be a ‘better offer,’ of a family day visiting relatives. Supposedly no contact details were available for the hosts so the Nash’s couldn’t contact them to rescind Alex’s attendance. As bizarre as this particular scenario may be, this family in Plymouth (hardly the party-centre of the UK, I admit) is just one example of the pandemic of party rudeness that has gripped the nation. No one knows how to behave at parties anymore. Times change, I get it. But when it comes to the world of entertaining there are some areas that I feel should be sacrosanct. As a regular host I can get quite worked up when I attend the events of others to see guests behaving in a fashion, which to my eyes, feels less than courteous. Scroll down for video . Maybe attending . Hosts of any age are really asking for it when they opt to invite their chosen guests via Facebook. Although it can be helpful for getting together large numbers of friends, it has its pitfalls - namely this magic third-option for soirées that Mr Zuckerberg has invented: maybe attending. A guest is not 'maybe' attending. You’re either going, or you’re not. If you are unsure if you can go but need to check, hold off clicking anything. It’s quite simple. Some techno-babe once told me why people often click maybe attending. She said that invited guests would feel like they’d offend the host by saying they weren’t coming. Again, as a host, I know that not everyone can come to everything, but need to know final numbers so I know how many canapés to make. What would happen if all guests clicked maybe attending? Derek Nash was issued an invoice for £15.95 by a fellow parent after he failed to take Alex, pictured, to his classmate's birthday party at a ski slope in Plymouth after saying he would be attending . The pre-party . Some under 35s are now particularly guilty of initiating what we shall term a ‘pre-party’. This is where one of the guests decides to invite a select few to their house at the same time as the initial party for a ‘warm up’. Not only does it somewhat upstage the original host, but also should the stealth gathering be discovered it could seriously damage friendships. At one party I attended, the host actually commented, after 50 minutes, as to the whereabouts of the 14 other guests. Only me, the host’s partner and two others had arrived on time. Then, at 8.25pm, the remainder of the guests list arrived en masse with no explanation as to where they had all been or why they were all arriving together. If you don't want to find yourself on the end of an unwanted invoice follow my top tips for being the perfect party guest... 1. Reply . All invitations, whether through the post, online or in your child’s satchel must be replied to within 2-3 days of receiving them. Correct form is usually to reply to the invitation in the same way it was sent – so if your friend invites you by text, a text message back with your response is acceptable. 2. Attend . If you say you are going – go! Even if you get a better offer you can’t back out. For most social parties you allow 10-15 minutes before showing up. Thus, if the invitation says 7.30pm, you arrive at 7.40ish. 3. Bring something . Unless it is a very formal affair then it is now customary to bring a ‘hostess gift’ (still called that if it’s a single man hosting you). Never bring flowers that will need to be stuck in water upon arrival – you’re just turning up with a job for your hosts. 4. Mingle . Yes, there may well be guests you don’t find that stimulating, or ones who you could speak to all evening, but the objective at parties is to mix with as many people as possible. For dinners this is trickier as you are static for most of it, but for drinks or cocktail parties ensure you spend roughly no more than 10-12 minutes with as many guests as possible. 5. Say thank you ­ . For good friends sending a text once you get home safely and to say a quick thank you is a nice touch, but is no substitute for something a little nicer and more tangible through the post. Send your thank you letter or card within 36 hours of the party’s end. Time-keeping . As we have seen, people can play fast and loose with the arrival time but so many people are oblivious to the ‘10 minutes late’ rule - where you arrive just after the stated event time to give your host a bit of breathing time. When I explain this to those who don’t understand it, they are unfailingly not hosts themselves, and therefore see no need for guests to give that safe breathing space to their hosts. A few weeks ago, 65 per cent of the guest list swanned into a housewarming a whole two hours late! This only served in making those who had gone to the effort to arrive on cue feel like they’d now be rude to leave. Maybe this is the new form and it’s just me? If you say you’re going to something you go for all of it, or none at all. Mr Nash found a brown envelope containing this invoice in his son's school bag . Snubbing . As we have seen today with the party peril in Plymouth, sometimes we do get a better invitation to something or our plans and family circumstances change. But if we have already committed, then it is tough cheese and well done to the host for being organised and getting their invitations out first. If you’ve said you’re going… guess what… you’re going! Only work or fatal illnesses are valid excuses in my book. And in those rare cases you send flowers and/or a hand-written missive to apologise. If two drinks parties are close by then it may be possible to attend both. Even if it is just showing your face to ‘make a cameo appearance’. An acquaintance of mine committed to a party two months ago and failed to show, with no explanation sent to our host (a mutual friend). The morning after the night before, on Facebook, a picture of her appeared at a bar with her friends… If you are going to be so rude as to snub, have a bit of intelligence about it. As a host, I worry about the details and how someone’s actions, whether giving or receiving the hospitality, will affect others. Clearly there is currently a rather inelegant acceptability as to what counts as ‘correct form’ when it comes to modern parties. People just don’t seem to care anymore. For those who couldn’t care less, don’t bother inviting them. Spend the money and effort on those who ‘get it’ and not those who presumptuously believe they’re such good value at balls and bashes they’ll be invited to the next one. William Hanson is author of The Bluffer's Guide To Etiquette.","Nash family from Plymouth sent £15.95 invoice for not attending party .

"Good Samaritan: Lauren Mohr, 34, died early Thursday after stopping to help car-crash victims on I-91 in New Haven, Connecticut . A kind-hearted waitress who stopped to help people involved in a car accident in Connecticut was killed after after falling off a highway bridge. State police say 34-year-old Lauren Mohr, of Wallingford, had just finished a shift at Barcelona Restaurant in New Haven at around 12.30am when she witnessed a hit-and-run crash on nortbound Interstate 91 and pulled over to help the victims. She was waiting for police to arrive on the scene when she allegedly jumped over a concrete wall in an attempt to evade an oncoming car and fell 40 feet from an overpass bridge to her death. She was rushed to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later. A Quinnipiac University spokesman said Mohr was a temporary admissions aide at that school, where her stepmother, Joan Mohr, was the vice president of admissions. 'Lauren was courageous and optimistic, and had faced a lot of challenges in her life, which made her a caring and wise person. Friends and family would seek her advice and she will be remembered as our hero,' Lauren's father Lawrence Mohr, said in a statement issued by the university. One of Mohr's co-workers at Barcelona said he wasn't at all surprised that she would have pulled over to help the crash victims. Crash scene: Mohr allegedly was trying to dodge an on-coming car when she jumped over the side of a concrete wall and fell 40 feet from this overpass bridge to her death . 'She was just a kind soul and that's just the way she lived her life,' Bart Maldonado told WFSB. 'That's just the way she was.' Before working at Quinnipiac and Barcelona, Mohr served for four years in the US Air Force and was trained as a medical technician. She was also an organ donor. She recently received her associate's degree in social work and planned to continue her studies in the field next fall at Southern Connecticut State University. None of the five people in the two cars involved in the accident was injured. One of the drivers, . Elvin Ayala, 33, has been identified as the driver of the 2005 Infiniti G35 that plowed into the back of Elizabeth Kranz's Mercedes-Benz on I-91 and then fled the scene, reported NBC Connecticut. The driver later turned himself in to police and was charged with operating a vehicle with a suspended license and following too closely. Police said he will not be charged in connection with Mohr’s death. Selfless: Mohr, an Air Force veteran and trained medical technician, was remembered by family and friends as a kind-hearted woman who was studying to become a social worker . Lynn Bushnell, vice president for public affairs at Quinnipiac University, said the college community was saddened to learn of Mohr's death. 'The university would like to extend its sincerest condolences to the Mohr family and ask that you continue to keep Lauren's family and her many friends in your thoughts and prayers,' she said. The 34-year-old woman leaves behind her husband, Nate, her parents and stepmother, sister Arwen, as well as her beloved cat, Becky.","Lauren Mohr, 34, was reportedly trying to dodge an oncoming car when she jumped over a concrete wall and died .

"The Duke University freshman who was outed as a porn star has shot back at her critics, saying she is 'empowered' by her work. The student who goes by the stage name Belle Knox appeared on Piers Morgan Live Thursday night after taking a brief break from school to deal with the backlash on campus. 'I'm not being exploited, I love what I'm doing and I'm safe,' Knox, a women's studies major, said. Scroll down for video . Empowered: Belle Knox has been doing the rounds of cable news shows and writing op-eds about porn and feminism . Financial burden: Knox says she first starting working in the adult film industry to pay her $47,000 in tuition . Knox made headlines last month when fellow freshman Thomas Bagley spilled her secret at a fraternity event. After that the news spread like wildfire on the North Carolina campus and Knox says it got to the point where she felt unsafe, so the university let her take a few days off classes. 'They've been very supportive of me. We're working really hard to make sure that I'm safe ,' she said. In her CNN interview, Knox went into more detail about how she got into the porn industry, while also voicing some of her regrets. She says she decided to start starring in adult films when she received her financial aid package for Duke and found out she was going to need to pay about $47,000 a year. 'The financial aid that I was given to pay for my tuition was insufficient and just really an enormous financial burden on my family,' she said. Revealed: The Duke University student was outed as a porn star when a fellow freshman spilled the beans at a fraternity event last month . On her side: Knox says she's faced some hostility on campus - mostly from other girls - but that most people have been supportive . Knox, who has two other siblings, decided to start shooting adult films since the pay was good and didn't require a huge time commitment. 'I set my own schedule,' she said, adding that she makes $1,200 a scene. 'I don't have to worry about not getting sleep or not doing my work because I'm working three jobs.' But she also says she hid her part-time job from her parents, which is something she now regrets. 'I regret not telling my family from the get-go. I think that was a really big mistake,' Knox said. Knox wouldn't go into detail about how her family has reacted to the news, but says she's not worried her porn work will come between them. Joy: Knox previously said that her experience in porn has brought her 'unimaginable joy' 'My family loved me six months ago when I wasn't a porn star, so I don't know what would make them not love me now,' she said. Knox even went so far as to say that if her own future daughter wanted to go into porn, she would support her. 'I would want my daughter to make an informed decision about her career and I think it's absolutely her choice,' she said. But Knox admits that the news of her porn career has made life on campus difficult. Bullied: Knox says people have set up fake Twitter accounts and used them to harass her . Threats: Knox says both she and her family have received threats since her identity was revealed . She says she can't go out like she used to anymore because fellow students are hostile to her - especially other girls. However, . Knox says the majority of campus is on her side and supportive. She . estimated that 70 per cent of her fellow students, especially the LGBTQ . community, were behind her while the other 30 per cent of 'frat guys' and girls seem to 'hate' her . Also on the show, Morgan asked how Knox came up with her stage name. She . says the first name is for the princess in the Beauty and the Beast, as . well as the character Belle de Jour from British television drama . 'Secret Diary of a Call Girl'. She . takes her last name from Amanda Knox, the infamous 26-year-old . suspected of sexually assaulting and then murdering her British roommate . while studying abroad in Italy in 2007.

"A confident Duchess of Cornwall nearly stole the show as she arrived looking wonderful in a regal white gown and diamond tiara that echoed the Queen's ensemble in Westminster today. Just over a year since she made her debut appearance at the State Opening of Parliament, her repeat visit today will be seen as a victory for Prince Charles who has long wanted his wife to play a greater role in royal life. And it seems his work has paid off after a radiant Camilla drew admiring glances and loud cheers from the crowds outside the Palace of Westminster as she made her way inside on her husband's arm.

The past month has been a difficult one for Camilla, who is still struggling to come to terms with the sudden death of her brother Mark Shand at the end of April. But instead of retreating to her country home, the Duchess has thrown herself into royal duties and yesterday joined the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh for a garden party at Buckingham Palace. Today, glamorous in a white gown, traditional sash and a diamond tiara, the Duchess looked every inch the princess, although even she couldn't eclipse the Queen, who wore the magnificent Imperial State Crown as she made her address to Parliament. With 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and five rubies, the crown, which was made for the coronation of George VI in 1937, is one of the most important of the Crown Jewels. Based on an earlier version made for Queen Victoria, the crown also boasts several famous jewels, among them King Edward's Sapphire which was taken from a ring belonging to the Anglo-Saxon king and builder of the first Westminster Abbey, Edward the Confessor.

Escort: Yeomen of the Guard prepare to conduct the ceremonial search ahead of the Queen's arrival at the Palace of Westminster for the State Opening of Parliament . The most important of all the Queen's crowns, the current Imperial State Crown was made in 1937 and boasts 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and five rubies. Although there has been an Imperial State Crown since the 15th century, there have been several different versions with the current one based on Queen Victoria's. Among the jewels is the sapphire of King Edward the Confessor, the Anglo-Saxon king who founded Westminster Abbey. Joining the Queen and Camilla at the Houses of Parliament were Prince Charles, who sported a traditional military uniform, and a cheerful-looking Duke of Edinburgh. The royal party arrived after the traditional ceremonial procession from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, which also saw the debut of the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach. The vehicle, which contains fragments from Henry VIII's doomed battleship, the Mary Rose, a bullet from the Battle of Waterloo and a piece of Newton's apple tree, boasts diamond doorhandles and a hidden 'Queen cam' which offers a 360 degree view of the crowds. Among the other historical mementos incorporated into the coach are slivers from Scott’s Antarctic sled, a part of Hut Six, which was one of several used at codebreaking centre Bletchley Park, and a piece of Scotland’s Stone of Destiny, upon which monarchs are traditionally crowned. The state opening of Parliament marks the start of a busy few days for the Queen, who tomorrow will travel to France for a state visit. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the monarch will travel to Paris by Eurostar and will be welcomed by French president François Hollande at the Arc de Triomphe. Later, the Queen will travel to the Elysée Palace for meetings with France's socialist head of state ahead of a garden party at the British Ambassador's residence in Paris. The following day, the Queen will join the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall in Normandy for a series of visits commemorating the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, before returning to the Elysée Palace for a state dinner.

"A common viral infection could increase a person's risk of developing diabetes later in life - and they may not even realise they have contracted it. The Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is part of the herpes family and can be sexually-transmitted. It can also be spread via coughs and sneezes and it is estimated around half of all adults have been infected. The virus tends to remain dormant and most people don't exhibit any symptoms, but if they do they are similar to flu. Around half of people in the UK are thought to be infected with the Cytomegalovirus . However, new research  from Leiden University and the University of Tubingen in Germany suggests it is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes in the elderly. They found adults aged 85 and over who were infected with cytomegalovirus were about twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes compared with those not infected. The team analysed information from more than 500 elderly adults in the Netherlands. Around 80 per cent were infected with cytomegalovirus and 15 per cent had type 2 diabetes. While 17 percent of those infected with cytomegalovirus had type 2 diabetes, only 7.9 per cent of those without the virus had the condition. People with type 2 diabetes tend to have their blood glucose levels checked every two to six months . Obesity and aging are known to be associated with insulin resistance, one of the first signs of type 2 diabetes. However, only a third of these people go on to develop the condition. Those who develop type 2 diabetes usually have raised levels of biological markers for inflammation such . as larger numbers of active white blood cells. The researchers found chronic infections including CMV can 'stress' the immune system. They suggested the virus could be acting directly on pancreatic cells or indirectly by causing the immune system to attack the pancreas. The study appears in BioMed Central's open access journal Immunity and Ageing.",The Cytomegalovirus is part of the herpes family and tends to remain dormant .
"A couple who escaped a fire earlier this week with nothing except the clothes on their backs have married outside their ruined home after firemen rescued their engagement ring from the ashes. With no dress, no flowers, and watched by only a small crowd of family and friends, Brian Osborne, 34, wed fiancee Megan Hunley today on the front lawn of their scorched house in Ledyard, Conn. The couple were forced to flee the burning building only last Monday, leaving everything behind, including an engagement ring Brian had been planning to give to Megan. A couple who fled a house fire with nothing but the clothes on their backs a week ago have married outside their burned house after firemen found their engagement ring in the ashes . Brain Osborne had been planning to propose to girlfriend Megan Hunley, and had the ring hidden in their bedroom, but was forced to flee without it when the fire started . Brian thought the ring had been burned with the rest of his possessions, but after the blaze was put out he asked a firefighter to go back in and look for it just in case. In an upstairs bedroom, underneath a pile of rubble, the fireman found a charred box and when he opened it, saw that the ring had escaped unharmed. He carried it back outside to Brian who proposed on the spot, and now, just over a week later, the couple are happily married. Wearing nothing but the clothes they escaped the blaze in, Megan and Brian married, and say they want the occasion to act as a reminder that all they need is each other. Speaking to WSFB, Megan said: 'I wouldn't want it any other way. All that other stuff is materialistic. I don't think we ever imagined this, I don't think anyone ever does.' After the blaze was extinguished Brian asked a firefighter to go back in and look for the ring, and to his amazement, the man found it unharmed in the bedroom . When the fireman brought the ring back out Brian proposed on the spot, and the couple married outside the house as a reminder that all they need is each other . Referring to the moment the ring emerged from the fire, she added: 'I cried. It was just an amazing moment because you think, why, of everything, why did this make it?' The couple were joined on their front lawn by 40 guests, including Osborne’s two children who were also in the house at the time of the blaze, but managed to escape unharmed. Several members of the Gales Ferry Volunteer Fire Company were also invited. Brain said: 'It's a great way to start over. It's all symbolic, we look at everything we've been through and think, why waste it, you never know what's next.'","Brian Osborne, 34, was planning to propose to girlfriend Megan Hunley .

"It's not just a fourth stand they are building at Bristol City. Sadly for Steve Cotterill, though, they will have to wait a while longer to underline their progress by taking the scalp of a big team. For large swathes of this match, it looked possible. West Ham were often desperately poor and Bristol City were frequently exciting. They attacked with pace and without fear; they created chances and did everything except take them. Twice Matt Smith won headers within a dangerous range and twice he beat Adrian in West Ham’s goal. Twice, there was a man waiting on the line to clear. That final yard was the hurdle and curse for a club who only have three quarters of a stadium, but dream big and sit second in League One.

For Sam Allardyce, there can only be relief that Diafra Sakho was fit after three weeks out and able to come off his bench to head an 81st-minute winner. Certainly any pride will need to be balanced against what was a weak performance, particularly from his midfielders. But into the draw they go and that, for this club more than some, is important. Allardyce knows his side have an opportunity in this competition in light of Saturday’s magnificent upsets – not to mention the freedom afforded by West Ham’s good league position – and it was the gist of his team talk. Allardyce said: ‘I said to the players, “Don’t be a victim. Don’t be another casualty. Be professional in what you do and if they are to beat you they have to produce something special”. It was a hard-earned victory and one we are grateful for. ‘A team in the lower divisions can, in one day, beat the most forceful team in the Premier League. Chelsea conceded four at home to Bradford. Big teams can always get knocked out. Gladly we are one of the bigger teams not crying all the way home. ‘Now it will all depend on the draw. I know it’s said that somewhere along the line you are going to get a Premier League team. But I hope we get them when we’re in the final and not before.’ Cotterill, meanwhile, tried to strike a philosophical tone but knows a chance went untaken. ‘We won’t be slitting our wrists because we got beat 1-0 by West Ham,’ he said. ‘It’s just a slight disappointment because with a bit of luck we might have knocked them out. ‘I think the results on Saturday made it more difficult for us. I am not saying West Ham wouldn’t have been focused but if they weren’t then those results would have made them more focused. ‘They picked a good, strong, experienced team.’ Indeed, Allardyce made only one change to the side that crushed Hull in the Premier League last weekend, with Winston Reid stepping in for James Collins, who has a back problem. It was about as strong a side as West Ham could field; it was a side that spent all but the final 10 minutes of the first half struggling to draw breath.

Luke Freeman (right) looks to shield the ball from James Tomkins during a difficult first half for the Hammers . Our brilliant Match Zone service shows that Sakho's far post header came after good work down the right from Carroll . With an extra man in the middle, City were winning the battle for midfield and in Luke Freeman, once of Arsenal but more recently Stevenage, they had a man who was able to take control. In Alex Song, West Ham had a top-class midfielder on loan from Barcelona who seemingly couldn’t pass to a team-mate. Combined, it meant City were on top for most of the half, happy to counter or dictate. The first warning was sounded after six minutes when Smith’s header beat Adrian and was cleared by Mark Noble. Smith then sent a second header past the keeper, only to be brilliantly cleared by Andy Carroll. West Ham looked in desperate trouble. In one challenge, Emmanuel-Thomas floored Winston Reid – the clichés about lower league sides making life uncomfortable for the big boys were also acted out. Allardyce responded by hooking off Song and Enner Valencia for Morgan Amalfitano and Sakho shortly after the restart and West Ham gradually held more possession. But even then there was no evidence that one side is almost two divisions to the north of the other, Smith underlying the point by heading over. But then Sakho took hold of this game. In the space of two minutes he was blocked by Aden Flint and also grazed the bar after showing some delightful skill on his way to goal. When Carroll hooked over a cross 10 minutes from time Sakho jumped up and won the game, even if Smith was given the opportunity to miss yet another header. ‘We were never at our very best but we did enough to get through to the next round,’Allardyce said. In the context of a remarkable weekend, that will have to do. Smith thought he had given Bristol a deserved lead after sending his header towards goal only to see it cleared by Carroll .

"Hundreds of 'lethal' fake Frozen toys and clothes have been seized and destroyed after concerns they could burst into flames and strangle children. The dodgy Disney items, including counterfeit dolls, umbrellas, watches, backpacks and blankets, were seized at a toy shop last week. Shockingly, fancy dress costumes and pyjamas do not conform to 'flammability' standards and are likely to catch fire. The haul comes just weeks ago Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman's eight-year-old daughter  suffered serious burns following a horrific Halloween accident. Some of the fake Frozen goods seized by Nottinghamshire County Council's Trading Standards team which include children's pyjamas, dolls, fancy-dress costumes, umbrellas,  watches, backpacks and blankets . Matilda Thykier's witch costume was set alight by a candle on the doorstep of a house while she was out trick or treating on Friday 31. She was taken to hospital for treatment of severe burns and Zoe Ball stepped in to host Strictly Come Dancing for several weeks after the incident as Ms Winkleman refused to leave her daughter's side. Meanwhile hooded tops were found to have lethal cords which were deemed a strangulation risk. Trading Standards officers from Nottinghamshire County Council seized the fake merchandise from a toy shop in Newark, Notts., during a raid last Tuesday (25/11). Councillor Alice Grice, vice-chair of the council's community safety committee, said: 'Official Frozen merchandise is amongst this year's 'must-have' Christmas presents for children - but unfortunately, counterfeiters who want to cash-in on the craze are all too aware. 'With the high demand for official merchandise, many parents are struggling to find items for sale and may be tempted to buy counterfeit versions. 'However, by doing so parents might be unwittingly putting their child in serious danger. 'Many cheap toys and goods from outside the European Union are often badly-made and in many cases, dangerous. 'We would advise parents to be especially wary when buying items like this from individuals or non-reputable companies on online auction or social media sites.' It is suspected that a number of the items do not conform to EU safety regulations, including pyjamas and fancy-dress costumes that are unlikely to meet flammability guidelines . The Trading Standards team had received a tip-off from a concerned member of the public about the counterfeit haul at a Newark toy shop . The seizure follows warnings by parents last week about counterfeit 'snap' bracelets which were made out of measuring tape and sheets of metal and had fake Frozen branding on. Sales of Frozen toys are set to hit an all-time high, outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released. The storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter. The film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion, while the song ‘Let it Go’ won an Oscar and became a social media phenomenon. The demand for Frozen merchandise is high. With the interactive Frozen Snow Glow Elsa who sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99, tipped to be the most in demand toy this Christmas, stores such as Tesco, Toys r Us and Argos, are struggling to keep up. Some list the item as unavailable while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves. The demand for Frozen merchandise saw another haul of fake toys  seized by trading standards officers last week. The haul of 1,960 knock off toys were seized at the Port of Dover in Kent - including 426 Frozen character dolls from the blockbuster Disney film,was the biggest ever seized.","Trading Standards seized the fake merchandise from a toy shop in Newark .

"Sepp Blatter, the under-fire FIFA president, has shrugged off the increasing pressure to act over allegations of corruption around the bidding process that enabled Qatar to secure the 2022 World Cup. Despite further revelations of bribery claims surrounding the selection of Qatar — and Russia for the 2018 tournament — Blatter stuck to FIFA’s party line yesterday. He took to Twitter to say simply: ‘Never ignoring media reports on ethics allegations in football. But let the Ethics Committee work!’ Under fire: Blatter (right) has been criticised over the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar . This was a reference to the inquiry already being carried out by FIFA’s own investigator, New York lawyer Michael Garcia, who is set to complete his report on Monday. Against the backdrop of public statements of concern from Sony, Visa and adidas, who pay millions to sponsor the World Cup, 78-year-old Blatter will attempt to carry on regardless, particularly as the 2014 World Cup is due to begin here on Thursday and in the week when FIFA will also stage their annual congress in Sao Paulo. While Blatter will face more calls this week to order a new vote he is due to deliver his address to congress on Tuesday. The response from the three main sponsors, who are calling for a thorough investigation, follows yet more revelations in The Sunday Times, with this week’s evidence from a cache of millions of documents alleging a more direct link between the disgraced former FIFA vice-president, Mohamed bin Hammam, and the Qatar bid team. This comes after Qatar officials insisted that bin Hammam was working independently of the bid, with any payments he might have made to FIFA officials designed only to secure support in his attempt to usurp Blatter as FIFA president. Challenge: Blatter is expected to seek a fifth term as president though Michel Platini may contest the election . In Danger: Sony is one of FIFA's key sponsors, and have called for a 'thorough investigation' In a statement yesterday adidas followed Sony in voicing concerns. ‘We are confident that the matter is being dealt with as a priority,’ said the German sportswear brand, their current sponsorship deal with FIFA due to run until 2030. ‘Adidas enjoys a long-term and successful partnership with FIFA that we are looking forward to continue. Having said that, the negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is  neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners.’ By then Sony had already called for a ‘thorough investigation’ into the bribery claims, while Visa said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation. ‘We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,’ it said in a statement. Sony said: ‘As a FIFA partner, we expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately. We continue to expect FIFA to adhere to its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations.’ It is certainly unusual for FIFA’s sponsors to break ranks. Adidas have been a sponsor since 1970, after all. But there are echoes of the Salt Lake City winter Olympics scandal here, given it was only when the major sponsors began to turn that the full extent of the corruption was revealed. While FIFA earned around £800million last year alone through the sale of broadcasting rights and sponsorship, Sony, adidas and Visa are among the six sponsors who collectively paid more than £100m in 2013. At this stage the airline Emirates, South Korean car giant Hyundai/Kia and Coca-Cola remain silent on these allegations of corruption. But the latest allegations have certainly raised the stakes with claims that bin Hammam, already banned for life by FIFA, brokered meetings between Qatari officials and national governments to discuss bilateral trade deals. In Qatar, they insist they remain confident they will not be stripped of the 2022 World Cup. The response by the Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy came shortly after Sony spoke out. Decision time: New York lawyer Michael Garcia will finish his investigation into the World Cup bids on Monday . A statement from Qatar said: ‘There is an ongoing investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bid process, with which we have fully co-operated. Consistent with FIFA’s rules we have been asked to refrain from commenting on the investigation and we will comply with that request. ‘Qatar has won the bid on its merits and we are confident that at the end of the appropriate  process, the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar will stand.’ Here in Sao Paulo the only positive was the progress that is being made at the Arena de Sao Paulo. There were concerns that the 61,000-seater stadium would not be completed in time and even yesterday workmen were still racing to put the finishing touches to the ground ahead of Thursday’s opening encounter between Brazil and Croatia. But inside it looked complete and last night they hosted a junior match and ran through an opening ceremony rehearsal. That the £180m stadium is situated so close to where people are living in abject poverty, in the favellas that dominate this area, could yet present more problems for the organisers this week. Even if a strike among the underground rail network workers appears to have been averted. Right now, though, the greater concern for FIFA surrounds the staging the two tournaments that follow this one.","Further evidence linking disgraced Mohamed bin Hammam to Qatar bid .

"An offshoot of the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency has begun operating on southern Afghanistan, less than three months after British combat troops withdrew from the region. A man identified as Mullah Abdul Rauf was actively recruiting fighters for the groups, flying black flags and, according to some sources, even battling Taliban militants. Local sources said Rauf, a former Guantanamo Bay prisoner, had set up his base in Helmand province and was offering good wages to anyone willing to fight for the Islamic State. Spreading state: Kashmiri protesters hold up a flag of the Islamic State during a demonstration against Israeli killings in Gaza in this July 2014 file photo. There is now an Islamic State group operating in Afghanistan . General Mahmood Khan, the deputy commander of the Afghan army's 215 Corps, said residents of a number of districts in Helmand have said Rauf's representatives are fanning out to recruit people. 'A number of tribal leaders, jihadi commanders and some ulema (religious council members) and other people have contacted me to tell me that Mullah Rauf had contacted them and invited them to join him,' Gen Khan said. But he said the Taliban, which is active across Helmand, has warned people not to contact Rauf. David Cameron has promised to lobby Barack Obama for the release of the last British resident held at Guantanamo Bay when he visits Washington this week, the detainee's lawyer said. Shaker Aamer, a Saudi who is married to a Briton, has not been charged with any crime and was cleared for release in 2007 from the U.S. naval base in Cuba. All  British nationals and citizens have been released from the detention camp. Obama has pledged to close Guantanamo, opened in 2002 to house suspected militants, but faces obstacles from Congress. According to rights group Amnesty International, Aamer moved to Britain in 1996 and was in Afghanistan doing voluntary work for an Islamic charity when he was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in 2001 and handed to the U.S. military. Aamer's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said Mr Cameron had written to him in the last week to say he would raise the case with Obama. Mr Stafford Smith said that was welcome but not enough. 'He has said this before and little has come of it. Rather than just raising Shaker's case, Mr Cameron must come back from Washington with a concrete date for Shaker's return home to London,' said Stafford Smith, director of the charity Reprieve. 'People are saying that he has raised black flags and even has tried to bring down white Taliban flags in some areas,' said Saifullah Sanginwal, a tribal leader in Sangin district, where British troops once patrolled. 'There are reports that 19 or 20 people have been killed' in fighting between the Taliban and the IS group, he added.  Sulaiman Shah, who was Sangin district governor until last month, told the Times that Rauf was believed to be moving back and forth to Iraq and Syria via Iran. 'He is telling people that his leader is in Iraq and that they have some activities in some parts of Afghanistan,' Mr Shah said. Helmand provincial council head Haji Mohammad Karim Atal told the Times that Rauf's Islamic State cell was offering wages of $500 (£330) a month to tempt Taliban fighters to switch sides. Tensions between the established militant group and the new pretender had reportedly turned deadly on at least one occasion, including a week ago when five or six people were killed when a gunfight broke out between Rauf's followers and those of Mullah Ahmad Shah, the Taliban commander in northern Helmand. The violence comes less than three months after the withdrawal of British combat troops from the country, where they had been waging war against the Taliban for 13 years. A total of 453 British forces personnel or MoD civilians died while serving in Afghanistan since the start of operations in October 2001. More than 2,200 members of the U.S. military have died. Estimates of the number of Taliban fighters killed are sketchy, but range from 25,000 to 40,000. The war also resulted in the deaths of an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 Afghan civilians. Occupation: The establishment of the Islamic State comes less than three months after the withdrawal of British combat troops from Afghanistan, where they had been waging war against the Taliban for 13 years . Rauf was a corps commander during the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule of Afghanistan, according to Amir Mohammad Akundzada, governor of Nimroz province, who says he is related to Rauf but has not seen him for almost 20 years. Both Gen Khan and Amir Akunzada said Rauf was apprehended after the fall of the Taliban in the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan and was detained for years at Guantanamo Bay. They suggested Rauf may have fallen out with Taliban leaders after spending time in the Pakistani city of Quetta, where Afghan officials and analysts believe senior Taliban leaders are based. A video released on Saturday purports to show militants from both Afghanistan and Pakistan pledging support to Islamic State. But Amir Akundzada said the group was not likely to gain traction with ordinary Afghans. 'People who want to fight in Afghanistan just create new names - one day they are wearing white clothes (of the Taliban) and the next day they have black clothes and call themselves Da'esh, but they are the same people,' he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. has noted the 'rhetorical message of support' for Islamic State by some in Afghanistan. 'We continue to watch for signs that these statements could amount to something more than just rhetorical support,' she said. 'That doesn't mean it's unimportant.' Analysts say most claims of allegiance to IS in Afghanistan have been motivated by opportunism and that a new jihadist outfit would find it difficult to establish a presence where there are already long-established militant groups with tribal links. The Taliban have confined their insurgency to Afghanistan, and do not espouse the pan-Islamic model of jihad embraced by the Islamic State.","New leader actively recruiting fighters and even battling Taliban militants .

"A dog’s owner may not notice how fast their pet is growing, especially if they see them every day. But one owner from San Francisco didn’t want to miss a week of his Rhodesian Ridgeback’s development so created this lovely time-lapse. The 23-second clip shows Greg Coffin’s dog Sophia growing from a two-month old puppy into a fully-grown three-year-old. Scroll down for video . The footage was filmed by Greg Coffin from San Francisco. It shows the development of his Rhodesian Ridgeback, Sophia as she grows from two months (pictured) to three years in just 23 seconds. This is then reversed to show Sophia shrinking back to a puppy . This is then reversed to show Sophia shrinking back to a puppy. The footage was taken by Mr Coffin, a senior art director at Digitas, every weekend, with help from his wife Amanda. It ends with outtakes that show Mrs Coffin attempting to keep Sophia still during the filming. Mr Coffin wrote on Facebook: ‘This is a pet project we've been working on for three years, that's finally completed. 'It's been amazing watch our little lady grow from a little burrito to the beautiful beast she is today.’ The time-lapse was taken by Mr Coffin, a senior art director at Digitas, every weekend, with help from his wife Amanda. It ends with outtakes that show Mrs Coffin attempting to keep Sophia (pictured at three years old) still during the filming . The fastest growth of a puppy occurs between four and six months. By the time it’s a year old, a dog's skeleton is usually fully developed, although it may continue to develop in larger breeds for the next six months to a year. In Mr Coffin's video, Sophia's rear legs are shown getting longer and larger even after this time. By three months, a puppy typically has a full set of baby teeth, which are replaced by adult teeth at around five months. It is likely the dog will begin a chewing phase at this point. Puberty typically begins at around four months old and sexual maturity can hit as early as six months. Between seven and nine months, a puppy will begin exploring more of their environment, and this can lead to a second chewing phase. The testosterone level in male puppies increases up to seven times higher than in an adult dog by the time it reaches 10 months, which can cause a growth spurt. This falls to a normal level by 18 months.

Instead, they perform a more complex cycle of movements (pictured) underwater  to maximise their speed through the waves and reduce drag . Doggy paddle is one of the first strokes children develop when learning to swim, but despite inspiring the name, research has discovered dogs don’t paddle in water at all. Instead, they perform a more complex cycle of leg movements underwater designed specifically to maximise their speed through the waves and reduce drag. Professor Frank Fish from West Chester University used underwater cameras to film eight dogs, across six different breeds, as they swam across a pool, . When a dog trots on land, their front paw rises and falls in time with the hind paw on the opposite side. For example, the left front paw will rise and fall with right hind paw. However, when a dog runs on land, in order to increase its speed, the legs move in a more complex, cyclical way. The left hind paw lands first, followed by its left front paw, right hind paw and right front paw in sequence. As the dog runs further, the legs rise in the same pattern.","The film was taken by senior art director Greg Coffin from San Francisco .

"The first person to fall foul of California's one-year-old revenge porn law has been sentenced to one year in jail after posting pictures of his ex girlfriend on a social media page run by her employer. Noe Iniguez, 36, from Los Angeles, was jailed for posting topless photographs of his ex on her work's Facebook, along with a message in which he described her as a 'drunk' and a 'slut'. Iniquez, who was also prosecuted for ignoring two restraining orders, has been ordered to attend domestic violence counselling. Noe Iniguez, 36, from Los Angeles, was jailed for posting topless photographs of his ex on her work's Facebook . City Attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan said in a statement: 'Iniguez, using an alias, allegedly began posting derogatory comments about his ex-girlfriend on her employer's Facebook page. In March, 2014. Iniguez allegedly posted a topless photograph of the victim on her employer's Facebook page which was accompanied by a message that called the victim a 'drunk' and a 'slut' and encouraged her firing from the company.' Iniquez had been in a four-year relationship with the victim, but prosecutors said after they split up he harassed her and sent her abusive text messages, LA Weekly reported. Revenge porn is the act of publishing sexually explicit pictures of former partners with the aim of causing them emotional distress. City Attorney Mike Feuer said: 'California's new revenge porn law gives prosecutors a valuable tool to protect victims whose lives and reputations have been upended by a person they once trusted. This conviction sends a strong message that this type of malicious behavior will not be tolerated.' Meanwhile, a federal judge recently put a new Arizona law against 'revenge porn' on hold after civil rights groups sued over constitutional grounds. Abuse: Iniquez posted a message on the Facebook page of his ex's employer, calling her a 'drunk' and a 'slut' The order from U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton came as part of an agreement between the Arizona attorney general's office and the groups that sued. The order blocks enforcement of the law to allow the Legislature time to work on changes. Rep. J.D. Mesnard, R-Chandler, crafted the bill to bar 'revenge porn' from being posted online by jilted lovers. The American Civil Liberties Union sued in September, saying the law is so broadly written it makes anyone distributing or displaying a nude image without explicit permission guilty of a felony. The group said that violates the 1st Amendment. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix on behalf of several bookstores and publishing associations, the owner of the Village Voice and 12 other alternative newsweeklies nationwide, and the National Press Photographers Association. Gov. Jan Brewer signed House Bill 2515 into law in April after it unanimously passed the Senate and House. Mesnard said Wednesday he'll work on changes but isn't sure they'll satisfy the ACLU. 'Given my willingness to do that, it made sense to say, well let's see if we can get an agreement to hold off on the bill for now and make some changes in the next session,' Mesnard said. 'We may end up right back where we are now because some of the issues the ACLU brought up, I don't think they'll ever be satisfied.' David Horowitz, executive director of the Media Coalition, whose members include publishers, librarians and booksellers, said the current law would have a chilling effect on free speech. 'The range of material that this law could bring in was hugely overbroad, it went far beyond anything you would think of as sort of malicious invasion of privacy.' Horowitz said. The court order put the ACLU's request for a preliminary injunction on hold until the Legislature passes and the governor signs a new version of the bill, or until the Legislature adjourns in late spring. If no new version is passed, Horowitz said the groups objecting to the law will move to get it blocked permanently.","Noe Iniquez, 36, from Los Angeles, was jailed for posting nude photos .

"Star University of Central Florida quarterback Blake Bortles is just a junior and already a hot NFL draft prospect, but its his girlfriend Lindsey Duke who's stealing all the headlines. The beautiful, blonde model was profiled on ESPN and has since seen a surge in her online following to rival that of her NFL bound beau. While the talented athlete gets a not so shabby 225,000 results when searched on Google, his buxom girlfriend's name returns over 6 million. Scroll down for video . Gorgeous: Meet Lindsey Duke, the newest addition to a storied history of beautiful and widely adored girlfriends of top NFL prospects . Cute couple: iDuke is the high school sweetheart and longtime girlfriend of University of Central Florida star quarterback Blake Bortles (left) Curiosity and outright envy surrounding the couple, often seen beaming arm-in-arm in Twitter and Instagram pics, has reached a fever pitch since Bortles' Fiest Bowl victory on Wednesday. Leading up to that victory, ESPN reporter Gene Wojciechowski told Bortles' coach George O'Leary about the discrepancy in the couple's internet fame. 'I would hope as a head coach that the numbers would be reversed,' O'Leary said, 'but obviously you haven’t seen his girlfriend. She deserves six million Googles.' Hot prospects: Bortles is rumored to be a top 10 pick for May's NFL draft despite being a junior . Despite his talent, a Google search of the relatively under-the-radar Bortles retrieves only about 225,000 results . More popular: Meanwhile, his girlfriend's name gets around 6 million results when Googled . Social butterfly: Duke has a habit of frequently posting pictures of herself and her friends in bikinis to Instagram and Twitter, helping pave her path to success . Duke has helped pave her own way to fame with constant bikini-clad updates to her Twitter and Instagram feeds. Off the field as well as on, Bortles is one lucky guy and doesn't seem particulary fazed by his girlfriend's popularity. 'Apparently, she is more of a household name than I am,' Bortles told ESPN. 'She’s more famous than me and there’s nothing I can do about that.' He's had time to get used to her appeal. They've been a couple since high school, where they attended prom together, and then attended the same university. Duke is set to graduate this year, which has many wondering if she'll be greeted with the same offers of modeling and television show gigs as the most beloved college football girlfriend of 2013 Katherine Webb. Duke's popularity places her in league with Katherine Webb, the former Miss Alabama and girlfriend of 2013 draft favorite A.J. McCarron who rose to fame after being spotted in the stands by an ESPN cameraman . Webb, who was Miss Alabama 2012, was basically spotted in the stands by ESPN this time last year as she cheered on her boyfriend of one month A.J. McCarron. The promising Alabama quarterback's spotlight quickly swung to Webb, who has since appeared in television commercials, a reality televsion series, and on the computer screens of a huge chunk of the American male populace. While Webb's rise to fame came quickly and almost out of nowhere, she and Duke both have another football beauty forebearer to thank for their success. In 2012, the breakout female star of the NFL draft was Lauren Tannehill. Featured on ESPN's draft coverage that year, the aspiring model and wife of the Miami Dolphin's pick Ryan Tannehill was a major hit, setting social networking sites abuzz with complimentary tweets. In the first ten minutes after Texas A&M quarterback Tannehill was picked with the eighth overall selection, the cardiology assistant began trending on Twitter and picked up 3,000 followers overnight, a 350 percent increase on the day before. Long line of ladies: Both women owe a debt of gratitude to Lauren Tannehill, the stunning blonde wife of 2012 draft favorite and current Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill who became a household name alongside her husband .","Lindsey Duke has been Bortels' number one fan for months, but she's now making some fans of her own .

"The Duke university student who outed the freshman who pays her tuition by starring in porn films as 'Belle Knox'  is facing an online backlash. Thomas Bagley, a Phi Delta Theta pledge who is majoring in computer science and mathematics, recognized Knox after watching her performance on an X-rated website. However, Bagley has not emerged from the saga unscathed, with his predilection for hardcore pornography trumpeted far and wide and his decision to out Knox gaining him almost as many detractors as the teen pornstar. Scroll down for video . Secret sharer: Thomas Bagley says he regrets the decision to out Belle Knox to his fraternity brothers . Joy: Knox previously said that her experience in porn has brought her 'unimaginable joy' One such person is Mike Kulich, the . head of Monarchy Distribution, a pornography distribution company. '[If] he can shame girls for doing porn, I can shame him for watching it,' he said recently, reports The Daily Dot. Kulich, . whose work includes such award-winning films as 'Asses for the Masses' and 'Cray Cray Vajayjay,' has made a habit of offering big bucks to . controversial figures, including accused murderer Amanda Knox and shamed . former PR exec Justine Sacco, whose racist tweet saw her fired from her . job. In an open letter to . Bagley, Kulich thanked him for being such a fan of the porn industry, . estimating that he must spend $200 a week to subscribe to the site. 'I'm sure your parents are proud,' he writes, before suggesting Bagley gets good grades when he is not masturbating. Kulich then offers Bagley $10,000 'to live out (his) fantasies.' 'We will make you a celebrity because it is apparent how much you love porn and attention,' he writes. Empowered: Belle Knox has been doing the rounds of cable news shows and writing op-eds about porn and feminism . Financial burden: Knox says she first starting working in the adult film industry to pay her $47,000 in tuition . Bagley has disabled his Twitter account following the Belle Knox controversy. He told the Duke Chronicle that he now regrets his actions. 'She told me that I ruined her life,' Bagley said.  'I certainly would take it back.  I would take pretty much that whole night back.' And while he is getting a taste of his own medicine, Knox has become something of a media darling, appearing on cable news shows and penning op-eds on the porn industry. Cyber attacks: Both Knox and Bagley have come in for bullying from trolls . Disengaged: Bagley has disabled his Twitter account after the media storm that came when he outed Belle Knox . On Thursday night she told CNN's Piers Morgan that she hasn't let the abuse and harassment she received after Bagley blew her cover get to her. 'I think 80 per cent of the world’s traffic on the Internet is pornography,' she said. 'And I think that probably every single person at some point in their life has watched pornography. 'So, I think it’s extremely hypocritical that the same society that consumes me is also condemning me.' Knox made headlines last month when Bagley spilled her secret at a fraternity event. After that the news spread like wildfire on the North Carolina campus and Knox says it got to the point where she felt unsafe, so the university let her take a few days off classes. Revealed: The Duke University student was outed as a porn star when a fellow freshman spilled the beans at a fraternity event last month . On her side: Knox says she's faced some hostility on campus - mostly from other girls - but that most people have been supportive . 'They've been very supportive of me. We're working really hard to make sure that I'm safe ,' she said. In . her CNN interview, Knox went into more detail about how she got into . the porn industry, while also voicing some of her regrets. She . says she decided to start starring in adult films when she received her . financial aid package for Duke and found out she was going to need to . pay about $47,000 a year. 'The . financial aid that I was given to pay for my tuition was insufficient . and just really an enormous financial burden on my family,' she said. Knox, who has two other siblings, decided to start shooting adult films since the pay was good and didn't require a huge time commitment. 'I set my own schedule,' she said, adding that she makes $1,200 a scene. 'I don't have to worry about not getting sleep or not doing my work because I'm working three jobs.' But she also says she hid her part-time job from her parents, which is something she now regrets. 'I regret not telling my family from the get-go. I think that was a really big mistake,' Knox said. Knox wouldn't go into detail about how her family has reacted to the news, but says she's not worried her porn work will come between them. 'My family loved me six months ago when I wasn't a porn star, so I don't know what would make them not love me now,' she said. Knox even went so far as to say that if her own future daughter wanted to go into porn, she would support her. 'I would want my daughter to make an informed decision about her career and I think it's absolutely her choice,' she said. But Knox admits that the news of her porn career has made life on campus difficult. Bullied: Knox says people have set up fake Twitter accounts and used them to harass her . Threats: Knox says both she and her family have received threats since her identity was revealed . She says she can't go out like she used to anymore because fellow students are hostile to her - especially other girls. However, . Knox says the majority of campus is on her side and supportive. She . estimated that 70 per cent of her fellow students, especially the LGBTQ . community, were behind her while the other 30 per cent of 'frat guys' and girls seem to 'hate' her . Also on the show, Morgan asked how Knox came up with her stage name. She . says the first name is for the princess in the Beauty and the Beast, as . well as the character Belle de Jour from British television drama . 'Secret Diary of a Call Girl'. She . takes her last name from Amanda Knox, the infamous 26-year-old . suspected of sexually assaulting and then murdering her British roommate . while studying abroad in Italy in 2007. 'She's . just a really interesting person. I'm not saying I support her or . anything...she just seems very intelligent,' the Duke student said.","Duke freshman Thomas Bagley who outed fellow student Belle Knox as a porn star has also been harassed .

"Losing a child is every mother's worst nightmare but Johanna Satekge knows all too well how it feels to watch helplessly as your baby dies in your arms. Diagnosed with HIV two months into her first pregnancy, the 39-year-old, from South Africa's Limpopo province, lost her eldest two children from complications caused by the disease. The reason? She was too afraid to admit to having HIV and was unable to access the drugs she needed to stop the disease from passing to her children. Brave: Johanna Satekge, 39, from South Africa's Limpopo province, was diagnosed with HIV in 2000 . Tragedy: Johanna lost two of her babies to HIV before getting antiretroviral drugs . But six years on from the death of her second child, Johanna is a happy mother of two healthy children and is now a health worker who spends her time educating others about the risks of HIV. 'I am very healthy now,' she explains, smilingly. 'I live a healthy lifestyle, look after myself and have been on anti-retrovirals for nearly a decade. 'My experiences are what makes me the person I am today. I have been through it all and have lived to tell the tale.' And Johanna really has been through it all. Healthy and well throughout her childhood and teens, her life was turned upside down when she was brutally attacked and raped aged 21. Although she didn't know it, her attacker was HIV positive and it was to be another four years before Johanna realised that she too had the virus. Growing up, she knew little about the disease beyond that it meant 'death and dying'. 'We knew that anyone who had AIDS was a walking grave,' she says. 'All the photos we saw on TV and in magazines were of bone thin people whom you could tell were on their deathbed. 'I didn't know anything except that it was a prostitute disease,' she continues. 'Any woman who was HIV-positive was regarded as promiscuous. 'Even our pastors called it a punishment from God for promiscuity.' Despite official denials, 1990s South Africa was at the centre of a growing AIDS epidemic - made worse by then president Thabo Mbeki's refusal to admit that it existed. As a result, while new infections dropped in countries like Uganda, where the government swiftly moved to counter AIDS and educate those at risk, the number of South African infections multiplied rapidly. Among them was Johanna, although with no knowledge of the disease and no idea what symptoms to look for, it wasn't until 2000 that the terrible truth was revealed. Pregnant with her first child, Johanna says she was 'so happy' until a routine blood test two months in revealed that she was HIV positive. Overwhelmed with shame and living in a community that stigmatised those with the condition, she kept it secret. 'The stigma at that time was very high and there was very little care in the clinics. 'Everyone was scared - especially in the rural areas. 'Most people with HIV would commit suicide just so they didn't have to experience all the sickness,' she continues. 'If our government had taken HIV seriously then, there would not have been so much death.' Just 14 months after Johanna's diagnosis and seven months after he was born, her son became the first person in her family to fall victim to AIDS. 'When I gave birth to a healthy baby who was not sick, I decided that I would breastfeed him myself,' she says. 'But he started getting sick at four months. I carried on, hoping he would be fine, but my baby died in my arms at seven months. Support: Johanna, who is now an AIDS worker, with her niece Lerato at her graduation . Disbelief: Former South African president Thabo Mbeki (left) refused to believe that AIDS exists while Jacob Zuma thinks a shower will protect you. As a result, AIDS has reached epidemic levels in South Africa . Programme: One leader who did respond to the crisis was Uganda's Yoweri Museveni. Cases of AIDS in his country are now falling rapidly . 'Judging by how sick he was, I knew it could only be AIDS. Losing my child was not easy, I nearly died of heartache. I cried so much that I thought I would follow him.' The death of her son gave Johanna the impetus she needed to finally seek help and in 2002, she plucked up the courage to finally tell her friends and family. 'I decided not to be silent anymore,' she says. 'It was time for someone to do something and who else if not me.' She threw herself into efforts to help other HIV positive women, working with AIDS charity Mothers2Mothers to help educate rural communities. But tragedy struck again two years later when Johanna became pregnant with her second child but once more, lost her to HIV shortly after birth. 'I got a single dose of Nevirapine [an anti-AIDS drug] and so did my baby but that was not enough,' she remembers. 'I was given one pill to take during labour but it was not enough to save her. We did get the treatment but we were among the unlucky. 'My daughter Lehlogonolo was born healthy but I soon realised that she was not growing, she was not gaining weight.' Worried, she tried to have the little girl tested but was told that the baby was too young to take a HIV test. Unwilling to give up, she asked a colleague to do a CD4 cell count - which can indicate the presence of the disease - and her worst fears were confirmed. 'She was found to be HIV positive,' says Johanna sadly. 'But by the time she was started on antiretroviral drugs, it was already too late for her. She passed on two weeks later.' A heartbroken Johanna was once more plunged into a morass of grief and recrimination. 'My child got infected and I blamed myself every day for that,' she says. Tragic: Although South Africa is making progress, for many HIV sufferers, action has come too late . Speaking out: Johanna hopes that more people will now speak out and wants to banish the stigma of HIV . 'I hated that I tried to have a child again only to experience another death. I was angry and sad all the time.' Devastated by the loss of her second child, Johanna vowed never to get pregnant again but changed her mind after finally being given access to antiretroviral drugs. Less than a year after beginning the course of medication, her viral load was so low it was virtually undetectable and later that year, her son Lefa was born - healthy and HIV negative. Four years later, a second healthy child, a daughter named Tiisetso followed and Johanna says that she couldn't be happier. 'I now have two HIV negative children and I believe I am the richest woman in the world.' Currently, 600 HIV positive babies are born every single day in sub-Saharan Africa, with many of the victims hailing from Johanna's native South Africa. She now works as a mentor mother for charity mothers2mothers, which employs HIV positive women and sends them to work alongside doctors and nurses in understaffed health centres as members of the healthcare team. In one-on-one and group sessions, mentor mothers provide health education and psycho-social support to other HIV-positive mothers, as well as providing them with the wherewithal to protect their babies from HIV infection, and keep themselves and their families healthy.","Johanna Satekge, 39, was diagnosed HIV positive in 2000 .

"It was another entertaining weekend in the Barclays Premier League with 36 goals scored across the nine games. Eight of those goals came at St Mary’s as Southampton thrashed Sunderland, while Sergio Aguero scored all four for Manchester City as they beat Spurs 4-1. There was plenty of late drama as well as Danny Welbeck rescued a point for Arsenal against Hull in stoppage time. While across London at Loftus Road there were four goals between the 87th minute and 95th minute as Liverpool edged out QPR 3-2. Sportsmail’s reporters look back on the weekend and give their favourite moment from a memorable round of games. Lee Clayton . Everything Enner Valencia does seems to go 'boom'. Until Saturday, he was restricting his goals this season to screaming shots for club and country, but that header at Burnley; twisting, moving away from goal and then thudding it from the centre of his head was terrific. There were many crazy moments from this weekend, but allow me to enjoy fourth place and a West Ham forward who looks a real menace. And that's before we mention his free-scoring mate, Diafra Sakho. Bring on Manchester City next week, Vincent Kompany… you have been warned. Enner Valencia celebrates scoring West Ham's second goal in their 3-1 win at Burnley . Joe Bernstein . After all the melodrama of 'Tiredgate' it did make me chuckle to see Raheem Sterling skipping free like a teenager in the 95th minute of Liverpool's game against QPR to set up the winning goal. Making no judgements on Brendan vs Roy but most of us would love to be as 'burnt out' as English football's quickest 19-year-old. Raheem Sterling came through a difficult week by putting in a good performance for Liverpool at QPR . Riath Al-Samarrai . Over the past month or so Garry Monk has increasingly muttered about referees. The frustration has been rising, with his perception that Swansea don't get a fair shake from officials has intensified. On Sunday, he blew his top. He will likely be charged by the FA for his outburst against Michael Oliver, having already been patronised by Mark Hughes. But his rawness is what appeals. He says what he thinks. At some point, with fines and such like, that will be chiselled out of him. But for now it is nice to hear honest thoughts from a manager. Garry Monk blew his top at the penalty awarded to Stoke after Victor Moses (right) appeared to dive . Craig Hope . Seeing Newcastle United come up with new and imaginative ways to keep themselves in the news. Last week, having proudly installed a giant LED screen inside the stadium, the club declared that its arrival would enhance the match day experience for all fans. Well, if they meant it would afford them an extra hour in the pub then they were right. The canvas around their jazzy new screen became dislodged in the wind before the game, delaying kick-off to 4pm amid safety concerns. But owner Mike Ashley – for once – missed a trick. For while the eyes of the world were on the canvas as it flapped in the breeze, not a single Sports Direct ad appeared on the screen next to it! The new big screen at St James' Park became dislodged and delayed kick by one hour . Ian Ladyman . An early flight to Russia on Sunday means I missed the drama at Loftus Road but watching Harry Redknapp's press conference on MailOnline on Sunday night was priceless. You can see clearly see the workings of Redknapp's mind as he is telling himself: 'Don't slag off Taarabt… don't say it…whatever you do, DO NOT say that thing about him being a fat waste of space…'. Oops… too late… he said it… . Harry Redknapp hit out at Adel Taarabt's lack of fitness during his post-match press conference . Dominic King . Switching on the TV at 4.45pm and seeing Jeff Stelling saying 'Yes! That is eight!' as he tried to explain Sunderland's capitulation at Southampton. Such one-sided scorelines are associated with different eras, so when one comes along as it did at the weekend, it genuinely makes you do a double take if you have been oblivious to what has been happening minute-by-minute. The result was capped by that magnificent own goal from Santiago Vergini. Chaotic football at its best. Southampton's 8-0 win over Southampton grabbed the headlines on Saturday . Rob Draper . A moment of pathos rather than joy: the look on Harry Redknapp's face after *that* Steven Caulker own goal. After 56 years in the game, it still hurts just as much and it still matters. On one hand that gives me hope that your passion for the game can still be alive after so long. Alternatively, I despair - it never gets any better, no matter how long you watch the game. Steven Caulker's own goal was the decider in the five goal thriller at Loftus Road . Mark Alford . Loads of Arsenal 'fans' were left gagging on their half-time prawn sandwiches when Abel Hernandez scored a marvellous team goal within a minute of the restart. Hull's team of giants had beat the Gunners at their own game: intricate passing, a sublime ball for Tom Huddlestone and Hernandez beating Arsenal's only 'big lad' (Mertesacker) in the air to score. I'd mis-timed my visit to spend a penny but I did catch a brilliant exchange between two Gooners still stood beneath a TV screen… 'Is that live, John?' 'Nah, we got this one in the bag, Phil.' Abel Hernandez out jumped Per Mertesacker to score for Hull at the Emirates . Alex Kay . My team Tottenham lost on Saturday but I was pleased to see Roberto Soldado finally get a chance to start in the Premier League. Yes, he missed a penalty but he set up the goal, won the penalty and brought more to the team than Emmanuel Adebayor has all season. Some players need love and patience. Soldado links up well with Christian Eriksen, has a good footballing brain and suits the team's style. Now if they can just sort out that defence… . Roberto Soldado won (and then missed) a penalty for Spurs in their defeat at Manchester City . Matt Barlow . Oscar's free-kick was sublime but it was eclipsed by Chelsea's second at Selhurst Park: a slick and intricate passing sequence with Cesc Fabregas, bouncing passes off team-mates before applying a clinical finish. It was a sparkling gem amid a ruthless performance which left you wondering if this was the champions in action. And if this is another exceptional team being assembled by Jose Mourinho. Oscar's goal for Chelsea from a free-kick was a thing of beauty as Jose Mourinho's men won 2-1 . VIDEO Mourinho pleased with team's evolution . Mike Anstead . The handshake between Brendan Rodgers and Harry Redknapp at the final whistle at Loftus Road said it all. Rodgers puffing his cheeks out and almost apologising. Redknapp shaking his head and muttering expletives in disbelief. The last eight minutes of QPR vs Liverpool summed up the chaotic brilliance of the Premier League. The handshake between Brendan Rodgers and Redknapp summed up the madness of the Premier League . Laurie Whitwell . It's probably cruel to highlight an own goal but Santiago Vergini's spectacular effort was too funny. Jamie Pollock scoring through his own net with all the skill of Gazza while playing for Manchester City had for years been my favourite, but the way Vergini struck the ball with such sweetness, and in no danger, nudges it top. Honourable mention to Lukasz Fabianski for his comically late dive to try to keep out Jon Walters' header. One for the cameras, perhaps. Lukasz Fabianski looks dejected after he failed to keep out Jon Walters' header . Sam Cunningham . I was fortunate enough to be at St Mary's at the weekend where Santiago Vergini scored what will surely go down as the own goal of the season. Southampton and Sunderland fans were momentarily stunned into silence when the defender struck a peach of a first-time volley from the edge of the box – unfortunately for Vergini it was past his own goalkeeper Vito Mannone. It's unlikely he has ever made a sweeter connection with a ball dropping from the sky. The fact I am picking that ahead of the eight goal annihilation of Sunderland, is testament to how good (or bad) Vergini's volley was. Santiago Vergini (centre) scored a stunning own goal as Sunderland were thrashed 8-0 at Southampton . Jack Gaughan . Jose Mourinho labelled Chelsea's second goal at Palace as 'scandalous' – it really was a thing of pure beauty. Seventeen passes from one end of Selhurst Park to the other, with eight different players involved and nine touches by the eventual goalscorer Cesc Fabregas. During a game that had almost descended into a training match, the change of pace and urgency of the Blues was frightening. Fabregas gave Julian Speroni the eyes to finish, too. Cesc Fabregas rounded off an excellent team move to score his first Premier League goal for Chelsea . Phil Gradwell . The fact that Michael Oliver gave a penalty against Ryan Shawcross for wrestling down Wilfried Bony in the area. 'But if you give that, you'll have six penalties a match,' the apologists bleat. So be it, if there are six penalties a game those grappling matches at corners will soon stop. And maybe instead of grabbing opponents, defenders will actually, you know, defend corners. Ryan Shawcross (right) was correctly penalised for grappling with Wilfried Bony in the area .","Southampton were the highest scores of the weekend with their 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland .

Ghazala Khan, 37, alleged she was told she would 'go to hell' and branded a 'stupid outsider' by her boss and barred from certain assemblies at Mohiuddin International Girls College in Burnley, Lancashire. She lost her job in 2012 claiming it was because she questioned why some teachers refused to teach girls unless they wore veils across their faces. But today an employment tribunal in Manchester dismissed her claims and ruled in favour of the college. The college denied she was vice-principal and said she left the establishment after it was criticised during an inspection. It said staff had received complaints describing Mrs Khan as 'rude and bad-tempered'. The school which charges £5,500 a year for international students and £4,500 for UK and European pupils, was described as a 'Muslim Eton' for girls when plans were originally put forward in 2009. Founded in October 2010 the school has around 90 students and is run by the Birmingham-based Mohuiddin Trust under the leadership of Sheikh Hazrat Pir Alaudin Siddiqui Sahib - an Islamic scholar based in Pakistan. Mrs Khan was appointed as vice principal in 2011 but she said she clashed with the college principal  after saying she and some students had some Islamic teachings they disagreed with forced upon them. She said one fellow teacher refused to speak to her, as she did not wear a veil, and she had challenged the same tutor after he ordered all his female students to wear the niqab in his lessons. Mrs Khan also said the college principal have warned of the school being 'polluted' because she had 'let a Christian in'. Mrs Khan claims she was immediately dismissed after a 'heated' debate with the school's principal Amjad Bashir (left) and Zahir Ahmed (right), a director of the Mohiuddin Trust which runs the college . Mohiuddin International Girls College, which opened its doors in October 2010, describes itself as a 'unique and friendly institution'. It was set up by the Mohiuddin Trust - a charity which aims to help those who are poor or under-privileged - under the leadership of Sheikh Hazrat Pir Alaudin Siddiqui Sahib, an Islamic scholar based in Pakistan. When plans for the college for girls over 16, it described itself as the 'Muslim Eton'. It said it's aim is to 'educate and empower women regardless of their age, colour, creed or social stature.' The trust acquired the former Burnley College in Lancashire and charges £5,500 a year for international students and £4,500 for UK and European enrolments. Staff teach A Levels and GCSEs in subjects including English, Mathematics and Science as well as Urdu and Arabic. The 90 or so students also have the opportunity to take on an Aalimah course - or Islamic Theology. It offers study of Arabic grammar, etymology, syntax and law. There is also halls of residence accommodation facilities for overseas students. The private-run establishment asks for donations on a section of its website. Speaking about the teacher's conduct, she said: 'There were quite a few times I didn't agree with the way he would make children wear veils across their faces just so he could teach them. 'I said ""nowhere in Islam does it say they must wear a veil to come to classes."" He said, ""you have no knowledge of anything and have no right to talk with somebody not related to you."" They said it was necessary to make all girls wear the veil.' Mrs Khan said she was also banned from assemblies where the girls would gather each evening because she was 'an outsider' and would have to wait outside. She added: 'There were a few occasions when I wasn't allowed into the assembly because they said I was an outsider. 'But when recitation is going on I am a Muslim and I recite the Qur'an. Mr Bashir made me wait outside. He used to say, ""can you wait outside? There are a few things you wouldn't understand. When we have finished you can come in."" I used to say, ""it's all blessings, why can't I come in?""' She claimed she was also not respected because she was female and not considered a Muslim 'scholar', despite being an experienced teacher. Mrs Khan said: 'The only way that we differ is that they say the Sheik, the founder of the college, is going to take them to heaven and everyone who does not believe in him is going to hell.' The 'Muslim Eton': Staff compared Mohiuddin International Girls College (pictured) to the independent boarding school in Berkshire which has educated 19 British Prime Ministers . Mrs Khan said matters came to a head after an Ofsted-type school inspection for Muslim education called the British School Inspectorate, where the college was criticised in a number of areas. The hearing was told that a meeting was called with the principal and trust director and she was 'blamed' for their failed inspection, called a 'stupid outsider' and ordered to leave. She said: 'I was upset, wasn't feeling well, had a lot of stress related issues and didn't want to come to court. 'For two years I waited and thought ""maybe they might sort things out for me"" but they didn't. I was very stressed. I was going through a lot, I had just lost my job. 'I was very depressed. My doctor said I was maybe going to have a nervous breakdown. 'I had realised I had been wronged. I thought they had been very prejudiced towards me and I thought I had been wronged.' Mrs Khan - who was representing herself - put questions to 45-year old Mr Bashir, a civil engineer who reacted angrily and was warned by tribunal judge over his conduct. When it was put to him by Mrs Khan that she had actually employed a Christian teacher, he replied: 'You don't even have a degree. You're not even qualified. I'm 100 per cent absolutely sure she was not employed as a vice-principal.' The tribunal, at Alexandra House in Manchester, heard that Mrs Khan claims she was ostracised by staff . Later Mr Bashir's own lawyer Amy Smith asked him: 'You are being accused of telling the business teacher that the claimant was incompetent in her work and she was a stupid outsider.' He replied: 'I never used the words stupid outsider.' She added: 'You are accused of making rude jokes because she was an outsider and she was going to hell and if you had it your way you would employ her as a cleaner or tea lady.' Mr Bashir who is no longer principal at the college replied: 'I never said that.' Miss Smith also put it to him that he told students Mrs Khan wouldn't understand them because she wasn't 'among them', which he also denied. He said the school employed Christian teachers so could not be accused of religious prejudice.","Ghazala Khan, 37, claims she was called a 'stupid outsider' by her boss .

"A working plastic gun has been printed using a self-assembled 3D printer, a nail and some household screws. The gun, based on blueprints made available online by Defense Distributed last month, cost just $25 (£16) to make and has already successfully fired nine .38 caliber shots by the Wisconsin engineer who built it. Up until now, the blueprints for the 'Liberator' gun have been mainly printed using industrial-grade 3D printers that cost around £5,250 ($8,000). Scroll down for video . A Wisconsin engineer has printed a 3D plastic gun using a self-assembled 3D printer he bought online, a nail and some household screws. In a video posted to YouTube, the engineer known only as Joe, successfully shoots nine .38 caliber shots. It is one of the first models to be printed on cheap, at-home 3D printers . 3D printing is poised to revolutionise engineering and reforge industries from medicine, to construction to aerospace. The process, also called additive manufacturing, creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. The feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape. The machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing. The process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s. Since 2010, an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3D printers, which are increasingly small, powerful and affordable. Defense Distributed used a higher-end $8,000 (£5,250) model to build its 3D gun. However entry-level desktop models can cost $500 to $1,000 (£329 to £659). The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Researchers recently used 3D printing to print bionic ears, that contained living cells from pigs. This latest gun is one of the first to be 3D printed using the much cheaper Lulzbot A0-101 3D printer - a printer that can be bought online, assembled at home and costs £1,136 ($1,725). Because of the use of the Lulzbot, the engineer behind the cheap gun known only as Joe, has called it the Lulz Liberator. In a video posted to YouTube, Joe is shown firing the printed gun which was pre-loaded with .380 caliber rounds. Eight shots were fired using the original printed plastic barrel. The barrel was then damaged, so it was replaced and Joe used it to fire one more shot. Joe told Forbes he believed it could have shot even more. The video was filmed by fellow Wisconsin engineer Michael Guslick. The Lulz Liberator is slightly different from the original plans because it has a rifled barrel and uses screws to hold it together, rather than printed plastic pins. It took two days to print the gun and Joe used generic ABS materials and household items that cost a total of $25 (£16). The blueprints for the first-ever . plastic gun produced on a 3D printer were released online, for free, by . Defense Distributed (DD) in March. The company's founder, 25-year-old Cody Wilson, spent a year working on the plans before successfully testing the designs. The first models based on DD's designs were printed in April. The plans behind the Liberator 3D-printed gun were designed by 25-year-old Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed. Wilson, pictured, spent a year working on the plans. He then made them available online, before the US State Department Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance ordered him to remove them because the guns could violate export regulations . This picture shows the printed parts of the Liberator gun designed by Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed. The version printed using the Lulzbot printer used metal screws to hold it together, rather than the plastic pins shown in this image . Earlier this month, DD announced the plans had been downloaded over 100,000 times and this led to the U.S. State Department ordering the . website to take down the plans, on the basis they could . violate export regulations. Because the original gun is made entirely from plastic it makes it possible to carry the gun through airport security metal detectors, for example, without being found out. Earlier this month, the Mail On Sunday tested this theory by smuggling a version of the Liberator gun onto a Eurostar train. Two reporters passed completely unchallenged through strict airport-style security to carry the gun on to a London to Paris service in the weekend rush-hour, alongside hundreds of unsuspecting travellers. The pistol was produced in under 36 hours using a £1,700 machine, bought online, to ‘print’ its components. Reporter Simon Murphy carried the plastic gun on to a London to Paris service in the weekend rush-hour . Once on board the packed 5.31pm Eurostar train, the reporters were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm, and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers . The train operator began an urgent investigation into the security breach following the expose, as experts called for airports and public buildings to review their procedures in light of our revelations. The Mail on Sunday pieced together the 16-part Liberator after downloading the designs. An American university student has proved earlier the same week that the designs worked, by  successfully firing a bullet on a shooting range. To test the procedures at St Pancras International Station, the gun produced by the MoS was split into three pieces and concealed in the clothing of two reporters who bought standard class tickets to Paris. The reporters then walked through the usual security procedures, manned by UK Border officials. They placed their luggage and metal objects, including loose change and watches, in plastic trays which were then passed through airport scanners. But although they were carrying parts of a potentially deadly weapon, they were able to walk through a metal detector without triggering the alarm. While some passengers were patted down by security guards, they said they proceeded unchallenged to passport control, manned by French police. Once on board the packed 5.31pm Eurostar train on Friday, the reporters were able to assemble the pieces to create a fully functional firearm in just 30 seconds, and pose for pictures close to unsuspecting passengers. The two reporters said they did not attempt to smuggle the firing pin or bullet for safety and legal reasons, but claimed small metal items could be easily concealed. Following the expose, security experts and politicians said they were horrified at the implications of the investigation. Lord West, the former Labour security Minister, called for a review to see how the ‘extremely dangerous’ weapons could be better detected. But he said he was ‘not surprised’ that Eurostar checks had failed to spot the weapon because they were so hard to detect. He said: ‘What we need is a review of how we can look at these things and how we can discover them more easily. That will take work and it will cost money. ‘These weapons are extremely dangerous because they are very difficult to detect with the methods we normally use. This is going to be a real problem, no doubt about it. People are going to have to rethink whether we need more checks.’ A Eurostar spokeswoman said: ‘Eurostar has a high level of security, with a number of checks  as specified by the authorities in order to protect the integrity of the Channel Tunnel. We take any issue relating to security very seriously. We will be investigating immediately to fully understand the nature of this issue with our security partner which carries out checks on our behalf at St Pancras. We will also investigate the matter with the Department for Transport, who oversee our security operation, and specify the checks that need to be undertaken.’ The Transport Department said the UK had ‘one of the strictest transport security regimes in the world’ and added: ‘This is kept under constant review in response to  new or emerging threats, but we do not comment on specifics for obvious reasons.’ Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas spent the last year designing the weapon. A self-styled libertarian, he argues that everyone should have access to guns, and said last week: ‘I recognise the tool might be used to harm other people ... it’s a gun. But I don’t think that’s a reason not to do it.’","Wisconsin engineer uses self-assembled 3D printer to create cheap plastic gun and has already successfully fired nine .38 caliber shots .

"The Simpsons has been at the cutting edge of popular culture for a quarter of a century - but do Springfield's most famous residents have the ability to predict the future? According to Internet conspiracy theorists, the simple answer is yes. They claim the world famous TV series predicted the Ebola crisis back in a 1997 episode in which Marge tries to coax a sick Bart out of bed, as proof. She suggests he reads a book before producing one entitled 'Curious George and the Ebola Virus'. Scroll down for video . Conspiracy theorists have pointed to these clips in The Simpsons for its apparent ability to foresee the Ebola crisis which now threatens to become a pandemic as the US records its first victim. According to Internet conspiracy theorists, a 1997 episode from season nine of the popular cartoon, features Marge trying to coax a sick Bart into reading 'Curious George and the Ebola Virus' The book's cover shows a monkey lying in bed. The monket has long been suspected of being a carrier of the virus which has now made its way to America and claimed its first victim, Eric Thomas Duncan . Marge then asks if Bart would like 'to color something', to which he replies: 'I already did', and points to an apocalyptic drawing of a dead Bart surrounded by blood and bodies with the sun and clouds crying . She then asks if he would like 'to color something', to which he replies: 'I already did', and points to an apocalyptic drawing of a dead Bart surrounded by blood and bodies with the sun and clouds appearing to cry. The clip appeared on a YouTube channel called the Controversy7 where the host discusses the Ebola virus among various other theories about the power of the Hollywood film industry. The presenter of the site, Emmanuel Lokonga, wrote: 'Is there something we are not being told? Is it by pure chance & coincidence that the Simpsons would do predictive programming?' The YouTube commentators were split on Mr Lokonga's theory. VSR wrote: 'US Government has had ebola vaccines for a couple of years now. Look it up.' Sourjouneth Truth added: Thank you so very much for this video! Very good information. You have done an excellent job on this. Puppets on their strings, they think. NOT! Our Father has His Children's Backs. The rest of the story is being written and the fate of the evil is predetermined. Read Psalms 73.' However some skepticism came from Jayden Morpeth, who commented: 'You realize the Ebola virus has been around for a long time it just hasn't be as serious as it is now.' The episode where the Ebola book appeared was called Lisa's Sax and first aired on October 19, 1997. Despite the apparent chilling prediction from The Simpsons, Ebola was already well-known as a havoc-wreaking deadly virus in the late Nineties. Ebola was discovered in 1976 following major outbreaks that year in the Sudan and Zaire. In the 1990s, the disease saw a resurgence with an outbreak in Gabon in 1994, followed by another in Zaire in 1995. It could be said that other than the current Ebola crisis, the worst in recorded history, The Simpsons episode actually predicted the outbreak which occurred three years after the show aired. Between 2000-2004, close to 500 people died from Ebola in Uganda, Gabon, the Republic of Congo and Sudan. The current outbreak, which began last December, has so far killed more than 3,800 people, according to the latest World Health Organization figures. The vast majority of those deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. On Wednesday a Liberian man, Eric Thomas Duncan, became the first Ebola victim to die on US soil. On Thursday a British man died from suspected Ebola in Macedonia. The Simpsons episode called Lisa's Sax aired on October 19, 1997 - and appeared to hold a chilling prediction about the future .

"Bayern Munich visited the Pope after their 7-1 demolition of Roma on Tuesday night. Afterwards, mind you, not beforehand. Bayern needed no divine intervention. They just needed to do what they do when they hit their best form: swarm irrepressibly over the opposition. Except swarm doesn't really do it justice. Better the phrase used by German magazine 'kicker', which described Bayern, and Pep Guardiola's plan, as 'more precise than a world famous surgeon'. Precision. That was what marked this Bayern performance out as so special. It wasn't that Roma defended particularly poorly – they even had a few strong chances on goal themselves – it was that Bayern's attacks were so precise. The Italians simply could not plug the eye of every single needle. Bayern Munich's stars celebrate their famous victory in front of their travelling support at the final whistle . This, as Guardiola has now successfully convinced the world, is not tiki-taka. Yet this is absolutely Guardiola's Bayern. Three at the back playing a high line, with a total of three players on each wing, all overlapping perpetually. A rock solid distributor in Xabi Alonso, and a couple of effortless space creators in the centre of attack in Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski. The result is that Bayern can perpetually switch the play, without being caught on the counter attack. It means they can perpetually push forward, without forcing their opposition merely to park the bus. It is an immensely precise, but also an immensely flexible system. Guardiola has demanded from day one that his players are able and willing to fill at least two different roles across a season. Last night, many of them did so in the space of half an hour. Arjen Robben was full of praise for his coach, saying 'huge praise goes to the training staff, who set us up perfectly'. As Guardiola put it after the game, though, 'good tactics are useless without good players'. Bayern Munich players celebrate during their sensational 7-1 thrashing of Roma in the Stadio Olimpico . Bayern's Robben ran rings around Roma's Ashley Cole (pictured, left)  who was substituted at half-time . Robert Lewandowski scores his header while former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole (left) looks on helplessly . At the moment, Bayern finally seem to be harmonising the incredible quality of their squad with the innovative brilliance of their manager. Last season, it often appeared that they were trying too much to fit themselves to Guardiola's system. In their current form, they don't need to – it just comes naturally. For the fans, this is seventh heaven. Guardiola remains a little too exotic to become a local cult hero like Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund or Ottmar Hitzfeld at Bayern, but there are no complaints anymore about his adaptation of Bayern. For this team, winning is not enough – they have to dominate and destroy. That is exactly what they are doing, having scored seventeen goals in their last three games. There is a chant among Bayern fans which simply goes: 'Super Bayern, Super Bayern, hey!'. The team which took apart Roma on Tuesday night did look superhuman. Their strength, their flowing football, their precision were all simply out of this world. Franck Ribery of Bayern Munich scores his team's sixth goal during the Champions League Group E match .

"Diego Simeone and Carlo Ancelotti go head-to-head on Saturday as Madrid pair Real and Atletico meet in the Champions League final. Having both enjoyed success during distinguished playing careers the pair have seemingly always been on opposing sides. While Ancelotti played for Roma and AC Milan, Simeone starred for Lazio and Inter and the rivalry will continue in the Estadio da Luz dugouts as both manager's will hope to mastermind their club from the Spanish capital to victory. Moving the goalposts: Diego Simeone guided Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title this season . Barking orders: Carlo Ancelotti will be looking to guide Real Madrid to the club's tenth European Cup victory . So these two have always been on opposite sides? Pretty much so. Simeone for Lazio and Ancelotti for Roma. Simeone for Inter, Ancelotti for Milan. And now on opposite sides of the great divide in Madrid. What did they win? Ancelotti won four Italian Cups and one Scudetto with Roma. Some years later Simeone won one league, one cup, One European Super Cup and one Italian Super Cup with Lazio. And in Milan? Ancelotti won two European Cups under Arrigo Sacchi. He has quite a relationship with this tournament – six finals in total two won as a coach and one lost; two won as a player and one lost. Success: Ancelotti, pictured lifting the European Cup as a player in 1989, has won the tournament four times . Action shot: Anelotti won four Italian Cups and one Scudetto eight-year playing career with Roma . And Simeone at Inter? A Uefa Cup triumph in 1998. The same year he played a certain game at St. Etienne and got a certain England captain sent off. So who had the better career? Ancelotti has the cups, Simeone has the caps. The Italian has won the Champions League twice but Diego played even more games for Argentina (106) than the other Diego, Maradona. All smiles: Simeone celebrates with Ivan Zamarano (left) and Youri Djorkaeff (centre) during his Inter days . And did they ever actually face each other on the pitch in one of those Rome or Milan derbies? No. They only started locking horns as managers. So what’s the balance? Simeone got the better of Ancelotti at the Bernabeu in the league earlier in the season becoming the first coach to lead Atleti to victory in a league match over Real in 14 years. Honours were even in the return fixture in a 2-2 draw. In the cup Real knocked Atletico out winning both legs. So it’s one win to Carlo, one to Diego, and one draw. All to play for in the biggest game of all. All to play for: Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo are both set to start in Saturday's Champions League final .

"A nurse who admitted killing at least 40 patients in his care but is suspected of murdering hundreds apologized for the deaths in his first ever interview from jail but still claimed they were mercy killings. Charles Cullen was handed down six life sentences in 2006 after he admitted poisoning at least 40 people in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over the course of his 16-year nursing career. Considered one of the most prolific serial killers in American history and once dubbed 'the angel of death', Cullen said he wanted to end his patients' suffering, even though many of them were in good health. Scroll down for video . First claim: In an interview to be with CBS' 60 Minutes, Charles Cullen at first says he thought he was helping people by ending their suffering . Another tune: Cullen tells a different story when reminded some victims were not close to death. He says there was 'no justification' and 'I felt overwhelmed at the time' Youngest and oldest victims: Michael T. Strenko, 21,  was having routine spleen surgery when he was poisoned and Helen Dean, 91, was in the hospital for breast cancer surgery when she died . The serial killer was interviewed for the first time ever about the murders by CBS' 60 Minutes, which was aired last night. Caught: It wasn't until the suspicious death of Fr Florian J. Gall that Cullen's killing spree was finally unearthed . When asked if he considered himself a murderer, he said: 'I think that I had a lot of trouble accepting that word for a long time. I accept that that's what it is.' When asked if he got pleasure out of . killing people, Cullen told 60 Minutes: 'No, I thought that people . weren't suffering anymore. So, in a sense, I thought I was helping.' When it was pointed out that many of . his patients weren't in pain, he said: 'You know, again, you know, I . mean, my goal here isn't to justify. 'You know what I did there is no . justification. I just think that the only thing I can say is that I felt . overwhelmed at the time.' In the interview broadcast last night on CBS' 60 Minutes, Cullen admits that if he had not been stopped, he probably would have went on to kill more people. At the time of his arrest in December 2003, Cullen told authorities he had administered overdoses to patients to spare them from going into cardiac or respiratory arrest. Even though there were suspicions at several of the hospitals he worked at, these were never reported or marked on his record and Cullen was able to continue his killing spree at each place he was transferred to. Guilty: Charles Cullen is walked through the Northampton County Court House in Easton PA after he pleaded guilty to the 1998 murder of Easton Hospital patient, Ottomar Schramm . More murders: Cullen pleaded guilty in May 2004 to three additional murders of patients in a hospital where he worked . When Cullen was hired at Saint Luke's . University Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, he had already been . fired or forced to resign from five other hospitals. Yet none of this was in his file with the state nursing board. He admits to killing five people at . St Lukes and even though there were suspicions, the hospital asked him . to resign on the premise they would give him neutral references. He was then hired as a critical care . nurse at New Jersey's Somerset Medical Center, where he administered . lethal injections to 13 patients over 13 months. It was only when a Roman Catholic . priest named Florian Gall died unexpectedly overnight while recovering . from pneumonia, that the hospital discovered high levels of the heart . drug digoxin in his blood. It was the second unexplained overdose in two weeks and set in motion the events leading up to Cullen's arrest. Asked why he thought he was able to . go undetected for so long, he said: 'I think because it's a matter of . worrying about lawsuits. 'If they pointed out that there was a . problem they were going to be found liable for millions of dollars. They just saw it as a lot easier to not put themselves in a position of . getting sued.' He also revealed that when he was at . Somerset, he was allowed to work one more shift even though he was being . fired over the suspicious deaths. 'The weird thing about Somerset . Hospital was is that they were planning on firing me the night before. So they let me work one more shift knowing that they were going to fire . me the next day,' he told 60 Minutes. 'So they let me work an additional . shift with the suspicion that I had harmed patients. Which I, you know, . was kind of a bizarre thing to do.' Cullen has admitted to killing 40 terminally ill patients in nine hospitals and a nursing home . Watch video here: .","Charles Cullen is known as the most prolific serial killer in American history .

"Smoking chimneys and garish gasometers invade the skyline. The backdrop is poignant if not pretty, for here, amid the industrial heartland of the Ruhr Valley, rumbles one of the talent factories responsible for powering Germany to World Cup success. This is the academy of Schalke 04, once home to Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Julian Draxler and Mesut Ozil - more than £100million’s worth of talent and a key part of the squad in Brazil. And here’s the bad news, at least from an England perspective - there is more to come. Captain Philipp Lahm, record goalscorer Miroslav Klose and defender Per Mertesacker may have retired since their crowning night in Rio, but on Sunday evening in Dortmund a golden generation — this lot have the medals to support that moniker — begin their quest for continental dominance when their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign opens against Scotland.

Forget football for a moment; it is the chemistry of character, maturity, education and trust which is key in Gelsenkirchen. Oliver Ruhnert, academy director, points first to his head and only later to his feet when asked what makes a world champion footballer, and he should know. ‘Mentality is the first thing we look for,’ he says, having already agreed that Germany’s squad in Brazil was psychologically superior to the rest. ‘Any of our scouts know the information we want above all else. What is his mentality? What is he doing when the team are losing? How do his team-mates react to him? ‘The second step is what they can do with their feet. There have been players who would make our team better, for sure, but in the future they would have been a black sheep. This is especially important for Schalke, it is more than technical skills.’ Earlier in the day an Under-16 match is watched by upwards of 500 spectators, many enjoying a beer and a bockwurst - traditional German sausage - laid on by the club. Ruhnert believes early exposure to crowds is one of the reasons why Germany’s players invite the amplified pressure of a major tournament, whereas England’s boys shy away on the international stage. ‘I visited Chelsea, Man City, Man United — all the facilities are so unbelievable and they are better than here. The pitches are like golf greens,’ he says. ‘But maybe the difference is mentality and maturity. When I was there I thought to myself, “Where are the spectators?” Some of the games I went to they were not allowed to watch. Why the secret? Dream factory: Park stadium, Schalke 04's headquarters, training grounds and medical facilities . Honest surroundings: There's nothing especially glamorous about Schalke's headquarters... But the complex and those behind the development of youth players have many reasons to be proud . ‘I think players need to feel pressure. In England, perhaps they don’t. In Germany, we want to treat our players like men from a young age and encourage them to take responsibility.’ On the subject of England, Ruhnert offers: ‘I think the one thing which has to change is the number of foreign players in the Premier League. Before Euro 2000 (when Germany suffered an embarrassing exit at the group stage) it was the same here, you could not find a German centre-forward in the Bundesliga. ‘But after 2000 we changed everything, from top to bottom.’ One innovation was education. Within the grounds of the academy is the Gesamtschule Berger Feld, a partial boarding school which now boasts a quartet of World Cup winners as alumni, as well as several of the current first team who came third in the Bundesliga last season. But it is not just about academic grades. Schalke are strict on their youngsters absorbing the history of the club. Their nickname - Die Knappen - means The Miners, the team having originally been made up of workers from the nearby coalmine. Indeed, the tunnel at the 79,000-capacity Veltins Arena has been transformed to resemble their forefathers’ underground workplace. Future stars: Schalke midfielder Max Meyer and Leon Goretzka celebrate a Bundesliga goal . Next wave: Meyer (left), 18, and Goretzka, 19, have already been capped with the national team . ‘Everybody always asks me, “Why are you so successful?”’ laughs Ruhnert, a coach since his twenties. He is now 41 and one of Germany’s most respected voices on youth football. ‘Of course, you need excellent scouts and coaches and a little bit of luck. But I believe in making small differences. ‘One of them, for us, is that we believe it is very important to tell the players the history of Schalke, to have this in the mind, to always have the spirit of Schalke in the heart. That breeds loyalty and passion. Draxler has been here since he was nine, Benni (Howedes) also. They know the club and have desire for it. The reference to the miners reminds them of the hard work needed to succeed.’ There is also a more recent reminder of the club’s proud history just beyond the academy, where a retro Eighties floodlight towers above a crumbling stadium. That is the old Parkstadion, a host venue at Euro 88 and scene of West Germany’s 2-0 win over Denmark, with Jurgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon the scorers. Connection to history: Schalke redesigned their home tunnel to represent the club's coal mining heritage . Club spirit: Draxler has been part of the Schalke system since he was nine years old . Thon, until Neuer and Co, was perhaps the most famous graduate of Schalke’s youth system. As I chat with Ruhnert, Thon, now 48, is himself just a few hundred yards away at an open day for supporters where more than 100,000 have gathered to meet stars past and present. Everywhere there is evidence of togetherness, community and spirit, a club safeguarding its future. To that end, finding talent is the continual challenge facing Ruhnert and his team of scouts. So where do they unearth their gems? A lot closer than you would perhaps think. Neuer and Ozil were born in Gelsenkirchen, Draxler in the bordering city of Gladbeck and Howedes just 20 miles away in Haltern. There is no need for South American superscouts, as Ruhnert explains: ‘Up to 13 [years old] we only go 20 kilometres around. Up to 15 we extend to our region, which includes 16 million people. It must be possible to find good players in that area, and that is our philosophy here. I say to my scouts, “Please look here first”. ‘After 15 we might start looking abroad. But look at the players we are successful with, most are from Germany and from very close to Gelsenkirchen. ‘One of our scouts is 62 and he only looks out for players between nine and 12 – but he has an unbelievable eye, the best. If he comes to me and says he likes a player, he is never wrong. ‘And we have more coming through now: Max Meyer, Leon Goretzka and Leroy Sane — watch out for them, they are waiting to be the next stars, for Schalke and the national side.’ For while the furnaces of the Ruhr Valley continue to blaze, a diamond is always being mined nearby. Manuel Neuer (28 years old, 203 apps for Schalke before £18m move to Bayern Munich in 2011) ‘Manu is great, I like him so much. At 16 the coaches said he was too small, but he grew 20cm and is now the best goalkeeper in the world. He is someone who always had the mentality to make it to the very top.’ Benedikt Howedes (26 years old, 236 apps/18 goals, still at the club) ‘Benni played on the left side in the World Cup. He had never done that before, that is unbelievable. He is not so fast or good with the ball but he is so intelligent. So you can see, there are different ways to become a professional.’ Julian Draxler (20 years old, 150 apps/27 goals, still at club) ‘There is always speculation about Julian’s future but it is better for him to stay here. He needs time. He made his debut at 16 and there was a lot of hype. But he had a dip also when he was younger. We keep faith with our players though and now he has the chance to be a fantastic player.’ Mesut Ozil (25 years old, 39 apps/1 goal for Schalke before £4m move to Werder Bremen in 2008) ‘Mesut was unbelievable at a young age, a real No 10. But now I don’t think he is the right player for the Premier League (with Arsenal). He is not a fighter. If you need to fight in a match then that’s not him. I think it would be good for him to make a new start, but he is too expensive for us now!’ AND ONE FOR THE FUTURE… . Max Meyer (18 years old, 50 apps/7 goals, still at club) ‘He has already been capped by Germany. He is unbelievable. I have never seen anyone like him. You can wake him up at four o’clock in the morning and he’ll go out and play. He could be one of the best players in the world in the future. But when he was 14 he was so small, everyone said “what do you want with this player?”. We realised the potential he had. He had skills you cannot learn.’ It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .","The Schalke 04 academy produced World Cup-winning stars Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Julian Draxler and Mesut Ozil .

"Arsenal legend Thierry Henry is attracting the interest of French giants Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco according to reports in France as uncertainty continues to surround the striker's future in New York. The 37-year-old, who has been at New York Red Bulls since 2010, will be out of contract with the MLS side at the end of the year and could be open to a move back to Europe in January. Speculation has been rife that Henry is set to retire but the former Gunner could also return for a third spell at Arsenal. Speculation is rife in France that Arsenal legend Thierry Henry could move to PSG or Monaco in January . Henry started his glittering career at Monaco back in 1996 where he scored 21 goals in 115 appearances .

New York's global head of football, former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier, has fuelled the speculation of a move to Ligue 1 by stating Henry could still play at the top level in France. 'If he has the level to play in Ligue 1? Yes, no problem,' Houllier told Le10 Sport. 'So far no decision has been made, either in one direction or the other. Thierry has not decided to end his career,' added Houllier. Henry (right), in action against his former club Arsenal this summer, could be leaving New York Red Bulls . The Frenchman, celebrating at the Emirates, is Arsenal's leading scorer after two spells in North London . 'We would love to keep it but it will also depend on him. Besides Thierry is in shape, it gives the impression of not growing old because he scores goal on goal. 'If there is another strategy that is to start with another squad, younger as the team gains a bit of experience, I think that Thierry could be part of this adventure. 'But it was confirmed that neither he nor the club had not made ​​a decision.'","New York's global head of football Gerard Houllier says no decision has been reached but that they want to keep Thierry Henry .

"A student has been told he can keep a £3,600 haul of goods from Amazon including a television and tablet computer after he was sent them because of a computer glitch. Christmas came early for Robert Quinn, 22, when he started receiving parcels which appeared to have been destined to be returned to the online retailer, only to arrive at his family home in Bromley, south London. In total 51 packages addressed to Mr Quinn have been sent to his parents' house ranging from a £150 baby buggy to a £50 portable heater - and they keep coming. Christmas comes early! Student Robert Quinn with the thousands of pounds worth of goods he received . Haul: Student Robert Quinn (left) has been told he can keep a £3,600 stash of goods from Amazon (right) including a leaf blower, a single bed and a Sony PSP after he was sent them because of a computer glitch . The packages started arriving a week ago, and the most recent arrivals yesterday included a £165 computer processor. He also received a book on neurological physiotherapy, a pirate outfit and an £18.98 Lego fire truck, as well as the £889 55-inch Samsung 3D television and the 12 inch Galaxy Pro, which retails on the site for £338. Other parcels contained larger items such as a single bed, a bookcase and a chest of drawers. And there has been a £120 laptop, a baby buggy, a Sony PSP console, a £90 Waterman pen, a £170 electric wine cooler, a Lotus car user manual, CDs, DVDs and books. Mr Quinn, 22, who is currently away at the University of Liverpool where he studies engineering, believes a computer glitch meant the goods were sent to him, instead of a returns depot as the items had been packaged up with returns labels. His haul remains at his family home but sensibly, he took the pen back to Liverpool for his studies. He said: 'At first I phoned up Amazon and they said that people must be ""gifting"" them to me, but there’s no way that’s happening because I don’t know any of these people. 'I was worried that people were losing out on their stuff so I phone Amazon again and said I’m happy to accept these gifts if they are footing the cost, but I’m not happy if these people are going to lose out. But Amazon said ""it’s on us"". 'I don’t think they’ve rectified the problem because I’m still getting more stuff.' Some of the gifts he plans to give as presents to his family, but may sell the £340 tablet despite his father having a keen eye on it. 'My brother wants the Dolce and Gabbana aftershave and my dad wants the Galaxy tablet,' he said. 'My brother can get the aftershave but I’m not sure my dad can have that tablet for free. 'My mum wants the leaf blower, she can have that. The rest I might sell back on Amazon.' The keen inventor is planning to give some of the items away to charity and sell the rest to fund an 'innovative' new cannabis grinder he is designing. He said: 'I should have about £1,600 to play with this summer and I might take my girlfriend to Bruges. 'And at the moment I’m working on an electrical cannabis grinder. I’m thinking about getting a patent on it.' Lucky: The goods include a 55-inch Samsung television, similar to this model, and a tablet computer . Christmas comes early: The parcels were sent to Mr Quinn's family home, and included a Samsung tablet computer, similar to the one pictured . A spokesman for Amazon told MailOnline: 'This matter has now been resolved and I can confirm that on this occasion the customer has been informed that he can keep the items that were delivered.' Amazon.co.uk, and many of the sellers who run their businesses through the website, offer returns for most items within 30 days of receipt of delivery, although this has been extended for the Christmas period. Many buyers are given a label to print and fix to their item before posting it back to the retailer. Last week the retailer experienced a record-breaking Black Friday when it sold 5.5million items at a rate of 64 purchases a second. It has also hired 13,000 extra staff to deal with pre-Christmas demand.

"A Japanese space explorer took off today on a  six-year journey to complete the most ambitious mission to an asteroid ever attempted. The explorer, named Hayabusa 2, is heading for the carbon-rich asteroid 1999 JU3, which could hold secrets to how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. The probe is expected travel 185 million miles (300 million km) to reach the asteroid in mid-2018, spend 18 months studying it and return in late 2020 with samples in time for the Tokyo Summer Olympics. Scroll down for video . A Japanese space explorer took off today on a six-year journey to complete the most ambitious mission to an asteroid ever attempted. The explorer, named Hayabusa 2, is heading for the carbon-rich asteroid 1999 JU3, which could hold secrets to how the solar system formed . The 1,300lbs (600 kg) spacecraft was launched on a hydrogen-fueled H-2A rocket at the seaside spaceport of Tanegashima in southern Japan. The rocket's upper stage engine fired twice to help the daring spacecraft break free from the pull of Earth's gravity. Carrying four stowaway landers, the spacecraft separated from the H-2A rocket at 06:09 GMT (1:09am EST). Once it reaches the asteroid, a small device will separate from the explorer and shoot a projectile to blast open a crater several feet in diameter. Japan's next asteroid sample return mission will take six years to return material from 1999 JU3 back to Earth. This will involve a number of stages, including dropping an 'impactor' that will explode above the asteroid's surface to allow a probe to collect material . The probe is expected ) to reach the asteroid in mid-2018, spend 18 months studying it and return in late 2020 with samples in time for the Tokyo Summer Olympics. The rocket's upper stage engine fired twice to help the daring spacecraft break free from the pull of Earth's gravity . Once it reaches the asteroid, a small device will separate from the explorer and shoot a projectile to blast open a crater several feet in diameter . The 31 billion yen (£166 million or $260 million) project is sending a probe towards the unpoetically-named 1999 JU3 asteroid in deep space. It will blast a crater in the asteroid to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation. It aims to answer some fundamental questions about life and the universe - including how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. Hayabusa 2, about the size of a refrigerator, is expected to reach the asteroid in 2018 and will spend around 18 months studying the surface. It will also drop tiny Minerva-II rover robots as well as a French-German landing package named Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (Mascot) for surface observation. In a galactic first, Hayabusa 2 will drop an 'impactor' that will explode above the asteroid's surface and fire a metal bullet into the crust at a speed of 4,5000 miles (7,200 l,) -- six times the speed of sound on Earth. The bullet is expected to create a small crater that will enable the probe to collect material that will be returned to Earth in 2020. The probe will map the surface of the asteroid before touching down, deploying small explosives to blast a crater to collect virgin materials unexposed to millennia of solar wind and radiation. An impactor will explode above the asteroid's surface and fire a metal bullet into the crust at a speed of 4,5000 miles (7,200 l,) -- six times the speed of sound on Earth. Hayabusa, which means peregrine falcon in Japanese, plans to hide behind the asteroid during the blast to protect its vital systems. The probe is a rectangular unit with two sets of solar panels sticking out from its sides. The main unit measures 3.3 x 5.2 x 4.6 ft (1 x 1.6 x 1.4 metres). 'The asteroid is carbonaceous and we may find organic matter and water, the stuff of life,' said Hitoshi Kuninaka, project leader at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. 'The impactor is made fully with Japanese technologies that are so advanced you would think they are out of this world,' he added . It will also drop tiny Minerva-II rover robots as well as a French-German landing package named Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (Mascot) for surface observation. The mission should help Japan's space programme put a troubled past well behind it. The first Hayabusa probe was unable to collect as much material as hoped but still made history by being the first vessel to bring back samples from an asteroid. Its seven-year mission ended in 2010 when it blazed a trail over Australian before slamming into the desert. But at the time, Jaxa's work guiding the craft back to Earth made it a source of pride for Japan, even inspiring several Japanese feature films. By reaching inside an asteroid this time, the new explorer may recover material that is not as weathered by the space environment and heat. 'The mission was completed one way or another, but we stumbled along the way,' said Akitaka Kishi from Jaxa's lunar and planetary exploration team. The mission aims to answer some fundamental questions about life and the universe - including how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago.

'To travel there and bring back something is extremely difficult.' Asteroids are believed to have formed at the dawn of the solar system and the probe's target is one called 1999 JU3, which scientists believe contains organic matter that may have contributed to life on Earth. Asteroid 1999 JU3, a rocky body around 3,000ft (900 metres) across with a tenuous gravity field, with a gravity field 60,000 times weaker than Earth's. It is believed to contain significantly more organic matter and water than the potato-shaped rock studied by the original Hayabusa. Its launch, postponed twice because of bad weather, comes less than a month after a European Space Agency probe landed on a comet in a pioneering mission. The European Space Agency's Philae probe finished a 57-hour mission on the surface of a comet on 15 November. But the solar-powered probe lost battery power due to landing in a spot shielded. The Rosetta mission team hope to revive it in March as it nears the sun.

"A plan to build a modern-day crematorium next to the gas chambers and ovens of a Nazi death camp has sparked a storm of protest from Jewish organisations around the world. Authorities in Lublin in eastern Poland want to construct the crematorium near to the Majdanek camp where 80,000 people were put to death during the Second World War . The camp was captured nearly intact because the advance of the Soviet Red Army was so rapid it prevented the Nazis from destroying it before liberation. Death camp: Tens of thousands of people - including many Jews - were killed by the Nazis at Majdanek . Horror: The bodies of those who died were incinerated in the camp's crematorium . Tragic history: The memorial at the entry gate within the concentration camp . Tragedy: Barbed wire fences trapped the prisoners into the camp, while armed guards kept watch for escape attempts . Majdanek remains the best preserved Nazi concentration camp of the Holocaust with intact gas chambers, crematoria and barracks. It is a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. But now Lublin, which has no crematorium for modern day funerals, has deeply upset Europe's Jews with its insensitive plan to build one near Majdanek. 'If people see smoke rising from a crematorium chimmney they will think it comes from Majdanek,' said Roman Litman of the Jewish community of Lublin, the city from where the Nazis directed the murder of 2.4 million Jews in a string of death camps in Nazi-occupied Poland. 'It cannot and must not be built anywhere near this hallowed ground that is strewn with the ashes of the dead.' Reign of terror: A watch tower looks over the site of the Nazi prison camp . Lublin city council is due to decide the planning application from a company called Styks before Friday. Krzysztof . Zuk, mayor of the city of Lublin, and authorities overseeing the . Majdanek memorial site which includes a museum, want the company to find . a different location for its crematorium which - if allowed to go ahead . - would be barely 750 yards away from the place where the Nazis . incinerated their victims. Lublin . says it needs a crematorium as more and more Catholics shun burials. But the rising tide of anger at the spot which has been earmarked may . mean further delays in getting one built. 'There should be no crematorium in . this area because of the one that is already there,' said Edward . Balawajder, the former director of the Memorial Majdanek. 'Majdanek . is known around the world as a memorial to the victims of Nazism. It . should not be shrouded in the smoke of burning people again,' read a . letter to the local paper signed by Jewish groups while Anti-Defamation . League leader Abraham Foxman, himself a Holocaust survivor, said; 'The . idea is disgusting, that a company wants to build such a thing near holy . ground dedicated to the memory of people who suffered incredible . cruelties.' Some locals, however, have backed the project, saying they want to live in a 'normal' city unburdened by the Nazi past. Majdanek . began life as a concentration camp for Jews and Soviet POWS, but began . exterminating inmates soon after opening in 1941. Grim discovery: Soldiers from the Soviet Red Army look at the ovens at Majdanek, following the camp's liberation in 1944 . Majdanek . functioned as sorting and storage depot for property and valuables . taken from the victims at the killing centers in Belzec, Sobibor, and . Treblinka, all in Poland. Victims at Majdanek were forced into gas chambers that were pumped full with the exhaust from captured Soviet tank engines. The crematoria next door still has ash remains of victims in its ovens. The Nazis built hundreds of concentration camps across occupied Europe before and during WWII. The two largest groups prisoners, both numbering in the millions, were Polish Jews and Soviet prisoners of war. There were also large numbers of Roma, ethnic Poles, political prisoners, homosexuals, people with disabilities, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholic clergy, Eastern European intellectuals and others. Western Allied aviators were also sent to concentration camps as spies.","Crematorium .

When asked why the models require so much lotion, he said: 'Angels have the most beautiful long legs, which require lots of tanning liquid.' The 'tan man' then revealed how a chance encounter with Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr led him to his current role in the lingerie runway show. He said: 'The VS Fashion Show came to Los Angeles in 2006. I lived a block away from [then] Kodak Theater where the show was happening. I waited in the hotel lobby and introduced myself to Miranda Kerr as she walked by, and offered her a spray tan. 'Soon, all of the Angels were asking for a tan and I have been hired to be Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Tan Man ever since.' Candice Swanepoel on the catwalk (l) and Lily Donaldson (r) in similar gold winged ensembles . The highlight of the annual Victoria's Secret catwalk event is always the reveal of the Fantasy Bra, of which this year there were two, each of them designed and made by Mouawad jewellers for the lingerie brand. The jewellery makers created the bras using 16,000 rubies, diamonds and sapphires, all of which are strung together with 18-carat gold. The ornate ensembles took the designers more than 1,380 hours to make. Adriana wore the blue and silver version of the swanky lingerie, her toned body bedecked in intricate jewellery across her decolletage, down her torso and over her slim hips. Alessandra had the pleasure of wearing the red bra, and was covered in even more body jewellery than her colleague, accentuating her enviably trim shape, flat stomach and muscular yet lean thighs. The Brazilian models walk the runway wearing the $2m (£1.2m) Fantasy bras during the 2014 show . Each of the models - who have been Victoria's Secret Angels for years (Adriana since 2000, Alessandra since 2004) - were adorned with large, flowing capes matching the colour of their underwear, adding to the drama of the moment. In mid-November, they had taken the elaborate bras to the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, Nevada to pose with the bejeweled creations. Most of the shoes of the night were designed by Sophia Webster, while some of the boots were Nicholas Kirkwood - coming in at a whopping £10,000.","Jimmy uses  three coats of tanner on each model, taking approximately 25 minutes per layer, lasting for seven days .

"With more than 50,000 operations performed each year according to the The British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons, cosmetic surgery is more popular than ever before. But going under the knife to fix bodily woes doesn't always pay off, with new research revealing that two thirds of those who have had surgery say they wish they hadn't. Of the 2,638 people surveyed, 65 per cent said they regretted the operation and a third confessed that the results weren't what they hoped for, with just 28 per cent declaring themselves pleased. Under the knife: 65 per cent, of the 2,638 people aged 18 and over from around the UK, who have had plastic surgery in the past five years, said they regretted it . Second thoughts: Katie Price, pictured here in 2011, has spoken of her regret at having too much plastic surgery . Of the men and women polled, 31 per cent had had breast implants, 27 per cent a nose job and 24 per cent liposuction. Common complaints included complications, which were cited by almost a quarter of respondents, while 17 per cent were angry that side-effects weren't fully explained. So disastrous were the experiences of 13 per cent of those surveyed, they actually felt less confident after the surgery. Another eight per cent revealed that the cost of the operation had left them in dire financial straits. The perils of surgery are well-documented thanks to the well-publicised disaster stories featured on TV shows such as Channel 5's Botched Up Bodies and TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters. Others to speak out about the risks of going under the knife include the surgically enhanced Katie Price, who in 2011, revealed that she regretted some of the choices she had made. 'There was a time when I went mad and my . lips were ­hideous and I looked like a duck,' she told the Sunday Mirror. 'I look at old ­pictures . and I'm scared at what I did to myself. I'm not happy with my boobs at all. I had them reduced because I . had huge boobs. They were ridiculous.' Although Price is yet to rule out having more surgery, the majority of respondents to the new poll, which was conducted by solicitors Medical Accident Group, said they wouldn't repeat the experience. Of the 17 per cent who would consider having more cosmetic surgery, half of those would want to repeat same cosmetic procedure as before. Speaking about the results, Ally Taft, a partner at Medical Accident Group, said: ‘There are many risks associated with what are often major operations and, unfortunately, we see the ones that go wrong. 'The cosmetic surgery sector is not particularly well-regulated so it is important that people consider whether to go through with a procedure very carefully and carry out thorough research into their surgeon or clinic.'

"It is the story of the Chancellor who fell for a designer dog and turned his back on a previously loved family cat. George Osborne has banished his tabby cat Freya from Downing Street after she lost out in the battle for his affections to a Bichon Frise called Lola. After five years with the Osbornes, Freya has been exiled to the Kent countryside where she will live with a member of Mr Osborne’s staff. George Osborne has banished his tabby cat Freya (pictured) from Downing Street after she lost out in the battle for his affections to a Bichon Frise called Lola . Freya has been exiled to the Kent countryside where she will live with a member of Mr Osborne’s staff . To appease the Chancellor’s two children, Luke, 13, and Liberty, 11, her new owner has agreed to send them regular photographs and updates about the cat. The official explanation is that the move is for Freya’s own safety: it comes just weeks after she was hit by a car near Downing Street. The mog has also made headlines for her worrying tendency to stray. But other sources claim it was simple favouritism - Mr Osborne is more of a dog man, and Freya was felt to have been ‘bullying’ Lola, who is half her size. When the Chancellor first brought Lola back to the flat above No 10 where he lives, in 2011, Freya was already firmly ensconsed. Although each pet had the run of their own floor of the apartment, when they met on the stairs the mood was said to have been ‘frosty’. Lola soon cemented her place in the Government by getting ‘married’ to Chief Whip Michael Gove’s male Bichon Frise, Snowy, in a flower-strewn ceremony. Mr Osborne has been gushing about Lola, who he devotedly takes for loo breaks in the Downing Street garden at 6am and midnight. Mr Osborne has been gushing about Lola (pictured), who he devotedly takes for loo breaks in the Downing Street garden . Only yesterday he told an interviewer that he thought Lola was ‘much prettier’ than Mr Gove’s dog. He didn’t mention Freya. Last night, a Downing Street source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Freya had to go, it just wasn’t working out. She was a handful. Poor Lola was scared of her.’ However, an aide to the Chancellor was at pains to deny that Freya had been intimidating the dog. ‘The issue was her tendency to roam, not her relations with Lola,’ he said. ‘She has ended up all over the place: Trafalgar Square, the Red Lion pub [on Whitehall] and miles south of the river. ‘It was getting too much and it was only a matter of time before she was seriously hurt.’ Freya’s temperament was first questioned when she was seen fighting with David Cameron’s cat, Larry, on the Downing Street pavement. This summer, the tabby had to be treated by vets after being hit by a car. Her injuries were minor, but it confirmed the Chancellor’s growing view that the Osbornes should become a one-pet family. Freya went missing from Mr Osborne’s Notting Hill home in 2009 and, after the family moved to Downing Street, she strayed more frequently, once travelling more than a mile to Vauxhall, where she was rescued by a charity worker. Last night, a Treasury aide said: ‘The car accident could have been fatal, and as a result the family took the view that she was at too much risk living in Downing Street.’ Freya’s departure leaves Larry, who lives with the Camerons above No 11, as the last feline in residence in Downing Street. The most famous No 10 cat was Humphrey, who was adopted in 1989 as a stray while Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. When Tony Blair moved in, officials were forced to organise a photocall to disprove rumours the cat had been put down by wife Cherie.","George Osborne has banished his tabby cat Freya from Downing Street .

"Physics genius Professor Stephen Hawking has told Roy Hodgson that his best chances of winning the World Cup in Brazil rest on key factors like playing a 4-3-3 formation, wearing red shirts and persuading the blondest players to take the penalties. After a month long study into the science of England’s past World Cup performances, Professor Hawking shared some of his findings. Perhaps most worrying among them for a team set to start their campaign in the Amazon rainforest, he found that a five-degree increase in temperature reduces England’s chances of winning by 59 per cent. VIDEO Scroll down to see Stephen Hawking's England World Cup theories . Winning formula: Professor Stephen Hawking has unveiled maths that would win England the World Cup . Success: Hawking's formulae for England winning the World Cup (top) and for penalties victory . Numbers game: The Cambridge physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat, the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper England's chances . He also discovered England are 22 per cent more likely to win short-haul games and that jet-lag, cultural differences and the nationality of the referee and shirt colour all take their toll. They are better close to sea-level and kicking off as near to 3pm as possible. In red, England have a 20 per cent higher rate of success, fitting the theory that red makes teams feel 'more confident, more aggressive and more dominant', something which will not be lost on Cardiff owner Vincent Tan. Professor Hawking also found England won 63 per cent of games with a European referee, compared with 38 per cent when the referee is from elsewhere. He also added that: 'WAGs are irrelevant.' As for penalties, he discovered strikers score the most, not surprisingly. The best place to aim is for the top corners and he also found blond and bald players perform better from the spot than those which dark hard, something he claimed with remain 'one of the mysteries of science.' Putting them on the spot: England are rubbish at penalties. Fact. Blonds are better: Apparently blonds (such as Joe Hart) are proven to be more proficient at penalties . Irrelevant: WAGs like Steven Gerrard's wife Alex Curran don't affect chances of winning, according to Hawking . Colour of success: England are more likely to win if they wear red, as they did famously in 1966 . 'European referees are more sympathetic to the English game and less sympathetic to ballerinas like [Luis] Suarez,' he said, and noted that goalkeepers who wobble around like Bruce Grobelaar or jump from side to side are 18 per cent more likely to make a save. 'As a theoretical physicist I am marginally more qualified to make predictions than Paul the Octopus,” said Professor Hawking, who was commissioned for the study by bookmakers Paddy Power and has donated his fee to charities. He’s going for Brazil to win it, by the way. A selection based on the fact that more than 30 per cent of World Cups have been won by the host nation. But he added: 'All science, mathematics and rational thought goes out of the window. I am an Englishman and I will be cheering our boys all the way to the final in Rio.' Graphical: The effect of home and away kits on England performances in the European Championships and World Cup . Historical data: This graph shows how England have fared in matches against opponents from each continent . Line up: Professor Hawking said that England should play 4-3-3 rather than 4-4-2, based on its success . Dancer: Luis Suarez gets less sympathy from referees as he is a 'ballerina', according to Hawking . Wobblers: And jelly-legged keepers, like Jerzy Dudek, are more likely to make a save . 'This will remain one of science's great mysteries': Professor Hawking said there is no evidence that it's advantageous to be left or right-footed but bald players and fair-haired players are more likely to score . Goalkeeper mobility: Players should place the ball in the top left or right hand corner when taking a penalty .","Hawking believes England best chance is to play a 4-3-3 formation .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has not ruled out keeping Frank Lampard at the Etihad Stadium beyond the terms of his loan from sister club New York City FC. Lampard is due to head to the MLS in January but an equalising goal against former club Chelsea at the weekend and two more in the 7-0 Capital One Cup rout of Sheffield Wednesday have pointed to the 36-year-old's value to City. Lampard's night took a turn for the peculiar when a pitch invader managed to grab a 'selfie' photograph with the former England star in the centre circle with the game still going on. Frank Lampard scored twice in 7-0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup third round . Lampard also scored against Chelsea in the Premier League last weekend, although he didn't celebrate . But talk turned more serious after the game when Pellegrini was asked about keeping Lampard for the whole season. 'It is an issue that we will see further down the line,' said the City manager. 'We will see what happens in January and we have two or three months to decide. 'He deserves all the praise he can get from the fans. 'We will do what is best for the team and the player. A fans also ran on to the pitch to take a selfie with the former Chelsea man, he was then taken away by police . 'We must talk about a lot of things, but it is not impossible for him to stay here.' After a scoreless first half, Lampard scored three minutes in the second period before winning a penalty on the hour and scoring again in injury time. Asked about the incident with the fan, Pellegrini said: 'He deserved the hug. 'He is a star in England and I'm very happy for him. 'For me, it is never difficult to put good players in the team. The problem is when you don't have the players. 'He is a very important player for our team and maybe, at 36, he cannot play three games in a row. But Frank is a top player.'

"Riley Pearson was suspended for four days for breaking school rules by having Mini Cheddars in his lunchbox and has now been expelled . A six year-old boy who was suspended from his school after he took a bag of Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch has now been expelled. Riley Pearson, from Colnbrook, near Slough, was initially excluded from Colnbrook C of E Primary School after teachers discovered the snack and called in his parents. After a meeting with headmaster Jeremy Meek, they were sent a letter telling them Riley would be excluded from last Wednesday until Monday because he had been 'continuously breaking school rules'. But his parents have now said he has been expelled after they spoke to the media, while his younger brother has also been banned from its pre-school. The school has insisted a pupil was not excluded 'for just having Mini Cheddars in their lunchbox' but because there had been a 'persistent and deliberate breach of . school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini . sausages, scotch eggs and similar'. Riley’s dad, Tom Pearson, said he was 'devastated' that the school had not only deprived Riley of his schooling but also his younger brother who attends its pre-school. He added that a scheduled meeting between the family and headteacher Mr Meek, due to take place yesterday was cancelled when he arrived. Mr Pearson then saw Mr Meek in the school playground as he picked up Riley's brother Jayden from pre-school but Mr Meek told him he would telephone him by the end of the day to let him know what was happening. Minutes later Mr Pearson received a phone call telling him both Riley and Jayden were not welcome back at the school. 'I’m just devastated,' said Mr Pearson, last night. 'He rang and told me the decision had been made to exclude Riley permanently and we had given the school a bad reputation because of the media coverage. 'He also said the funded sessions Jayden has at the school’s pre school were being withdrawn too. I think he’s a coward for not telling me to my face.' 'Not balanced': Riley's lunchbox fell foul of the new healthy eating policy at Colnbrook C of E primary school . The airport worker and wife Natalie, who is due to give birth to her fourth child next week, are now waiting to hear from education officers from Slough Borough Council to see what to do next. In a statement the school said a pupil had been permanently excluded because 'during the course of a recent four day exclusion, . the pupil’s parents made it publicly clear that their child would not . be following the school's policy on healthy eating upon their return'. The . school also said the decision was taken because of 'the parent school . relationship suffering an irretrievable breakdown' due to 'misrepresentations in the local and national media . that were both wholly inaccurate and grossly misleading, abusive . language being used towards staff, and other inappropriate actions being . taken that were designed to damage the school’s reputation'. The school, which was placed in special measures after Ofsted inspectors deemed it 'inadequate' in 2012, introduced a healthy eating policy at the start of term. The school has said it was 'extremely disappointing that the media have been provided with such grossly misleading information' A letter was sent to parents saying that from January 14, packed lunches should be 'healthy and balanced'. Parents . were told: 'Chocolate, sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks are not allowed. If your child's lunchbox is unhealthy and unbalanced they will be . provided with a school lunch for which you will be charged.' A letter was sent to parents saying that from January 14, packed lunches should be 'healthy and balanced' At the time of his exclusion last . week, Riley's mother Natalie said: . 'We just do not see how they have the right to tell us what we can feed . our son. 'If anything, Riley is underweight and could do with putting on a few pounds.' Miss . Mardle, who is expecting her fourth child, added: 'Having a balanced . diet also includes eating some carbohydrates, sugars and fats. 'It is not about excluding some foods, it is about getting the mix right.' Riley’s lunchbox usually contains a . sandwich, yoghurt tube, Dairylea Dunkers cheese spread snack, and a . packet of Mini Cheddars, with water to drink. His . mother said the . 3ft 9ins tall schoolboy who weighs 3st 2lbs, eats home-cooked meals and . plenty of fruit and vegetables at home. Miss Mardle said: 'I would understand the exclusion if he was constantly throwing tables around or bullying other children, but it is just ridiculous for a packet of Mini Cheddars. 'Surely the headteacher has better things to do with his time than search lunchboxes?' A statement released by the school said it was 'extremely disappointing that the media have been provided with such grossly misleading information which has resulted in them running a wholly inaccurate and potentially damaging story for our school'. The statement said: 'We have not excluded a pupil for just having Mini Cheddars in their lunchbox, but where there is a persistent and deliberate breach of school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini sausages, scotch eggs and similar, and all other avenues have been exhausted, the Governors would expect further action to be taken. Government guidelines for school meals suggest food must meet certain nutritional standards so children have healthy and balanced diets. According to the guidance, this means there must be high quality meat, poultry or oily-fish, at least two portions of fruit and vegetables with each meal and bread, other cereals and potatoes. It also rules out fizzy drinks, crisps, chocolate or sweets in school meals and vending machines along with more than two portions of deep-fried food a week. 'If we are faced with a situation where a parent threatens to send a pupil into school with insufficient food to sustain them throughout the school day, it is a risk we simply cannot afford to happen.' The statement went on to say it would only use a permanent exclusion as a final resort 'when all other avenues have been exhausted'. It said the school took the decision to permanently exclude a pupil yesterday because of 'persistent breaches of school policies' and because 'during the course of a recent four day exclusion, the pupil’s parents made it publicly clear that their child would not be following the school's policy on healthy eating upon their return'. The school also said the decision was taken because of: 'The parent school relationship suffering an irretrievable breakdown that would have put two pupils in an unacceptable position. 'This breakdown was due to misrepresentations in the local and national media that were both wholly inaccurate and grossly misleading, abusive language being used towards staff, and other inappropriate actions being taken that were designed to damage the school’s reputation.'","School disputes parents' claims and says pupil was excluded for 'continuously breaking school rules'

"Bloomberg: 'Protesters are taking jobs away from the city' These are the shocking scenes that have led some people to accuse the Occupy Wall Street protesters living rough in New York's financial district of creating unsanitary and filthy conditions. Exclusive pictures obtained by Mail Online show one demonstrator relieving himself on a police car. Elsewhere we found piles of stinking refuse clogging Zuccotti Park, despite the best efforts of many of the protesters to keep the area clean.

Properties, which owns Zuccotti Park, the site of the New York . demonstration, have already railed against protesters, who they claim are creating sanitation problems. 'Sanitation . is a growing concern,' Brookfield said in a statement. Despite claiming to represent 'the 99 per cent', not all Americans are behind the Wall Street protests. But according to the Financial Times, the President himself is unofficially backing their cause. The paper wrote: 'While not endorsing the protests, Barack Obama and Joe Biden have expressed understanding of the movement that has spread rapidly across the country. 'Mr Obama said people were angry because Wall Street had not been 'following the rules'. 'His vice-president even compared the movement on Thursday to the Tea Party, the conservative movement which has upended national politics in the past two years.' 'Normally . the . park is cleaned and inspected every week night. . . because the . protesters refuse to cooperate. . .the park has not been cleaned since . Friday, September 16th and as a result, sanitary conditions have reached . unacceptable levels,' CBS News reported. Although . many of the protesters are understood to be making strenuous efforts to . clean up after themselves, after three weeks of occupation, the strain . of hundreds of people living on the street has begun to take its toll. The authorities today warned of a dramatic crackdown on Wall Street demonstrators, as the protests spread across America. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly has promised that if protesters targeted the police, authorities will respond with 'force.' Kelly blamed activists for starting the skirmishes with police that led to 28 arrests yesterday. Most were arrested for disorderly behaviour, CBS News reported.

Hundreds of people have been arrested in New York since the protests began last month. On Wednesday, the biggest crowd so far of about 5,000 people marched on New York's financial district, and police used pepper spray on some protesters.

"Sir Cliff Richard suffered a 65 per cent drop in airplay of his songs on UK radio stations since his home was raided  over child sex allegations . Sir Cliff Richard has suffered a 'significant drop' in the number of times his songs have been played on the radio in the UK since his home was raided as part of a child sex abuse investigation. The BBC filmed the raid of Sir Cliff's Berkshire mansion and broadcast the coverage live after striking a deal with South Yorkshire Police over the planned search. A reporter had contacted the force weeks before the planned search in August about the top secret investigation. However the pop star's reputation may have been damaged by the very public revelations about the search - because his airplay has dropped by around 65 per cent in the UK since it took place. An analysis of radio airplay, by BBC Radio 5 Live using figures from Radio Monitor, found that there has been a 65 per cent drop in the number of times Sir Cliff songs have been played on BBC and commercial radio stations in the last three months. A friend of Sir Cliff told MailOnline: ‘The BBC identified Sir Cliff in collusion with police, flouting the guidelines that people should not be named before they are charged. By stopping playing his records they have caused him further serious harm and are happy to compound it by highlighting the damage they themselves have caused.’ Since August 14 - when the raid took place - records by the number one singer have been played 1,800 times by UK radio stations. This is a 65 per cent drop from the more than 5,000 times his records were given airtime during the same period the year before. Even taking into account Sir Cliff's album release last year, the figures suggest his success has been hampered by the raid. In 2012 his records were played around 4,500 times during this three month period - a 60 per cent fall to today's figures. A representative for Sir Cliff, 74, said they 'acknowledged the BBC has confirmed the unlawful naming of Sir Cliff Richard and disproportionate coverage' of the raids at his £3m mansion has caused him 'serious harm.' The corporation was heavily criticised for its live coverage of the raid, which appeared to show BBC cameras ready at the gates of Sir Cliff's Berkshire mansion before police arrived. The Home Select Committee described South Yorkshire Police's handling of the raid as inept. Scroll down for video . It later emerged a reporter from the BBC had contacted the force asking about a planned raid and police said they felt they needed to strike the unusual deal to prevent the corporation reporting the facts anyway, and potentially jeopardising the investigation into allegations that Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a boy at a 1980s concert. South Yorkshire Police admitted striking the 'unprecedented deal' for the BBC to show live coverage of the raid in return for them holding their story until it took place. Sir Cliff – who strongly denies  all the allegations – also expressed anger that the BBC was tipped off about the search before he was. At the time of the search he had been at his villa in Portugal. BBC reporter David Sillito is shown covering the raid by police of Sir Cliff's Berkshire Mansion in August . The BBC was criticised after it appeared to be ready to film the raid in Sunningdale before police arrived . Sir Cliff was in Portugal when his Berkshire mansion was searched and was angry the BBC were tipped off . The singer has never been arrested or charged in respect of the claims. The BBC said the Home Select Committee had already endorsed the way the broadcaster covered the raids. A spokeswoman said: 'There has been no change to our music policy and Cliff Richard’s songs have been played throughout the year across BBC stations.' Sir Cliff has sold 250 million records worldwide and won countless awards, including a lifetime achievement Brit Award. He has also achieved number ones throughout five decades with The Young Ones, Summer Holiday, We Don't Talk Anymore, Misletoe and Wine and Millennium Prayer. He returned to the studio in October - the first time since the raid was broadcast live by the BBC- to record his 101st album. After the revelations the police criticised the BBC for its ‘disappointing’ failure to make it clear the police had not been the original source of the story. However the broadcaster said it had followed journalistic practice in agreeing not to broadcast a story that could jeopardise an inquiry. Following the raid a producer at BBC Radio Solent sent an email to staff instructing them to delete from their playlists any of the pop legend’s songs to 'avoid embarrassment.' This was criticised by MPs and the public.","Sir Cliff Richard's Berkshire home raided in child sex probe in August .

"A pregnant woman in Iowa had a particularly difficult labor this week when she was held at gunpoint on her way to the hospital. Rachel Kohnen and her husband Ben were going 30 miles over the speed limit on Tuesday morning in Fort Dodge, Iowa, as Rachel was in labor and felt that if the two did not get to the hospital soon she was going to give birth in a car. Around that time, a police officer turned on his sirens to pull the couple over, but they kept going. Scroll down for video .

Baby girl: Rachel ultimately gave birth to her fourth child Hazel (above) who weight in a 10 pounds . 'He starts following me and he turns on his lights an my wife says we can’t pull over. The baby is coming now,' Ben, who was driving, told NBC 13. Said Rachel, 'I did tell him not to stop.' She then added, 'I think I was screaming,  ""Oh dear God, we can’t have the baby in the car.”' The couple called 911 to notify them of the situation, but it was too late. Police had set up a stop and thrown down tire spikes, so the couple's tires were blown out, and that was when things got really rough on Rachel.

A student at Arkansas State University, Eaton was impaled while at a rush event, WMC reported, and was seen last month using a wheelchair. A campus police incident report, excerpts of which were published by KAIT, said a 20-year-old man at the event struck a flying football with the golf club. The report went on to say that 'The separated shaft and head traveled around 30 feet when the shaft impaled [Eaton].' 'When it the club went in, it hit her spinal cord,' friend Makaleigh Riddle told KAIT in August. 'The way doctors talked about it, it was probably paralysis. That's the best that we were looking at. It was really hard to hear. But now she's moving her arms and legs a day later. I don't know. That's just crazy. I know people are praying everywhere but that's a miracle. She's the strongest person I've ever met so that doesn't surprise me at all.' Help: The man who used the golf club reportedly helped Eaton after she was impaled . Speaking about the 20-year-old man, Riddle said at the time 'She just went to fall and he held her head there for a good 15 minutes to keep her in place. If that [the club] had moved at all, there was not really anything anyone could have done. 'His quick reaction probably saved her life. He had to be really strong for that. I couldn't imagine.' 'It was a freak accident which is basically the only way to describe it,' Riddle also told KAIT. 'There's no way you could have even imagined that that's what would have happened.

"Disgruntled shoppers have called for a Costco store to have opening times only for U.S. customers - after being bombarded by Canadians buying cheap milk. Residents in Bellingham, Washington, say they are annoyed with large numbers of visitors driving across the border to stock up on gas and food. The nearest towns north of Bellingham are Abbotsford and Surrey in British Columbia -  just 30 miles away over the border. Canadian residents can take advantage of their strong dollar against the weak U.S. currency and buy food and fuel for less than they would at home. Scroll down for video . Busy: A picture posted on Facebook protest page calling for U.S. only opening hours at Costco a Costco in Bellingham, WA, shows a long queue with many Canadians . Tensions: Local customers have complained that the Canadians are 'rude' when they bombard the shop to buy cheap milk and gas . Residents angry at the 'rude Canadians' have now started a Facebook page calling for them to be banned during certain times. The site, named 'Bellingham Costco needs a special time just for Americans', shows pictures of cars with BC plates taking up two parking spaces. It also has images of a packed shop floor with large numbers of people queuing. While a video shows the frantic scrabble to buy milk after a crate of it is unloaded into the shop. So far it is attracted 2,158 likes as dozens of residents back the campaign. A large group of Canadians scramble to buy cases of milk from the Costco store. A video of the scenes - which have angered residents - have been uploaded onto the Facebook protest page . Almost gone: Within seconds the milk has disappeared as Canadian customers load their carts with the dairy product, which is cheaper in the U.S. than it is in Canada . The Canadian Dollar has seen five successive weeks of gains against its U.S. counterpart and currently buys around at 99.11 cents per U.S. dollar. One Canadian dollar buys $1.009. This is up from year lows of 94 cents per Canadian dollar last September. The creator of the Facebook page wrote: 'To our Canadian friends on here that think we hate you: You have to look at the root of the problem. 'Bellingham has laws that keep big box companies from expanding. The overcrowding in this small, slow paced town has agitated people.'

Ken Oplinger told CBC News that they bring in tax revenues and 'without them the living situation in the city would be quite different'. He added: 'In the last two years, our sales tax generation has doubled or tripled the pace in the rest of the state, and its almost entirely because of the Canadians coming south.' A Costco spokesman said the store wanted to expand to take into account the extra customers from Canada but could not do so at its current site because there is not enough room. They also ruled out introducing opening times just for Americans. However, they have employed an off-duty police officer two days a week to control the crowds parking at the store during busy periods.","Facebook protests page calls for Canadians to be banned at certain times .

"In the depths of the countryside, it is not unusual to find young lambs huddled in front of a fireplace or swaddled in a blanket in a farmer's living room as they are nursed back to health. However, it's not often the newborn lambs begin to favour their newfound human surroundings over grassy fields and hay-filled barns. But, that’s exactly what’s happened to one youngster, who is now having an ‘identity crisis’ after preferring to be more like his dog playmate. Scroll down for video . Keith, the 'sheep dog', was taken in by 19-year-old Anna Burton (together above with the family's other dogs) when he was born prematurely at the family's farm in Nidderdale, North Yorkshire, in February this year . The lamb was unwell when he was born and was cared for by Miss Burton, being nursed back to good health . Keith now lives with the family and enjoys taking part in activities with the dogs, including walks in the fields . Keith, the 'sheep dog', was taken in by Anna Burton when he was born prematurely at the family's farm in Nidderdale, North Yorkshire, in February this year. Miss Burton, 19, only brought the newborn into the house in order to take care of him as he was abandoned by his mother and was a 'very small' lamb. Since then, Keith has adjusted to life indoors and has been spotted stealing food from the dogs' bowls, watching TV and snuggling up for cuddles with his owner. Miss Burton, a college student, said the lamb now gets on so well with the family dog, Toby, that they are often found playing together on the farm. She said: 'He was born prematurely at the end of February this year to a sheep who we thought was having twins, but actually had triplets. He even shares the dog's bowl with the family's other six dogs and likes to spend time in the family home . Miss Burton said he enjoys watching TV, having cuddles with her and eating dog food with the other animals . He has formed a strong bond with the family's dog, Toby, and they can often be seen playing together . 'We didn't find Keith for a few hours by which point he wasn't very well and was too small to get milk from his mum. 'He spent about one week learning how to stand up and lived inside for over a month, usually just sitting by the dogs or on the sofa with me. 'Our dog Toby used to get very protective of people touching him or going near him. 'He and Keith get on well together now and I often find him in the barn with him.' It is not the first time the family has brought a lamb into the house, but never before has one made themselves at home as much as Keith. Miss Burton said Keith, who has grown considerably since February, enjoys walks with the family's dogs . She said: ''Our dog Toby used to get very protective of people touching him or going near him' The family have moved Keith to a barn outside the family home, but said he is often found wandering back in . The family currently have six dogs but Keith believes himself to be the seventh member of the pack. Miss Burton said: 'Keith has fit right in with the dogs. They are all still very protective of him even though he is actually bigger than them now. 'It must be confusing for them because Keith thinks he is one of them. The other sheep don't like him very much though. 'Keith sits and waits for his food just like the dogs and whenever he saw one of them jump onto the sofa he would try and jump up too. He would also come for walks round the fields too.' Miss Burton is used to having sheep around, having grown up around them on the farm, and has gained vast experience through her childhood in looking after them. Keith was rather unwell and fragile when he was born in February (pictured) and was taken in by the family . He was nursed back to health in the family's home, where Miss Burton fed him up and kept him warm . Miss Burton has grown up with lambs on the farm her whole life (pictured above as a youngster with a lamb) Miss Burton has developed a strong bond with Keith (together above) after nursing him back to good health . The pair even snuggle up on the sofa together, although Keith has grown remarkably since he was a baby . She is currently studying for a business and management degree at Harrogate College but is looking to go into vet nursing next year. Due to his current size, Keith is now too big to live in the house and is currently living in a barn with three other sheep, who were also unwell when they were born. However, keeping Keith out of the house has proved difficult for the family as at any opportunity, the 'sheep dog' likes to wander in. Miss Burton added: 'He lives in a barn outside with three other sheep. 'Although, Keith does still like to come for a wander in the house when he gets the chance. 'He just generally really enjoys human company.' Miss Burton said Keith, the 'sheep dog' is often found trotting in and out of the family home as he pleases . He is now almost fully-grown and has been moved to a barn on the farm, where he lives with other sheep . Despite his new home, he loves popping back in to the main house for food and to see his owners and dogs .","Keith the 'sheep dog' taken in by Burton family after being born premature .

"The simple exercise of sitting down and standing up again without holding onto anything, could suggest how long you have to live. This is the belief of a group of physicians, who came up with the ‘sitting-rising test’ to measure their patients’ flexibility and strength. They developed a scoring system for the test and found that people who scored three points or less out of 10, were more than five times as likely to die within six years, as those who scored more than eight points. Scroll down for video . The simple exercise of sitting down and standing up again without holding onto anything, could suggest how long you have to live. This diagram shows how to take the 'sitting rising test' Claudio Gil Araujo, of Gama Filho University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was among the doctors who originally developed the sitting rising test (SRT) to quickly assess the flexibility of athletes, but he now uses it to persuade his patients that they need to stay active to maintain their muscle and balance, and live longer, Discover Magazine reported. As we age, our muscles tend to become weaker and a loss of balance means we are increasingly likely to fall. Current ways to test frailty can be time-consuming, impractical and inaccurate for small doctors’ surgeries, but experts are keen to keep older people moving. Dr Araujo says that anyone can take the SRT because no equipment is needed. A video explaining how the sitting standing test works, although caution should be exercised if you give it a try . As we age, our muscles tend to become weaker and a loss of balance means we are increasingly likely to fall. Doctors are keen for older people to keep exercising - a stock image of  a class in Florida is pictured . In a study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, the researchers described how 2002 adults aged between 51 and 80 took the SRT at Clinimex Exercise Medicine Clinic in Rio. They found that patients who scored fewer than eight points out of 10 on the test, were twice as likely to die within the next six years, compared with people with more perfect scores. One point was deducted each time a person used their hand or knee for support to either sit down or stand up, while half a point was deducted for losing their balance. The experts found that people who scored three points or fewer, were more than five times as likely to die within the same period. They wrote in the study: ‘Musculoskeletal fitness, as assessed by SRT, was a significant predictor of mortality in 51–80-year-old subjects.’ The study found that every point increase in the test, was linked to a 21 per cent decrease in mortality from all causes. However, chartered physio-therapist Sammy Margo said that the exercise may be 'quite ambitious' for older people in the UK. This is possibly because of cultural differences, because Britons are not used to regularly sitting on the floor, like in some other cultures. In this way, it may not be terribly accurate at predicting life expectancy. She told MailOnline that there is a risk that people with early signs of arthritis in the knee could feel the strain when trying the exercise, which she described as 'quite hard work'. 'The advice is not to endorse the test – it sounds as if it is somewhat simplistic and it is not widely used,' she said. UK physiotherapists tend to prefer another test, where patients stand up from a sitting position  and see how many times they can repeat the action in 30 seconds. 'The ""30 second chair test"" is more appropriate and is used as a prognostic,' she said. 'It's simplistic, quick and easy and gives a good indicator for falls.' The test measures leg strength and endurance - which are needed to move around without falling - rather than flexibility and agility like the SRT. Healthy people aged between 60 and 64 are expected to stand and sit more than 12 times for women and 14 times for men in 30 seconds. A good score for a 90 to 94-year-old is siting and standing more than seven times for man and four times for women. While Ms Margo did not recommend the SRT, she said it does 'address everything' in terms of a person's strength and flexibility.","Physicians in Brazil developed the test to measure flexibility quickly .

"The derelict military bunker at the centre of a German officer's botched plot to blow up Hitler will be opened to the public as a museum. The Wolf’s Lair, located in the Masurian woods in northeastern Poland, has been open to the public since the end of World War II, but mainly for much criticised paintball games or as an indoor shooting range. It was one of Hitler’s key military headquarters during the war. But is most famous as the place Colonel Claus von .

New image: Tourists wander around the remains of the Wolf's Lair in Poland, which will now open as a museum to educate visitors about its history . The plan was to kill Hitler and replace him with a government which would negotiate a truce with the Allies, ending the war. Having left the conference for a pre-arranged phone call, Colonel von Stauffenberg, whose fate was thrown back into the spotlight due to 2008 movie Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise, left the hut shortly before the bomb detonated. However, a staff officer had moved the briefcase shortly after von Stauffenberg’s departure which saw Hitler protected from the blast and the dictator survived with minor injuries. Von Stauffenberg was captured and . executed alongside three conspirators and all their relatives were sent . to concentration camps. A total of 200 were executed as a result of the assassination attempt. Overgrown: Part of one of the derelict bunkers on the 600 acre complex which once had its own train station . Title: Wolf's Lair, Wolfsschanze in German, was named after Hitler's self-appointed nickname: Herr Wolff . Four months after the bomb, Wolf's Lair was destroyed by the Nazi forces as the Soviet Red army advanced in 1945. Soon after it became a tourist attraction. Nearly 70 years later, due to lax . legislation, tours of the overgrown bunkers have been less informative . than the Polish Government see fit and tourists can even pose for . photographs in Nazi uniforms. ‘At this moment, one does not feel the tragic dimension of this place,’ historian Tomasz Chinciski told The New York Times.

"The urge to join Twitter is tempting when everyone from the Prime Minister to the Pope is posting messages about their daily lives. But actor George Clooney says anyone who is rich and famous and on the social media site is a 'moron'. Speaking in an interview with Esquire magazine, the Hollywood star also says the pressures of the 21st Century would have been too much for the stars from the 'golden age' of cinema. Actor George Clooney says anyone who is rich and famous and on the social media site is a 'moron' 'Not that I'm comparing myself to Clark Gable, whoever, but they couldn't survive in this environment', the 52-year-old said. 'They'd punch the s**t out of some people. It requires a Zen quality.' Twitter addict and columnist Caitlin Moran responded: 'If I were friends with Sandra Bullock in real life, I probably wouldn't be on Twitter either, to be honest.' Despite the actor's rise to global superstardom, he says being famous is restrictive. The Hollywood star says the pressures of the 21st Century would have been too much for the stars from the 'golden age' of cinema . In 15 years Clooney has not gone for a walk in New York's Central Park, despite wanting to, and is still surprised by his success. 'There's a funny thing about fame. The truth is you run as fast as you can towards it because it is everything you want. You get there and it's shocking how immediately you become enveloped in this world that is incredibly restricting.' Clooney, who has won two Academy Awards and four Golden Globes, is not the first to criticise the use of Twitter. However, some have had to give in to social media network. David Cameron said in 2009 that 'the trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it (is) too many tweets might make a t**t'. But that didn't stop him setting up an account just before the Tory party conference in 2012 and now he has more than 500,000 followers. Hugh Laurie in House (left) succumbed to joining Twitter this year while actor George Clooney said stars from the golden age of cinema such as Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable would not survive in today's environment . Four years ago Hugh Laurie declared: 'As I look around my friends' tweets, I see banality on all sides.' He . now has more than 230,000 followers since he set up his Twitter account . declaring in under 140 characters: 'Having damned this technology as . the seed of Satan, I finally succumb'. Actor Steven Berkoff described Twitter as a 'river of filth'. David Cameron tweeted this photo of himself with Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma yesterday. He originally was against the idea of joining Twitter . George Clooney's latest project sees him team up with Ocean's Eleven co-start Matt Damon once again as they battle to rescue art stolen by Nazis during the Second World War in new movie The Monuments Men.

"A model famous for a second place in Brazil's popular Miss Bumbum-competition is fighting for her life in intensive care after a botched cosmetic surgery. Andressa Urach, is in a 'serious condition' in a hospital in the southern city of Porto Alegre after removing gel from her thighs, which had previously been injected for cosmetic purposes. The 27-year-old's surgery wounds became infected following a second operation to drain her thighs  and she is currently being sedated, her mother Marisete De Favari said. Botched surgery: After discovering that the fillers in her legs were causing her leg muscles to rot, Miss Urach made several attempts to 'drain' the thighs, but instead they became infected . Miss Urach tweeted this picture from her hospital bed at the weekend, but her condition worsened on Tuesday and she went into septic shock . Miss Urach came second in the 2012 Miss Bumbum competition, which scours Brazil for the most attractive behind in the land. Ahead of the competition, Miss Urach, who hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim he strenuously denied, had injected two types of 'body fillers', hydrogel and PMMA, into the upper legs to fill out the thighs and lift her bottom. In July this year the model discovered that the products were causing her leg muscles to rot, leaving her in excruciating pain. In an interview with Brazil's R7 website, she said: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. 'That's why I am feeling such strong pains. I'm taking morphine every four hours and antibiotics to alleviate the suffering.' All personality: Miss Bumbum runner-up Andressa Urach, underwent surgery to remove two types of 'bodyfillers' which she had injected into her legs to enlarge her bottom and thighs . Miss Urach underwent an operation in July to drain 400ml of hydrogel from each leg, but the model continued to complain of discomfort and pain. On Saturday she was rushed to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures on Sunday and Monday, according to reports. On Tuesday, Miss Urach went into septic shock and was taken to the intensive care ward, where she remains sedated in a 'serious' state. The thigh augmentation surgery was one of at least nine cosmetic procedures the Miss Bumbum runner-up had done in the last five years, according to reports. They included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, boob job, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. A friend of Ms Urach, who didn't want to be named, said the TV presenter had been unable to perform physical exercises for four months. She said: 'She was always in a lot of pain. She knew that the liquid was dripping inside of her and she didn't want to use shorts or miniskirt.' Another Miss BumBum contestant, Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said: 'Everyone is in a state shock. 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. We were slaves to beauty.' Claim to fame: Miss Urach came second in the 2012 Miss Bumbum competition and hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo . Ms Urach's agent, Cacau Oliver, who is also the creator of the Miss BumBum competition, on Monday night asked fans of the model to pray for her. He said: 'We are all praying fervently, now is the time to pray.' And Ms Urach's mother, Marisete De Favari, who hasn't left her daughter's bedside, last night thanked fans or their messages of support but asked the to keep praying. She wrote on her Facebook page: 'A beautiful, intelligent woman, a girl full of dreams, who has fought to get where she is, who never gave up even though nothing was easy, who just wants the best for her family, a girl who fears God. 'For this, I am certain, by by faith, that she will be cured. Thank you all from the heart and I ask that you keep praying, because this will be one more fight and my baby will come through it victorious.' Miss Andressa infuriated Real Madrid striker Ronaldo in April last year by claiming he had cheated on girlfriend Irina Shayk with her. She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa in a statement of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel she claimed they made love at for an interview with a reporter. The pretty brunette greeted him wearing only a coat of patriotic Portuguese red and green body paint when he arrived at his country's base camp hotel in Caminas near Sao Paulo at the start of the World Cup in June. Six days later she was ejected from Portugal's public training session at a nearby football stadium and told to stay away from the Real Madrid star.","Andressa Urach, 27, was Miss Bumbum-runner up in 2012 .

"Click here to read the complete science behind the adidas Brazuca . Neymar could soon have the world at his feet if he inspires Brazil to glory on home turf this summer. And the Barcelona star got a taste of the ball he hopes to win the World Cup with during training at Brazil's training base on Wednesday. Chelsea's Oscar and former team-mate David Luiz were among the players who used the Brazuca ball while training alongside Neymar as the squad were assembled on the pitch for the first time since joining up for the World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar and Brazil team-mates receiving World Cup medicals . Skills test: Oscar (left) and Neymar (centre) juggle with the Brazuca World Cup ball in training on Wednesday . Keep up: Dani Alves (second right) also got a taste of the official World Cup ball at Granja Comary . Likes what he sees? Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari (centre) casts his eye over his squad . Goalkeeper Julio Cesar has backed the official World Cup ball, playing down possible worries over the performance of the adidas-made Brazuca. 'The ball is a good one, we had contact with it today,' the former Inter Milan and Queens Park Rangers player said of the Brazuca, which is a playfully slang word for native Brazilians. 'I think the outfield players are going to like it too,' he added. His comments at Brazil's Granja Comary training complex, which is in Teresopolis 90km outside Rio de Janeiro, were in sharp contrast to four years ago when he and other players criticised the Jabulani ball, which was used in the South Africa World Cup. Orders: Scolari gives instructions to Neymar as the Samba stars build up towards the World Cup . You're supposed to use your feet! The Brazil players get their hands on the Brazuca ball for some exercises . What's the secret, Phil? Scolari whispers to technical coordinator Carlos Alberto Parreira (left) That ball, he said, was too light and moved about in the air. It was 'terrible, horrible, like a ball you buy in the supermarket,' he added. Julio Cesar had a miserable campaign at the 2010 finals where his mistake contributed to Brazil's elimination by the Netherlands at the quarter-final stage. But the 34-year-old, who is now plying his trade with FC Toronto in U.S. Major League Soccer, said he had worked hard to recover his confidence after that career low point. Glove affair: Goalkeeper Julio Cesar eyes the new Brazuca ball during training in Teresopolis . Still like it, Julio? The keeper gestures after a ball is struck past him and into the net . Back of the net: Goalkeeper Jefferson stretches for the ball but can't prevent a goal during training . 'Supermarket ball': The infamous Jabulani ball was used at the 2010 World Cup . 'Sometimes too much confidence can trip you up, and I say that from experience,' he said. 'After the World Cup, in addition to our elimination, I had problems with Inter and with Queens Park Rangers. I had to be very strong in order to be here today. 'I am a much better player than four years ago,' he said. 'Although I had the rank of best goalkeeper in the world in 2010 I feel like I am much better prepared today. You always have to take something positive from adversity.' What a way to travel: Brazil's method of transport during the World Cup has been revealed . Perfect branding: Brazilian airline Gol has provided the Boeing 737-800 for the national team's travel . Bright: The plane was painted by The Twins - graffiti artists and identical brothers Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo . Scolari's planning has been meticulous and this was evident when his squad arrived. The stars had a medical check-up at Granja Comary, dubbed the Brazil Lab. Luiz, on the verge of a £50m move from Chelsea to PSG, had his mouth and ears checked up, while his soon-to-be club-mate Thiago Silva got the same treatment as the squad were put through stringent fitness tests. Meanwhile, the team's method of transport has been revealed for the World Cup: a spectacular painted airplane branded with the team badge.

"Hayley-Eszti Szucs was terrified when she awoke one day to find that she couldn't move . A woman who woke up one day to find she was unable to move or speak has overcome her ordeal and forged a successful modelling career. Hayley-Eszti Szucs, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was struck down with a severe case of ME - a chronic fatigue syndrome which affects the brain and nervous and immune systems - on Boxing Day 2011. The 22-year-old was on holiday in Spain at the time with her boyfriend Alex, who called an ambulance when the left side of her face dropped. She was rushed to hospital, where Hayley said she was unable to move or respond to the panic around her, leaving her feeling as though she was 'trapped inside my body'. 'My boyfriend, Alex, is Spanish, so were out there visiting his family for Christmas,' she said. 'We'd had a lovely time celebrating, but the day after Boxing Day, I remember waking up and just knowing instantly something was wrong. 'My boyfriend tried to speak to me but he could tell straight away that I was seriously ill. 'I couldn't respond to him at all and the left side of my face began to droop. Alex called an ambulance and I was rushed to hospital. 'I remember doctors speaking to me and asking me if I knew where I was, but I couldn't say anything to them. 'I had no way of communicating so my boyfriend had to give the hospital permission to carry out tests and investigations. Hayley, pictured in hospital in 2011, after waking up 'trapped' inside her body, unable to communicate . Hayley was in hospital in Spain for four weeks before she was able to return home . 'It was like I was trapped inside my own body.' Hayley had to lie in a hospital bed, unable to move or respond to the panic going on around her. 'I wanted to say things and tell people how I was feeling but I couldn't. It was horrible - I could hear people talking about me and asking me questions but it was impossible to respond. 'It was the scariest experience of my life.' While in hospital, medics carried out a variety of tests, including a brain scan and a lumbar puncture, to determine the cause of her symptoms. Hayley found solace when writing her blog where she first noticed a lack of disabled models in the media . But Hayley's condition stumped doctors, and it wasn't until a year later that she finally received a diagnosis. 'I stayed in Spain for four weeks, and when I finally started to improve, I just wanted to come home,' Hayley said. 'I was able to speak again, but my movement was still really bad - I had to be carried out of the hospital - and I was experiencing up to 20 seizures a day. 'As my case was so unusual, even the doctors back home were unsure of what was wrong with me, but I was eventually diagnosed with ME via a process of elimination.' Although she was relieved to finally now the causes behind her condition, Hayley was left feeling hopeless. Hayley has been able to a successful career as a disabled model . Although Hayley has vastly improved she still requires a wheelchair from time to time . 'It was bitter sweet to get a diagnosis - I finally had answers but to hear the term incurable was really hard - I hadn't even considered that I wouldn't get better. 'A couple of days after I was told that news it suddenly hit me and I just burst into tears, I didn't understand why it was happening to me. 'I just thought of how I would lose my independence as I would need a wheelchair, and my life would never be the same again, it was awful.' As Hayley began to come to terms with her condition, she started writing a blog, which now attracts more than 10,000 followers every month. Hayley says her online diary enabled her to express herself during the tough time. Left, Hayley before her illness in 2011, right: shows the effect the illness has on Hayley . Although Hayley still battles with her illness she says she is determined not to let it take over her life . Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) causes persistent fatigue (exhaustion) that affects everyday life and doesn't go away with sleep or rest. CFS is also known as ME, which stands for myalgic encephalomyelitis. Myalgia means muscle pain and encephalomyelitis means inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. CFS is a serious condition that can cause long-term illness and disability, but many people – particularly children and young people – improve over time. Source: NHS . 'The blog was a coping mechanism, as it was a relief to be able to write about what I was going through. 'I started getting some great feedback and to hear I was inspiring others was a big achievement.' As well as attracting a phenomenal readership, Hayley's blog opened her eyes to the disabled modelling industry. 'Soon after I started blogging I noticed that you rarely see people in wheelchairs, or disabled models, online or in magazines. 'It made me want to get into modelling - I just thought there was no reason not too.' A determined Hayley ventured into the industry and was met with huge success. 'I put myself out there and now I often have stylists and make-up artists inviting me to do shoots with them, and I'm hoping to pursue a professional careers further. 'I also work with Models of Diversity to challenge main stream brands to use more disabled models in their campaigns.' Hayley says that her ordeal has made her even more determined to succeed and refuses to let her illness prevent her from further success. 'When I look back on everything I've been through - literally waking up one morning to a completely different world - I'm proud that I've made it through it all. 'ME still dominates my life, but it's not who I am - I'm determined to follow my dreams, and show people that nothing can hold you back.'

"Three gay men from Thailand have tied the knot in what is thought to be the world's first three-way same-sex marriage. Happy newlyweds Joke, 29, Bell, 21 and Art, 26, took the plunge on Valentine's Day after exchanging their vows in a fairy-tale ceremony at their home in Uthai Thani Province, Thailand. The three blushing grooms are thought to be the world's only wedded male threesome and have since become internet sensations after photos from their big day went viral. Bell, Art and Joke pictured together after tying the knot in the world's first three-way same-sex marriage . The newlyweds took the plunge on Valentines Day when they exchanged vows in Uthai Thani, Thailand . The trio consummated their love under Buddhist law in the ceremony as same-sex marriages are not recognised as legitimate under Thai law . In what they described as the happiest day of their lives, the three men were suited and booted for the ceremony in which they exchanged rings after walking down the aisle. Bell, From Phitsanulok Province, said: 'I think we are first three-way same sex males to have a wedding, possibly in the world. 'Some people may not agree and are probably amazed by our decision, but we believe many people do understand and accept our choice. Love is love, after all.' Although same-sex marriages are not recognised as legitimate under Thai law, the trio were able to consummate their love under Buddhist law in the symbolic ceremony. Art, from Chiang Mai Province, met Joke, from Uthai Thani Province, through business and started a relationship after realising their love for each other while working closely together in 2010. Both men knew they were gay before they met and have been living together for the past five years. Meanwhile Bell, who was studying management at Phitsanuloke University, frequently met the couple at parties before the three men realised they all started to have feelings for each other. But after Bell was hospitalised with a congenital disease, the threesome became inseparable leading Joke and Art to propose the idea of a three-way marriage. The only condition was that Joke and Art must ask Bell's parents for his hand in marriage. Art said: 'When Bell was in hospital, it became clear that we all had a lot of feelings for each other. The newlyweds pose for a photograph on their wedding day after falling in love during their time at university . Pictured from left to right, Joke, Art and Bell said many people accepted and understood their situation . 'We thought what better way to show our love for each other by getting married. 'It might seem strange to some, but many people understand our bond and the reasons we got married. In Thailand, same-sex unions are not legally binding, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons may face legal challenges on their sexual freedoms as same-sex couples are still frowned upon. However, more LGBT rights are applicable than ever before in the country, one of the most tolerant countries in Asia, with religious groups declaring their support for civil marriages between gay and lesbian couples. Joke, Bell and Art were joined together under Buddhist Law in a ceremony that was not legally registered. The ceremony included the traditional exchange of vows in which the trio declared their love for each other, and in doing so, agreed to share their home and responsibilities. The three men believe same-sex marriages are just as valid as any other legally sanctioned ceremony . According to Joke, same-sex marriages are just as valid as any legally sanctioned ceremony and are treated as such. He said: 'Now Thai society has a better understanding of sexual orientation as many same-sex weddings appear on TV, newspapers and social media, we feel more accepted and able to come out. 'But I don't believe the world has ever seen three men marry before, this is something new. 'Most people all around us can accept that and many people have given us their blessing. 'We love each other and live together like brothers; hopefully this is something the world can understand in the 21st century.'","Three men have tied the knot in world's first three-way same-sex marriage .

"New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will meet with Ryan Giggs to thrash out the Old Trafford legend’s future at the club. The veteran Dutch coach will leave the Holland squad’s training base near Amsterdam and travel to a secret destination in Europe to meet with Giggs and United chief executive Ed Woodward. Van Gaal will officially be unveiled as United’s new manager Thursday or Friday and the club will then reveal who will join the 62-year-old on the coaching staff. VIDEO Scroll down for Holland coach Louis van Gaal names World Cup squad . Showdown: Ryan Giggs wiill meet with Louis van Gaal for crunch talks over his Manchester United future . Incoming: Van Gaal, expected to be announced as United boss, will talk with Giggs about his role . With Phil Neville and goalkeeping coach Chris Woods on the way out and Nicky Butt, and perhaps Paul Scholes, expected to head back to coach the club’s Under 18s, it is Giggs’ future that remains shrouded in doubt. Van Gaal is expected to offer the 40-year-old a coaching role at the meeting and will tell him that he wants someone on the staff who knows the club and its players. However, whether or not Giggs decides to stay will depend on whether he thinks the role he is offered is senior enough. He has already indicated privately that he will not stick around if he thinks he is not going to be a fundamental part of the set-up. Van Gaal is currently in the thick of preparing the Dutch team for a friendly with Ecuador on Saturday and the World Cup finals in Brazil next month. On the block: Phil Neville has left and Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are facing questions over their future . Switch: Van Gaal announced his Holland team will play a 5-3-2 at the World Cup in Brazil . He revealed a shock change in tactics, from the traditional Dutch 4-3-3 to a seemingly more defensive 5-3-2, at a press conference in Hoenderloo on Tuesday — but refused to say much about United. ‘That is for Manchester United to comment on,’ he said. ‘No, I would not say anything about it. I am here for the Dutch team, not as coach of Manchester United. You’ll have to wait until the process is finished or (put) questions to Manchester United — or perhaps to another club. I cannot say anything further.’ The Dutch players have a day off Wednesday, enabling Van Gaal to meet with Giggs and Woodward to discuss the way forward. Different directions: Phil Neville (left) will be cut from the coaching staff, though he hasn't been told formally, while Paul Scholes will have a meeting on Thursday to discuss his future role at the club . Scholes will attend a meeting at the club on Thursday but MailOnline revealed that Neville and Woods will not be retained by Van Gaal, even though Neville was at Carrington Tuesday and has still not been informed officially. Neville and Woods got the news minutes after Rio Ferdinand was informed by Woodward his United career was over in the dressing room at Southampton on Sunday. Neville was approached by  Woodward as he emerged from the shower. He wasn’t told he too was finished at Old Trafford but he might as well have been. Woodward said there might be a role for him outside the first team; possibly in the academy. Woods was then approached outside the dressing room. Woodward told him that another goalkeeping coach was coming in — it is already known Van Gaal wants to bring Frank Hoek from the Dutch national set-up — and that his first team duties had been terminated. Bearer: United chief Ed Woodward broke the news to Neville in the dressing room after Sunday's game . Woods will also discuss exactly what that means towards the end of this week, but Neville and Woods certainly believe their time at the club is over. The whole episode left Giggs, his coaches and players, stunned at Woodward’s insensitivity. When United do announce Van Gaal’s arrival, it is unlikely there will be a press conference. Instead, Van Gaal will leave Woodward to work on agreed summer transfer targets and go about his summer business with the Holland team. Woodward’s performance in the transfer market came in for some harsh criticism Tuesday from United legend Roy Keane. Critic: Former United skipper Roy Keane criticised Woodward for his transfer policy . ‘Why give Moyes a six-year contract? He had one transfer window, and it’s not always down to the manager when players don’t come in. I think Ed Woodward needs to look at himself. He’s got to get deals done.’ And Woodward could face an awkward time on Thursday when United’s first quarter financial results are announced. There could be some tricky questions from investors over the hiring and firing of David Moyes and the club’s patchy performance in the transfer market. Graeme Souness thinks it will take United four transfer windows to turn the club’s fortunes round. He said on Sky Sports: ‘It’s not a given that United will be back in the top four, whoever is the manager. Top target: Southampton and England left back Luke Shaw has been linked with a £27m move . ‘It’s not a quick fix. ‘I think it’s a minimum of four transfer windows — if it goes well — before Manchester United get back to where they want to be and should be. I’m talking about winning big trophies’ Former United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports the club need to be careful who they buy. Neville said: ‘If he [Van Gaal] decides he wants eight players, that doesn’t mean he should go and buy eight players. Switch: Robin van Persie was involved in the decision to switch Holland to a 5-3-2 formation . ‘Signing three or four real top quality — and improving next season, bedding them in and then going again with two or three more the year after, is the organic approach I would expect Manchester United to have. ‘However, I didn’t expect Manchester United to sack a manager after ten months, so what’s going to happen in the next few months, who knows?’ What will be of particular interest to United supporters is the fact that Van Gaal involved Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben — his captain and vice-captain — in the decision to make the tactical change for Holland.","Louis van Gaal will meet with Ryan Giggs for crunch talks about the Manchester United legend's future .

"A Captain Kirk action figure, Iron Man toys and part of a Tyrannosaurus rex are to be sent into orbit around the Earth as the ‘crew’ of the first test flight of Nasa’s next generation Orion space capsule. The spacecraft will also carry a sample of soil from the Moon, an oxygen hose from an Apollo mission spacesuit and a series of Sesame Street puppets and props. They are all part of a weird collection of artefacts and memorabilia that will be sent into space as cargo aboard the first test flight of the Orion spacecraft. Scroll down for video . The Orion space capsule, the white tip of which can be seen sitting on top of a Delta IV Heavy rocket at the Space Launch Complex 37 in Cape Canaveral, will launch on Thursday for its first test flight into space . Nasa is due to launch the capsule into orbit around Earth in what it hopes will be the first steps towards eventually using the vehicle to carry astronauts to Mars. Weather conditions for Orion’s launch on Thursday from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, scheduled for 07.05 EST (12.05 GMT), are looking favourable. Orion is Nasa's first manned space capsule since the Apollo module and will allow the US to regain its capability to launch astronauts into space, which it lost after the retirement of the Shuttle. The Orion Exploration Test Flight 1 is designed to expose the capsule to the conditions it will experience when returning from deep space missions to asteroids and Mars. Upon reentry it will reach speeds of up to 20,000 mph and its heat shield will have to bear the brunt of the scorching plasma that builds up as the spacecraft dives through the atmosphere. Temperatures can reach up to 3,300 degrees C before it slows down enough to deploy its parachutes before dropping into the sea. Astronauts in Orion will also travel through areas of space where intense radiation can be encountered and the capsule will need to protect them from this. The test flight will send Orion through the inner Van Allen belt, a deadly zone of radiation trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. Radiation experiments onboard the test flights will measure how electronics and astronauts might survive in this hostile environment if they are inside the capsule. Yet despite the crucial nature of the test flight, Nasa has packed many of the lockers inside with toys and memorabilia, including a toy figure supplied by William Shatner and a fossil from a T. rex. The spacecraft, and its cargo, will be carried into orbit on a Delta 4 Heavy Rocket, taking it 3,600 miles above there Earth, about 15 times higher than the International Space Station. During the four and a half hour flight the capsule will orbit the Earth twice before beginning its violent descent back into the atmosphere as scientists attempt to test its heat shields. Reaching speeds of up to 20,000 mph, the 16 feet wide heat shield will have to withstand temperatures of more than 3,300 degrees C (6,000 F). A suite of more than 1,200 sensors onboard the capsule will record the stresses, vibrations, temperatures, radiation exposure and acceleration it is exposed to during the descent. If it survives reentry, Orion will deploy parachutes before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean, where it will be recovered by the US Navy. 'Orion is the exploration spacecraft for NASA, and paired with the Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket it will allow us to explore the solar system,' said Mark Geyer, program manager of Orion, which is based at Johnson Space Center in Houston. 'Really, we're going to test the riskiest parts of the mission - ascent, entry and things like fairing separations, Launch Abort System jettison, the parachutes plus the navigation and guidance. 'Plus we’ll fly into deep space and test the radiation effects on those systems.' Technicians pack bags to be placed into Orion's stowage lockers with items from Sesame Street including a cookie belonging to Cookie Monster, Ernie's rubber duck, Grover's cape and Slimey the Worm . A Captain Kirk figurine and Iron Man collectables are among the cargo to be carried on the 3,600 mile test flight of the Orion space capsule as Nasa tests its heat shields ability to withstand the intense heat of re-entry . Orion will travel twice around the Earth before reentering the Earth's atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean as engineers attempt to test how the capsule will hold up against the violent descent . Although it will not carry any astronauts on the test flight, the capsule is designed to transport humans, so engineers want to find out what the conditions inside the cabin will be like. Officials at Nasa have, however, also decided to continue the tradition of taking mementos into space. While Orion Test Flight 1 will carry important radiation experiments, the other lockers have been stuffed with a strange assortment of toys, memorabilia and signed celebrity photos. Among the cargo will be props from Sesame Street including a cookie belonging to Cookie Monster, Ernie’s rubber duck, Oscar the Grouch’s pet Slimey the Worm and Grover’s cape. When they return to Earth they will take prized spots on the long-running television programme in a bid to educate millions of children about space. Lockheed Martin, the main contractor for constructing Orion, also worked with the Entertainment Industries Council to collect items from science fiction-related celebrities to fly onboard. William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk in the original Star Trek series and is a noted space enthusiast, supplied an action figure of ‘Captain Kirk in Environmental Suit’. The Orion capsule, seen here inside its launch abort system and service module outside the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, has been fitted sensors to measure the temperature, vibrations acceleration and radiation that astronauts might be exposed to inside during reentry from a mission to an asteroid or Mars . Reentry is one of the most dangerous parts of human space flight as temperatures can reach up to 3,300 degrees C as plasma builds up on the heat shield of Orion, seen here in an artists impression of the capsule as it lines up to being its race through the Earth's atmosphere at speeds of up to 20,000 miles per hour . ‘William Shatner is thrilled to send Kirk back to space and support Orion, while inspiring future generations about space travel,"" EIC vice president Skylar Jackson told collectSPACE. Director Jon Favreau offered an Iron Man challenge coin while Back to the Future actress Claudia Wells provided signed cast photos and a Delorean time machine model. Mayim Bialik, from The Big Bang Theory, also gave pictures of her ancestors. A collection of pins, medals and artworks will also be carried in the Orion lockers. Recordings of Mars from Gustav Holst's The Planets, performed by the National Symphony Orchestra, and 'We Shall Overcome' by Denyce Graves, will also be onboard. Nasa has also placed a tiny sample of lunar soil along with a fossil from a Tyrannosaurus rex donated by the Denver Science Museum, into the capsule.. A microchip carrying the names of more than a million people who submitted their names will also be carried onboard. In a statement on its website, Nasa said: ‘Together, the artifacts chart humanity's progress and technological advancement as the nation takes a critical step forward on the Journey to Mars.’ Carrying commemorative cargo into space, however, is not a new tradition and has been done since the very early age of space flight. Nasa's Mercury astronauts carried dimes in their spacesuits while astronauts on the Apollo missions carried photos and specially stamped envelopes. The Voyager spacecraft have also carried gold discs featuring sounds of Earth along with a range of other information while the Curiosity rover on Mars carried a penny to calibrate its instruments. A microchip carrying the names of a million people will also be flown aboard Orion on the test flight after the public were given  opportunity to have their names included as part of Nasa's journey to Mars .","Nasa's next-generation spacecraft to be launched 3,600 miles into space .

"When Major John Tulloch retraced the steps of Allied prisoners of war and their infamous 'death march' from 1945, he thought his photographs would bare only a vague resemblance to the tortuous route PoWs took 70 years ago. The retired army officer had revisited the muddy track in Borneo where thousands of World War Two PoWs trudged to their deaths, only to be given a shocking surprise when he looked back at his images. Maj Tulloch studied his pictures and found what appeared to be hunched, skeletal ghostly figures marching across his photograph, almost exactly in line with the path they took seven decades ago. Apparition: Has Major captured the spirits of long dead  PoWs on a notorious death march 67 years ago? The haunting image evokes strong memories of the desperate 'death march' made by Allied prisoners of war. Some 2,400 World War II PoWs died in . the horrific Sandakan Death Marches in 1945 to avoid them being . liberated as Japan was forced on the retreat. Severely malnourished and barefoot, they were forced by brutal Japanese captors to walk 160 miles in sweltering heat for a month. Maj Tulloch took the picture from the window of a 4x4 vehicle while driving along the 'death march' route in 2010. It is thought the astonishing photographic illusion was caused by a the reflection of a patterned towel which was on the dashboard of the vehicle as he took the image. Surrendered: 67,000 PoWs also forced into notorious Bataan Death March in the Philippines, April 1942 . Maj Tulloch said he took the picture in 2010 when he did a recce of the route ahead of aMarch of Remembrance and the unveiling of a memorial to the 400 members of the Royal Artillery who died. Men who collapsed through exhaustion were left to die or were killed by being shot, bayoneted or beheaded. Only six men survived the three marches from Sandakan to Ranau and that was because they managed to escape. It was the single greatest atrocity against Australian troops. Rest Point: Exhausted PoWs get respite along the Bataan Death March watched by merciless Japanese guards . Cruelty: Over 11,000 Allied prisoners died or were killed on the way by guards . Maj Tulloch, 66, said: 'We were driving along the same track as that taken by the death march and I was clicking away on my camera, I took about 200-odd digital photographs. 'I went through the pictures on a computer screen later and didn’t see it the first time round. I went back over them again and I just suddenly thought ""what the hell...?"" 'I looked at the photo again and went very cold indeed. What I saw were the shapes of 17 or 18 ghostly figures coming out of the jungle and walking down the track going to Ranau which you can see in the far distance. 'It took me a few moments to work out how it had occurred but it was too weird for words. I showed it to several people and they said it is quite extraordinary, some even refused to look at it because it was so haunting. 'While my guide drove along he put a towel on the dashboard. The towel had a pattern on it and that reflected through the windscreen. I have called it reflections of a death march.' Maj Tulloch is now an instructor in jungle warfare for the Royal Artillery. At Bayonet point: Japanese troops guard American and Filipino prisoners in Bataan in the Philippines after their capture on 9th April 1942. Forced 'death marches' of captured soldiers, interned civilians or persecuted ethnic groups were a common sight during the War. The brutal demonstrations, in which hundreds of thousands died from exhaustion, disease or beatings from their captors in Nazi Germany or the Japanese Imperial Army, took place to stop prisoners being liberated. One of the most high-profile marches saw an estimated 80,000 Allied PoWs forced to march across Poland, Czechoslovakia and Germany in harsh winter conditions in early 1945. But as the tide of war began to turn in the same year, Hitler's forces began to evacuate captured PoWs and other prisoners westwards. During the marches, Allied PoWs were divided into groups of up to 300 men and marched off under guard. But lack of supplies meant they had to scavenge for food and shelter and the weak were left behind to die. Others were murdered by some of their guards. Official figures said 3,500 US and British and Commonwealth men lost their lives but others estimate around 8,348 died. But the most notorious death marches were the SS-led evacuation of concentration camps. Those too weak were killed outright and the rest were mercilessly driven on to other camps suffering beatings and mass murder. For example nine days before the liberation of Auschwitz 60,000 inmates were taken on a 35 mile death march to waiting trains, 15,000 died on the way. In the Far East the Japanese Imperial Army was also responsible for carrying out numerous death marches. One of the most notorious was the Bataan Death March of 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 US PoWs after a three month battle in 1942. They were forced on a 128km march in which over 11,000 were beaten, bayoneted, mistreated and died from heat and exhaustion.","Images of ghostly skeletons on Borneo jungle track caught on film .

"Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was on a suicide mission when he attempted to detonate a bomb in his underpants as the plane, en route from Amsterdam, approached Detroit . The notorious underwear bomber's plot in 2009 to blow up a plane on Christmas Day failed because the explosives became 'degraded' after he wore the same pair of underpants for two weeks, according to a U.S. official. Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was on a suicide mission when he attempted to detonate a bomb in his underpants as the plane, en route from Amsterdam, approached Detroit. The bomb however failed to detonate aboard the flight, which was carrying nearly 300 people, but caused a brief fire that caused burns to his groin. He was sentenced to life without parole in February 2012 after he pleaded guilty to all charges on the second day of his trial the previous October. The head of the Transportation Security Administration said this week the bomb failed to detonate because of how long Abdulmutallab had been wearing his underwear. John Pistole told the Aspen Security Forum: 'The bomber had had the device with him for over two weeks.' Mr Pistole was then asked whether the bomb had become 'damp', to which he replied: 'Let's say it was degraded.' During his trial, Abdulmutallab said the bomb in his underwear was a 'blessed weapon' to avenge poorly treated Muslims around the world. After the bomb failed to detonate, passengers pounced on Abdulmutallab and forced him to the front of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 where he was held until the plane landed minutes later. The head of the Transportation Security Administration said this week the bomb failed to detonate because of how long Abdulmutallab had been wearing his underwear . In 2009, months before the attack, he travelled to Yemen to see Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and one of the best-known al Qaeda figures, according to the government. He told investigators that his mission was approved after a three-day visit with his mentor. Al-Awlaki and the bomb maker were killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, just days before Abdulmutallab's trial. At the time, President Barack Obama publicly blamed al-Awlaki for the terrorism plot.","Umar Abdulmutallab was on suicide mission when he attempted to detonate a bomb in his underpants as the plane approached Detroit .

"If you are the kind of person who will wrap yourself in the St George's flag as you shout 'ROO-NEY' at the TV this summer, the bulletin on Luis Suarez is good news. No doubt many England fans punched the air when it emerged that Suarez had suffered a knee injury at Uruguay's training in Montevideo and might be out of the clash on June 19. 'Suarez is out of the World Cup - get in!' 'I hope it's a bad one.' 'Right, all we need is Cavani to break down now.' Feeling down: Suarez is an injury doubt for Uruguay's second group game against England . Sensational: Suarez played a key role in Liverpool's title challenge this season with 31 league goals . And on and . on. Any advantage to the team you support is always welcomed, whether . that's your star striker returning from injury, or your rivals' No 9 . pulling his hamstring. England . vs Uruguay with Suarez sitting in the stands is wholly more appealing to England fans . than the same fixture with Suarez walking out of the tunnel in his . blue shirt. But what about the entertainment? What about watching the stars? What about those goals you'll still be talking about in 30 years? The Champions League comes along every season and if your team gets to the final, they will play a total of 13 matches. So, even if a star player picks up an injury, you're still likely to see him at some point during the tournament. Now compare that with the World Cup. An unfortunate knee niggle - one diagnosis on Suarez is that he'll miss four to six weeks, another said he'll be fit in three - can ultimately rule you out of a tournament that only takes place every four years. That's what you call a bad break. Stars: No-one would want to watch the World Cup without Lionel Messi (left) or Cristiano Ronaldo . Whether you fall into the Messi or . Ronaldo camp, few would claim they are not excited about watching one or . the other - or both - this summer. We want them to turn it up to 11 in . Brazil. And it should be the same for Suarez. This is the man who enjoyed an exceptional season with Liverpool, scoring 31 goals as he took them to the brink of a first title since 1990. There's no-one who watches Match of the Day on a regular basis that wasn't blown away by Suarez at some point this season. Taking that form into the World Cup, he would be a joy to watch. You hope the same for Andres Iniesta, Neymar, Robin van Persie, Yaya Toure and the other leading figures of the game. The World Cup has a history of high-profile injuries (Pele in 1966, Michael Ballack in 2010) and there are already a few decent players out of Brazil (Thiago Alcantara and Theo Walcott, for sure, and they may be joined by Radamel Falcao.) So, if you want to sit back next month and watch the best players in the best tournament, start crossing your fingers that Suarez is an exceptionally quick healer.","If we want the best competitions we need the best players to be available .
If Messi or Ronaldo were out we would be sad, why aren't we for Suarez?
Too many big names have already been ruled out through injury .
Suarez may never hit this sort of form again so we need to enjoy him ."

"With the latest in 21st-century technology — plus quite a bit from the 19th — it is unique. And despite having travelled by Concorde, Royal Yacht, elephant and South Sea canoe, the Queen has never been carried in anything quite like the transport which will take her to today’s State Opening of Parliament. Unveiled for the first time, the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach is only the second royal carriage to be built in a century and joins the unrivalled royal collection of coaches, phaetons, landaus, broughams and barouches. None of the others, however, features a 360-degree ‘coachcam’ offering a monarch’s-eye view of the procession, gold-plated hydraulics, motor-racing technology and a dazzling museum. Scroll down for video . Palace-on-wheels: Unveiled for the first time, the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach is only the second royal carriage to be built in a century . For this palace-on-wheels is much more than the ultimate horse-drawn limousine. Open a diamond-clad door handle and, inside, we find a time capsule of 1,000 years of history. Surmounted by a crown made from the timbers of HMS Victory, which houses the royal website’s ‘coachcam’, the new state coach contains relics of all those key moments sacred to Britain and so much of the Commonwealth. The panelling includes slivers of Scott’s Antarctic sled, Sir Isaac Newton’s apple tree, Hut Six at  codebreaking centre Bletchley Park, one of Sir Edmund Hillary’s Everest ladders and the beams of most of our great cathedrals. As she is drawn behind six horses, the Queen will be sitting on a piece of Scotland’s Stone of Destiny, upon which monarchs are traditionally crowned, and surrounded by a bolt from a Spitfire, a musket ball from Waterloo, a bolt and rivets from the Flying Scotsman and a button  from Gallipoli. There’s even a fragment of the bronze cannon from which every Victoria Cross is cast, and a piece of metal from the wreckage of a 617 Squadron Dambuster. Chock full of history: As she is drawn behind six horses, the Queen will be sitting on a piece of Scotland's Stone of Destiny, upon which monarchs are traditionally crowned, and surrounded by a bolt from a Spitfire, a musket ball from Waterloo, a bolt and rivets from the Flying Scotsman and a button  from Gallipoli . Little wonder this three-ton coach — . 18ft long — has taken 50 people more than ten years to assemble.  And it . is all the idea of one remarkable Australian. Jim . Frecklington, 64, worked in the Royal Mews as a young man before . returning home to help organise  the Queen’s Silver Jubilee exhibition . in Australia. Having repaired carriages on the family farm in his youth, he set about building a replica of the 1902 State Landau. This . led to something even more ambitious and, in 1986, he built the . Australian State Coach, a gift from the people of Australia to the Queen . to mark the country’s bicentenary. It proved a very popular addition to . the Royal Mews, not least because it was the first state coach with . heating. But Mr Frecklington, whose family emigrated from Britain to New South Wales in the 1850s, was not finished. ‘I . wanted to make something in honour of Her Majesty’s great reign and . something which represents our extraordinary history,’ he explains as he . shows me his spotless creation in its new home behind the Palace. So, he set about building something even larger than the Australian State Coach at his workshop near Sydney. Symbolism: A part of the Stone of Destiny which is placed in a capsule beneath the seats in the new Diamond Jubilee state coach . Relics: Woods from various celebrated buildings and vessels have been used to inlay the doors . History: The panelling includes a button from Gallipoli, wood from the Mayflower, a rivet from the Flying Scotsman, slivers of Scot's Antarctic sled, wood from Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree, Hut Six at  codebreaking centre Bletchley Park, one of Sir Edmund Hillary's Everest ladders and the beams of most of our great cathedrals . The construction was a labour of love. All the springs, for example, were hand-forged, while the wheels were cast in aircraft-strength aluminium and made by one of Australia’s leading racing car designers. Mr Frecklington wanted to use the finest craftsmen and women from all over the Commonwealth. So, all the leather is English, as is the gold silk brocade upholstery (from Sudbury). The lamps are glazed with the finest lead crystal from Edinburgh. The intricate heraldic paintwork has been hand-painted by Irish-born Australian Paula Church. The door handles are from New Zealand — each is gold-plated and inlaid with 24 diamonds and 130 Australian sapphires by Kiwi master jeweller Mike Baker. Even the bolts which fix the gold-plated hand supports to the bodywork have been finished using the same guilloche enamel as a Faberge egg. And so it goes on. Mr Frecklington has applied the same mind-boggling attention to detail to the historical artefacts which give the Diamond Jubilee State Coach its special status. He began by asking the custodians of HMS Victory if he might have a piece of timber from Nelson’s flagship. Once it was clear Mr Frecklington had the endorsement of Buckingham Palace, things started to progress. ‘I knew Victory had undergone a refit in 1922 and that they had set aside some timber, and they were kind enough to let me have some.’ The result is a crown resting on four lions modelled on those found on the gates of Buckingham Palace. The entire coach is covered with heraldic emblems, crests and motifs, all of which have been approved by the College of Arms. Comfy: Flip up the armrests and there are discreet, Bond-style controls for the heating and electric windows underneath . 'I . wanted to make something in honour of Her Majesty': Jim Frecklington, 64, designed and built the coach. The lamps, right, are glazed with lead crystal from Edinburgh . A wheel hub: Mr Frecklington built the coach in his workshop near Sydney, Australia using the work of the finest craftsmen and women from all over the Commonwealth . He then broadened his quest for other historic artefacts to include every great building and institution he could think of. The trust which looks after Britannia donated some teak handrails from the old Royal Yacht. They now form the armrests (flip them up and there are discreet, Bond-style controls for the heating and electric windows underneath). He secured contributions from Windsor Castle, Balmoral and even the old Royal Box at Ascot. St Paul’s and Winchester Cathedrals presented certified pieces, as did Westminster Abbey and many stately homes. The panelling includes yew from Glamis Castle in Scotland, where the Queen Mother grew up, ash from Blenheim Palace and oak from Althorp, ancestral home of the Spencer family. Going back somewhat further is a little bit of timber from the Bronze Age Ferriby boat found in the Humber. A strong theme throughout is sacrifice. Hence the metalwork from a Spitfire, Hurricane and Lancaster and many of our best-known battlefields. ‘I wanted something every family in the land can relate to,’ he says. Crowning glory: Made from wood reclaimed from HMS Victory the reproduction crown sits atop four lions modelled on those found on the gates of Buckingham Palace . Mr Frecklington secured contributions from Windsor Castle, Balmoral and even the old Royal Box at Ascot. St Paul's and Winchester Cathedrals presented certified pieces, as did Westminster Abbey and many stately homes. The public can go to view the new carriage at the Royal Mews from tomorrow . Resplendent: The entire coach is covered with heraldic emblems, crests and motifs, all of which have been approved by the College of Arms . Dry run: The carriage rolls past the Palace of Westminster in a rehearsal of the State Opening of Parliament, set to take place today . There will be those who wonder why anyone should go to so much trouble — and how much it has all cost. Besides, how do you put a price on all this? Mr Frecklington smiles and says he’s not sure. He paid for a lot of it himself, but the coach has now been formally acquired for the nation by the Royal Collection Trust following a private donation. In other words, it hasn’t cost the taxpayer a penny. After today, though, the public will be able to view it, along with all the other coaches and carriages, during the daily opening of the Royal Mews at the back of Buckingham Palace. Though the Queen has seen the finished product, she will not have ridden in it until today. Mr Frecklington — who is already working on his next project, a tribute to horses that went to war — has been allocated a ringside view of the royal arrival at the Palace of Westminster. ‘It will be a very special moment,’ he says. ‘She’s a wonderful example to humanity, and this has been a great team effort.’ The Queen arrives for 2013's State Opening of Parliament in the Irish State Coach, which had been her traditional carriage for the procession from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament. This year she will use the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach . In 2012, the State of Opening of Parliament saw the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh use the Australian State Coach for the procession. It was then the newest in the Palace's collection, having been presented to mark Australia's bicentennial in 1988.","The Queen's new Diamond Jubilee State Coach is only the second new royal carriage to be built in a century .
It contains relics of key moments and incidents from more than a thousand years of British history .

"Former Everton and Birmingham forward James McFadden has revealed that he is waiting for the right offer to return to football, following his release from Motherwell in May. The 31-year-old, who has 48 international caps for Scotland, stated that he has received plenty of offers, but has been unwilling to accept anything thus far. 'Most of the offers have been from abroad but they've not excited me too much and I'm quite indecisive so I'm holding off for something that will excite me,' McFadden told BBC Radio Scotland. International: McFadden has been capped 48 times for Scotland, scoring 15 goals in the process . Veteran: The Scot has played for Everton on two seperate occasions . Despite opting to turn down all offers to this point, McFadden continued by clarifying that he is ready should the right deal be offered to him. 'I'm still on the look-out for a club and keeping myself fit. There's definitely a lot more football left in me and if I'm ever asked then I'm ready.' The striker scored 13 goals for Birmingham in 67 league starts, after the Midlands club paid Everton £4.75m for his services in January 2008. In demand: McFadden cost Birmingham £4.75m in January 2008, when he signed from Everton . Goal: McFadden (centre) has scored some important goals for his country, including this against France . Following that, he returned to Everton for a second spell on Merseyside, before leaving for Sunderland on a free a year later. McFadden re-signed for his boyhood club Motherwell in February 2013, until his release in May left him searching for a return to football. The Scot admits he is taking his return to football one step at a time, and was insistent that he has to consider his family's future as well as his own. 'I'm just kind of weighing (the offers) up and seeing what the best one is for myself football-wise but also my family as well, I've got to take them into consideration.'

"Ray Parlour believes Arsenal will be better equipped to mount a Premier League title challenge next season if they finish this campaign by winning the FA Cup. The former England midfielder insists the players will benefit psychologically from ending the club’s nine-year wait for a trophy. Nobody in the squad has lifted silverware in England before. Parlour won three League titles, four FA Cups, and one League Cup during his 12-year career at Arsenal and knows how success breeds success. Scroll down for video... Long time coming: Arsenal have not won silverware since lifting the 2005 FA Cup in Cardiff . In eight years under Arsene Wenger he won six trophies and is unwavering in his support for the Frenchman, who last guided Arsenal to silverware in 2005. Parlour, who left the summer before that FA Cup triumph, also played for Hull City and says a win for Steve Bruce’s team would make history – but it would affect the future for Arsenal. ‘They will be under a lot of pressure having not won anything for so long,’ says Parlour. ‘It would be really bad if that continued. I’m not sure what effect that might have. The Romford Pele: Ray Parlour believes the Gunners will challenge for the title if they win the FA Cup . ‘But on the other side, winning the FA Cup would give players that confidence and belief. A lot of them haven’t won anything before and that can be a mental hurdle to overcome. ‘I know, having experienced it, that lifting trophies in whatever competition makes your stronger, you’re then a winner. I would expect victory to boost the team for a title challenge in the Premier League next season.’ Parlour believes more money will be spent in the transfer window, with the £42.5million capture of Mesut Ozil last summer a marker that years of saving are over. He predicts Wenger could be handed as much as £100million to splash on reinforcements. Slip up? Arsenal face underdogs Hull City in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday . We all know what Arsene Wenger has been working with at the club, the new stadium meant he had to balance the books and couldn’t compete with the elite clubs in Europe on fees and wages. ‘But signing Ozil showed that has changed. They need a top quality centre-forward and probably a holding midfielder. I think Ozil will improve next year after adjusting to England – it is hard to go without a winter break when you’ve had one your entire career – and more quality signings will come.’ Would you like the chance to represent Titan Bet this summer in Brazil?

"Google may be looking to reverse the fortune of its Glass headset by making it  more streamlined. Patent files have revealed a new design for the high-tech headset that features a thinner casing above the left ear, making it more inconspicuous. It follows news that Google plans to revamp the hardware on the headset next year, too, by replacing its Texas Instrument Chip with an Intel processor. Scroll down for video . Google may be looking to reverse the fortune of its Glass headset by making it more streamlined and less obtrusive. Patent files have revealed a new design (pictured) for the high-tech headset that features a thinner casing above the left ear, making it more inconspicuous . Google Glass launched in 2012 to fanfare, but its price, clunky design, as well as how long it is taking to be released to general consumers have dampened this excitement. The headset costs £1,000 in the UK and $1,500 in the US, but models now sell on eBay for half this price. Developers are also said to be abandoning the platform, and even Google's Sergey Brin appeared at an event recently without the specs. A thinner design and faster processor may make it more appealing to a wider variety of people. But Google has already attempted to make the device more fashionable with the launch of designer frames, which don't appear to have boosted its charm. Google Glass has also been criticised by privacy campaigners for allowing wearers to take photos and videos surreptitiously, so making the device itself less prominent may flame these concerns. The patent (pictured) was first filed in October 2011 but was only awarded yesterday.

The patent follows news that Google plans to revamp the hardware on the headset next year, by replacing its Texas Instrument Chip with an Intel processor.  A thinner design and faster processor may make it more appealing to a wider variety of people . The patent was first filed in October 2011, but was only awarded yesterday. It doesn't confirm Google is revamping the device, but it does suggest it has been looking at alternative designs since before the headset was released. Recently it emerged that the consumer version, which Google promised would go on sale this year, has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future. Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters earlier this month, nine said that . they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, . mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the . device. Three more have switched to developing for business, . leaving behind consumer projects. 'It's not a big enough platform to play on seriously,' said .

Spellista, a puzzler released a year . ago, is still available, but Glu has discontinued work on it, a . spokesman for the company said. Another developer, Sean McCracken, won $10,000 in a contest . last year for creating an aliens-themed video game for Glass, . Psyclops, but Google never put it on the official hub for Glass . apps, making it tougher to find. He has quit working on updates. However, plenty of larger developers remain with Glass and there are nearly . 100 apps on the official web site including Facebook and . OpenTable. Still, there are some enthusiastic developers. Cycling and . running app Strava finds Glass well-suited for its users, who . want real-time data on their workouts, said David Lorsch, vice . president of business development. And entrepreneur Jake . Steinerman said it is ideal for his company, DriveSafe, which . detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel. In April, Google launched the Glass at Work program to help . make the device useful for specific industries, such as . healthcare and manufacturing.

"After a difficult encounter with Switzerland, Javier Mascherano does not deny that Argentina need to improve if they are going to progress beyond their quarter-final encounter with Belgium. ‘The moment of truth has arrived,’ said the Barcelona and former Liverpool midfielder. ‘Now we have to maintain the level and get rid of the mistakes.’ Had Switzerland been more clinical in front of goal, Argentina could already be out of this World Cup. But they survived the many opportunities the Swiss had, securing victory and their passage to the last eight with a goal from Angel Di Maria only two minutes before the end of extra time. Must do better: It was a night of frustration for Javier Mascherano (right) and Argentina before they eventually prevailed 1-0 against Switzerland and reached the last eight of the World Cup . Last-gasp: A penalty shoot-out was looming when Angel Di Maria scored Argentina's winner in the 118th minute . ‘It’s very difficult,’ he said. ‘But it’s not just about what we’re missing. I like to look at positive aspects. In a World Cup that is so difficult, where it costs so much to go through, we have made good strides forward. ‘In the second half of extra-time Switzerland had less legs. They couldn’t attack in the same way. We could press higher, and we started to win a lot of the ball in their half. But you know that with one mistake you’re going home.’ Mascherano is encouraged by the success the South American teams have so far enjoyed, even if it is the Central Americans from Costa Rica he considers the major threat to the ambitions of the so-called bigger teams. ‘The South Americans, while one or two have gone out, have put in a very respectable performances,’ he said. ‘Obviously we’re seeing a very different World Cup. South America, it’s not the same to play in as Europe. Roar of encouragement: Mascherano urges his team-mates on during the las-16 clash with Switzerland in Sao Paulo . Getting stuck in: Mascherano tries to win the ball from Fabian Lichtsteiner during the encounter at Arena Corinthians . ‘There’s been an evolution. Today you have countries who, historically, don’t have such a football tradition but they’ve evolved; they’ve made a stride forward. ‘Costa Rica are getting their reward for being a brave side. They’re a team that likes to play, that I love to watch because they never depart from their style of play. ‘I said it when they won their first game, against Uruguay; they’re a squad who invite others to copy them. ‘Colombia, well, they’re a fine team. It’s something we knew from qualifying. Jose Pekerman has done extraordinary work with very young players with great potential. Whoops! Mascherano mis-kicks as Argentina struggle to make the breakthrough in the second round game . ‘It’s a bit of a lottery too. Chile could well have gone through. It would have been deserved. I think they put in a very respectable display. They’ve grown a lot and, above all, they never deviated from their idea. That’s the identity of a team.’ Mascherano thinks it difficult to identity a favourite from the eight remaining sides. ‘I’ve read that it’s the World Cup with the most goals, where there are a lot of entertaining games, where there are a lot of great match-ups,’ he said. ‘There aren’t too many big gaps between teams. For the supporters, that’s great. I don’t think it’s fair to say anyone’s been a surprise but you have to mention Costa Rica, who are doing something extraordinary.’","Argentina midfielder says 'moment of truth has arrived' as they prepare to face Belgium .

"A judge has declared a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a verdict for a police officer who shot dead a young girl during a chaotic search for a murder suspect that was recorded by a reality TV crew. Loud voices could be heard in the jury room in Wayne County, Michigan a few hours before jurors threw in the towel in the case of Joseph Weekley on Tuesday and were dismissed. They sent three notes, the last one indicating they still couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on the third day of deliberations, despite encouragement from Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway. But supporters of the seven-year-old victim, Aiyana Jones, said they believe the jury was unable to reach a decision due to race. Mistrial: The case of Detroit police officer Joseph Weekley has been declared a mistrial after the jury were unable to reach a verdict. Weekley is accused of involuntary manslaughter . Roland Lawrence of the Justice for Aiyana Jones Committee explained only one juror was African American and that he had 'no confidence in this jury' once he realized the racial disparity. Weekley, a member of an elite police squad, was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Aiyana, who was shot in the head in May 2010 while sleeping on her grandmother's couch. He was accused of being 'grossly negligent' in how he handled his submachine gun as his black-clad, masked and armed unit stormed the Detroit home to capture a suspect in May 2010. Police threw a stun grenade through a window, and Weekley was the first officer through the door. Weekley told jurors that he accidentally pulled the trigger during a struggle with the girl's grandmother, but Mertilla Jones denied interfering with the gun. Loss: Aiyana Stanley-Jones, 7, was shot dead when the officer's gun accidentally fired during a raid . Missed: Her grandmother Mertilla Jones sobbed as she testified in the trial last week . The hunt for a murder suspect was being recorded by a crew from 'The First 48,' a police show on A&E Networks. Some video shot from the sidewalk was part of the evidence. The jury could have convicted Weekley . of involuntary manslaughter, a felony, or reckless discharge of a . firearm, a misdemeanor. He also could have been cleared of all charges. Frustration: Judge Cynthia Hathaway had encouraged jurors to reach a unanimous decision . 'This is a bittersweet outcome: Bitter because Weekley was not convicted, and sweet in that justice for Aiyana Jones will come soon,' said Roland Lawrence. A pretrial conference to schedule a new set of hearings and a near jury selection is set for 9am July 25. If convicted, Weekley could face up to 15 years behind bars. Aiyana was sleeping on one end of the couch, and her grandmother Mertilla Jones was on the other in May 2010 when an armed, black-clad and masked police officers stormed the apartment. Armed with an MP5 submachine gun and . behind a shield, Weekley had been tasked with being first into the home in search of murder . suspect, Chauncey Owens. Last week, a neighbor testified that he . tried to tell officers before they raided the home that children were . inside. Under cross-examination Monday, Jones said the officers were . negligent. 'They knew there . were children in there. So why would they come in there like that? They . came to kill, and they killed a 7-year-old.' Davis, the officer who tossed the stun grenade, said the team was unaware children were inside. When . asked by prosecutors if knowing children were in the house would have . forced police to change raid tactics, Davis responded: 'Probably not.' The apartment: Police entered the home on the bottom-level where Jones and her granddaughter were. Their actual target lived in the apartment above . It was Owens they were after. Two days before the raid 17-year-old Je'rean Blake was standing outside a neighborhood convenience store when he was shot to death following a dispute. Mertilla Jones testified that Owens lived in the upper unit with her daughter, LaKrystal Sanders. Police found Owens in the upstairs flat and he was arrested. Owens pleaded guilty in April 2011 to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 28 years in prison for Blake's slaying.","Joseph Weekley charged with involuntary manslaughter in death of Aiyana Jones after he was 'grossly negligent' with handling gun during a raid .

'After the article, Cliff noticed black SUVs outside his house,' a source told the Post. 'He was then contacted by a Victoria's Secret private eye who wanted to meet with him and their lawyer.' Another source said that Turney's conservative bosses at Ohio-based L Brands are not happy with the scandal. 'They've been trying to shut down Cliff and convince him not to include her in his book. But he's standing up for himself,' a friend added. 'His book has many people and many chapters. This is one chapter. He contributed to Victoria's Secret.' Donenfeld and Turney started dating around 2008, and he soon after broke up with his girlfriend so he could spend more time with the lingerie exec in Florida, New York and Ohio. Staying together: Donenfeld and Turney's relationship ended in 2010 when she refused to leave Charles (left), her husband of more than 20 years. Pictured above last December . Donenfeld claims Turney relied on him for advice on everything from the Victoria's Secret fashion show, to what she should wear. 'She didn’t go out in public without my input,' he told the Post last year.'I was instrumental in every aspect of her life for two years. I was her sounding board, personally and professionally.' Changed man: A source close to Donenfeld says he's dating someone new and has turned his life around after getting baptized. He now attends church every Sunday . During their two-year romance, Turney allegedly promised to buy her boyfriend a multimillion dollar home in Naples' exclusive Port Royal community, but all he got was a Cartier watch. Things got more serious in 2010, when Turney was considering a professional move to Harrod's in the UK. Donenfeld says Turney asked him to move to London with her, where they could start a new life together and adopt a baby. 'At the time, she was discussing a move to Harrods,' he said. 'She said it would be much easier to start our lives over again in London. She said she’d place me in a job at Harrods.' But when Donenfeld scheduled an . appointment for Turney at a New York divorce lawyer, so she could . finally leave her husband, Turney wavered.

"A young Somali-American woman is believed to have fled her home in Minnesota to join Islamic State militants fighting in Syria. Prosecutors in  St Paul yesterday charged 20-year-old Yusra Ismail with stealing a friend's passport to travel to the conflict zone. She was not present at the hearing, having left the U.S. on August 21. The criminal complaint alleged that Ismail used the stolen U.S. passport to fly to the Netherlands and Norway last August. On August 24 she contacted family members to tell them that she had subsequently travelled on to an area of Syria under the control of the Islamic State terror group. Militants: U.S. authorities have long held concerns about the number of young Somali-Americans traveling from the Minneapolis area to join Islamic extremist groups fighting abroad, including ISIS (pictured) Prosecutors said there is no record of Ismail, who is not a . U.S. citizen, returning to America after using the stolen passport to leave the country last August. She had booked a return ticket, according to the complaint, but there is no record of anyone ever using that ticket to board a flight back to the United States. Omar Jamal, a Somali community advocate in the Twin Cities who has spoken with Ismail's family, told TwinCities.com that she is 'a very young girl' who was 'really confused.' He said her family is 'a little bit shocked' that she left for Syria, adding 'she was radicalized... she was brainwashed.' U.S. authorities have long held concerns about the number of young Somali-Americans traveling from the Minneapolis area to join Islamic extremist groups fighting abroad. Until recently, however, those leaving the large community of East African expatriates in the area have mainly joined Al Shabaab - the militant Al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia. Route: A  number of Somali-Americans are believed to have left Minneapolis Saint Paul Wold Chamberlain International Airport in Minnesota to travel to Europe and subsequently join the Islamic State in Syria . Terrorists: Last summer, FBI officials said they had begun tracking a trickle of Somali-Americans from the Twin Cities area to Syriain in general, and to areas held by the Islamic State (pictured) in particular . Ismail's case comes one week after the same office charged two young Minnesota men of Somali ancestry with supporting the Islamic State. Abdullahi Yusuf, 18, was stopped at Minneapolis airport before he could board a plane to Turkey - the country most would-be jihadists pass through to reach terror group's Syrian strongholds. Agents are still looking for 20-year-old Abdi Nur, a contact of Yusuf's - who boarded a plan to the Turkish capital Istanbul the day after his friend's arrest and has not yet returned to America. Last summer, FBI officials said they had begun tracking a . trickle of Somali-Americans from the Twin Cities area to Syria . in general and to Islamic State-held areas in particular.

"For more than 700 years, Old Sarum has hidden a secret buried in its foundations. A detailed underground plan of the 11th century medieval city has revealed a series of houses and a courtyard believed to be the remains of a royal palace. The map was created using geophysical ground-penetrating scanners on the site of the Iron Age fort near Salisbury. The findings, which concentrated on the medieval period, revealed a series of large structures along the southern edge of the outer bailey defensive wall (pictured). The vast complex - thought to be a royal palace or defensive structures - measures 557ft (170 metre) long and 213ft (65 metre) wide . The geophysical survey was carried out by archaeologists from the University of Southampton using a range of state-of-the-art scanning techniques. They concentrated their survey around the inner and outer baileys of what was once a fortification, situated around two miles (3.2km) from modern-day Salisbury. Old Sarum was an Iron Age fort established around 400 BC and which measures 1,300ft (400 metres) long and 1,180ft (360 metres) wide. It was occupied by the Romans after the conquest of Britain in 43AD when it was known as Sorviodunum. A castle was built on the site after the Norman Conquest in 1066, when William the Conqueror created a motte in the centre of the hillfort, adding an inner set of fortifications. The geophysical survey was carried out by archaeologists from the University of Southampton using a range of state-of-the-art scanning techniques.They concentrated their survey around the inner and outer baileys of what was once a fortification (marked) situated around two miles (3.2km) from modern-day Salisbury . The inner castle and royal palace consisted of towers, halls and apartments, while the north-western section of the bailey was chosen as the site for a new cathedral, built in 1092. The city was inhabited for more than 300 years, but declined in the 13th century with the rise of New Sarum, now known as Salisbury. The findings, which concentrated on the medieval period, revealed a series of large structures along the southern edge of the outer bailey defensive wall, suggesting these buildings may have been built to defend the fort.

The vast complex measures 557ft (170 metre) long and 213ft (65 metre) wide and is arranged around a large courtyard. Experts believe the walls would have been up to 9ft (3 metres) thick, and featured a 196ft (60 metre long) hall. There is also evidence of towers and multi-storey buildings. The mapping additionally revealed an open area of ground behind these large structures, thought to have been used to deliver resources to their residents, or built as part of a circular route through the city. Residential areas were found in the south east and south west quadrants of the outer bailey alongside the inner bailey ditch, alongside evidence of deposits indicating industrial features, such as kilns or furnaces as well as signs of quarrying after the 1300s. These vast complexes, and the presence of a large courtyard suggests the whole site may have been used as a palace.

The inner castle and palace consisted of towers, halls and apartments, while a cathedral was built on the north-western section in 1092 . Kristian Strutt, director of archaeological prospection services at the University of Southampton, said: 'Archaeologists and historians have known for centuries that there was a medieval city at Old Sarum, but until now there has been no proper plan of the site. 'Our survey shows where individual buildings are located and from this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan within the city walls.'

The inner castle and royal palace consisted of towers, halls and apartments, while the north-western section of the bailey was chosen as the site for a new cathedral, built in 1092. All early buildings in the castle would have been made of timber, and the oldest surviving stone structure, the keep, is said to have been built early in the reign of Henry I in the 12th century. The royal palace within the castle was subsequently used by Plantagenet monarchs. Eventually, a new cathedral was established during the 1220s in what is now modern-day Salisbury. This caused the clergy to abandon Old Sarum and marked the start of a gradual decline of the region in favour of New Sarum, now known as modern-day Salisbury. The castle continued in use, and money was spent on its repair and maintenance during the reign of Edward III in the 14th century. By the 19th century, the settlement was officially uninhabited but still had formal parliamentary representation. Old Sarum is currently an English Heritage property and is open to the public. Source: English Heritage . The research was conducted as part of the Old Sarum and Stratford-Sub-Castle Archaeological Survey Project, directed by Kristian Strutt and fellow Southampton archaeologists Timothy Sly and Dominic Barker. Old Sarum is currently an English Heritage property and is open to the public. Heather Sebire, property curator at English Heritage, said: 'Having the team of archaeologists on site over the summer gave our visitors a chance to find out more about how important historic landscapes are surveyed. 'The use of modern, non-invasive surveying is a great start to further research at Old Sarum. 'From this work we can surmise much about the site's past and, whilst we can't conclusively date the findings, it adds a new layer to Old Sarum's story. We welcome the chance to find out more about our sites, and look forward to exploring ideas for further research in the future.' Mr Strutt added: 'Our research so far has shown how the entire outer bailey of the monument was heavily built up in the Middle Ages, representing a substantial urban centre. 'Results have given us compelling evidence as to the nature of some of the structures. It is clear, however, that there is more non-intrusive work that could be carried out to further expand our understanding of the site.' The team hopes to return to complete the survey of the inner and outer baileys and survey the Romano-British settlement to the south of Old Sarum in Easter 2015.","Old Sarum was an Iron Age fort near Salisbury established around 400 BC .

"In the search for life on Mars, landers, rovers and spacecraft have been sent to the red planet to ascertain if it was once, or still is, habitable. But evidence for such life might now have been found in a meteorite that landed on Earth three years ago. Examining a meteorite named Tissint, scientists have found small fissures that were filled with carbon containing matter - and it may be of extraterrestrial biological origin. Scroll down for video explanation . The Tissint meteorite (fragment shown) fell to Earth in Morocco on 18 July 2011. It was ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact 700,000 years ago. Pieces of the meteorite were found to have fissures caused by water, and these may contain carbon of biological origin, according to a new study . The Tissint meteorite fell to Earth in the Moroccan desert on 18 July 2011. It was ejected from Mars after an asteroid crashed into the surface 700,000 years ago, sending debris into space - some of which made its way to Earth. And this meteorite, the fall of which was seen by several eyewitnesses, seems to bear signs the red planet was once habitable. Dr Philippe Gillet, director of EPFL's Earth and Planetary Sciences Laboratory, and colleagues from China, Japan and Germany performed a detailed analysis of organic carbon found in the meteorite. The Tissint meteorite fell in Tata Province, in the Guelmim-Es Semara region of Morocoo, on 18 July 2011. It broke apart in the atmosphere and rained material on to Earth, with several pieces being recovered and some being sold. It is also only the fifth Martian meteorite to be seen falling to Earth by eyewitnesses - the last being in 1962. Tissint had been ejected from the surface of Mars 700,000 years ago when an asteroid struct the surface. Of most interest is the sign of certain elements being carried into cracks in the rocks by water fluid, which has never been seen in a Martian meteorite before. They concluded that it very likely had a biological origin. The scientists argue that the carbon could have been deposited in fissures of the rock when it was still on Mars by fluid that was rich in organic matter. 'So far, there is no other theory that we find more compelling,' said Dr Gillet. Other studies of the meteorite have agreed that carbon in the meteorite is organic. However, there has been a debate as to where this carbon came from. A study in 2012 proposed that the carbon came from the crystallisation of magma at high temperature on Mars - ruling out a biological origin. But the latest study says liquids seeping into the rock at low temperatures near the surface is a more likely explanation. The Tissint meteorite fell in Tata Province (shown), in the Guelmim-Es Semara region of Morocoo, on 18 July 2011. It broke apart in the atmosphere and rained material on to Earth, with several pieces being recovered and some being sold. And it is only the fifth Martian meteorite to be spotted falling to Earth . Dr Philippe Gillet, director of EPFL's Earth and Planetary Sciences Laboratory, and colleagues from China, Japan and Germany performed a detailed analysis of organic carbon found in the meteorite. They found it very likely had a biological origin from Mars (shown) This is supported by some properties of the meteorite's carbon. Most notably, the ratio of the carbon 13 isotope to carbon 12 was similar to coal on Earth. This is important because coal has a biological origin - namely dead plant and animal matter. In the study the researchers also ruled out the chance the carbon had come from Earth - and they are now increasingly sure this meteorite proves life on Mars once existed. 'Insisting on certainty is unwise, particularly on such a sensitive topic,' warns Dr Gillet. 'I'm completely open to the possibility that other studies might contradict our findings. 'However, our conclusions are such that they will rekindle the debate as to the possible existence of biological activity on Mars - at least in the past.'","The Tissint meteorite fell to Earth in Morocco on 18 July 2011 .

"An astonishing photograph of John Kerry having a cozy and intimate dinner with Bashar al-Assad has emerged at the moment the U.S Secretary of State is making the case to bomb the Syrian dictator's country and remove him from power. Kerry, who compared Assad to Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein yesterday, is pictured around a small table with his wife Teresa Heinz and the Assads in 2009. Assad and Kerry, then a Massachusetts senator, lean in towards each other and appear deep in conversation as their spouses look on. A waiter is pictured at their side with a tray of green drinks, believed to be lemon and crushed mint. Cosy: This astonishing photograph shows the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his wife having an intimate dinner with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his wife in 2009 . Cosy: This astonishing photograph shows the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his wife having an intimate dinner with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his wife in 2009 . The picture was likely taken in February 2009 in the Naranj restaurant in Damascus, when Kerry led a delegation to Syria to discuss finding a way forward for peace in the region. While President Barack Obama has softened his military threat against Syria by putting the question to Congress and guaranteeing at least a week's delay, Kerry remains outspoken about the dangers posed by the Syrian regime. He said that Assad 'has now joined the list of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein' in deploying chemical weapons against his own people. Kerry said Sunday that the U.S. now has evidence that sarin nerve gas was used in Syria and that 'the case gets stronger by the day' for a military attack. Speaking out: US Secretary of State John Kerry last week said the U.S. knows 'with high confidence' the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in an attack . Couple: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is pictured with his British-born wife Asma Assad . Under pressure: Syrian President Bashar Assad, right, is pictured in a meeting yesterday.  Kerry has described him as a 'thug and murderer' During a passionate speech in Washington last Friday, he called Assad a 'thug and murderer,' and urged the world to act. 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator,' Kerry insisted. And today in a call to 120 Democratic congressmen Kerry called Assad a 'two-bit dictator'. The Obama administration has placed the Syrian chemical weapons death toll on the outskirts of Damascus at 1,429 people - far more than previous estimates - including more than 400 children. The . head of the U.N. refugee agency in Syria says seven  million Syrians, . or almost one-third of the population, have been displaced by the . country's civil war. Tarik . Kurdi said that five million of the displaced are still in Syria while . about 2 million have fled to neighboring countries. He says two million children are among those directly affected by the war. Kurdi . says U.N. assistance has been a 'drop in the sea of humanitarian need' and that the funding gap is 'very, very wide.' He says international . donors have sent less than one-third of the money needed to help those . displaced by the war. More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed since an uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad erupted in 2011. Kerry has said he is confident that Congress will give Obama its backing for an attack against Syria, but the former Massachusetts senator also said the president has authority to act on his own if Congress doesn't give its approval. While Kerry stopped short of saying Obama was committed to such a course even if lawmakers refuse to authorize force, he did say that 'we are not going to lose this vote.' Congress is scheduled to return from a summer break on September 9.  House Speaker John Boehner has said a vote will likely take place that week. Senator John McCain said on Sunday that Assad will be 'euphoric' about Obama's decision to wait for Congress before scrambling his bombers. And after a meeting with Obama at the White House today the senator said it would be 'catastrophic' if the vote was lost on the House of Representatives floor. The French parliament could act sooner. A debate is scheduled Wednesday on taking action on Syria, as President François Hollande has come under increasing pressure to seek legislative approval for joining the U.S. in any attack. On Saturday evening, centrist UDI party leader Jean-Louis Borloo insisted that 'like the U.S. president, who decided to consult the U.S. Congress in the name of democratic principles, the French president must organize, after the debate, a formal vote in parliament.' What was once considered a certain three-pronged attack on Syria from the U.S., France and the UK was reduced to a bilateral affair on Thursday, as Britain's parliament shot down Prime Minister David Cameron’s request for involvement in a strike against Assad. A day later, Kerry began flattering France as America's 'oldest ally,' in hopes of ensuring that Paris didn’t follow London’s lead. Horrific: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault now says he will share top-secret intelligence with his nation’s parliament on Wednesday. 'We are going to give the MPs everything we have – classified until now – to enable every one of them to take on board the reality of this unacceptable attack,' he said Monday. Elisabeth Guigou, president of the foreign affairs committee in France's National Assembly, said Monday that  – told France info: Ayrault planned to show MPs 'evidence the attack took place and that it could only have been the regime who were behind it.' On Sunday a government source told the French news agency Agence France-Presse that the French will soon make public a trove of documents over the years, showing Syria stockpiling chemical weapons. One of the loudest critics of the administration's handling of Syria, McCain criticised Obama in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. Referring to Obama's famous statement that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a red line, McCain said: 'He didn't say, ""It's a red line - and by the way I'm going to have to seek the approval of Congress."" He said it was a red line, and that the United States of America would act.' 'That's a big difference,' McCain insisted. 'And that's one of the reasons why this is so problematic.' The Arizona Republican, whom Obama defeated for the presidency in 2008, said the president asked him to come to the White House on Monday, specifically to discuss Syria. Awful: Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria . Democrats, too, are expressing frustration at Obama's failure to act decisively after his 'red line' speech. Charles Rangel, who represents the Harlem section of New York City, said Monday said 'of course it's embarrassing' that the president didn’t act immediately after chemical weapons use was discovered. Rangel opposes a Syrian military strike but said Obama's delay on Saturday was also a major embarrassment to Kerry – who had demanded strong action a day earlier. It’s 'unheard of,' Rangel said on MSNBC, that a president would allow the world to see him issuing an empty threat. 'So of course it's embarrassing, I wish it didn't happen, ' he said. ' 'I guess Secretary Kerry is even more embarrassed than me after making his emotional speech that this was urgent.' Tension: President Bashar Assad will be . 'euphoric' about Obama's decision to wait for Congress over Syria, . according to Sen. John McCain . Firm: Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov . said evidence of alleged chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime . presented to Moscow by the U.S. and its allies is 'absolutely . unconvincing' Obama is hoping Congress's most intractable foreign policy hawks will help sell the idea of U.S. military intervention in Syria to a nation already deeply scarred by more than a decade of war in the Middle East. Having announced over the weekend that he will seek congressional approval for military strikes against the Assad regime, the Obama administration is now trying to rally support among Americans and their elected representatives. Obama's meeting with McCain is meant to quell fears that Obama isn't doing enough to punish Assad's government for the presumed sarin gas attack in the Damascus suburbs last month. But some Republican and Democratic lawmakers don't want to see military action at all. Obama's turnabout on Syria sets the stage for the biggest foreign policy vote in Congress since the Iraq war. On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. received new physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that shows sarin gas was used in the August 21 attack. 'We know that the regime ordered this attack,' he said. 'We know they prepared for it. We know where the rockets came from. We know where they landed. We know the damage that was done afterwards.' Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President . Biden meet with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security . Advisor Susan Rice to discuss Syria on Sunday . Debate: The President meets national security advisers to discuss possible military action . Kerry's assertion coincided with the beginning of a forceful administration appeal for congressional support. On Capitol Hill, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in private to explain why the U.S. must act. Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough also made calls to individual lawmakers. Classified meetings have been planned for this week.

"Wearing a turquoise polo neck with her hair neatly blow-dried, Irene Lewis Ward, 87, looks every inch the prosperous retiree. But the Wiltshire grandmother's innocuous appearance hides a secret - and one that could strike at the heart of the Danish monarchy. For Mrs Ward claims to have proved that she is the great granddaughter of King Frederik VII, a monarch who supposedly died childless and left his throne to a cousin from whom current ruler, Margrethe II, is descended. Scroll down for video . Delighted: Mrs Ward says she is delighted to have finally discovered the truth about her history . Ruler: Danish queen Margrethe II is descended from Frederik's cousin, Christian of Glucksburg . According to Mrs Ward, whose story has been turned into a book that has sent shockwaves through Danish society, she is descended from Frederik and his third wife, former ballerina Louise Rasmussen. King Frederik VII was believed to have died childless, with the throne passing to Prince Christian of Glucksburg, but Mrs Ward says he actually had a secret daughter who was smuggled away to Wales for her own safety. 'It was amazing to find it all out. It was a long process but we got there,' said a delighted Mrs Ward. 'It's great to put all the pieces together. 'There is plenty of the king's [Frederik's] blood flowing in the UK, even if they didn't know about it at the time.' Mrs Ward's tale begins with her grandmother Elizabeth, who according to the 87-year-old, is the daughter of the Danish monarch and his third wife. Although King Frederik had had two previous royal marriages, both were unhappy and ended in divorce. His third match, with 'commoner' Louise, caused an outcry and the match was morganatic - between people of unequal rank - which meant his title and privileges could not be automatically claimed by his wife or children. Until Mrs Ward came forward, it was thought the couple had not had children, leaving the throne empty when Frederik died. Instead, claims Mrs Ward, they had a daughter named Elizabeth who was born in February 1851 but kept her existence a secret in order to avoid a war. Had the child been a boy, the royal pair would have announced his birth to the nation, confirming him as Frederik's heir and successor. The birth of a girl, her parents feared, could spark a German-assisted revolt, pitching the Scandinavian country and its larger neighbour into a bloody war. Childless: Although King Frederik VII is thought to have died childless, Mrs Ward's new book claims otherwise . Royal descendants: Mrs Ward's father John (left) and grandmother Elizabeth (right) Desperate to keep the birth secret, the royal couple approached the British Government for help and came up with a plan to spirit the newborn out of the country. Elizabeth was taken by Sir Henry Williams-Wynn, the British Ambassador to Denmark, from Copenhagen to his country estate in north Wales. The child grew up anonymously in Britain, later marrying and having three children. Tragically, she died young, perishing soon after her husband and eldest son. One of the two remaining children was Mrs Ward's father, John, who was just six at the time of his mother's death, and who in later life, began the search for his maternal grandparents. 'My father spent his life looking for his mother's people,' explained Mrs Ward. 'He spent many years trying to find out, and ultimately failed. At home: Mrs Ward says she is descended from Elizabeth, the daughter of King Frederik VIII . At home: Mrs Ward, despite her claims to Danish royal blood, lives in a modest home in Wiltshire . Quest: Mrs Ward took up the search for her great grandparents after her father's death . 'He . discovered his mother was connected to the Williams-Wynn family but . every time he asked a question about her, no one would tell him . anything. 'I had seen how much it had bothered my father and when he died, I vowed I would one day take up his search.' Mrs Ward and her late husband began their own search in 1969, and in 1981 the trail had led her to Copenhagen. There, the final piece in the puzzle fell into place when she tracked down the great-great granddaughter of the wet nurse who had taken the baby to Wales. The woman had promised to keep it a secret until her death, with Mrs Ward agreeing not to tell anyone until after she had died. 'Her family had kept this secret for all those years,' said Mrs Ward. 'Her great-great grandmother was the wet-nurse who had to take the newborn baby girl of the King and the Countess. 'She took her with the British ambassador all the way to north Wales and handed the baby over to a family in a village. It all fitted, and I realised the mystery had been solved. 'I promised not to tell the story until after this lady had passed on and now I can. 'All that time we were looking in north Wales for a family scandal - the daughter of one of the Williams-Wynn family getting pregnant or something like that. 'We had no idea we would discover that I was the great-granddaughter of the supposedly childless King of Denmark. The story means an awful lot to me.'","Irene Ward, 87, claims to have evidence of her descent from Frederik VII .

"As the voice behind Frozen's Elsa, Idina Menzel's formidable vocals have echoed around the globe in the Disney film's mega hit Let It Go. But the 43-year-old actress  says she hasn't always been proud of her incredible voice because growing up she didn't want to seem different. Much like her cartoon incarnation, who is forced to keep her freezing powers under wraps, Menzel spent her teenage years hiding her ability from friends. Scroll down for video . Idina Menzel suppressed the formidable vocals that made  Disney's mega hit, Let It Go, a worldwide success . Menzel is the voice behind Frozen's heroine Elsa, the princess who must hide her ice-making magical powers . 'I didn't want to stand out. I didn't want other girls to be envious of me - or not like me,' Menzel said in a recent interview in The Telegraph's Stella Magazine. 'So, yes, I would hide that.' As well as her powerful vocals, Menzel felt forced to mask  her strong personality when she broke into acting. 'I was afraid of being too big and too loud,' she said. 'So I went inward. But I've come back round in my 40s to not being ashamed of being bawdy and a maybe a little bit rough around the edges.' Menzel got her first break in the original New York production of Rent in 1996 and has been a stage star for the past two decades. In 2004 she won a Tony award for playing the green-skinned witch Elphaba in Wicked on Broadway. Left: Menzel sings Let It Go at the 2014 Oscar ceremony; right: In happier times with ex-husband Taye Diggs . Then last year she became the voice of Elsa in the Disney hit Frozen, the most successful animated film of all time - partly, no doubt, due to its soaring soundtrack. The film's central anthem, Let It Go, captured the imagination of children and adults alike and become a worldwide hit. It then won best song at this year's Oscars,  which Menzel performed live. Menzel, who grew up in a Jewish family in New York's Long Island, says she was overwhelmed by the success of the film. While amid the whirlwind of Frozen, she faced painful drama in her personal life with the recent split from her husband of ten years, the actor Taye Diggs. The pair have a five-year-old son, Walker. The divorce has been hard and Menzel admits to being torn as a working mother, saying, 'I always feel guilty'. She also laments often missing Walker's bedtime thanks to her current stage role in If/Then, a Broadway show  written specially for her. Ironically her own parents split when she was 15, prompting the actress to pledge never to divorce. And she confesses to feeling 'ashamed' that her marriage broke down but is committed to co-parenting with her ex. Currently on the agenda for Menzel is her Christmas album, Christmas Wishes. The record, which includes festive classics like  Christmas Wishes, Silent Night and Baby It's Cold outside (a duet with Michael Bublé), is out now.","The 43-year-old New Yorker didn't want other girls to be 'envious' of her .

"Sam Allardyce headed for his 60th birthday celebrations with West Ham occupying a Champions League place and the veteran manager admitting that he is too long in the tooth to fret over his Upton Park future. When Allardyce was given a stay of execution by the club’s owners in May it was on the basis that he served up more attacking football. Five months on and Big Sam has delivered with a little help from a summer signing who has scored six goals in six games. Now the manager is being asked about Sakho rather than the sack.

There is a long way to go, of course, but it is a sign of how quickly things can change that David Sullivan and David Gold are happy to let Allardyce’s contract drift towards its expiry date at the end of the season. Allardyce has seen it all before. ‘When you’ve got 13 years in the Premier League and 20 years in the manager’s job, the anxiety of contracts is not a great hardship,’ he said. ‘If there is a turn in fortunes, I’ve still done a fantastic job and life will move on.’ It is more than a decade since Allardyce demonstrated the pressures of football management by wearing a heart monitor on the touchline for a television documentary and five years since he had cardiac surgery to remove an arterial blockage. He is a changed man. ‘I don’t feel the pressure as much,’ he said. ‘You learn to deal with it. I’ve proved myself at this level a long time ago and that makes life all the more enjoyable and you can be less worried about things that go against you.’ West Ham proved that at Turf Moor, weathering a difficult first half against a Burnley side desperate for their first win of the season before scoring three second-half goals to move up to fourth place. Diafra Sakho maintained his remarkable record since a £3.5million summer move from Metz and was involved in the other goals for Enner Valencia and Carlton Cole. Allardyce bristles at the suggestion that West Ham’s style is significantly different this season, but the fans who wanted him out have certainly gone quiet.

And the West Ham gaffer was all smiles at the final whistle as his side moved into the top four . Carlton Cole cannot hide his delight as he celebrates in front of the rapturous West Ham faithful at Turf Moor on Saturday . This was the first time a Premier League team has scored with three headers in one game since Norwich managed it against Newcastle nearly three years ago. Having won his fourth Premier League game in eight, Allardyce needed to overcome another challenge, this time from wife Lynn, before his birthday celebrations. ‘There was a big debate between us about whether it should be a large party,’ he revealed. ‘Not being that pleased about being 60, I said it would be small so it’s with very close personal friends. ‘Then on Sunday it’s all the family — son, daughter, the grandchildren. I’ll really have a very good weekend now.’ The same could not be said for Burnley after eight games without a win. George Boyd scored their goal but Burnley failed to make the most of their chances. ‘It’s devastating,’ said Boyd. ‘But I have no doubt we’ll get the goals which will be enough to keep us in the division.’ VIDEO Our strikers delivered - Allardyce .","West Ham moved into the top four after beating Burnley on Saturday .

"Michael Sata has promised to turn around the poor southern African country's fortunes within 90 days . A former cleaner at Victoria Station has become president of Zambia. Michael Sata, 74, who has vowed to . 'sweep my country even cleaner' than he kept the London railway . platforms, was sworn in as leader yesterday after a narrow election . victory. The chain-smoking father of eight campaigned against the growing influence of China in his mineral-rich country. He accused outgoing President Rupiah . Banda, whose party had been in power for 20 years, of being soft on . corruption and vowed to share Zambia's huge mineral wealth more fairly. Mr Sata, known as King Cobra for his . venomous turn of phrase, was born in Zambia when it was still the . British colony known as Northern Rhodesia. He came to London in the 1950s and found work as a cleaner and then porter for British Rail. He studied part-time and took casual jobs at car assembly plants before returning home and joining the police force. Mr Sata, who refuses to drink bottled . water until all Zambians have access to clean water, worked under two . presidents before breaking with the ruling party to form his opposition . Patriotic Front. Rise to power: Mr Sata's swearing-in yesterday . He quickly won support from mill- ions of Zambians who continue to live in poverty, despite the nation's natural wealth. China has a massive presence in the . country, Africa's biggest copper producer, but refuses to employ . Zambians or use local products. Instead, Chinese contractors bring in . their own labour force, equipment and food. Locals celebrate in Lusaka early this morning after opposition leader Michal Sata was declared Zambia's new president . Presidential challenger Michael Sata was declared the winner last night, sending his supporters into the streets of Lusaka . Election volunteers prepare for the ballot count, in which Mr Sata won 43 per cent of the vote . There were suggestions during the . volatile campaign, which saw bloodshed and rioting between rival party . supporters, that the Chinese were bankrolling Mr Banda. However Mr Sata . edged to victory with 46 per cent of the vote. Yesterday Mr Banda wept as he conceded defeat to the man who once served as one of his ministers. He said Zambians must unite following the election. 'Zambia must not go backward,' he said. 'We must all face the future and go forward as one nation.' Political commentators have raised . concerns that Mr Sata's hostility towards China might have a negative . impact on Zambia's economy. The country's currency has already devalued in recent days in anticipation of a victory for Mr Sata. Another cause for international . concern has been the new president's support for Robert Mugabe's ruinous . rule of Zimbabwe and decade-long land grab. According to the United Nations, 70 . per cent of Zambia's 13million population live in poverty, and the . average annual wage is £255. Mr Sata's swearing-in makes Zambia . one of the few countries in Africa to have had two democratic . transitions of power since gaining independence from colonial powers in . the 20th century.

The men were forced to cocoon . themselves in an improvised igloo and live off a revolting diet of . penguin meat and seal blubber to survive. After seeing out the harsh winter they mustered the strength to trek 200 miles over five weeks to reach safety. It . is thought the crew member's incredible story of survival was largely . overlooked by history because the heroic death of Captain Scott was so sensational. The accounts, photographs and diagrams . from Dr Levick that are being sold by a private owner have brought the . remarkable tale back from the cold. Having . spent the summer months observing a colony of Adelie penguins, Levick . and the others soon realised the Terra Nova ship would not be back to . pick them up as arranged. Amazing story of survival: Levick's sketch of the ice cave igloo where he was stranded with five other explorers is revealed for the first time . Diarist: Dr Murray Levick in his finneskos - or reindeer boots (left) - and wrapped up against the elements (right) Rations menu: Levick's documentation of the men's diet reveal just how revolting it was . The vessel was unable to reach the party due to heavy pack ice. With . little food or equipment and wearing clothes unsuited for an Antarctic . winter, the men abandoned their tents and dug an ice cave - or igloo as . Dr Levick described it. He . drew a diagram of the cave including positions of where the men slept . and he described how biscuit boxes were used in the construction. He wrote how ice was good at conducting heat so the cave was surrounded by snow, which wasn’t. Stranded . on the aptly named Inexpressible Island from February to September 1912 . the men were forced to live off seal blubber and penguin meat. The . details of the diet were recorded by Dr Levick, 36, including the . effects of eating blubber that caused retching and sickness. Disgusting diet: The party survived on combination of penguin meat and seal blubber, which caused retching and sickness . He . wrote: 'We had great difficulty in eating the blubber, and as our . biscuit ration was reduced to 1 biscuit per day each, we had to eat very . large quantities of lean meat to satisfy our hunger. 'This led to a craving for starchy food that would never be satisfied.' Listing . the menu for the men between February 24 and March 17, Dr Levick wrote: . 'Morning: 1 pint hoosh (sealmeat and blubber) 1 spoonful of cocoa in a . pint of hot water. Evening: ditto.' He added: 'When all was ready the cook shouted 'mugs ready'. 'Immediately each man passed up his aluminium sledging mug...remaining in their bags to eat it.' Another problem was the lack of salt, and using sea water instead merely gave the men diarrhoea. Ill fated: Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Scott . A further predicament - one that . nearly killed them - was when a blizzard sealed the cave and the stove, . powered by seal blubber, almost asphyxiated them all. The . men, known as the Northern Party, were led by Victor Campbell, but it . was Dr Levick’s medical knowledge that ensured they lived. To pass the hours lying in their sleeping bags, Dr Levick wrote his detailed account and described how he read to the men. He wrote: 'I started reading to the party in the evenings. Our library consisted of David Copperfield, Simon the Jester, the Life of R.L.S. and Boccaccio’s Decameron. 'I started on David Copperfield and read a chapter every night.' Tobacco was another consolation and there can rarely have been a more heartfelt tribute to pipe smoking than Dr Levick’s. He wrote: 'Now pipes and tobacco have for hundreds of years soothed and cheered the heart of Man, but I do not believe that the blessings of the precious plant have ever been felt and appreciated more than they are now being felt and appreciated by us.' After seven months the men attempted to make it to safety on September 30 and arrived at Port Evans 200 miles away on November 7. They then learned of the fate of Capt Scott, who had died on his return from the South Pole. A search party that had been sent to look for the Northern Party had found their empty tents and were amazed when they learned the men had survived. As well as the commander, Victor Campbell, and Dr Levick, the other men were Raymond Priestly, a geologist, and petty officers George Abbott and Frank Browning, and Seaman Harry Dickason. Dr Levick’s accounts of the experience and the photographs are being sold by auctioneers Bonhams and are expected to fetch about 30,000 pounds. Dr Levick later wrote a groundbreaking study of Adelie Penguins, the first serious monograph on the species. A spokesman from Bonhams said: 'The story of Dr Levick and his companions is a truly remarkable tale of survival against horrific odds, resourcefulness and real heroism but it is not well known. 'If Captain Scott’s tragic fate were not so powerfully etched into the British soul the exploits of this other intrepid group of heroic Britons would be celebrated much more widely. 'These smoke stained, weather beaten notebooks of Dr Levick show why.' The auction takes place in London on March 30.","Details emerge of how crew from Captain Scott's doomed Terra Nova expedition survived in an ice cave .

"The British Chiropractic Association claims hunching over a screen can damage posture and cause back or neck pain . Watching movies in bed on your laptop or tablet is playing havoc with the nation's backs, a new study warned. Nearly half of all Britons confessed they used the devices before dropping off to sleep. Yet the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) said people tend to forget their posture, hunch over the screen with their spine unsupported which can damage posture and cause back or neck pain. Three fifths also watch TV in bed and four fifths of those spend up to four hours glued to the screen. But the BCA warned much of this TV time is at uncomfortable body angles. Instead it is urging Britons to make bedrooms tech free zones to improve sleep quality and better posture. BCA chiropractor, Tim Hutchful, said: 'Technology has become integral to our lives but when it comes to bedtime it is having negative repercussions on our lifestyles and bodies. 'Our research shows that nearly half (48%) of people can't sleep due to back or neck pain but technology could actually be exacerbating the problem. 'Many of my patients who can't sleep will resort to a laptop or a mobile phone to help them get to sleep, for example to watch a film, but the reality is this could further prevent them from sleeping. 'The light given off by screens stimulates the brain making us feel more awake and what's more, when people use technology in bed, they often don't pay attention to their postures which can cause pain and keep them awake. 'We're urging people to make their bedrooms tech-free zones and see what benefits can come from this.' It said laptops, tablets and smartphones should be banished from the bedrooms. If tempted to check emails one last time before bed, people should try doing this in the living room or the kitchen then switch off before retiring to bed. And instead of relying on mobiles for an alarm call, people should invest in a traditional old fashioned alarm clock as this will remove both the temptation to use it and stop its lights disrupting sleep. But if you have to use devices in bed, make sure your back is supported with a pillow and the device is propped up so it's at eye level. The BCA is urging Britons to make bedrooms tech free zones to improve sleep quality and better posture.","Nearly half of all Britons admit using devices before going to sleep .

"When Caroline Cartwright, from Tyne and Wear, gets into bed with husband Steve, sleeping is usually the last thing on her mind. But while Mrs Cartwright and her husband of 38 years enjoy their time in the sack, neighbours have been left fuming after being forced to endure years of banging sounds and screaming. 30 visits from the police later, the 53-year-old was slapped with a four-year ASBO and even endured a 12-week jail term. But, she says, she has no regrets - and no plans to stop. Scroll down for videos . No regrets: Caroline Cartwright has no regrets, despite being hit with an ASBO for having noisy sex . 'If you get to a point where the bed's banging on the wall, you're not going to stop, are you?' she laughs. 'As far as I'm concerned, that's what you should be doing. Just relax. Go with the flow. It's not as if I'm having sex and think: ""Oh, I'm making too much noise. I better be quiet"".' Mrs Cartwright's problems began when she and her husband moved into a quiet terrace of Victorian homes in Tyne and Wear. Their bedroom backed onto a neighbour's but the couple, who will appear on Channel 5's ASBO and Proud documentary, chose to splash out on a bed with an iron headboard anyway. Complaints from irate locals soon began to flood in but it wasn't just the headboard that annoyed neighbours - Mrs Cartwright's habit of screaming loudly during the act also proved a problem. 'It was a different bed from the one we have now,' she says, unrepentantly. 'We broke that one. It was a metal headboard so it used to bang on the wall.' Banned: Caroline is not allowed to shout, scream or vocalise during regular sex sessions with husband Steve . 'There was no carpet back then, so when you have sex, the bed goes back and forward,' adds Mr Cartwright, who describes the complaints as 'silliness'. Finally, after scores of visits from the police, Mrs Cartwright was handed a noise abatement order - later upgraded to an ASBO after she breached the order five times. The ASBO forbade her from 'shouting, screaming and vocalisation' during sex or from playing loud music. In a bid to get around the restrictions, Mrs Cartwright, who is unemployed,  switched her sex sessions to the morning - but neighbours, who complained she was noisy enough to drown out their TVs, were left unimpressed. 'I wasn't supposed to make excessive noise that could be heard in a neigbouring property or outside,' she explains. 'As soon as I got it, I said to them [the police]: ""I guess I'm going to get arrested then"".' She duly was. 'I think we were having sex when they came to arrest me,' she remembers. 'I think we'd just finished,' adds husband Steve. In court: Caroline and her husband leave court after she was sentenced to her first prison term in 2009 . Not happy: Caroline and Steve leave court for the second time a year later having received another jail term . Misery: Rachel O'Connor is one of the neighbours whose life was made a misery by the Cartwright's noisy nocturnal antics . 'The lads in blue were knocking on the door and I let them in and they asked me what we were doing,' he continues. 'And I said we were having sex in our own house.' 'When we got to the police station, the [policeman] said: ""We're going to have to stop laughing now we're going in"",' adds Mrs Cartwright. 'They were all trying not to laugh.' What followed, however, was no laughing matter. Mrs Cartwright was taken to court, handed an eight-week suspended prison sentence and was forced to live in a bail hostel for weeks. A year later, and after scores more complaints and visits from the police, Mrs Cartwright was again arrested for breaching her ASBO following two police call outs in two days. Again, she was handed a suspended sentence, this time for 12 weeks, and sent to live in a bail hostel where she was held alongside serious criminals, including murderers. It proved an interesting experience. 'I would have been judgmental about people who went to prison before I got locked up,' she explains. 'But then you go in there and you hear the stories of why they're there, it makes you realise that it could be anyone who ends up there.' But despite her convictions, Mrs Cartwright, who has since bought a less noisy wooden bed, remains adamant that she's done nothing wrong. 'I don't see why I should stop having sex in my own house with my husband of 38 years,' she complains. 'I'm sure there could be a lot worse things I could be doing. They all thought it was stupid I was in prison. 'I mean I was in the same prison as people like Rose West for making a noise when I have sex. There could be a real crime going on while they're busy arresting me.'","Caroline Cartwright, 53, was handed an ASBO for having noisy sex .

"These rare colour photographs of Adolf Hitler spent a decade languishing beneath the ground. His personal photographer Hugo Jaeger - who was granted unprecedented access to the Führer to document his every move between 1936 and 1945 - hid his colour slides after the fall of Nazi Germany for fear of being persecuted. Jaeger, who was one of the first photographers to use colour film before the end of the war years, buried the slides in metal jars to try and conceal his links to the Nazis, but returned to retrieve his handiwork in 1955. Hitler in colour: The Führer is seen in upper Bavaria in the late 1930s in a rare colour shot taken by his personal photographer Hugo Jaeger . The collection, published by Life.com, includes informal photographs of the Nazi leader dining with members of his inner circle, as well as shots of him delivering speeches against the backdrop of a swastika flag or overseeing battle plans. Jaeger shot thousands of photographs of Hitler over a period of nine years, before the end of the war prompted to hide his colour slides in a leather case - terrified they would give away his links to the Nazis. Rare glimpse: The Nazi leader is seen in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz .

"Here's a new kind of fast fashion - a zip up tie for men. The innovative fashion statement is draped round the neck and then the two sections are zipped up - which could save precious seconds for anyone late for a meeting and eliminates the need to re-tie it later in the day. The tie costs £42 and comes in three different sizes and shades of blue and grey. But even the designer, Josh Jakus, . from Oakland, California, admits it won't be to everyone's taste and is . more for those who want to 'assert their individuality'. Time-saver: The zip up tie can be donned in seconds with no need to re-tie later in the day . He said: 'I don't think it will replace . the original tie - there are a lot of people who would prefer to stick . with the tradition - that's fine with me.' Mr Jakus added that his tie is 'perfect for any occasion where you want to both look good and different at the same time'. 'A friend has worn the tie to government functions in Washington DC - and he didn't look out of place,' he said. The 44 year old said the style also makes a great talking point when worn at parties. Fast fashion: Designer Josh Jakus came up with the innovative fashion statement that allows men to zip and go . 'When I wore the zip tie to a cocktail party recently I spent the whole evening talking about nothing else,' he said. 'The feedback has been great. One of my male friends initially hated the tie, but then a minute later he said he loved it. I took it as a huge compliment because it meant he had to think about the design - that's what I want my work to do.' The product designer explained how he came up with the idea thanks to the surplus supplies of material his company had. Style statement: Mr Jakus admits the innovative tie is for men who want to 'assert their individuality' He said: 'My other designs are made with zippers and felt, and my company had surplus of both of these materials. I was trying to find a use for the extra material and started coming up with different ways to create a new and unique idea. 'At one point I put a zipper around my neck and the idea was born - it was pretty easy to figure it out from there.' He said the ties, which will be available to buy online and from selected retailers are currently 'for all ages' but he hasn't ruled out a range for children. 'I haven't made a tie for kids yet, but I know a friend has bought one of the smaller sized ties for her son,' he said. Wooden tie, £38, by Made Lovingly, www.notonthehighstreet.com .

"A group of Scottish football legends have come out in support of the Union, but then received a barrage of abuse on Twitter. David Moyes, Alan Hansen and Ally McCoist were among 16 former players and managers calling on fans to reject independence when the vote takes place on September 16. But many Twitter users were quick to make their voices heard, and attacked the group. One Twitter commentator described Murdo MacLeod as a Tory c*** due to his rejection of independence . The Yes Scotland campaign published an aerial photograph of Alan Hansen's Merseyside home in response . The team, which includes 16 players from the 1960s to the 2000s and former Old Firm managers Billy McNeill and Walter Smith issued a joint statement through the Better Together organisation. They said: 'We are proud Scots who have been proud to represent our country around the world. When Scotland calls, we answer. 'We are proud that Scotland has always stood on its own two feet but we also believe that Scotland stands taller because we are part of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a country Scotland helped to build. 'We urge every patriotic Scot to help maintain Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom which has served Scotland so well.' The intervention of the high profile footballers has not been welcomed by people promoting a Yes vote. MOTD: Pundit Alan Hansen is one of 16 former Scottish players to reject independence . Former Old Firm managers Billy McNeill, left, and Walter Smith, right, are 'managing' the squad of 16 . Some, such as Alan Hansen and Paddy Crerand  have been criticised for joining the debate as they no longer live in Scotland. Hansen left for Liverpool in 1977 while Crerand arrived in Manchester in 1963. Other footballers such as Ally McCoist faced abuse over the fact that previous comments may have been seen as being in favour of independence. Murdo MacLeod was accused of wanting to strip and privatise the National Health Service which saved his life. Other Twitter users described him as a Tory. Other pro-independence supporters questioned Hansen's qualifications for commenting on economic matters . Paddy Crerand's relevance to the debate was raised over the length of time he has lived in England . Pro-independence activists criticised some of the players over the fact that they no longer live in Scotland . Scottish Labour's deputy leader Anas Sarwar praised the intervention of the footballers. Speaking to the Daily Record, he said: 'These men have played for the national team, have led Scotland and are now saying what they believe is best for Scotland.This shows that there is no shortage of passion and patriotism from those that are voting No. 'This isn’t a choice about whether Scotland is a nation or not as, these legends show, Scotland already is a proud nation. 'This is a choice of what vision we think is best for our future in Scotland and we believe that is solidarity, unity and teamwork.' Rangers: David Moyes and  Ally McCoist have also lent their support to the No campaign . Speaking at an event to launch the statement in Glasgow, football commentator and Better Together supporter Archie Macpherson called on the No side to inject more heart into its arguments during the final days of campaigning. He said: 'It has been a logical and rational presentation of facts on the currency, North Sea oil, pensions and so on, which are absolutely vital, but it has got to be backed up with conviction and passion. 'So it is not just reasoned arguments - you have got to reach out and communicate with people.' Yes: Some supporters showed a statement by Ally McCoist designed to damage the No campaign . Mr Macpherson, who recently spoke out for the union at a rally in Dundee, added: 'All these figures played with passion - people on the terracing responded with passion, passion was at the core of football in Scotland, and it was only passion that kept us going against bigotry. 'And they are backing the last home stretch passionately and the people on the terracing will recognise that, and I am sure they will go with them.' The full line-up includes Alex McLeish, Jim Leighton, David Moyes, Alan Hansen, Willie Miller, Paddy Crerand, Davie Provan, Barry Ferguson, Bertie Auld, Denis Law, Ally McCoist, Derek Johnstone, Murdo MacLeod, Ian Durrant, John Brown and Frank McAvennie. However, following today's announcement, members of the pro independence movement have taken to social media to criticise Hansen's intervention in the debate. One Twitter account for the Yes Scotland campaign even published an aerial photograph of Hansen's Merseyside house. The Scotland Legends campaign features former players and managers of both Celtic and Rangers . Michael Stewart, a former Scottish international footballer, pundit and Yes Scotland campaigner, said: ""It's always interesting to hear different views on this big issue, and I am hearing many, many other voices within the football world who are backing Yes. 'The real strength of the Yes campaign is seen in the many fans' groups who are backing independence right across the country. 'And this is just symbolic of the groups and movements from all walks of life in the powerful, ever-growing grassroots movement who, I believe, will help deliver the all-important Yes vote in just over a week's time.' In recent weeks, celebrities such as JK Rowling, Sir Alex Ferguson and Susan Boyle have all previously come out in support of a no vote. David Bowie used his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards to urge 'Scotland stay with us'. However, comedian Frankie Boyle and James Bond star Sir Sean Connery have both said Scotland would benefit by independence. With polling day approaching on September 18, the gap held by the No campaign has fallen to just six points with 53 percent of the population planning to reject independence - down from 73 per cent in May.","Former Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen has rejected independence call .

"The federal government has spent $394 million on the Obamacare website - more than it cost to build Facebook or Twitter, it was revealed today. Despite the massive bill to taxpayers, the Healthcare.gov still doesn't work properly ten days after it was launched - allowing only a handful of Americans to sign up for plans on the insurance exchange market. And experts warn that the site is likely to continue to experience significant glitches for months to come as engineers work out the bugs they failed to to spot before the site went live on October 1. The price tag for the broken healthcare site is more than four as high as what the government initially meant to pay. Failure: This is the error message MailOnline received on Thursday when a reporter tried to sign in to Healthcare.gov. Some content on the site doesn't even appear to have been proof-read . It appears that only a handful of users have been able to sign up for health insurance through Healthcare.gov ten days after the site launched . In 2011, the Obama Administration agreed to pay contractor CGI Federal $93.7 million to build, launch and maintain Healthcare.gov. In the two and years since CGI Federal won the bid to build the Obamacare site, the company requested more and more money to cover cost over-runs. And the federal government had agreed. Experts say the site has dramatic problems with the back-end architecture has resulted in servers becoming overloaded and bogging down. But the interface is also a problem. Much of the site contains grammatical and typographical errors. Java Script errors prevent pages from loading correctly in browsers. Even more infuriating, Andrew Couts of Digital Trends points out, is the fact that much larger, more successful sites have been built for far less money. CGI has collected $634 million overall in Department of Health and Human Services contracts since 2006. Facebook operated for its six years, until June 2010, on less than $600 million in outside funding - a acquiring more than half a billion users and more than 130million monthly unique page views. Twitter, founded in 2006, operated on $360 million in investment until 2011 - when servers were processing more than 140 million tweets a day. The October 1 roll out of health insurance exchanges is one of the key pieces President Barack Obama's health care law . The professional social network LinkedIn built a base of more than 230 million users with $200 million in funding. The Washington Post reports that 4.7 million people tried to log onto the site in the first 24 hours. But, the government has refused to release traffic number for Healthcare.gov since. On Thursday, the site allowed visitors to create a username, but was not allowing log-ins. Digitial Trends points out that it's not as though the United States of is short on talent when it comes to developing online software - Americans invested the Internet itself, after all. CGI Federal has refused to comment on the glitches and why Healthcare.gov has failed to work - or when full service might be restored. Government contractor CGI Federal won the contract to build Healthcare.gov two years ago - for $94million . The Department of Better Technology, a federal contractor that competes with CGI Federal, sheds some insight into why the Healthcare.gov contract might have failed so spectacularly. 'That cancer is called “procurement” and it’s primarily a culture driven cancer one that tries to mitigate so much risk that it all but ensures it. It’s one that allowed for only a handful of companies like CGI Federal to not only build disasters like this, but to keep building more and more failures without any accountability to the ultimate client: us,' the company wrote in an op-ed posted on its site. On top of promoting mediocrity, the federal procurement system also weighs down site developers with 6,500 pages of registration and regulation for contractors. Those restriction ensure that 'very few new businesses can compete for contracts, and the ones that do end up becoming specialists in those regulatory burdens, not in doing the right thing,' the Department of Better Technology says.","Price tag is more than four times as high as the original $94 million contact .

"Alan Pardew remains in the market for attacking personnel but he may have unearthed a gem from the club's academy after teenager Rolando Aarons tortured Schalke in a 3-1 victory at the Veltins Arena. The 18-year-old Jamaican – who also qualifies for England – laid on one goal for Emmanuel Riviere and scored another as the Magpies enjoyed an unlikely win over their Champions League hosts.

"In an interview to celebrate his 71st birthday. Sir Alex Ferguson has spoken about the managers who could replace him, his desire to win back the title from Manchester City and why the return of his 'warrior' captain Nemanja Vidic could make the difference. Ferguson was interviewed by Abu Dhabi Sports, when he was also asked about the prospect of Manchester United signing Mario Balotelli from their arch rivals and who he believes is the better player: Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi. Ferguson, who also spoke highly of Robin van Persie - but did not mention Wayne Rooney once in the interview - said he is still 'hoping to stay for a bit of time' at Old Trafford. Many happy returns: Sir Alex Ferguson gave a wide-ranging interview in Abu Dhabi on his 71st birthday . 'In terms of football management, I have achieved everything I always wished for. It's been a great journey for me. But being manager of Manchester United, you have to kick on. You can't look back. The drive is always on to do better, although it's not easy in the Barclays Premier League. It's a difficult league. And European football is getting stronger and stronger. 'You have to think of where we lost it last season. We were 4-2 at Everton and didn't win. That won't happen again. Trust me. Our rivals are Manchester City and possibly Chelsea. We recovered a 12 point disadvantage to catch Newcastle one year and lost 11 point lead to Arsenal, so it's (Chelsea) is possible, but it's City who are the biggest danger.' Asked about managers who will replace him, Ferguson said with a smile: 'There is no-one on the agenda, but somebody will have to replace me... The fire still burns: Manchester United's manager is as combative as ever after more than 25 years at Old Trafford . 'I'm hoping to stay on for a bit of time, anyway. 'It's very difficult. Over the years, names have been bandied about but football is such a precarious industry. But you could be talking about one of the potentially exciting young managers in the game, but is he going to be here in two or three years time. The sack race is horrendous. 'Sometimes a manager can only survive four games if he doesn't win a match. It's impossible to say who is going to be there.' Ferguson is then asked about Everton's David Moyes and Jose Mourinho. He says: 'There will always be names bandied about and they are all qualified people. Nobody knows where they are going to be in two or three years time. 'Top managers will always been in demand. Heirs to the throne? Jose Mourinho (top left), Pep Guardiola (top right) and David Moyes (below) 'Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho and David Moyes... there are a lot of successful managers out there. I don't know what their plans are in two or three years time.' Ferguson spoke highly of striker Robin van Persie, signed from Arsenal last summer. 'He certainly is magnificent players. He brings maturity, he is a proven goalscorer, a proven international and and is at a good age. He is helping our young strikers, Chicharito and Danny Welbeck. He's been outstanding since he came.' He also welcomed the return of Nemanja Vidic. 'He has been out for a year and three months, although he has played a few games. He's our captain, a real warrior and our leader.' Forward talking: Fergie praised Robin van Persie (top)... but failed to mention Wayne Rooney (below) And he was asked if United could win the league and European Cup double, a feat they managed in both 1999 and 2008. 'It's hard to marry the two together,' he replied. 'We've done it in the past and there is no reason why we can't do it this season too.' He was critical of United's success in Europe, however, and believes they should have won more than the two European Cups in his time as manager. 'I think our club should have done better. Sometimes we have been unlucky, sometimes we have been disappointing and other times, we have thrown it away.' Ferguson also praised his wife Kathy, to whom he has been married for 47 years. 'Without her backing and support, there is no way I'd have lasted as long as I have,' he said. No chance! Controversial Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli (centre) appears not to be on Fergie's radar . And when asked to decide who is the better player: Real Madrid forward Ronaldo or Barcelona's Messi, he replied: 'They are both the best in the world. They have different qualities, but they both have fantastic desire. 'Pride to play, pride to prepare. Ronaldo practiced for hours, that's what made him a great player. We had the privilege of him for six years and he will go down as one of the best players this club has ever had.' Finally, the interviewer asks him if he would like to sign Balotelli for United from City. A smiling Fergie responds: 'I have enough players!'","'Guardiola, Mourinho and Moyes will always be in demand'

"Just 51,000 people completed Obamacare applications during the first week the Healthcare.gov website was online, according to two sources inside the Department of Health and Human Services who gave MailOnline an exclusive look at the earliest enrollment numbers. The career civil servants, who process data inside the agency, confirmed independently that just 6,200 Americans applied for health insurance through the problem-plagued website on October 1, the day it first opened to the public. Neither HHS nor the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services would comment on the record about the numbers. Enroll America, on Obama administration-related organization that aims to help Americans sign up, only replied to a request for information a day after this article was first published. 'I don’t have any hard numbers beyond what HHS and the state-based exchanges have released,' said spokesman Justin Nisly, who insisted that Americans have been 'enthusiastic' and 'grateful' for Obamacare. The White House did not respond to emails seeking comment. But several administration officials have claimed this month that they didn't have access to the kinds of raw figures MailOnline obtained from the people who work for them. And the anemic totals suggest a far lower level of interest in coverage through the Affordable Care Act than the Obama administration has hoped to see. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . More than a week into the glitch-littered launch of the Obamacare insurance exchanges, MailOnline has learned that just 51,000 Americans have used Healthcare.gov to enroll . Organizing For Action, the latest incarnation of President Obama's 2012 campaign organization, celebrated the Oct. 1 launch of the Obamacare exchanges in Lehigh, Pennsylvania, but the numbers so far have been nothing to celebrate . Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, a . Republican who chairs the House Ways & Means Health Subcommittee, . said that 'if the numbers are accurate,' they show 'that relatively few people have . navigated the challenges of the first step of the process – roughly the . population of a small town in my district.' 'The . White House and HHS have continually claimed they did not have these . figures,' Brady told MailOnline. 'If they do, they have misled the . Congress and the American people.' The low numbers . also reflect a level of technological frustration on the part of . Americans whose attempts to investigate their new health insurance . options have been met with crashes, error messages and interminable . delays. CNN host Wolf Blitzer agreed on Wednesday that the White House . should consider granting Republicans' demands for a one-year delay of the rule requiring individual taxpayers to buy insurance, given the failings of the glitch-prone enrollment website . that has produced more headaches than new customers. ‘If . they weren’t fully ready, they should accept the advice that a lot of . Republicans are giving them,' Blitzer said. 'Delay it another year, get . it ready, and make sure it works' 'I don't know': HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on The Daily Show that she hadn't seen Obamacare enrollment numbers . Obama was passionate on launch day, saying in a Rose Garden ceremony that millions of Americans would benefit from the Affordable Care Act. But so far those numbers have seemed far out of reach . The open enrollment period for Obamacare coverage is slated to last for six months. If the first week's total were an indication of how many Americans will sign up during that time through the Obama administration's website, its final tally would reach a paltry 1.32 million. Healthcare.gov provides enrollment services for Americans in 36 states; the remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia, which operate enrollment programs in their own exchanges, represent 33.7 per cent of the U.S. population, according to census projections. If the state-run exchanges were to have a similar response rate for six months, the national enrollment total would be approximately 2 million. That number is less than 29 per cent of the 7 million the Obama administration would need, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in order to balance the new health insurance system's books and keep it from financial collapse. 'The administration’s goal is seven million people in the first year,' Americans for Tax Reform president Grover Norquist, a long-time Obamacare opponent, told MailOnline. 'We are not on track for anything like seven million. New Coke was retired for being a smaller disappointment.' 'There was no good reason to hide these number,' he said. 'This is not keeping a secret from the Russians or the Syrians. ... Why lie about this, . for crying out loud?' 'These numbers reflect what we all know: Obamacare is a disaster,' Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn told MailOnline. 'It is time for the . president to admit Obamacare is not working and that the American people . deserve better.' Spokespersons for five different Democratic senators declined to provide comment, with most saying they are paying greater attention to the debt-ceiling and government-shutdown standoffs that have gripped Washington, D.C. since before Oct. 1. 'These numbers reflect what we all know,' said Texas GOP Senator John Cornyn (C). 'Obamacare is a disaster.' Rep. Kevin Brady, an outspoken Texas Republcan, said everyone who has used the federal government's website to enroll in Obamacare would fit in a single small town in his legislative district . House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee chair Darrell Issa, a California Republican, said the small enrollment numbers are a symptom of a larger problem. 'Far more people have been unable to complete their applications because of crashing websites or impossible wait times than have successfully enrolled,' said Issa. 'Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and the window for open enrollment gets smaller every day.' They've lost Wolf: CNN personality Wolf Blitzer, who seldom aligns himself with Republicans, said Wednesday that the White House should give Republicans the Obamacare delay they seek, if only to give tech issues time to sort themselves out . Issa said Wednesday during a committee hearing on Capitol Hill that 'in just the past decade, the federal government cancelled at least fifteen major IT projects after wasting $10 billion on their development. But none of those costly mistakes were anywhere near as big or complex, as Obamacare.' The White House aims to see the health care exchanges enroll at least 2.7 million young, healthy people between the ages of 18 and 35, whose monthly premiums are needed to offset the cost of health care for older, sicker Americans. It's unclear how many of the early enrollees fall in that age group. A projected enrollment total of 2 million would also represent just 4 per cent of the overall number who could participate. 'More than 50 million Americans qualify for the Obamacare exchanges,' Americans for Limited Government vice president Rick Manning pointed out, claiming that 'this paltry response is a clear rejection of the system.' It remains possible, according to the sources who provided the enrollment data, that overall rates of enrollment will tick up after the much-maligned healthcare.gov website is retrofitted with technology fixes that allow more Americans to navigate it smoothly. White House Press Secretary Jay . Carney drew criticism on Monday after he . boasted that website response times were cut by one-third after the . Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services implemented virtual . 'waiting rooms' that allowed users to trickle in according to the load the . government's servers could handle. Another flood of customers could hypothetically come in after Jan. 1, the sources said, if a significant number of private employers cancel their employee benefit plans and dump their workers into the Affordable Care Act's health care exchanges. 'You should ask HHS. I don't have a number,' said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Oct. 4, when reporters quizzed him on Obamacare enrollment numbers . Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Sunday on Fox News that 'it's obviously not my primary area of responsibility' to know how many Obamacare enrollees have clicked the error-prone 'submit' button . The availability of raw Obamacare enrollment numbers will come as an embarrassment to the Obama administration, since its public faces have insisted that such figures are unknown or unknowable. Carney reiterated on Monday that the administration would 'release enrollment data on regularly, monthly intervals.' 'I'm not sure when that begins,' he told reporters, 'but I'm sure we'll let you know in plenty of time so you can plan and put it on your calendar.' 'The clock is ticking,' says Rep. Darrell Issa, 'and the window for open enrollment gets smaller every day' That night, Comedy Central host Jon Stewart asked Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on 'The Daily Show' how many Americans had enrolled in Obamacare. 'I can't tell you,' the secretary answered, 'because I don't know.' An unnamed senior White House official told CNN host Jake Tapper on Monday that the administration would start releasing numbers after November 1, and would combine data from healthcare.gov with those from more than a dozen states that run their own health insurance exchanges, in order 'to have a good picture of what's happening across the country.' Sen. Ted Cruz, the feisty tea party standard-bearer who led a lengthy quasi-filibuster last month that raised the profile of what Republicans say are Obamacare's legal and philosophical shortcomings, said Thursday that 'every day our concerns are validated as we learn more about how the law can’t deliver on its promises.' 'The law has failed on every single measure,' Cruz told MailOnline. 'It does not make healthcare more affordable or accessible. It does the opposite.' Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin said Thursday that the Obamacare enrollment numbers were unlikely to keep pace with the numbers of Americans who are losing their insurance as the program goes into effect. 'Over 800,000 people in New Jersey alone have lost their current health insurance in the last month,' Martin said, 'yet nationwide only 51,000 people have received health insurance from Obamacare. The numbers just do not add up.' Overlaid on top of Obamacare's rocky launch has been a partial government shutdown whose broad personnel layoffs have compounded what was already a difficult rollout. On Wednesday a press spokesperson who answered a Department of Health and Human Services press line told MailOnline to allow at least 24 hours for a comment – one which never came anyway. 'We're in furlough status right now, so we're short-staffed,' she said. 'All our requests are going through email. Drop us a line, and if anyone's available, they'll get back to you.'","Obamacare's main signup engine attracted just 6,200 new customers on its launch day and 51,000 after the first week .

"Facing redundancy: Every regiment in the army will be hit by the cuts that will see 8,000 soldiers lose their jobs . Eight thousand British soldiers – many serving on the front line in Afghanistan – will be told days after Christmas that they are to lose their jobs. Redundancy notices will be sent to servicemen and women telling them their careers are over as part of sudden speeded-up cutbacks by the Ministry of Defence. The Army has already been shaken by the announcement of a swathe of cuts, which included the loss of historic regiments and the prospect of a gradual reduction in personnel over the next eight years. But now The Mail on Sunday has discovered that the MoD will make a single devastating cut of 8,000 servicemen and women, reducing the Army to 86,000 – its smallest size since the 1700s. A further 4,000 soldiers will go before 2020. The axe will fall across every branch and regiment of the Regular Army, with only Special Forces ringfenced. Thousands of soldiers will disappear from regiments such as the Royal Welsh, the Royal Fusiliers, the Royal Engineers, the Royal Lancers and the Army Air Corps, which includes Prince Harry among its officers. The Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers is expected to lose 600 of its most skilled personnel, while the Royal Logistics Corps will also be badly hit. Last night serving officers, military experts and MPs condemned the drastic measure as a stab in the back for soldiers and a blow to the Army’s capability. Former commander Tim Collins, who led the Royal Irish Regiment into Iraq in 2003, said: ‘This is meltdown. We’re still fighting in Afghanistan, the world is changing  rapidly and looks increasingly dangerous yet the Government is crippling our operational capability. ‘The sheer size of the redundancies in a single hit will devastate morale and send totally the wrong message to soldiers on the front line. In the new year they could find envelopes on their doormats with bad news inside. The job cuts across the Army cannot sit alongside Britain’s commitments to its operations against the Taliban and terrorist organisations appearing in other countries.’ In another move, British Army officers would be forced to retire at 45 – ten years earlier than at present – in a radical proposal by a Conservative member of the Defence Select Committee. Outspoken: Former commander Lt Colonel Tim Collins, pictured in Iraq, described the cuts as 'crippling' Drastic: A further 4,000 soldiers will go by 2020 - leaving the Army at its smallest size since the 1700s . Julian Brazier MP wants to pare down the number of senior officers, leaving just a small cadre to fill specialist positions advising politicians. The plan, called ‘Manning The Army Of The Future’, represents the most drastic change to the structure of the Army since the Second World War. Under his proposal, which could become policy by 2015 if it is approved by the Government, thousands of senior officers will be forced out. Currently the Army has just over 7,000 senior officers holding the ranks of Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, Brigadier, Major General, Lieutenant General and General. Their starting salaries at these ranks range from £47,760 to £148,000. Controversial: Conservative MP Julian Brazier, on the Defence Select Committee, has proposed that all British Army officers be forced to retire at 45 . The majority of these officers are 45 or older and reducing their numbers by half would save £144 million a year. Mr Brazier believes the top end of the Army is ‘over-commanded’ and ‘over-administered’ and wants the money saved on salaries to be used on benefits such as housing for serving officers. But former commander of British Forces in Bosnia Bob Stewart, now a Conservative MP, said: ‘If the “Career to 45” scheme is introduced many of the most talented officers will leave in their early thirties. Why would they hang around to 45, by which time they might struggle to find really good jobs in the major industries?’ The sending out of 8,000 sacking letters after Christmas has stunned senior personnel. One major, who expects to be among those selected for redundancy, accused the Prime Minister of ‘cowardice’. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: ‘The Government and the Prime Minister want the redundancies out of the way in 2013 so their disgusting treatment of frontline soldiers is forgotten about by the time of the next General Election. ‘They don’t care what this reduction in Britain’s fighting capability will do to morale or to our combat effectiveness. All they care about is what is on voters’ minds the year after. This is a most cruel example of political expediency. The redundancies and the commitment to shrink the Army to a strength of 82,000 could have been met by natural wastage, a slowing down of recruitment and cherry-picking those who are the most keen to leave. ‘Some really good people are going to be chopped, some of them who are serving in Afghanistan now – their post-operational tour holiday periods will end just in time for the Government to hand them a P45. Morale will take a skydive.’ More cuts: The news comes after Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced the loss of 17 units back in July . In July, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced the total loss of 17 units. At the time no schedule for the redundancies was confirmed. Only those soldiers about to deploy to Afghanistan and those serving on the front line that month will be safe from the January cull. No redundancy notices will be posted to Camp Bastion. The MoD said last night: ‘There are no plans to make any further reductions beyond the changes announced last year. The size and timing of any future redundancies has yet to be determined, however we aim to remove uncertainty for Army personnel and their families as soon as possible. Difficult decisions have had to be taken to deal with the multi-billion-pound black hole in the defence budget.’ It added that it had no plans to change the retirement age for senior officers. Since publication of the above article and a comment piece in the Mail on Sunday, MP Julian Brazier wrote this response: . Your article ... did not take into account my proposals for pensions and the prospects for redundancies. You . claimed my support for the brilliant General Sir Frank Kitson’s . blueprint of moving from a three quarter career to a half career would . reduce pensions for many. In fact I stated it would require a generous . boost to pension rights and, obviously, those following a proper second . career will have many years to add to their pension pots. My . proposals offer a route to a larger deployable force, and protect . essential benefits. I have repeatedly defended Army pension rights in . Parliament and am campaigning to get justice for a group of officers . made redundant just before their earliest pension date. Also, . if an 8,000 reduction really is planned, far more of those people would . be leaving through natural wastage and voluntary redundancy than . compulsory discharge. Julian Brazier MP .

"Remy Cabella resumed his holiday already planning to establish himself among Newcastle's great French imports. The 24-year-old France international completed his move from Montpellier for an undisclosed fee on Sunday evening when he signed a six-year deal to become the latest recruit from his country to ply his trade at St James' Park. He could make his competitive debut for the club in the Barclays Premier League opener against Manchester City next month, and he will do so hoping to follow in the footsteps of the likes of David Ginola and Laurent Robert. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Remy Cabella freestyling in the rain with France team-mates . New boy: Remy Cabella poses with his Newcastle shirt inside St James' Park after sealing his £12million move .

Fresh start: Cabella (left), pictured in action against Bastia last season, is Newcastle's fourth summer signing . Big stage: Cabella (right) was part of France's World Cup squad but failed to make an appearance for Les Bleus . VIDEO Newcastle splash out on Cabella . Cabella told nufcTV: 'Yes, that's something I am here for. I am looking to improve all the time and hopefully become one of the best. I just love improving. 'I love to play. Big matches or little matches, I am always there. It makes me want to play more, the fact that this match is such a big one at the start, and I am looking forward to just getting involved in the season. 'My first match at Newcastle is something I have been really looking forward to.' Cabella freely admits he modelled himself on Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo as a youngster, but insists he has become his own man as he has matured in the game. He said: 'I loved to learn how to dribble like him and do the tricks, but now I am on the professional stage, I have my own way. 'I am looking to improve all the time and Newcastle is a well-known, very good club. I just love to improve and that's what I'm here to do.' Magpies boss Alan Pardew was delighted to have finally landed a man the club had been chasing since January, when they tried to sign him as a replacement for Yohan Cabaye. Indeed, the 52-year-old included himself in a vote of thanks he extended to owner Mike Ashley, managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr for eventually getting the deal done. Pardew said: 'I'd like to pay tribute to my staff, in particular Graham, myself, Lee and Mike and everyone on the board who worked really hard for this one because he's a player we think is important. Inspiration: Cabella admits he used to model his game on Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo . Not alone: Cabella has joined a growing list of French players plying their trade at St James' Park . Planning ahead: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is busy strengthening his squad ahead of the new season . 'Obviously, that's represented in the fee and represented in his commitment to us as well. 'I am just looking forward to seeing an exciting talent in the team and someone who can open the door. 'Of course, he's a player who has been on our radar for a while. It's a marquee signing for us. 'He represents all Newcastle fans love in a player. He has real flair, real hard work, commitment. But he is going to bring a talent to St James' Park that I hope our fans are going to enjoy. 'He's got great ideas when the ball comes to him and, along with [former Ajax midfielder] Siem [de Jong], is going to improve an area where we definitely needed some help. 'It's part of a rebuilding process, and a big part of it.' Pardew finished last season under pressure after Newcastle wilted alarmingly following Cabaye's departure for Paris St Germain, and he is hoping signings of the calibre of Cabella and Dutchman De Jong can help win over his detractors. Big expectations: Pardew wants new signing Siem de Jong to improve Newcastle's central midfield options . Break: Cabella will go on holiday to Corsica before returning to pre-season training with his new club . He said: 'It's taken us a while to build and we have had to lose one or two great players along the way, Cabaye in particular. 'But we always knew that once this summer came, we could make a bigger step, maybe, and hopefully that's reflected in performances, reflected hopefully in our fans' belief in the team and more importantly, for the players we have retained, the great players we have retained - [Fabricio] Coloccini, [Cheick] Tiote, Tim Krul, et cetera.' In the meantime, Cabella will return to the holiday he interrupted in Corsica to complete his move before throwing himself into his new challenge. The midfielder said: 'It was nice to meet everybody and to come down, but I am definitely looking forward to making the most out of the rest of my holiday before I have to knuckle down and get in and start training with everyone.'

"Floyd Mayweather’s potential mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao could take place in the Middle East. Reports have claimed that a group of investors in the United Arab Emirates have put around £70million up to help facilitate hosting the fight in Dubai. After years of posturing, it seems that the super-fight could be edging closer with May 2015 being the target date for the two superstars of boxing to finally get in the ring together.

Pacquiao looked excellent during his win over Algieri (left) Mayweather’s hometown of Las Vegas is one of the favourites to host the fight, but Pacquiao’s last fight against Chris Algieri was held in the Chinese city of Macau and that could also be another option for the fight. But Dubai has emerged as a potential third host for the fight. The Middle East has never hosted anything of this size in the past and the time difference between Dubai and America would have to be factored in. Muhammad Ali and George Foreman famously fought in Zaire 40 years ago and Hasim Rahman beat Lennox Lewis in South Africa in 2001. But rarely do mega-fights such as this happen outside America.

"Half of all cancer cases are spotted at a late stage when treatment is less likely to be successful, experts have warned. They calculate that more than 52,000 patients a year are having their odds of survival cut because the disease is not being caught quickly enough. The shocking figure is based on huge variations in diagnosis around England, with some cancers almost five times as likely to be diagnosed late in some parts of the country as others. Lung cancer is the most likely to be spotted late – with fewer than one in four cases caught early. Late diagnosis is blamed on factors from a ‘stiff upper lip’ to GPs under pressure not to refer patients for costly tests. Cancer Research UK, which commissioned the analysis of NHS data, said that early diagnosis is ‘crucial to give patients the best chance of survival’. Delays in treatment can not only be deadly, but can also mean patients are subjected to much more aggressive treatments than would have been necessary earlier in the disease’s progress. For instance, a woman with breast cancer might only have surgery if the tumour is spotted early. But if the disease has spread, she may face rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well. Overall, 46 per cent of cancer in England are diagnosed at an advanced stage – when they have spread to other parts of the body, making them harder to treat. The figure rises to 77 per cent for lung cancer, Britain’s biggest cancer killer. When it is diagnosed early, seven in ten patients will live at least a year – compared to around one in four when found late. Cancer Research UK’s chief executive Harpal Kumar said: ‘Not to invest in earlier diagnosis is to fail cancer patients' If every part of the country did as well as the best, the ‘survival prospects’ of more than 52,000 patients a year would be improved, the Incisive Health report estimates. This does not mean all would be cured – some would simply live longer or be spared gruelling treatments. But 5,000 more patients would be alive five years after diagnosis. The added cost of treating advanced cancer means that catching the disease early would also save the NHS an estimated £210million a year. Cancer Research UK’s chief executive Harpal Kumar said: ‘Not to invest in earlier diagnosis is to fail cancer patients. ‘Earlier diagnosis saves lives and it could save critical NHS funds - and in the face of an overstretched NHS and a projected growing number of cancers diagnosed in the years ahead, we need to do everything we can to ensure that all patients have access to the best treatment as early as possible.’ NHS England said it is working to improve outcomes for patients though earlier diagnosis. It added that survival rates have ‘never been higher’.","Lung cancer is most likely to be spotted late – with fewer than 1 in 4 cases caught early .

"A mother has spoken of her anger after her daughter was excluded from classes because she dyed her hair ginger.

She was removed from classes and told to do her work in an isolation room at Skegness Academy, Lincolnshire, until the washed the dye out. Before and after: Shaunni Barker, 15, was shocked to be excluded from classes after dying her hair red . Mother Sharon, 42, has demanded that her daughter, who she described as a ‘good and studious student’, be allowed back into class. ‘I’ve taken her home now because she will get no work done without her teacher to help her,’ she said. ‘Ginger is a natural colour really. It’s disgusting a student can be sent home or put isolation because of the colour of her hair. ‘How does the colour affect how you learn? She’s a good kid.’ Mother Sharon, 42, has demanded that her daughter, a 'good and studious student', be allowed into class . She added: ‘I might be able to understand it better if she turned up to school with pink hair but ginger, or deep red, is a recognised colour.’ Shaunni was put into isolation when she turned up to the academy, which teaches 1,190 pupils aged 11-19, on Monday. She used £5 L’Oreal Performance colouring kit to dye her hair. Her mother said she had dyed her hair ginger because she wanted to look . like her grandmother - who is currently in poor health - when she was . younger. Her . mother, who works at a discount shop, said: ‘My mum Janet Potts had . lovely ginger hair when she was younger and Shaunni has always loved the . colour. ‘She found the right hair dye and used it because she wanted . to look like her gran because she's ill at the moment and Shaunni . thought it would be a nice gesture.’ Her mother said Shaunni wanted to dye her hair ginger in order to look more like her grandmother, Janet . She explained that Shaunni, who . aspires to be a photographer, had to work in a small office near the . head of year and wasn’t allowed into the playground for breaktime. She . was also told she had to eat lunch alone. Her mother added: ‘It's . like she's a prisoner in the school because she's decided to have ginger . hair. It's appalling. No one deserves to be treated like this.’ Yesterday the school defended the policy on hair colour. Executive Principal Emma Hadley said: ‘Our pupils are ambassadors for the academy and we expect them to represent us in the correct manner. ‘We want our pupils to present themselves smartly as we believe that the self-discipline this requires is an important lesson to learn as pupils will find that there is often a dress code in most places of work. ‘We provide very clear guidance to parents in our prospectus.’","Shaunni Barker, 15, coloured her blonde hair dark red over the weekend .

"Actress Nicole Kidman has been braving public appearances in the wake of losing her father Dr Anthony Kidman - but has revealed it's her country music star husband Keith Urban who has helped her cope. 'I think as anyone knows, you need a partner who is there for you through the tough times, as well as the good times,' says 47-year-old Kidman. 'I think when it's really, really tough and things get hard - and recently, I lost my father - and my husband was extraordinary through that. Scroll down for video . Nicole Kidman has  revealed she has been able to cope with her loss of her father by turning to the person she spent 'a long time looking for' – country music star husband Keith Urban (pictured) 'So I'm very, very fortunate. But I spent a long time looking for him.' Kidman’s father Dr Antony Kidman passed away aged 75 in Singapore in September but the Oscar-winning actress has kept up her engagements despite the dark moments that have followed, retreating as often as possible to the Nashville home she shares with Urban and their children. Kidman  arrived in China looking fresh and refreshed . 'I have a very quiet life there with my children and my husband and I love to go running, I love swimming. I love sport. I play golf,' said Kidman. 'I've had a long career now and I know what's important.' Kidman has this week travelled to the southern Chinese holiday island of Hainan to take part in the Mission Hills Celebrity Pro-Am and she has found comfort here among her own kind, being joined by fellow Hollywood A-listers Morgan Freeman, Jessica Alba and Chris Evans and even turning to fellow Aussie Greg Norman for advice about life on and off the course. Kidman arrived in China looking refreshed and was spotted out with Norman in the early hours of Friday working on the The Before I Go To Sleep star’s swing and enjoying deep conversations with the man known as The Great White Shark - who gave the actress’ game a 'six out of 10.' 'I gave her a six only because she's just starting to learn how to play the game,” said the 59-year-old Norman. 'We as players know how to play so actually when you see somebody who wants to play and learn the game of golf, we like that. That's why I give her a six because she's going to be very, very good. 'She actually made a statement and said, ""I would like to be able to play within 10 years well enough to go out and hold my own with somebody I wanted to play with on a golf course."" 'I said: ""If you do a few certain things at a regular time each week, within a year, you'll be able to get out there and hold your own against somebody.""

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of incredible FA Cup shocks, as well as intriguing matches in the Football League. 1. Andy Carroll’s heading ability makes him feared as a striker, and he was crucial in setting up Diafra Sakho’s winning goal at Bristol City. But the giant England forward is just as important to West Ham for his defensive work. The goal line clearance that stopped Matt Smith putting Bristol City in front was one of 12 headers that Carroll won out of 19 he contested in the FA Cup tie. More than half of those were in Hammers’ own penalty box helping deal with corners and free kicks, rather than when the team were attacking. Andy Carroll's (left) strength and height becomes a welcome addition to West Ham when they defend corners . Diafra Sakho (C) celebrates with team mates Aaron Cresswell (L) and Carroll as West Ham take the lead . 2. Louis van Gaal was still at the World Cup with Holland and yet to take over at Old Trafford when Manchester United paid £30million for Ander Herrera and it’s beginning to look as if he was a player the Dutchman didn’t really want. The 25-year-old Spaniard got on for only the last 23 minutes of the 0-0 at League Two Cambridge and that’s typical of how rarely he has figured for van Gaal. He has had injuries – but even when fit all but two of his last nine appearances in a United shirt have been as a substitute. Ander Herrera has struggled to impress Louis van Gaal and was only used as a sub against Cambridge . Herrera arrived at the club before Van Gaal took charge and reports suggest he is willing to let him leave . 3. One of the reasons van Gaal is said to be willing to let Herrera move on is that he wants more pace in wide areas – so he’ll be pleased to note the sudden progress being made by Wilfried Zaha since Alan Pardew took over at Crystal Palace. The 22-year-old, loaned out for the season by United but never a regular when Neil Warnock was in charge, has started three of the four games under Pardew. It’s clearly helping his confidence, involved in the creation of all three goals in the FA Cup win at Southampton. Van Gaal will be pleased to hear that on loan winger Wilfried Zaha has upped his game under Alan Pardew . 4. If Jordan Henderson is really going to step up as the Anfield successor to Steven Gerrard he needs to add more regular goal scoring to his repertoire. There were other players who were more guilty of missing chances in the 0-0 draw with Bolton, but 24-year-old Henderson had two good openings and failed to convert them in the way Gerrard in his prime would have led the side. Henderson has just two goals in all competitions from 31 appearances this season, after hitting five in 39 last term. Jordan Henderson is being touted as the next Liverpool captain but critics feel he needs to score more goals . Henderson shakes hands with former Liverpool youngster Jay Spearing during their 0-0 draw with Bolton . 5. There’s been much talk of how Chelsea need to keep Diega Costa and Nemanja Matic fit for their assault on multiple silverware but it is John Terry who remains the real heartbeat of the side. At 34 the Blues skipper sat out of the FA Cup clash with Bradford for a rest – only the fifth of Chelsea’s 34 matches so far this season he’s not figured in. But it’s hard to imagine Jose Mourinho’s side would have fallen apart so badly against League One opposition of their Captain, Leader, Legend had been on the pitch. Jose Mourinho would've been shocked to see how badly his Chelsea side were dismantled at Stamford Bridge . Keeping Diego Costa fit will be a huge bonus for Chelsea, but it was John Terry they missed in Bradford loss . 6. Former England Under 21 defender Craig Dawson started the season as first choice partner for Joleon Lescott at West Brom but lost his place in early December. The 24-year-old who began life playing part-time football while working in a pub collecting glasses is clearly determined to show new boss Tony Pulis he should get another chance. He was Albion’s best defender at Birmingham, making 14 clearances as his team fought off a second half onslaught from their Championship neighbours to hang on to a 2-1 win. Tony Pulis Celebrates West Bromwich Albion's 2-1 victory over Championship side Birmingham . 7. Winger Marc Albrighton could finally be about to get a proper chance to force his way into Leicester’s team after a disappointing time since moving from Aston Villa in search of regular first team football. The 25-year-old has started only two games all season – ironically one of them being the 1-0 win t’s against Villa. But his 17 minute cameo at Tottenham was crucial to the comeback mounted by Nigel Pearson’s side, involved in the build-up to the equaliser and then hitting the cross for Jeffrey Schlupp’s dramatic injury time winner. Leicester's Jeff Schlupp celebrates his winning goal (middle) as Younes Kaboul (left) looks on dejected . Marc Albrighton was given the chance to shine against Tottenham and he certainly did as he set up Schlupp . 8. Nigel Clough had a huge reputation for bringing through young players at Derby and he’s doing the same thing at Sheffield United. The Blades boss made eight changes at Preston from the side which had performed so heroically at Spurs a few days earlier in the Capital One Cup. Curiously one of the three whose legs were felt fresh enough for two big cup ties just three days apart was 17-year-old Louis Reed. Already the youngest ever to play for United when he made his debut at 16 and 257 days, the midfielder easily got through 90 minutes as his side fought back from a goal down to earn a replay.

Caretaker Steve Lovell is doing his chances of landing the job at Gillingham permanently after seeing his side beat Oldham to score back-to-back home League wins for the first time since last March. Gills chairman Paul Scally is still searching for a boss after Neil Ardley and his number two Neil Cox chose to stay at AFC Wimbledon. That’s given an extended chance to 54-year-old Lovell, who played 233 games as a striker for the Gills in the late 1980s and has made it clear he wants to stay in charge.

"After Manchester United's fourth Premier League win on the spin, Louis van Gaal was understandably in a jovial mood on Tuesday night.

After a difficult start to his reign as Untied boss, Van Gaal has now steered his side to withing two points of second-place Manchester City, who face a trip to Sunderland on Wednesday evening. United's 2-1 victory against Stoke saw Marouane Fellaini score his second goal of the season with a first half header before a powerful Steven N'Zonzi drive pulled the Potters level in the 39th minute. Former Chelsea winger Juan Mata put Van Gaal's side back in front after his long range free-kick evaded everyone in the Stoke box before drifting past Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal. Marouane Fellaini celebrates putting United ahead with a brilliant header in the 21st minute . Speaking after the game, Van Gaal said: 'The fighting spirit is fantastic when you see the team, and that is why the fans are also excited. ‘We have come back from bad results many times and against Stoke the referee should have whistled at 1-0 (when Assaidi challenged Fellaini) but he didn’t and they scored. But we fought back again and fought til the end when we also had the long balls to Mr (Peter) Crouch, and we have survived. ‘It is good for the players, the team and for me, and the party we have tomorrow (Wednesday)’ ‘I was not happy with the performance in the first half, we were not aggressive enough, and the last few moments were not necessary.’ Juan Mata's second half free-kick was enough to hand United three points at Old Trafford .

"Shockwaves reverberated through Eastern Europe tonight after Vladimir Putin boasted he could invade five NATO capitals inside two days. This came amid new reports that almost 4,000 Russia troops are massing in Crimea close to Ukraine's mainland. 'If I wanted, Russian troops could not only be in Kiev in two days, but in Riga, Vilnius, Tallinn, Warsaw or Bucharest, too,' Putin was quoted as threatening, according to Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. All are former USSR or Soviet-bloc cities and apart from Ukraine their countries are now NATO and EU members. Scroll down for video . Putin, pictured here at a meeting of the Russian State Council, boasted Russia could be in Kiev in two days - and also in Riga, Vilnius, Tallinn, Warsaw and Bucarest . Putin allegedly also boasted to Poroshenko about his ability to squash European Union initiatives through bilateral contacts urging him 'not to rely too much on the EU'. The Kremlin leader claimed he could 'influence and block the adoption of decisions at the level of the European Council', it was alleged. Respected German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that Poroshenko passed on the threat of invasion to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, citing EU diplomatic sources. Poroshenko warned the US Congress of a threat to 'global security everywhere' posed by the Russian aggression against his nation. 'If they are not stopped now, they will cross European borders and spread throughout the globe,' he said. The EU failed to deny the extraordinary threat from Putin, though the Kremlin dismissed the German newspaper report. 'We will not conduct diplomacy in the media or discuss extracts of what are confidential conversations,' said EU Commission spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen sidestepping the question. 'What matters to the EU is to contribute to lasting peace, prosperity and stability in Ukraine.' Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claim as 'another canard', alleging was as inaccurate as an earlier claim that Putin had boasted he could storm Kiev in two weeks. 'We consider it possible not to pay attention to such reports anymore,' he said. However, Kiev claimed that Russia was massing troops in annexed Crimea, just as Poroshenko was meeting Barack Obama in Washington. Poroshenko, pictured here in Washington today, passed on the threat of invasion to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, citing EU sources . NATO leaders have backed Ukraine claiming that a new rapid-reaction 'spearhead' force could be deployed within a year. The force, which will have 4,000 to 5,000 troops on standby is designed to be deployed in the field within three days. NATO leaders believe a strong western response will curtail Vladimir Putin's expansion plans. The NATO move is in response to Ukrainian requests for more assistance from western powers to curtail Putin. Mr Poroshenko's accusations came as a rocket shelling appeared to take place near the front line in Zuivka, some 30 miles east of Donetsk . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: 'Please understand me correctly. Blankets, night-vision goggles are also important. But one cannot win the war with blankets. Even more, we cannot keep the peace with a blanket.' Mr Poroshenko welcomed the defensive equipment pledged by the US but called on the west to supply Ukraine with offensive weapons. Almost all Russian military units 'in the north of occupied Crimea' were pushed close to mainland Ukraine 'along with all their equipment and ammunition', said National Security and Defence Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko. Despite Kremlin denials, the alleged Putin claim created a wave of angst across eastern Europe. Estonian foreign minister Urmas Paet warned in the wake of Putin's comments: 'We shouldn't let the public stress level rise all the time since it's not helping anybody.' More shelling in Zuivka: Kiev claimed that Russia was massing troops in annexed Crimea even as Poroshenko was meeting U.S. leaders in Washington . He added: 'It is clear that the security situation in Europe has changed due to the events in Ukraine.' Lithuania announced a weekend meeting of NATO top brass in Vilnius amid high anxiety over Russia's actions in Ukraine. 'For us, it is important that the NATO military chiefs discuss how to strengthen the security of the Baltic region,' said Defence Minister Juozas Olekas. Poroshenko said his country was now angled to the West . 'Ukraine crossed the Rubicon and ruined any hopes to restore the Soviet Union. We are a European nation,' he said. But he warned that in Europe the 'post-war mechanisms of security are no longer working. The world ought to review its security systems'.","Putin was quoted threatening that Russia could be in Kiev in two days - and also in Riga, Vilnius, Tallinn, Warsaw and Bucarest .

"Former Manchester United manager David Moyes is to be questioned by police over claims he attacked a reveller outside an upmarket wine bar after being taunted about losing his job. The 51-year-old, who succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson as boss at Old Trafford but only lasted nine months, apparently snapped after receiving a torrent of abuse at The Emporium, in Clitheroe. The alleged victim is 23-year-old joiner Joshua Gillibrand. Investigation: Moyes was present at the bar in Clitheroe at the time of the assault . Incident: Joshua Gillibrand claims he was attacked at just after 10pm on Wednesday night . Moyes is said to have been enraged when one drinker goaded him about his recent sacking and called him 's*** and something about having never won anything', a witness said. The 51-year-old was sacked by United in April after a disastrous first season at Old Trafford which saw United surrender their Premier League title and fail to win a trophy. In the resulting furore, a table was almost upturned and glasses sent smashing on the floor during a brief scuffle near the bar entrance. Mr Gillibrand, a joiner, allegedly suffered a lump on the side of his head and a bruised shoulder in the confrontation but did not need hospital treatment. Police today confirmed they had launched an investigation into the fracas and were set to speak to the ex-Everton boss. Location: The Emporium wine bar in Clitheroe, Lancashire, where the alleged assault took place . The incident happened at around 10pm on Wednesday after Moyes and friends – including Derek Shaw, the chairman of Preston FC while Moyes was manager there - had enjoyed a meal at Piccolino in Clitheroe before crossing the road and making their way to the nearby Emporium wine bar. A group of revellers were standing outside the bar enjoying a drink after a warm day but when they saw the former manager arrive they began making abusive remarks. A witness said: ‘Moyes started to head with his mates in but he was being barracked by drinkers outside who were giving him grief. ‘He was getting a bit of lip from a couple of blokes and then one guy, who was a bit drunk, said something about him being s**t and having never won anything. Injured: Mr Gillibrand allegedly suffered a lump on the side of his head and a bruised shoulder in the confrontation but did not need hospital treatment . ‘Moyes kept his head down and carried on walking towards the door with his friend and everyone thought he was just ignoring the banter. 'It was crazy. No-one could quite believe what had happened. We were stunned. He’s obviously had enough of all the abuse he’s been getting.’ A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: ‘Officers attended the bar at about 10pm on Wednesday, May 21 and it was reported that a 23-year-old local man had been assaulted by a 51 year old man. He did not require hospital treatment. ‘Inquiries are ongoing and we are speaking to a number of people to try to establish the circumstances. There are a number of differing accounts which we need to work through to try to establish exactly what has happened. No-one has been arrested at this stage.’ A spokeswoman for the Emporium said: ‘There was an incident outside the building. However it did not affect any of our customers or staff and has been dealt with by the police.' Out in public: Former United boss Moyes attended the LMA Awards in London last week . On the course: Moyes (right) played golf with LMA chief Richard Bevan on May 14 in Spain . Another witness told the Clitheroe Advertiser and Times that what happened was nothing more than a scuffle. 'Around 10pm, one of the men [in Moyes' group] . went outside, perhaps for a cigarette, when he became involved in a . heated argument. A table was knocked over, but that was as serious as it . got. 'David Moyes and the others went outside to see what was happening and the police arrived incredibly quickly. 'The group involved in the scuffle seemed to be in their 20s. I don't know what was said, but it obviously caused some offence.'

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini insists the club's stated target of winning five trophies in five years is 'not important' to him. City chief executive Ferran Soriano underlined the ambition from the hierarchy at the Etihad Stadium in May 2013 when he said about the next five seasons: 'On average, I want one trophy or title a year. 'That is the Champions League, the Premier League or the FA Cup. 'Pellegrini was announced as successor to the sacked Roberto Mancini shortly after and in the campaign that followed, City won the Premier League title and the Capital One Cup. VIDEO Scroll down for Pellegrini: New signings won't be ready for Community Shield . Relaxed: Manuel Pellegrini has refused to set a title target for himself at Manchester City . Victors: Pellegrini won the Premier League in his first season at the club last time out . That looks like a decent start in terms of working towards Soriano's goal, but when asked ahead of Sunday's Community Shield clash with Arsenal about the chief executive's comments, Pellegrini said: 'I don't have a target to win five titles. 'Every time I play a competition, I want to win it. 'But that thing that we have to win five titles in five years - for me it is not important.' Pellegrini was keen to emphasise the point that his side will be doing their utmost to claim silverware at every opportunity. Asked about his priorities for the season, the Chilean said: 'For this year, our target is exactly the same as last year. 'We will play in the four competitions we must play in and we will try to continue in all competitions as far as we can. Exactly the same as last year. 'We continue trying to win the Premier League, the FA Cup, the Capital One Cup and the Champions League, and we will see during the season what we can do.' City have so far made five new signings this summer in goalkeeper Willy Caballero, defender Bacary Sagna and midfielders Fernando, Bruno Zuculini - a deal completed late on Friday - and Frank Lampard, who has joined from the club's American sister outfit New York City FC on loan until January after leaving Chelsea. Pellegrini feels he has a stronger squad than last season, but is not about to make any predictions about exactly how potent they might be. Pressure: Willy Caballero has arrived to challenge Joe Hart for No 1 spot . Acquisition: Whilst Bacary Sagna has arrived to challenge Pablo Zabaleta at right-back . Asked if the group he has are capable of winning the Champions League in 2014/15, he said: 'I don't know. It is impossible for me to know the future. 'The only target of our squad is the same as last year - to try to win the four competitions that we are going to play. Of the new recruits, only Caballero, Fernando and Zuculini might feature in Sunday's match at Wembley, with City set to have eight players missing. Lampard is deemed not ready to be involved yet and the same applies to Sagna, along with Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Fernandinho and skipper Vincent Kompany - a sextet who were involved in the knockout stages of the World Cup. Alvaro Negredo is the other man to miss out due to his foot injury. Press for success: City chief Ferran Soriano has set the goal of one trophy per year . Meanwhile, Arsenal's trio of World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski are also unavailable having been given extra rest after their triumph in Brazil. Although acknowledging there will be a considerable number of high-profile absentees, Pellegrini is adamant the contest will be more than just a glorified friendly. 'Of course it is not a friendly match,' the 60-year-old said. 'It is an important game against an important team in Arsenal. 'Maybe both teams do not arrive in our best moment because both have a lot of players who are just getting back after the World Cup. 'But I think it will be a very good game, it is important for both teams to try to win it, and we will try to do that.'","Pellegrini says  target of five trophies in five years is 'not important' to him .

"Wales boss Chris Coleman has leapt to the defence of Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey. The 31-cap playmaker made his first start for Arsene Wenger's men after injury on Tuesday night and played for 90 minutes as they threw away a three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht in the Champions League. Former Gunners striker Charlie Nicholas picked out Ramsey for particular criticism in his post-match analysis, which included the belief that the 23-year-old is going backwards after a sensational last campaign which included an FA Cup final winner. Aaron Ramsey cuts a forlorn figure as Arsenal surrendered a three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht . Wales manager Chris Coleman defended Ramsey from criticism as he announced his squad for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium . Former Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas suggested Ramsey had regressed while talking on Sky Sports . When asked if he felt the comments were unfair during the announcement of his squad to face Belgium next Sunday, Coleman said: 'Yes. Charlie Nicholas is paid to give his opinion as a pundit but it is not as black and white as that. It can't be. 'Charlie was a player himself. No player plays well in every game and every month and Charlie should know that. They have good spells and bad spells. 'If Aaron is not at his best at the minute then the next game or the week or two weeks after he will be at his best. 'Aaron has played a lot of games for us where he has dictated the tempo of the game at both ends of the pitch. If you can do that you have got to be a good player. 'For me I am just glad he is playing. And I know Aaron, he needs to keep playing and playing regularly, that is when we see the best of him.' Ramsey in action for Arsenal against Anderlecht - the Gunners threw away a three-goal lead to draw . Ramsey grimaces in pain on the ground during the Champions League match at the Emirates . Ramsey is one of eight players heading to Brussels having recovered from injury, a list that also includes defenders James Collins, Paul Dummett and Adam Matthews. But it is in midfield where Coleman's squad has received the biggest boost with Wigan midfielder Emyr Huws and playmaker Jonny Williams, who limped off after a star display against Bosnia-Herzegovina, returning to the fold along with Ramsey and Joe Allen. 'We've rarely had Allen and Ramsey together,' Coleman said. 'It is nice to have Ramsey back and Joe had a good game against Real Madrid and did very well. Two players of that calibre are going to improve any squad, we know that, so it is very good to have them back. 'I thought Liverpool played fantastically and Joe was at the heart of it so that was pleasing to see.' Wales can also welcome back Joe Allen to their team for the qualifier with Brussels next weekend . West Ham's James Collins (left) is also ready to return to the Wales fold after missing out last time . Also on board is Fulham boss Kit Symons, despite Coleman's reservations that the Wales assistant manager may forgo his international commitments to focus on the Cottagers having been handed the reigns at Craven Cottage. 'Kit is on the trip,' Coleman said. 'I had a conversation with him about whether he'd be carrying on and I thought maybe he wouldn't and I didn't want to lose him. 'He doesn't want to not be here, he wants to carry on. He spoke with the Fulham chairman (Shahid Khan), who has been very supportive, so it is very positive.' The one area where Coleman's 25-man group looks particular light is up front. Kit Symons is set to continue with his Wales duties despite being appointed manager of Fulham . They may have the world's most expensive player of all time in Gareth Bale, but he is joined by four forwards with just 28 caps between them due to injuries to Simon Church, who started all three previous Euro 2016 qualifiers, and Burnley's Sam Vokes. Coleman said: 'It is a shame for Churchy. We knew we were going to miss big Sam with his injury. 'We have the man Baley and then we've got some youth there in Tom Lawrence and George Williams, who are very exciting.'","Wales manager Chris Coleman has defended Aaron Ramsey from criticism .

"Peter Piot says it took '1,000 dead Africans' for the WHO to declare the Ebola outbreak an emergency . The scientist who discovered Ebola has slammed the World Health Organisation for taking too long to declare state of emergency over the recent outbreak in West Africa. Peter Piot said it took '1,000 dead Africans' before the WHO took the Ebola outbreak seriously, wasting precious time before acting appropriately. The Belgian microbiologist say that although the WHO knew about the outbreak three months after it started, it took them a further two months to declare a state of emergency. Professor Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was part of a team that discovered the Ebola virus in north west Zaire in 1976. 'It took three months for the WHO to find out there was an Ebola outbreak, that I understand. Guinea had a poor laboratory infrastructure,' he said in an interview with Talk to Al Jazeera, due to be aired on Saturday. 'I have much more of a problem with the fact that it took five months for WHO, for the international health regulations committee, for that's what it is, to declare this a state of emergency. 'It took 1,000 dead Africans and two Americans who were repatriated to the US because they were infected. 'There's no excuse for that. It took too long; we wasted too much precious time.' In October, the professor warned that the Ebola crisis had spiralled 'out of control'. Having waited too long to act, he believes the international community has then over-reacted in unhelpful ways. He added: 'There is an epidemic of Ebola in West Africa and then there is a second epidemic, an epidemic of mass hysteria that we saw particularly in North America. It was really out of proportion with the issue. Tragedy: The Ebola epidemic, the worst since the virus was first discovered in 1976, has now claimed 5,987 lives in West Africa, and 15 in other countries . Critique: Professor Piot,  who was part of a team that discovered the Ebola virus in north west Zaire in 1976, said 'there's no excuse' for the length of time it took the WHO to act, and that they 'wasted precious time' In October, the professor warned that the Ebola crisis had spiralled 'out of control' and that the crisis is unlikely to come to a halt until a vaccine is available to immunise the population. . 'In theory Ebola is very easy to control, but it has got completely out of hand,' he said, speaking at a seminar at Oxford University in October. 'This is no longer an epidemic, it is a humanitarian crisis.' While he predicted the epidemic could be over by this time next year, he said it will take years to help reconstruct the countries devastated by the virus. WHO recently claimed that around 6,000 people had died of the virus since the outbreak begun - and not 7,000 as was previously reported. All but around 15 of those deaths have hit the three countries at the heart of the crisis in West Africa - Guinea, where the outbreak began last December, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Taking action: U.S. President Barack Obama tours a lab with Dr. Nancy Sullivan to discuss Ebola while he visits the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland on Tuesday . Professor Piot claims solutions need to address not just the lack of healthcare systems in place in these countries but the local population’s cultural habits and belief systems. He highlights that some parts of West Africa have a habit of touching the dead at funerals - while others may believe in ‘witchcraft.’ He adds: 'The concept of an infectious agent is not always there. People may think it's witchcraft or a case of ""someone wanted me to die"". 'You need people who speak the language, who understand the culture, who know what people think and feel.' According to revised data, published this week by the WHO, the worst Ebola epidemic since the virus was first discovered in 1976, has now claimed 5,987 lives. Following Monday's correction, the WHO said that as of November 28, Guinea had recorded 2,155 cases and 1,312 deaths, Liberia saw 7,635 cases and 3,145 deaths while Sierra Leone reported 7,109 cases and 1,530 deaths. There have also been 15 fatalities in other countries, bringing the total to 6,002.","Peter Piot was part of a team that discovered Ebola virus in 1976 .

"Children from deprived areas of England are twice as likely to be obese as those living in more affluent parts of the country, according to new figures. The latest statistics for children aged 10 to 11 show that 24.7 per cent from low-income areas are obese, compared to 13.1 per cent in more affluent locations. While 9.5 per cent of four to five year olds are obese, that figure doubles to 19 per cent by the time children leave primary school. The data, published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, relates to the 2013/14 school year. Children living in deprived areas are more likely to be obese. In reception class children in Hackney had the highest rates of obesity (14.4%) while those in Windsor and Maidenhead had the lowest rates (5.5%). In year six rates ranged from 26.7% in Southwark to 11.1% in Richmond upon Thames . Eustace de Sousa, national lead for children, young people and families at Public Health England (PHE), described the figures - which are for children in state schools - as 'deeply concerning'. He said: 'We know that over a third of children leaving primary school are overweight or obese, which makes them much more likely to be overweight or obese as adults and considerably increases their risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems. 'Tackling obesity, and in particular childhood obesity, has always been a national priority for PHE.' In reception class, more than one in five (22.5 per cent) children were classified as overweight or obese, 0.3 per cent higher than in 2012-13. In year six, more than a third (33.5 per cent) were overweight or obese - a rise of 0.2 per cent from last year. Mr de Sousa said: 'Parents and carers can help their children maintain a healthy weight by following a balanced diet, keeping an eye on portion sizes and limiting sugary drinks and sugary or fatty snacks. 'Change4life offer simple, affordable recipes including family meals for £5 and ideas on small swaps families can make to their diets, like swapping sugary drinks for diet or sugar free versions, water or lower fat milk, to remove excess calories. 'Children also need a minimum of 60 minutes of exercise each day, which can be achieved in one session or through shorter bursts of 10-minute activity.' Eustace de Sousa, national lead for children, young people and families at Public Health England (PHE), described the figures - which are for children in state schools - as 'deeply concerning'. (File picture) The local authority with the highest obesity rate for reception aged children was Hackney (14.4 per cent), while Windsor and Maidenhead was the lowest (5.5 per cent). In year six, obesity rates ranged from 26.7 per cent in Southwark to 11.1 per cent in Richmond upon Thames. The prevelance of obesity was found to be higher for boys in both year groups. In reception, 9.9 per cent of boys and 9 per cent of girls were classified as obese, while in year six the rate was 20.8 per cent for boys and 17.3 per cent for girls. Meanwhile the overall prevalence of underweight children was lower in reception (0.9 per cent) than in year six (1.4 per cent).","New figures reveal 24.7% of children aged 10 to 11 from low-income areas are obese, compared to 13.1% from more affluent locations .

"David Beckham’s plans to bring a Major League Soccer team to Miami are moving in the right direction despite claims from the league’s commissioner that the process ‘can’t go on forever’. Beckham revealed almost a year ago that he would exercise his option to become the owner of a new MLS franchise in Miami, but has since had two plans for a 25,000-seat stadium rejected. ‘The reality is that everything if progressing very well,’ said a spokesperson for Beckham Miami United on Wednesday. Former England captain David Beckham poses with wife Victoria at the London Theatre Awards last month . Beckham poses with Brazilian legend Pele ahead of the World Cup final between Germany and Argentina . Former England captain Beckham unveils his plans to bring a franchise to Miami earlier this year . ‘Miami is still David's No 1 choice and it will happen. The fans and the people of Miami are behind us and we hope to announce some positive and exciting news soon.’ Don Garber, the MLS commissioner, had earlier refused to discuss whether Beckham's option could be switched to another city, said: 'It is a private discussion and relationship as it relates to the specific option and I am not going to get into those details, but by all means this is not something that can last forever.' The MLS board of governors will hear a report from the league's expansion committee on Saturday and Garber indicated that they would aim to make some decisions on new franchises in the first half of 2015. The league will grow to 20 teams in 2015 with the addition of New York City FC and Orlando City FC followed by Atlanta and a second LA-based team in 2017. Garber said MLS is looking to add at least three more clubs by the end of the decade and that he recently held talks with groups from Minnesota, Sacramento and Las Vegas. 'We have also been in discussions with San Antonio, El Paso and St. Louis, they are just not as far along for the next round,' said Garber. Beckham in his pomp for Manchester United and England - he made 115 appearances for his country . The commissioner said, however, that Miami remained a goal for the league -- but only if the right venue is found. 'I believe Miami can become a great MLS market if we can put the pieces in place,' said Garber. 'The (Beckham) group continues to work to try and find a stadium solution that they believe will put them in a position to succeed. That is a difficult process and it is one that they continue to work hard on.' Although politicians having blocked Beckham's two proposed waterfront venues, Garber says he won't be putting direct pressure on elected representatives to help the former England and Manchester United star. 'We are not putting pressure on anybody. What we do is we communicate to the public and their representatives what is necessary for us to be successful and ultimately ensure that David can exercise his option in Miami. 'They are well aware of it now and there is not much more really that we can do now and we are not asked to do much more.'","Don Garber, the MLS commissioner, says process 'can't go on forever'

Authorities noted that the door had a lock at the top, out of reach of the teenager, and another child at the home said Sells would lock the door 'during the day and nights'. The child told authorities that they would sometimes see the girl's fingers reaching around the door, in an apparent attempt to get out, the documents said. Everything inside the room was covered with feces and blood, authorities said. The gruesome conditions were unearthed after concerned relatives took the girl to hospital on Monday and doctors contacted authorities. They then executed a search warrant at the home. When the girl was taken to St. Vincent Hospital in Anderson, she was covered in feces and weighed just 35lb. She was then flown to Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in Indianapolis for treatment. 'Cruel': Sells was granted custody of the children in 2009 when their mother abandoned them . Together: The couple, pictured at their wedding six years ago, claimed that the girl was in the room before she was dangerous and had approached Sells with a knife. The girl is mentally disabled, police said . When police arrived, they said the girl was so thin that bones were protruding from her skin. 'If you see pictures of the victim, it's very disturbing,' Sgt. Joel Sandefur said told the Indy Channel. 'We wouldn't accept treatment of an animal that way, let alone a human being, a 15-year-old girl.' The teenager and a four-year-old child moved in with the couple when their mother abandoned them four years ago, according to the court documents. The older girl, whose grandfather said suffers from a chromosome problem in her brain, was kept locked up inside the room by Steve Sells, according to his wife of six years. She had not been to the doctors or to school in two years, the Indy Channel reported. He told authorities he locked her in the room to protect himself, claiming that the 35lb girl was strong and had previously approached him with a knife. The Department of Child Services asked for a court hearing regarding custody of the girl in 2011, Fox59 reported. Scene: Sells allegedly locked his granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom without enough heat. When detectives searched the house, they found a mattress, a bucket and a bowl of oatmeal in the bedroom . 'I think they were asking for court intervention for them to be permitted to take the child out of that environment or to get services and the court did not permit that to happen at that time,' said Prosecutor Cummings - but the child ultimately stayed at the home. A spokesperson for DCS would not speak about the case citing confidentiality laws but confirmed the agency had received a report about the family at the Indiana Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline. Neighbor Thomas McAllister told said that Sells and his wife lived at the home with their three children. He said that Sells had always given the impression he was a caring father. 'That is mind boggling,' he added. 'That is just disgusting and no child should have to go through anything like that.' Both of the Sells now face charges of neglect of a dependent and battery and Steve Sells also faces a charge for criminal confinement.

"This is the touching yet awkward moment nine pairs of students were asked to kiss on camera - despite having never met before. The clip shows the 18 pupils greet each other for the first time followed by a few seconds of small talk before they go in for their first embrace and snog. Despite having a reputation for being promiscuous on student nights, the shy smiles and laughs clearly show these students are not accustomed to kissing strangers - one lady even walks away mid-smooch. Scroll down for video . First kiss: This montage shows pictures of 18 Bristol students kissing strangers on camera . The video, produced by the University of Bristol TV station, UBTV, and directed by Gemma Wilson, echos similar footage by Los Angeles-based filmmaker Tatia Pilieva in March in which 20 strangers were asked to lock lips on screen. However, the way the British students react is somewhat more awkward than their American counterparts. Station manager Will Pope was on hand to help out with producing and editing the UK clip, but declined to take part. Will, a third year Classical Studies student, said: 'When Gemma came to me with the idea for the shoot, I really wanted to get involved with the project. Nice to meet you: Two strangers prepare to kiss as part of a Bristol student's project . It wasn't that bad! The footage shows the pair kissing, left, and their reactions after their first smooch, right . Well, this is awkward! One of the female students doesn't look too happy about the prospect of snogging a stranger - although he looked pretty happy about it . Off they go! The pair embrace but the girl still looks less than impressed afterwards and grimaces, right . Ready? Despite having a reputation for being promiscuous, the awkward smiles and laughs clearly show these students are not accustomed to kissing strangers . Hands on: This couple seem to be enjoying their first-ever kiss despite initial awkwardness . How did he find it? This young man's body language suggests he found the whole process uncomfortable . 'It was quite a tense atmosphere in the studio - a lot of the participants weren’t at home in front of the camera which may have been a bit daunting. 'I was asked to star in the video but I said no. All the students were volunteers, who knew exactly what they would be asked to do. 'It was great fun, and the footage we got was really heart-warming. Their reactions are so human.' Hello there! The video, which these two students star in, was produced by the University of Bristol TV station . Tender: The duo get stuck into their kiss and the woman even manages to place a hand on her partner's arm . Round two? The girl seemingly makes a mad dash but her partner looks ready for more . Getting into it: Nine pairs of strangers, including these two men, were asked to kiss on camera . Reaction: One of the men looks happy about his first kiss with the stranger, who looks downtrodden . The video is a tribute to a similar idea by US filmmaker Tatia Pilieva who filmed 20 models meeting and kissing for the first time. But the Bristol students steal the show with their sheer awkwardness, firmly putting to bed the rumour that students are well-versed in kissing strangers. One girl even walks off mid-way through the kiss, while most of the pairs ended up just smiling and laughing about the whole ordeal. Preparing: A spokesperson for student newspaper The Tab said: 'Nobody knows where to put their hands at any point' but this couple seem to, right . Something funny? The couple seem to find their first kiss hilarious . She doesn't look too happy about it! This woman seems a little reluctant to get stuck in . Awkward? The female student still seems hesitant mid-kiss, while the man just can't let go . Another girl complimented her new partner, by saying 'not bad' after their first embrace. A spokesperson for student newspaper The Tab said: 'Nobody knows where to put their hands at any point. 'Some of the people seemed way too keen to get their tongue in there, and from our experience it isn’t actually that shocking to ask a student to make out with a complete stranger, it happens all the time.' Before and after: It seems a random smooch wasn't so bad for this pair, whose hands linger after locking lips . Au natural: Some of the couples make the whole experience look easy . Oh no! This chap doesn't look too happy about having to kissed a stranger . Woah!

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1) Gareth Barry has his own way of answering the group of Aston Villa fans who have booed him since he left in 2009. Everton’s 3-0 success at Goodison on Saturday took his record against the club where he made 441 appearances in nearly 12 years to seven wins from nine Premier League matches – with a goal difference of 19-4. The 33-year-old rubbed it in with yet another man-of-the-match display, covering more miles than any player on the pitch and finding a team mate with 81 of his 86 passes. Gareth Barry rubbed it in the Aston Villa fans' faces with a man-of-the-match performance for Everton . 2) It’s not a coincidence that Joe Hart has saved three of the last five penalties he’s faced – the Manchester City goalkeeper does his homework. Roberto Soldado had put four of his last five successful penalties to the goalkeeper’s bottom right hand corner – exactly where England No 1 Hart dived to keep out the Tottenham striker’s effort on Saturday. Joe Hart had done his homework and that is why he saved Roberto Soldado's penalty for Tottenham . 3) Harry Redknapp has always prided himself on passing football but his current QPR side are even struggling on that score. For all the problems they caused Liverpool their accuracy rate of just 68.8 per cent was the lowest of any Premier League team all weekend. Maybe that’s why they are struggling so badly to score – five of their six Premier League goals this season have now come from set-pieces. Harry Redknapp's QPR side are struggling in the Premier League, and cannot keep possession . 4) Mohamed Diame has four goals in five games for Hull now – as many as he scored in 41 appearances for West Ham in the whole of last season. But it’s not just putting the ball in the net where he looks a different player. Against Arsenal he was a huge influence in midfield, winning nine tackles and involved in 22 duels for the ball – more than any other Premier League player all weekend. Mohamed Diame (left) celebrates his goal against Arsenal and has scored four in five games for Hull . 5) Slightly built Tottenham youngster Tom Carroll, tiny in Premier League terms at just 5ft 9in, could have picked an easier place than Stoke to make his Premier League debut for Swansea after joining them on loan for the season. But the 22-year-old rose well to the challenge, giving the ball away only five times during his 65 minutes. The 5.4 miles he ran was a fraction further than striker Wilfried Bony managed in 90. Boss Garry Monk likens him to former Swans midfielder Joe Allen, and the way he stood up to 6ft 4in opponent Steven Nzonzi shows promise for the future. Tom Carroll (right) stood up well to the giants of Stoke City for Swansea and tackles Mame Biram Diouf . 6) Steven Taylor is refusing to give up on staying at Newcastle – even though the club tried to sell him in the summer and his contract runs out in seven months time. The 29-year-old defender, picked for the first time since a 0-0 draw at Aston Villa in August, played a huge role in keeping Leicester to only three attempts at goal. In four appearances including Capital One Cup ties this season, passionate Geordie Taylor has finished on the winning side three times. Steven Taylor impressed against Leicester and here he muscles out Marc Albrighton . 7) New Huddersfield manager Chris Powell’s biggest problem in the next week could be persuading Wigan to extend the month’s loan of Grant Holt, which is due to run out. Powell had taken one point from three games before Holt turned up, now the 4-2 win over Blackpool means he’s got 10 from the four matches in which the 33-year-old has played. Meanwhile, Wigan boss Uwe Rosler, who hadn’t picked Holt for a Championship game all season, has not won a single match of four with his team scoring only two goals. Chris Powell's Huddersfield are impressing, but he will struggle to keep Grant Holt on loan . 8) Felix Magath’s team selection during his time at Fulham was constantly bizarre – the German never named an unchanged side in his 20 games in charge and fans started playing ‘Felix bingo’ trying to guess the next line-up. That’s all changed since Kit Symons has taken over – bringing Sean Kavanagh into his defence in place of the injured Fernando Amorebieta was only the fourth change he’s made in six games as caretaker. Small wonder that Symons, the popular choice to stay in charge at Craven Cottage, has overseen four wins in that time. Kit Symons is keeping things simple at Fulham - he has made just four changes in six games and it's working . 9) John Gregory signed 11 new players for Crawley in the summer and has got another four on loan – but the wholesale changes are taking time to have an effect. A 5-3 thrashing at Notts County meant the former Aston Villa and QPR boss, who hadn’t managed in England for six years before he took over the League One club, has seen his side ship nine goals in two games. Gregory called it ‘embarrassing’ and admitted his players got bullied. Crawley are 15th in the table – exactly where they were when he took over last December. Garry Thompson (right) celebrates his hat-trick goal for Notts County against 'embarrassing' Crawley . 10) Phil Brown must have looked with envy at how Ronald Koeman followed up collecting a manager of the month award. While Southampton boss Koeman celebrated the honour by watching his side spank Sunderland 8-0, Brown has seen his Southend side crash since he won the League Two prize for four wins out of five in September. Since then the Shrimpers have struggled – the 1-1 draw at Exeter was their first point in three games and there’s a tough trip to Newport to come on Tuesday night.","Gareth Barry was man of the match for Everton against his former club .

"Arsenal club captain Thomas Vermaelen is putting all talk of his future on hold as he turns his attention to Saturday's FA Cup final against Hull. The 28-year-old Belgium defender made 14 Barclays Premier League appearances as the Gunners secured a top-four finish and another season of Champions League football. Vermaelen, who played in the penalty shoot-out victory over Wigan in the semi-final, will be hoping to be involved against Hull this weekend despite requiring five stitches in a knee injury suffered at Norwich on the final day of the league campaign. Bigger prospect: Thomas Vermaelen says his focus is on the FA Cup final against Hull City this weekend . Summer switch? The Arsenal captain's future has been doubted in recent weeks . If he does play, it could prove to be his last appearance for Arsenal as he strives to find first-team football with just one year left on his contract. But Vermaelen is keen to keep his mind trained only on delivering the FA Cup to the Emirates Stadium and end a nine-year run without silverware for Arsene Wenger's side. 'It is not important at the moment, my future,' he said. 'We are in front of an FA Cup Final and my focus is there. My future is not important at the moment. 'We know there has been a lot of talk about not winning a trophy for a long time and so for us it would be important to win the final.' Memories of a 1-0 League Cup final defeat to Birmingham in 2011 will no doubt weigh heavily on the minds of Arsenal supporters leading into another showepiece game where they enter as the firm favourites. Vermaelen missed the shock loss two years ago due to a long-standing Achilles issue and does not want to be recollecting that time in the run-in to the meeting with Hull. Big test: Arsene Wenger is looking to end a nine-year trophy drought at Wembley . 'The whole time was difficult for me, to be out injured for such a long time,' he said. 'Missing big games like finals was never easy. I was at Wembley, I was in the stands. It's a long time ago but it was a very disappointing result and everybody knows that. 'We can't think about it. Saturday is a different game again. There are a lot of changes in the team since then - a lot of players left since then - but we have to make sure it doesn't happen again. 'Every final is something special, something different. Of course, that happened but that's the past and we have to make sure that doesn't happen again.' Loving life: Vermaelen and Aaron Ramsey have fun on Rudiemental's DJ decks at Arsenal's Charity ball . Although Vermaelen is looking to avoid a repeat of the Birmingham defeat, when Obafemi Martins capitalised on a defensive error to score a late winner, he knows Arsenal's players will be competing under immense pressure to finally deliver another trophy. 'There will always be pressure for a cup final,' he added. 'The players are used to playing under pressure because if you play for a club like Arsenal, you have to win every single game. People expect that so Saturday won't be different. The pressure will be there always to win that game. 'We are used to the pressure, every game has to be won. Of course we know that there has been a lot of talk of not winning for nine years but it is a game we have to win. 'We know there is a lot at stake as well but we go in with a lot of confidence.'","Thomas Vermaelen has been linked with a move away from Arsenal .

"Mind-bending ‘psychotronic’ guns that can effectively turn people into zombies have been given the go-ahead by Russian president Vladimir Putin. The futuristic weapons – which will attack the central nervous system of their victims – are being developed by the country’s scientists. They could be used against Russia’s enemies and, perhaps, its own dissidents by the end of the decade. Fire: Putin, seen using a traditional pistol, has new weapons in his sights . Sources in Moscow say Mr Putin has described the guns, which use electromagnetic radiation like that found in microwave ovens, as ‘entirely new instruments for achieving political and strategic goals’. Mr Putin added: ‘Such high-tech weapons systems will be comparable in effect to nuclear weapons, but will be more acceptable in terms of political and military ideology.’ Plans to introduce the super- weapons were announced quietly last week by Russian defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov, fulfilling  a little-noticed election campaign pledge by president-elect Putin. Plans to introduce the super- weapons were announced quietly last week by Russian defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov . Mr Serdyukov said: ‘The development  of weaponry based on new physics principles – direct-energy weapons, geophysical weapons, wave-energy weapons, genetic weapons, psychotronic weapons, and so on – is part  of the state arms procurement programme for 2011-2020.’ Specific proposals on developing the weapons are due to be drawn  up before December by a new Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. Research into electromagnetic weapons has been secretly carried out in the US and Russia since the Fifties. But now it appears Mr Putin has stolen a march on the Americans. Precise details of the Russian gun have not been revealed. However, previous research has shown that low-frequency waves or beams can affect brain cells, alter psychological states and make it possible to transmit suggestions and commands directly into someone’s thought processes. High doses of microwaves can damage the functioning of internal organs, control behaviour or even drive victims to suicide. Anatoly Tsyganok, head of the Military Forecasting Centre in Moscow, said: ‘This is a highly serious weapon. ‘When it was used for dispersing a crowd and it was focused on a man, his body temperature went up immediately as if he was thrown into a hot frying pan. Still, we know very little about this weapon and even special forces guys can hardly cope with it.’ The long-term effects are not known, but two years ago a former major in the Russian foreign intelligence agency, the GRU, died in Scotland after making claims about such a weapons programme to MI6. Sergei Serykh, 43, claimed he was a victim of weapons which he said were ‘many times more powerful than in the Matrix films’. Mr Serykh died after falling from a Glasgow tower block with his wife and stepson in March 2010. While his death was assumed to be suicide, his family fear there was foul play. Last night the Ministry of Defence declined to comment.",Could be used against Russia's enemies and perhaps its own dissidents .
"A worshiper found his prayers for financial security were answered at Jerusalem's sacred Western Wall. The man discovered an envelope containing $500m of cheques stuffed into one of its cracks of the holy landmark. The iconic wall in Israel's capital has for centuries been a focal point for worshipers of numerous religions, who tuck slips of paper with prayers written on them into the historic structure. Holy site: Worshipers pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem . The envelope, discovered on Wednesday, was filled with more than 500 signed cheques - some written for $1m. Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who oversees the wall, said most of them were Nigerian, with some from Europe, Asia and the United States. But the cheques were not addressed to anyone and would most likely bounce if someone attempted to cash them in. The worshiper handed the envelope to police, via a lawyer. Officers are investigating whether the cheques are forgeries. Pilgrimage: U.S. president Barrack Obama leaves a prayer in the wall . Rabbi Rabinowitch said he has found cheques, mainly written by worshipers from Africa, in the wall's charity box before, but all them bounced. He told New York Daily News he believes who ever left the $500m of cheques was well intentioned and thinks he 'wanted to give all they had to the creator of the universe.' The Western Wall is located in Jerusalem's Old City at the Temple Mount and is one of the most sacred sites in Judaism. It is part of an ancient wall which surrounded the Temple's courtyard and is believed to have been built in 19BC, with much of structure now lying below street level.

"Addiction to prescription drugs is so rife that more Britons die from taking painkillers and tranquillisers than heroin and cocaine. There were 807 fatal overdoses involving prescription drugs last year, a rise of 16 per cent in five years, official figures show. By comparison, there were 718 such deaths from taking heroin and cocaine, and numbers have been falling since 2005. Experts have warned that GPs give out repeat prescriptions too easily and there is not enough  support for addicts. Addiction: Deaths from prescription medication last year outstripped those from cocaine and heroin . One helpline has calculated there are at least 32,000 painkiller addicts in Britain, but even that is likely to be an underestimate. Jim Dobbin, Labour MP and chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on involuntary tranquilliser addiction, has called on the Government to take urgent action. He said: ‘This can be long-term addiction and there is very little support for addicts. There needs to be more understanding of how serious this problem is. ‘Lives are being destroyed and people are being left without the help and support they need. The Government has refused to accept the scale of the problem.’ Concern: MP Jim Dobbin has called for greater support for those affected by painkiller addiction . One GP has claimed that doctors are prescribing antidepressants ‘too easily’ – including in some cases for bereavement – when they should offer patients counselling. Dr Des Spence, who practises in Glasgow, said: ‘There has been this rising culture of intervention with medication – whether it is for depression or anxiety or pain – and I think it can be very unhelpful. ‘It can erode people’s sense of wellbeing. The cure of these things is not necessarily in the gift of medicine.’ The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show that deaths from abuse of strong painkillers and tranquillisers have been rising steadily, while those from opiates used for recreational purposes have declined. Separate NHS statistics reveal that around 62million prescriptions were written for all types of painkillers last year, a 30 per cent rise in five years. Britons also spend an estimated £500million a year buying painkillers at chemists. Campaigners are particularly concerned at the high numbers of women becoming addicted to drugs prescribed by doctors. Cathryn Kemp, 42, an author, became hooked on the painkiller fentanyl in 2007 after being given it for inflammation of the pancreas. Although the drug is 50 times more powerful than heroin, she says she was not given any warnings about addiction. Danger: Many patients are not told that powerful painkillers can become addictive . Miss Kemp said: ‘The pain was like being eaten alive and it was the first medicine that took it away. It was like sinking into a lovely warm bath. ‘I was fighting a daily battle against pain and I found something that helped me in that battle. It took only a few months before I crossed that line between keeping to my prescription and taking more. I ended up on something I could just not get off.’ Miss Kemp, who has written a book, Painkiller Addiction: From Wreckage to Redemption, was initially prescribed eight pills a day, but later took up to 45 a day. Although her GP confronted her about her addiction he continued writing out the prescriptions.In 2010 she was forced to sell her Brighton home to pay for rehab and is no longer addicted. She said: ‘There are so many people who are on sleeping pills, antidepressants, tranquillisers and strong painkillers. We are a medicated nation.’","807 people died overdosing on prescription drugs last year, figures reveal .

"More than 300 workers at luxury fashion label Mulberry's handbag factory are being screened for tuberculosis after two workers came down with the lung condition. Staff at the brand's plant in Shepton Mallet in Somerset now face an anxious wait to see if they too have caught the disease, which can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The most common symptoms of the infection include a persistent cough, weight loss and if left untreated, it can be fatal. Leather workers inside the Mulberry factory in Shepton Mallet in Somerset. More than 300 are now being tested for TB after two staff members were diagnosed with the condition . Staff at the brand's plant, pictured, now face an anxious wait to see if they too have caught the disease . According to the Sun, two employees at the factory were diagnosed with the condition but were now back working at the plant. It is thought one worker was confirmed as having TB in January, while another was diagnosed in May. This prompted Mulberry to test the rest of their workforce at the Somerset factory for the condition and send letters to all 300 staff on advice from Public Health England as TB may not show symptoms for several years. A spokesperson told the newspaper: 'Mulberry has fully complied with Public Health England advice on this.' Supermodel Cara Delevingne, pictured, fronts the advertising campaign for Mulberry and is set to launch her own collection with them next month . As part of a promotional film for her collection, Miss Delevingne visited the factory in Somerset in June, where she was seen using one of the sewing machines . It is thought that anyone else who tests positive for the condition will be referred to specialist doctors with Public Health England adding that it is very much now a curable disease, which can be treated. TB almost disappeared from the UK by the early 1970s thanks to the BCG vaccination and antibiotics. However, cases are now on the rise, which is being blamed on increased immigration from Eastern Europe where TB is more common. British label Mulberry has long been the handbag of choice for many A-list celebrities including Kate Winslet and Sienna Miller. Their ad campaigns are fronted by supermodel Cara Delevingne, who visited the Somerset factory in June ahead of launching her own collection for the brand. In a film released ahead of the collection, it shows the 21-year-old visiting the archives, choosing leathers, sketching ideas and discussing the practical needs she had for a multi-functional bag. She was also shown at the affected flagship factory using the sewing machines, discussing her designs and smelling the leather on a newly made Mulberry satchel. Tuberculosis - or TB - killed one in four people during Victorian times but was almost wiped out in Britain by the 1970s. Less crowded living conditions in the 20th Century cut infection. Administration of the BCG vaccine from the 1920s, the discovery of antibiotics in 1928 and the introduction of the antibiotic streptomycin also helped. But there has been a dramatic rise in cases recently, especially in and around London, where 40 per cent of all TB cases are detected. In 2011, 8,963 cases of TB were reported in the UK. There is fear that the disease may spread further, due to a combination of foreign immigrants infected with TB coming to the UK, increased travel abroad, and hospital staff who are not trained to spot the disease from early symptoms. Tuberculosis is a communicable disease caused by infection with the tubercle bacillus (also known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. tuberculosis), most frequently affecting the lungs. These tiny bacteria are usually passed on through mucus in the same way as colds are passed on, such as when people sneeze, talk or cough. The bacillus can remain active in the air for several hours in confined warm spaces such as planes and the London Underground . A cure for TB was developed more than 50 years ago, but it is still one of the top three killer diseases in the world, along with malaria and HIV. An untreated person with TB can spread the disease to ten to 15 people each year.","Workers being screened for the disease which can be spread through the air .

"Constant sexual abuse, neglect, beaten and starved: this was the horrific treatment children living at Australia's oldest yoga ashram were forced to endure, a royal commission examining child sex abuse at a NSW Satyananda Ashram has heard. A woman has told the enquiry she was sexually abused by Satyananda Sarswati - the man who founded the worldwide yoga movement with branches across the world, including Australia. In a statement to a royal commission, Bhakati Manning said she was abused by two senior swamis in ashrams in Australia and 'by the spiritual founder of Satyananda yoga'. Shishy (centre), the partner of Swami Akhandananda Saraswati, at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram, in the foothills of Mangrove mountain in New South Wales in the 1980s.  A royal commission is examining how the retreat handled sex abuse complaints against Swami Akhandananda Saraswati who ran the NSW Central Coast compound . Commissioner Justice Jennifer Coate (pictured) during the opening address at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse public hearing  into the Satyananda Yoga Ashram at Mangrove Mountain . She said the abuse happened when she was 15 at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram on NSW's Central Coast. She was 17 when she travelled to the famous Munger ashram in India in 1976 to study with the respected yogi whom she had met in Australia. Ms Manning said shortly after her arrival, he fondled her genitals and said something to the effect 'this is our relationship, don't tell anyone'. He also taught her how to tie her dhoti - a traditional garment - so that it tucked between her legs. He said something to the effect of 'you have to protect what is mine from being seen', she said in her statement. The world-renowned yoga master died in 2009. Ms Manning, now aged 55, will continue her evidence on Thursday, the third day of a hearing where six witnesses have told of being abused. Several witnesses have also told the enquiry, the swami forced them to have sex and Shishy (pictured centre) was often present . Constant sexual abuse, neglect, beaten and starved : this was the horrific treatment children living at Australia's oldest yoga ashram (pictured) were forced to endure, a royal commission examining child sex abuse has heard . The commission has already heard that Satyananda's disciple Swami Akhandananda, who was sent to lead the Mangrove Mountain ashram, used underage girls for sexual gratification. It also heard celibacy was a requirement at the ashrams and Akhandananda would beat people who were found to be having sex. Children were sent out on what one witness referred to as 'F*** patrols', to spy on couples and report back. Akhandananda was jailed for sex abuse in 1989, but the conviction was overturned on a technicality in 1991. He died in 1997. Witnesses whose parents brought them to the Mangrove ashram in search of a utopian life have told how they were subject to depraved sexual practices by Akhandananda, who often summoned them by loudspeaker or had his partner Shishy bring them to him. Commissioner Justice Jennifer Coate (pictured left) and Commissioner Helen Milroy (pictured right) during the opening address at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse public hearing  into the Satyananda Yoga Ashram at Mangrove Mountain . On Wednesday, one woman, referred to as APL at the commission, said facilities at the Mangrove ashram were basic, with children often going hungry. Their heads were shaved, they wore orange robes and were made to do hard labour. APL later discovered the Swami and Shishy had a hot tub, a television and drank alcohol. Several witnesses have also said the swami forced them to have sex and Shishy was often present. They also said Shishy would beat them. APL's sister also gave evidence on Wednesday, labelling an email sent by the ashram claiming a healing ceremony for victims last Easter was successful as an insult. She said it was particularly insulting that in the email the ashram was spouting rubbish about 'ego and embracing the darkness', because it was what Swami Akhandananda said when he was 'f***ing little girls and stealing people's lives'. Solicitor for the Mangrove ashram Aaron Keraghan apologised at the commission hearing on behalf of his clients and told two abuse victims on Wednesday the ashram would like to financially compensate them.","An enquiry into child sex abuse at Australia's oldest yoga ashram has found children were subjected to sexual abuse, starvation and neglect .

"She has such natural beauty, she could pass for a movie star. She smiles, her demeanour relaxed. In normal times, this young woman would surely have enjoyed a bright and happy future, perhaps with a  husband, children, grandchildren. But soon after this photograph was taken, she would face almost certain death. The haunting image is one of a series depicting Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland before they were rounded up to be sent to the gas chambers. Despite the awfulness of her predicament, this  Jewish woman manages to smile brightly for the camera as she poses for Jaeger . An elderly man with a yellow Star of David fixed to his chest, speaks with German officers as he and other Jews are rounded up in Kutno, German-occupied Poland in 1939 . Innocent victims: These young Jewish girls couldn't possibly have imagined the horrors that lay ahead as they pose outside their tent in another haunting photograph taken by the ardent Nazi Hugo Jaeger . The clue is the curled-up piece of  yellow cloth the unknown woman wears on her lapel – a makeshift Star of David. All around her, and in other photos taken in the ghetto into which the Nazis corralled their prisoners, every man, woman and child was forced to wear one. In peacetime, the six-pointed star was a proud symbol of Judaism. In the Holocaust which Hitler was about to unleash – here in the devastated town of Kutno – it would become their death-star. The remarkable colour images were taken by the Führer’s personal photographer, a loyal follower given unprecedented access to the Third Reich’s elite. Hugo Jaeger was allowed to travel with Hitler to record his appearances at rallies, intimate parties and in private moments. More usually he dedicated himself to lionising his leader and what the Nazis regarded as their most triumphant moments. Here, it appears, he seems simply to have been fascinated by faces from a different faith in a country under siege. He is said not to have shared  Hitler’s unqualified hatred of Jews. Hence, whether he intended it or not, Jaeger’s camera captured an atmosphere rarely seen before horror and carnage overtook it. Ghetto boys: In their tattered rags the two boys smile for the camera, but the man in the centre, most probably their father, has a look of distrust etched across his face . While most Jaeger's photographs focus on the glory and . triumphalism of the Reich, here he . has chosen instead to capture the misery of the conquered people instead . With their clean clothes and hair neatly coiffured, these three young . women do not, at first glance, appear anything like Jaeger's other subjects. But look closer and . you find a star of David on the coat of the girl on the left . After so many years, it is impossible . to know for certain why so many people in the photographs are smiling. None appears to have been forced to pose, none seems to display any . fear. The trilby-hatted man in the coat with . a fur collar, for example, seems quite comfortable in the company of . German officers. Children in the squalor of a tented village appear . unperturbed by the photographer. Yet Kutno, 75 miles west of Warsaw, had . been bombarded and turned into a ghetto soon after Hitler’s invasion in . September 1939. Its sugar factory would be  surrounded by barbed wire and used to imprison 8,000 Jews, crammed into appalling conditions. Some would die of infection or starvation. Others would not live through the bitter cold of the winter. The ghetto existed until 1942, when most of its surviving inhabitants were sent to death camps.

A young woman clutches a jug as she escorts an elderly Jewish man through the Kutno Ghetto in early 1940 . It is highly unlikely any of the people in these images survived. Incredibly, the photographs did. The Kutno ghetto was ‘liquidated’ as . part of the Final Solution in the spring of 1942.  In 1945, as the .

So after secreting them, initially in a . leather suitcase, he buried them in airtight glass jars outside Munich, . returning from time to time to check they were safe. Two decades after the war ended, he sold them to Life magazine. Now the pictures have gone online at . Life.com. Despite attempts to identify some of the subjects, no record . was ever found of the smiling young woman. Historians said it would be astonishing if she had survived.

"A 'phony' army ranger who was confronted at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday  by a decorated Afghanistan vet previously pleaded guilty to impersonating a police officer. Sean Yetman, 30, was spotted parading around Oxford Valley Mall dressed in camouflage fatigues and wearing military honors that he couldn't possibly have been awarded. A YouTube video of a confrontation between him and Ryan Berk, a Purple Heart recipient, who was immediately suspicious of Yetman's mismatched uniform has been watched more than 2.7 million times since it was posted on Friday. Scroll down for video . Sean Yetman, the 'phony' army ranger who was confronted at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday by a decorated Afghanistan vet, has previously pleased guilty to impersonating a police officer . Court documents show that in May 2003, Yetman pleaded guilty to impersonating a police officer . A Bucks County Court summary shows that in May 2003 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a public servant. Yetman has refused all offers to speak to the media since the incident, but his fiancée told Army Times that he has ‘spiraled into a deep depression’ since being exposed. Adrienne Lally said Yetman lost his job and has had a nervous breakdown. ‘The phone calls do not stop, and we are now hearing death threats. All of this has us concerned for our children and their safety,’ she wrote via email. ‘He is a good man with a very big heart and this backlash has spiraled him into a deep depression.’ Yetman is facing possible criminal charges after U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against Yetman. Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’ Berk said he gets 'frustrated' by people pretending to be army vets 'because you serve with good men who have either lost their loves or been seriously wounded who earned that uniform' Yetman, who insists on the video that he is who he says he is, may have been using the uniform as a means to obtaining military discounts at the mall. 'It’s frustrating, because you serve with good men who have either lost their loves or been seriously wounded who earned that uniform,' Berk told GMA on Wednesday about the incident. Along with an American flag patch in the wrong spot, Berk noticed that Yetman was wearing three Combat Infantryman Badges (CIBs) on his shoulder – an extremely rare honor. The latest incident came to light after Berk approached Yetman on Friday and used his cell phone to record their conversation as he quizzed him about his experiences as a soldier. When asked where he had received his CIBs, Yetman man first answered that he got all three in Afghanistan - an impossibility since only one is given per campaign. The conversation got more heated as Berk then called him a phony and accused him of impersonating a soldier. Yetman claimed he had 'literally just got home from Fort Lewis' and was shopping with his Sergeant Major - who he offered to introduce Berk to. When the man denied lying about his military service, Berk lost his cool. 'Here it is, stolen valor at its finest,' he shouted, as Yetman began to walk away. 'Why don’t you just admit you’re a phony?' ‘I noticed his combat infantryman's badge, he had two stars above it, which would indicate that he served in three different wars which is almost physically impossible for his age,’ said Berk. There is no U.S. Army Ranger with three CIBs named Yetman listed on any official record. Ryan Berk, a Afghanistan vet and Purple Heart recipient, was shopping at the mall with his girlfriend and her son when he spotted the 'fake' officer and decided to approach him . Speaking to Fox on Tuesday, Berk said that while the man had initially provided some answers that could have been correct, his story quickly unraveled when he claimed to have received his three CIBs from service in Afghanistan. 'I served in Afghanistan and have several friend who were seriously wounded and a couple who were killed in action who wore that same uniform and to see someone try and claim that type of sacrifice really irked me,’ said Berk. He also said his grandfather had served in World War 2 and it was ‘just wrong’ that this man was tainting that legacy by wearing the uniform. ‘No one is going to question a guy in uniform, unless they already wear the uniform,’ Berk, who earned a Purple Heart after he was wounded by shrapnel in 2010 while fighting in Afghanistan, told The Morning Call. Berk’s video of the confrontation was uploaded to the Stolen Valor YouTube account, where it has since been viewed over two million times. The account belongs to Guardian of Valor, a network of active and veteran soldiers who seek to expose people who falsely claim military service and/or claim unauthorized medals or tabs. On Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against Sean Yetman . Anthony Anderson, a vet who runs the Guardian of Valor website told Philly.com that fake soldiers are becoming increasingly common. Most are seeking attention and recognition, while others use the uniform to receive exclusive military discounts at stores and restaurants. Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’ It was unknown if the uniformed man received any special treatment from any store at the mall, but on Monday, U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) asked the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia to determine if there was evidence of a federal crime against 'Yetman' Berk has no doubts that the man he confronted was not a ranger. 'He's impersonating in the uniform people died for,' Berk added. 'He was wearing awards that I earned and he didn't.'","Sean Yetman, 30, was spotted dressed in camouflage fatigues and wearing military honors that he couldn't possibly have been awarded .

"Adolf Hitler's grand plans for the 'supercapital' of the Third Reich, which he intended to rename Germania, are detailed in a new exhibition. Staged in a vast Nazi bunker, 'The Myth of Germania: Vision and Crimes' features the 'Hall of the People' which was to be twice the size of St Peter's Basilica in Rome with room for 180,000 people. A giant map shows plans for a five-mile-long boulevard designed to be flanked by towering buildings celebrating Nazi prestige. Scroll down for video .

The new city was to be the biggest in the world with grand buildings, avenues and statues which Hitler proclaimed would last for 1,000 years. But due to the war, all that was realised of Hitler's plans for Berlin are huge street lights on an avenue leading up to the Brandenburg Gate. The Berlin exhibition reveals architect Albert Speer – who escaped the death penalty at the Nuremberg Trials after claiming not to know about the extermination of the Jews – was told to use Jewish slave labourers. He ordered evictions in the demolition zones so building could be completed quickly once Germany had won the war.

It is being staged in a vast bunker built by the Nazis in the Wedding district of Berlin which has become a tourist attraction in its own right. To meet demand for construction materials for 'Germania', Hitler, Speer and SS military commander Heinrich Himmler agreed to use concentration camp inmates as manpower. The SS built the world's largest brickworks in Oranienburg, a camp near Berlin where many inmates were murdered or died from the work.","Myth of Germania: Vision and Crimes exhibition is held in a Berlin bunker .

"Marouane Fellaini claims the reason he went down in pain during Tuesday's 2-1 win over Stoke was because he twisted his neck in an incident with  Oussama Assaidi.

"On a cold Friday night, there is nothing more tempting than a takeaway. But not only can these dishes wreak havoc on our waistlines, they can also damage our teeth, according to a leading dentist. Here, Dr Sameer Patel, a dentist at Harley Street’s Elleven practice, lays out the hidden dangers in the most popular takeaway foods.. Takeaways not only wreak havoc on a person's wasitline, they can also damage their teeth. Dr Sameer Patel, a leading dentist at Harley Street's Elleven practice, advises drinking water and flossing to keep teeth healthy . INDIAN AND CHINESE: TOOTH STAINING . It's not just dark beverages such as tea and coffee that will stain your teeth - any heavily pigmented food can lead to tooth discoloration - and curry powder is one such culprit. While this staple ingredient of Indian cuisine isn’t particularly dark, the deep pigment can stain teeth yellow over time. Dark liquids used to flavour foods, such as soy sauce, can produce the same effect. So if you do eat sushi or Chinese food, use the soy sauce sparingly. Indian and Chinese takeaways contain curry powder and soy source, dark pigments that can stain teeth over time. 'Anything that would stain a white T-shirt is likely to stain the surface of your teeth in the same way,' Dr Patel says. Eating broccoli or spinach can form a protective film over teeth . Dr Patel advises using the example of a white T-shirt: anything that would stain this is likely to stain the surface of your teeth in the same way. He also recommends eating an appetiser of spinach or broccoli first, as these green veggies form a protective film over teeth, making them less porous and susceptible to staining. Opting for lighter coloured condiments such as rice vinegar or lemon is also advisable, he says. KEBABS: JAW ACHE . Eating lots of chewy kebab meat can overwork the jaw, leading to jawache . Believe it or not, the foods you eat can have a big impact on the health of the joints in your jaw. As a result, the tough texture of the meat used for kebabs is sometimes associated with jaw ache. Eating a high amount of very chewy foods can overwork and overextend your jaw – leading to strains. ‘Any time you overuse a certain set of muscles, it can lead to contracted muscles and related pain, including headaches, and toothaches over time,' Dr Sameer explains. Most obviously, try limiting the number of problem foods you consume and be sure to distribute the way you chew your food evenly around the mouth. ITALIAN: ACID EROSION . Pizza and pasta are two of the most popular dishes in the UK and are rarely associated with tooth decay. However, white pizza bases and pastas are refined carbohydrates which contain simple sugars that dissolve quickly. This causes a surge of acid inside the mouth and when combined with the acidity of tomatoes, can erode tooth enamel and ultimately lead to sensitivity. These foods also take on a gummy consistency when chewed that can allow small particles to get trapped between teeth and stick to the surface. Flossing as part of your daily oral hygiene routine is the most effective way to remove trapped food and chewing sugar-free chewing gum can limit damage by making your mouth produce more saliva - helping to cancel out the acid in your mouth after eating or drinking. Pizza and pasta are refined carbohydrates and contain simple sugars that dissolve quickly in the mouth. This causes a surge of acid which erodes tooth enamel and causes sensitivity . FISH AND CHIPS: TOOTH DECAY . Starchy foods are notorious for getting stuck in between your teeth and lodged between crevices. While they may not necessarily taste sweet, the starches can begin converting to sugar almost immediately through the pre-digestive process that begins in the mouth. Processed foods are also notorious for using sugar as a preservative or flavour enhancer: ‘sugar can come in many different forms and the batter on fish and associated sauces such as ketchup, are culprits for having a high sugar content,' Dr Sameer said. While limiting sugar intake to meal times is not a cause for concern, snacking on starchy foods at regular intervals is what can cause problems. Dr Sameer advises rinsing your mouth with water after eating to help fight tooth decay. ‘This washes away trapped food, whilst the fluoride content fights against bacteria and prevents mineral loss in tooth enamel,' he said. Fish and chips are starchy foods that get stuck in between the teeth. They are converted to tooth-rotting sugar immediately through the mouth's pre-digestive processes . THAI: ENAMEL WEARING . The delicious sticky sauces and little nuts and seeds that you come across in most Thai dishes are very damaging to your tooth enamel. The small nuts and seeds tend to get stuck in between the teeth and are not easily rinsed away, so the sugars in them have longer to wear down your enamel, harming your teeth. To combat this, Dr Sameer Patel advises to floss afterwards and chew sugar-free chewing gum to dislodge the food residue. Do not brush straight after eating as this will cause the food residue to get further lodged in between the teeth and cause further damage.","Dr Sameer Patel is a dentist at Harley Street's Elleven practice .

Possibly the biggest day of the young cricketer's life, the 22-year-old was surrounded by his cricketing family at the Macksville Recreational Centre in Macksville in northern New South Wales on Wednesday. Wearing a navy blue suit and dark sunglasses, Abbott was supported by his girlfriend Brier Neil throughout the heart-wrenching service. Scroll down for video .

Abbott was the unfortunate player who delivered the bouncer that struck Hughes in the neck during the Sheffield Shield clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Tuesday. The 22-year-old has received overwhelming support from the entire cricket community including Hughes' own family who told Daily Mail Australia the day before the funeral on Tuesday that they were looking forward to seeing Abbott and embracing him with open arms. A family member expressed the empathy they felt Abbott's unbearable situation . 'We can't wait to see Sean Abbott tomorrow and give him a big kiss and hug,' the family member told Daily Mail Australia at the time. 'We just want to tell him it was freak accident and he cannot think he had anything to do with it. 'No one is blaming him. We want to hug him and tell him that everything is okay.'

'It's the whole squad that really needs everyone's support,' a spokeswoman for Cricket NSW told Daily Mail Australia. 'We want to keep supporting them as a group, there were a lot of Phillip's friends in the team,' she said. Late last week, friends and mentors at the Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-western Sydney institution where Abbott discovered his talent for cricket as a young boy, joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming-cricketer. When one of 'Sabs's' team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK, they said. Australia captain Michael Clarke pays tribute to Hughes during the funeral . The courageous young man returned to training on Tuesday with his New South Wales Blues team-mates .

'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by Tuesday's events. 'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, ""Don't worry about it, it's okay"".' Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke both consoled the devastated cricketer in the immediate aftermath of his friend's death. And they were far from alone.

"A small private plane that passed its Florida destination before crossing into Cuban airspace - and triggering a U.S. security alert - has crashed in the water off Jamaica twice asked permission to fly at a lower altitude before the pilot lost consciousness, it has emerged. Larry Glazer, a real estate developer in Rochester, New York, was seen slumped over the controls by a fighter jet sent to escort the plane. He and his entrepreneur wife Jane, both died in the crash. Their plane, which took off from New York on Friday morning, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida. It continued flying south for several hours at an altitude of 25,000 feet before entering Cuban airspace and heading towards the Caribbean, eventually crashing 14 miles North East of Port Antonio in Portland on Friday afternoon. In total, it traveled more than 1,700 miles. Scroll down for video . Killed: Rochester real estate developer Larry Glazer and his wife Jane, both 68, were aboard the aircraft that lost contact with air traffic controllers and flew 1,700 miles before crashing in the water off Jamaica . Experienced pilot: Glazer, 68, a father-of-three and a grandfather, is pictured in front of another small plane . Search party: Jamaican Marine Police return to the Port Antonio Marina after a fruitless search for a plane that crashed into the ocean near Port Antonio, Jamaica, Friday, Sept. 5, 2014 . Two fighter jets had been sent to the plane earlier on Friday after air traffic controllers were unable to make contact with the pilot. The jet pilots noted that Glazer was slumped over his controls, perhaps from oxygen deprivation. One of the fighter jet pilots said he could see the pilot of the small plane, a SOCATA TBM 700, which has a pressurized cabin, was still alive. 'I can see his chest rising and falling,' he said in a recording of his dispatch. 'Right before I left... we could see that he was actually breathing.' The plane also had 'frosted windows', an indication of a sudden loss of cabin pressure and officials said they suspected hypoxia - a deprivation of oxygen - could have caused them to pass out. According to ABC, the pilot requested to fly lower during two calls to air traffic control, however when they asked if he wanted to declare himself in a state of emergency, he said no. The plane was flying at 28,000 feet at 10 am when Glazer asked to descend to 18,000 feet because of an issue with the plane, ABC reported. He was cleared to drop to 25,000 feet but then asked to go lower. Air traffic control denied the second request because of the traffic traveling below Glazer. They said if he made a left turn he could bypass the traffic and descend. He made the turn, but then stopped responding. Route: Their single-engine plane, which was traveling from New York to Florida this morning, failed to land, entered Cuban airspace and headed towards the Caribbean. It crashed just off Jamaica on Friday . Site: The small plane eventually went down in the water 14 miles North East of Port Antonio in Portland . Killed: The turboprop was flown by Larry Glazer and his wife Jane Glazer of Rochester, New York. They were en route from Rochester to Naples, Florida . The unresponsive plane flown by Larry Glazer was a SOCATA TBM 700, a single-engine turbo-prop with a pressurized cabin that is used as a light business and utility aircraft. Seats: Seven including pilot and co-pilot . Max cruising speed: 345mph (300 knots) Max certificated altitude: 30,000ft . Wing span: 41 feet, 6 inches . Length: 34 feet, 9 inches . History: Built by American and French engineers. Been in production since 1988 but periodic upgrades have boosted its horsepower and speed . Production: More than 125 worldwide . The fighter jets that found the plane were eventually forced to break off once they entered Cuban airspace. They were in contact with Cuban authorities, who have said the aircraft did not violate its airspace rules. After passing Cuba, it reached the Caribbean where it crashed, Jamaican authorities said. A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 will search for the plane's wreckage, while Jamaica said a search and rescue team had been dispatched to the area. The plane, a Socata TBM-700 light business and utility aircraft, was registered to a development, Buckingham Properties, which is owned by Glazer. A company bio for Glazer notes: 'Larry spends some of his spare time on the ground - gardening around his house with his wife, Jane; and some in the sky - flying his plane.' An article about Glazer in the Rochester City Newspaper called him 'downtown's patron saint'. His company 'owns, co-owns, or manages nearly 13 million square feet of real estate space', it says. Response: Two F-15 fighter jets (file picture) were dispatched after the pilot of a private plane failed to respond but when he entered Cuban airspace, they were forced to break off . The Glazers were possibly affected by hypoxia, a condition where the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply in high-flying aircraft. If the cabin loses pressure and passengers don't use supplemental oxygen quickly, they can become unconscious or possibly die. When hypoxia develops slowly, symptoms can include light-headedness, tiredness, numbness, tingling and nausea. If it comes on quickly, it can cause confusion, behavioral chance, headaches, breathlessness, disorientation or heart palpitations. Jane Glazer was herself an entrepreneur, setting up and running QCI Direct, which delivers home care items through catalogs and websites. The couple, who met at camp at Seneca Lake when they were both counselors in 1964, had been married for more than 45 years and were considered stalwarts of the community. 'The City of Rochester has lost two heroes,' Mayor Lovely Warren and City Council President Loretta Scott said in a statement. 'It is difficult to put into words how much Larry Glazer has meant to our community. Larry worked hard to return a sense of vitality and excitement to our Center City. 'His efforts helped to lift our spirits and restore our sense of optimism. He has been a treasured friend and partner. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Glazer family, the partners and employees of Buckingham Properties, and all of Larry's many friends.'","Rochester real estate developer Larry Glazer, whose company owned the plane, and his wife Jane were both killed in the crash .

New design: The coin will be made from two types of metal, like the current £2 coin. And the Government will embed luminescent particles  that will show up under a particular light - making fakes easier to spot . Upgrade: Payphones, parking metres, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket self-service check-outs are among the roughly £1.2million machines that will need to be re-fitted . Payphones, parking metres, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket trolleys are among the devices that will need to be upgraded. Earlier this year, the Royal Mint suggested that the cost of converting these machines would be around £20million. But company chiefs have today disputed the amount - calculating that it could me more than five times as much. Jonathan Hilder, CEO of the Automatic Vending Association, estimated that forgeries make up some 3.03 per cent of the more than 1.5billion £1 coins in circulation. He said that increasingly sophisticated technology meant that coins were easier to fake - and that 50 per cent of these counterfeit coins successfully passed through vending machines. The new coin  will be made from two types of metal, like the current £2 coin. Out with the old: The present £1 coin, left, . will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting. Its replacement . will be a reworking of the old-fashioned threepenny bit, which last . circulated in 1971 . And the Government will imbed tiny luminescent particles in the coin that will show up under a particular light - making fakes easier to spot. Mr Hilder said that, while the AVA agrees with the principle of introducing a new £1 coin, it also believes that the Government needs to do more to cover the cost of converting the machines. He told MailOnline that it will cost £72.8million to adapt 450,000 coffee, snack and drink machines across the country. He added: 'We need a categorical assurance that there will be no upgrade of the 20p or 50p coins in the forseeable future', explaining that the move would lead to crippling costs for some. Costly: Earlier this year, it was estimated that the cost of re-calibrating each parking machine is £500 a time, which means converting every one across the UK would add up to £50million . Bacta, the body that represents the amusement industry, said that it will cost £100million to adapt 350,000 gaming machines. Chief executive John White said: 'This cost cannot be passed on to customers because of strict rules governing the relationship between stakes and winnings. 'The industry is faced with a number of challenges already and our members, many of whom are small independent businesses, cannot afford this additional cost.' Earlier this year, it was estimated that the cost of re-calibrating each parking machine is £500 a time, which means converting every one across the UK  would add up to £50million. The British Parking Association, whose members run car parks and on-street parking machines for councils and private firms estimated that the bills will be much higher. The BPA has estimated that about 80,000 parking machines - 10,000 of which dispense change. In a statement it said: 'It is estimated that the simplest software upgrade on a pay and display machine will cost in the region of £90 to £130 per machine. If the validator requires changing, this can often also require new fixing brackets for the new validator and would cost in the region of £250 to £350 per machine. 'On machines providing change, it will be considerably more.' However, the association said that one benefit of the change will be to stop around 40million counterfeit coins going in to parking machines each year, which would offset the cost. The British Retail Consortium told MailOnline today that it was working with the Mint and the Treasury on the project to ensure that there was a 'fair and sufficient implementation period'. A spokesman said that self-service check-outs, tills and weighting machines in the back office were among those that would need an upgrade. But he said that it was difficult to estimate a final total cost without receiving the final specifications. A spokesman for the Treasury said: 'After thirty year’s loyal service, the time is right to replace the current £1 coin with a new, more secure coin that will reduce the costs of counterfeiting to our economy. 'It is the small and medium businesses that feel the costs the most and ultimately, the costs of bringing in the new coin could never compare to the price we’d pay in the event that confidence in the £1 coin deteriorated. 'That’s why the government is acting now, to stay several steps ahead of the counterfeiters. In doing that, we are committed to arriving at a final specification of the coin that maximises the benefits to the UK and to introducing the new coin in a manageable way for industry. 'That is why we have been undertaking a full consultation with all interested parties, which will determine the final specification of the coin.' In September, George Osborne launched a competition for members of the public to design what goes on the tails of the new 12-sided £1 coin. This unique opportunity will put a design on millions of new £1 coins while the winner will receive a £10,000 fee in exchange for the right to use it. But the contest, which is now closed, sparked the creation of a number of spoof coins - with pranksters posting designs using Mr Blobby, Alex Salmond and the Chuckle Brothers to Twitter.

"More than 140,000 Australians are now ditching conventional dating methods and turning to websites to find a sugar daddy or sugar baby to meet their needs. At 25-years-old, Vanessa Marie is one of the many young women who have found a man much older than her – a 51-year-old hotel owner – to regularly shower her with gifts in exchange for her attention. 'We basically would meet up once a week for diner with drinks and for exchange I would get a weekly allowance,' Vanessa, who earns $500 a week just for her presence, told A Current Affair. Scroll down for video . At 25-years-old, Vanessa Marie found a 51-year-old hotel owner who she meets with for a weekly date in exchange for a $500 allowance . 'You get spoiled and pampered, you get to basically get what you want - it's easy money I guess.' The model echoed the sentiments of infamous sugar daddy Geoffrey Edelsten's alleged former sugar baby, Shirley Moore, who described the businessman as 'my personal ATM'. 'He's like ""OK, so what do you want from me. Do you want a $100,000 a year, do you want $250,000 a year?"" 'He's like ""OK well, set up a bank account, I'll send you $2000 a week"".

Nerita, also 25, met the director of a successful Melbourne company through sugardaddymeet.com in exchange for a fancy dress and bag . The 25-year-old who works in the finance industry said that she was financially secure and successful and doesn't consider herself a gold digger. 'I've met some very lovely gentlemen so, all very good experiences so far,' Nerita said of her dating men she's met online who are up to twice her age. 'My first experience was one of the most exciting experiences I've ever had – I got a message through my inbox basically saying 'liked your profile'. 'They're very attractive, I enjoy their company, I enjoy teaching them, and I enjoy going out with them,' Geoffrey Edelsten told A Current Affair . 'He's a director of a pretty successful company in Melbourne and he essentially wanted me to be his date for a company event. Along with that I got a beautiful dress, a beautiful bag out of it. I mean, who doesn't like all of that?' But what about the well-to-do gentlemen involved in these controversial relationships, what do they get out of it? 'They're very attractive, I enjoy their company, I enjoy teaching them, and I enjoy going out with them,' Geoffrey Edelsten told A Current Affair, insisting that money was only 'a minor attraction' for the women he sees.

Single or married, no time for game? Looking to support and pamper women who will treat you like a king? Interested in a discreet and mutually beneficial relationship? Time to be a Sugar Daddy!' But there's nothing to be ashamed of in the power-based relationship, according to Nerita, who saiud: 'For an older man to have a younger companion? I don't see an issue with that.'

"A huge nugget of gold, nicknamed the Devil's Ear because of its peculiar shape, was found by miners in Siberia on Friday 13th, as a full moon shone over Russia. Initially the precious lump was cast aside by a sifting machine, but was later spotted by an eagle-eyed worker at the Ukhagan mine in the Irkutsk region's Bodaybinsky district. ‘Even the giant nugget's weight seems sinister - including three sixes - 6.664kg (14.69lb)’ reported The Siberian Times. A huge nugget of gold, nicknamed the Devil's Ear because of its peculiar shape, was found by miners in Siberia on Friday 13th, as a full moon shone over Russia. Depending on its purity, it may be worth £180,000 ($300,000) The Welcome Stranger Nugget is thought to be the biggest gold nugget ever found. Weighing in at 72.02 kg (158.78 lbs), it was more than ten times the size of the Devil's Ear nugget recently found by miners in Siberia. It was discovered near Dunolly, Victoria in Australia on 5 February 1869. The nugget was 61 cm (24 inches) wide. This compares to the Devil's nugget which is 21 cm (8.3 inches) wide. Soon after it was dicovered, the nugget was melted down into ingots and shipped to the Bank of England. Depending on its purity, this would make the nugget worth around £180,000 ($300,000). ‘The nugget was found on Friday 13 June, coinciding with a full moon,’ said a statement by local officials. ‘The weight also favours secrecy - there are three sixes - and the shape is very similar to a pointy ear. So miners immediately called the find the Devil's Ear.’ They admitted that the mine's machinery, meant to identify gold, cast the find aside. ‘A worker, who started to level the pile, found the nugget.’ Now there is added excitement at the Siberian mine. Such finds rarely come singly. 'If there is one, there will be a second and it is possible that very soon the Devil's Ear will have a brother.' Sergey Kozlov, Ugakhan director, said: ‘The nugget was found in a new mine that according to preliminary estimate doesn't have that much gold. ‘Now the miners are very hopeful that an old saying 'one nugget never walks alone' will work for them again. ‘But first we will have to check the dropouts more carefully - to see what else the clever equipment threw away.’ The Welcome Stranger Nugget is thought to be the biggest gold nugget ever found.

"A three-year-old girl almost died after her family's cat gave her a rare form of meningitis. Sparkle Anderson was left just hours from death after she contracted meningitis from Chesney, her mother's two-year-old pet. Thankfully, after a month in hospital, Sparkle made a full recovery and she is now inseparable from the animal. Sparkle Anderson, three, caught meningitis from her mother's pet cat, Chesney (pictured) Sparkle's mother Chelsea-Ann Dodd, 21, a promotions assistant from Winsham, Somerset, said: ‘It seemed such an unlikely cause. ‘The doctors said she was only the 39th person in the world known to have picked up that particular strain of meningitis. ‘She was just three weeks old and very vulnerable. It was very frightening. ‘Chesney still lives with my mum and there's no need to worry about them being in contact any more. In fact they follow each other around all the time when we visit.’ Sparkle (pictured with her mother, Chelsea) fell ill when she was just three weeks old. She cried constantly and was hot and bad-tempered so her mother took her to hospital where she was diagnosed with meningitis . When she was diagnosed, doctors said that Sparkle was just hours from death. She had to spend a month in hospital before being released. She is pictured recovering from the illness . Miss Dodd said she became concerned when, at three weeks old, Sparkle would not stop crying. She said: ‘I tried everything to calm her down, but she wouldn't stop yelling. She was extremely hot and bad-tempered. A fever and cold hands and feet . Refusing food and vomiting . Being fretful and disliking being handled . Drowsiness and unresponsiveness . An unusual cry or moaning . Neck stiffness and a dislike of bright lights . Pale, blotchy skin or a red rash that does not disappear under pressure . Seizures or fits . Source: The Meningitis Trust . ‘After a few hours I decided to trust my mothers' instinct and take her to hospital.’ At Musgrove Park Hospital, in Taunton, doctors took her daughter away for some emergency tests. She said: ‘It broke my heart to see her hooked up to so many wires. When they told me she had meningitis, I felt sick. ‘It didn't make any sense - Sparkle didn't have a rash and I hadn't noticed her shying away from bright lights. ‘She had an extremely rare form – I was told there had been just 39 cases previously, which really took me by surprise. ‘I was told that she could have died within hours if I hadn't brought her in.’ As doctors brought Sparkle out of the danger zone, they made the startling revelation that they had traced the source of her meningitis to Chesney the cat. Sparkle had contracted a dangerous viral strain of the illness called pasteurella multocida. This bacterium is common in animals, including cats and dogs and can be transferred to humans through bites, scratches and saliva. Sparkle was lucky to make a full recovery from her illness and is now a healthy three year old . It is believed the cat must have licked Sparkle's bottle and that she contracted the illness as a result of bacteria in the cat's saliva . However, it is extremely rare for it to cause meningitis. A spokesperson for the Meningitis Research Foundation said: 'Meningitis can be caused by organisms such as bacteria, viruses or fungi infecting the fluid which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. 'Most feline infectious diseases only affect cats whilst most human infectious diseases only affect humans.  It is possible but rare for certain diseases to pass between cats and humans, for instance if a cat bites you or licks an open wound you could get an infection. Last month Jessica Livings, 19, revealed she had caught TB while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat, Onyx . Cases of meningitis resulting from an infection passed on from a cat are extremely rare indeed.' Miss . Dodd said: ‘They thought that it was transferred through Chesney's . saliva. I'd been careful not to leave them alone together, but Chesney . must have licked Sparkle's milk bottle while my back was turned. ‘I . was consumed with guilt - I felt as if I hadn't kept a careful enough . eye on things, and that Sparkle's sickness was my fault. I sent Chesney . to go and live with my mother.’ After a month in hospital, Sparkle came . home and has since gone on to make a full recovery. She is now a happy, . healthy toddler who is unafraid of animals. A spokesperson for the charity Meningitis Now told MailOnline: 'It is possible to contract meningitis from cats but it is very, very rare, so people shouldn’t worry unduly about contracting it in this way. 'Our advice would be to keep your family pet and make sure you know the signs and symptoms of meningitis. 'Take prompt action if you suspect the disease. Among the symptoms to look out for in babies and toddlers are fever, with cold hands and feet; a stiff neck and a dislike of bright lights; an unusual cry or moaning; and being drowsy, floppy or unresponsive.' Miss Dodd added: ‘I've been told it's perfectly safe for Sparkle to spend time with Chesney, which is a relief because they've really become best friends.’ Last month, a 19-year-old girl revealed she had caught TB from her pet kitten. Jessica Livings, from Berkshire, is thought to be the first case of cat-to-human transmission. Experts believe she became infected while cleaning her pet's open wound and she had to be rushed to hospital for surgery on severely her damaged lungs. She is now keen to advise new parents to research early symptoms of meningitis in children, which include pain, mottled skin and unusually cold hands and feet or shivering. The cat now lives with Sparkle's grandmother but the pair are allowed contact as the danger has passed . She said: ‘I didn't know very much about meningitis - I always thought the only thing I should be worried about was a rash. ‘But there are lots of other symptoms too, and knowing them can make all the difference in helping to catch it early. ‘I try not to think about how close I came to losing Sparkle. I'm so grateful that she's alright now.’ For more information on meningitis visit www.meningitisnow.org or phone the helpline on 0808 80 10 388.","Sparkle Anderson, now three, fell ill when she was just three weeks old .

"A man who has been unable to smell properly for 20 years sniffed out a major gas leak just days after a kick to the head during a rugby match restored his lost sense. Edward Baker's ability to smell gradually deteriorated throughout his adult life after he repeatedly broke his nose playing his favourite sport. He has even undergone surgery to fix the problem, without success. During a recent game of rugby, he received a kick to the face which left him with another bruised and bloody nose. Incredibly, after the swelling went down, he realised he was able to breathe properly and that his sense of smell had been restored. Scroll down for video . Edward Baker had not been able to smell for 20 years due to a broken nose, but recovered his lost sense after being kicked in the head in a rugby match (pictured) Just days after recovering his sense of smell in the  match between Poole and New Milton (right) he sniffed out a gas leak next to a school (left) The 41-year-old marketing director put his newly-restored ability to good use when he smelt a gas leak near a school in Bournemouth, Dorset just days later. He immediately called the gas board and engineers rushed out to seal off part of the residential road and fix the leak. Mr Baker said: 'Although I haven't been able to smell gas for years, I still recognised the pungent smell straight away. 'The leak was in a built-up area with a school and nursery just yards away so the guy who kicked me in the face potentially saved a serious situation.' Mr Baker said he first broke his nose at the age of 14 and then on frequent occasions over the next 25 years. Eventually he couldn't inhale properly through his nose and his ability to sniff scents and odors completely faded. Mr Baker (third from left) gradually lost his sense of smell after repeatedly breaking his nose playing rugby . He said the player who kicked him to the head did a great service both to himself and those who would have potentially been affected by the gas leak . In a bid to restore his lost sense, Mr Baker underwent an unsuccessful operation last year which involved doctors drilling into his nose to try to improve his breathing. But, where skilled surgeons failed, a burly rugby player succeeded. Mr Baker's latest nasal injury happened during a game involving his team, Hampshire-based New Milton III and Poole 1st last month. He said: 'I've broken my nose a number of times over the years and it gradually got worse and worse until I couldn't breathe through it or smell through it. 'I had an operation last year where they drilled into my nose to make me breathe better through it, but it didn't work. 'So where the surgeons failed this bloke's size 12 boot worked. It was at the end of the game and there was a bit of a melee on the pitch and my nose got kicked. 'As the swelling started to go down about a week later I realised I could breathe and smell again. 'I had sensed it was coming back, and then as I was walked up the road and I could smell gas, something I'd never been able to detect before. 'I called the gas board. What I had smelt wasn't the source but gas was creeping into a chamber nearby. But it highlighted the area and they were able to fix it.'

"With its front wall slipping into the garden, and its crumbling interior open to the elements, it looks like a disaster waiting to happen. But this derelict house has become a treasured feature of a seaside town after an artist transformed it into a unique art by making it look like the facade has slipped into the front garden. Part of the upper floor of the four-storey property is exposed as curving bricks, windows and a door below give the illusion that the front of the house is sliding away. Standards are slipping: Thanet District Council gave the artist permission to use the empty property to . realise his self-initiated £100,000 project . The house has become something of a tourist attraction since it was unveiled . Artist Alex Chinneck, 28, started the £100,000 project, called 'From the knees of my nose to the belly of my toes', at the end of August and has recently completed it in Margate, Kent. The mid-19th century house, which was compulsorily purchased by Thanet District Council after being empty for 11 years, will be brought back into use at the end of the year-long public art exhibition. Ten companies donated their materials, manufacturing capabilities and professional services to build the sliding facade in Godwin Road in the Cliftonville area of the resort. Mr Chinneck, who lives in Hackney, east London, said: 'This idea was completely self-initiated. Initially I wanted to do it in London and I wrote to various people to try to get it off the ground. 'I was offered a huge number of properties, including a multi-storey car park, but I then decided I wanted to do it in Margate because I was excited by the arrival of the Turner Contemporary art gallery.'

'I wanted to create something that captured humour, illusion and would be accessible to people from all types of different backgrounds. The response has been very positive.' Last year, Mr Chinneck installed more than 1,200 pieces of glass across the facade of a factory in Hackney to create the illusion that its 312 windows had been identically smashed and cracked.

"A teenager who was regularly taunted by strangers on the street about her size has dropped five dress sizes and as many stone in just one year. Laura Frankham, 19, suffered from self-esteem issues and found herself comfort eating, leaving her at a size 20 and weighing 16 stone at her heaviest. The nursery worker's binge eating did not go unnoticed as Laura would often receive abuse from both friends and strangers because of her weight. Scroll down for video . Laura Frankham dropped five stone in one year after years of being taunted about her size . Laura, from Burnley, said that it got to the stage where she became so miserable with her weight that she hid herself away. 'I was really self conscious and had little confidence. I started to become a recluse - I'd get invited to parties but I wouldn't go because I was so unhappy with my weight,' she said. As Laura became more uncomfortable in her own body her emotional eating only worsened. Laura decided to take on the cabbage soup diet seeing her lose half a stone in her first week of trying it . Laura had become a recluse with her low self-esteem keeping her house bound and comfort eating . Laura now enjoys a better social life . 'I lived on a diet of crisps, chocolate and other sugary snacks. 'Sometimes I ate two dinners a night - I would eat at my friend's house and then go home and eat another dinner which my mum had made. 'I used to eat huge portions of food packed with carbs and cheese - I loved to eat the fat off meat as well - that was a big thing for me.' 'It got really out of control.' Laura, said that it was when she couldn't walk down the street without being taunted that she realised she needed to trim down. 'People at school would call me fatty, fat b****, fat f***. When strangers in the streets would join in, that's when I realised I needed to lose weight.' Laura kickstarted her weight loss in autumn of 2012 by braving the cabbage soup diet - an eating regime which requires followers to eat nothing but cabbage soup for a week. The diet, which is designed to help shed fat fast, saw Laura lose half a stone in her first week of battling the bulge. She steadily lost up to 4lbs a week, helped by regular sessions on her Wii Fit system. 'I stopped eating chocolate, crisps and potatoes for quite a while and started to eat veg and healthy light meat,' said the 19-year-old. By September 2013 Laura had dropped a five stone. She currently weighs 10st 8lb - she and no longer plagued by her low self-esteem.

"Searching through tangles of lights to find the broken one that has left the Christmas tree in the dark is enough to bring out the Scrooge in anyone when decorating for the festive season. However new technology promises to put an end to this annual vexation. Engineers have designed the first wireless Christmas lights that are powered using a magnetic field created around the tree. Scroll down for video . Bright idea! The new lights uses LED lights, contained within decorative baubles, that can be powered using resonant inductive coupling in a similar way to the method that is used to recharge electric toothbrushes . When the bulbs are placed inside the magnetic field they light up and they can also be controlled through an app on a smart phone like an iPhone or tablet. The new lights have been built to sit inside decorative baubles that can be placed anywhere on the tree and the designers claim they will last  20 years longer than traditional Christmas lights. Christopher Higgins, 29, co-founder of Powered by Aura, the California-based company behind the new lights, said: 'This is really a brand new technology and there is nothing quite like it. 'I was inspired to make it because of the amount of wires that suffocate and weigh trees down.' Mr Higgins unveiled the design on the crowdfunding website Kickstarter, where he hopes to raise enough money to begin producing commercial in time for Christmas 2015. The lights work by placing a magnetic coil around the trunk of the Christmas tree. A magnetic coil placed around the tree trunk produces a magnetic field that only lights up the bulbs when enter the field. The company behind the technology say the ring can power up to 100 lights . The lights use LEDs bulbs printed onto circuit boards capable of converting a magnetic field into electricity . For trees shorter than five feet this can be placed around the base while for larger trees it needs to be placed in the middle of the foliage, according to the designers. The lights use LED bulbs that can then convert the magnetic field produced by the coil into electrical energy to power the lights, a process known as resonant inductive coupling. The approach is similar to that used to recharge the batteries in electric toothbrushes. Mr Higgins said their Aura Power Ring can power lights on Christmas trees of all shapes and sizes up to around 10 feet tall. The ring also connects to phones, tablets or laptops using WiFi, allowing homeowners to turn their lights on and off, or even to set up a schedule for when they want them to shine. The Aura power ring can produce a magnetic field up to 10 feet tall to power the lights and can be placed around the base of trees shorter than five feet or in the middle of the foliage of taller Christmas trees . The bulbs could save having to wrestle with tangles of Christmas tree lights when decorating next year . Mr Higgins added: 'This uses no batteries, no wires. It's completely different to anything seen before. 'The ornaments receive power from the base ring by being specially constructed and tuned to only communicate with the base ring itself. 'You can set up any kind of schedule for the lights - such as simple on and off toggling to specific times. 'You can even set up a schedule for dates you want the tree to start and stop lighting up.' The lights come in three different styles - clear glass, crackle glass and frosted glass. All styles are available in white and multicolour and the power ring is also available in two sizes - 42 inches wide or 30 inches. Prices for the ring and bulbs start at £45. Currently the company has received around $32,000 (£20,400) of backing on Kickstarter. The lights will come in a variety of colours and designs including frosted glass, crackle white glass, clear . Owners can also control their lights by turning the power ring on and off over WiFi from an app on their phone .","Aura lights are powered wirelessly by a magnetic field around the tree .

"France head to Brazil with plenty of confidence after rounding off their World Cup warm-up matches by thrashing Jamaica 8-0 on Sunday, with striker Karim Benzema scoring two and creating two in an impressive display of attacking football. Benzema picked out Oliver Giroud for France's fourth goal and also created the second for midfielder Blaise Matuidi, who in turn set up Benzema's second. Star winger Franck Ribery was ruled out of the World Cup on Friday because of a lingering back injury but his absence could work in France's favor as the teamwork looks much improved. One down: Yohan Cabaye slides in to convert Olivier Giroud's knock-down for France's first goal . In form: PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi was superb for France, scoring their second from just outside the box . 'We've lost . a world-class player,' France coach Didier Deschamps said. 'He's not . here, but we have other players. It's about having collective strength.' Giroud . set up the opener for midfielder Yohan Cabaye, left back Patrice Evra . crossed for Matuidi's second of the night, and Antoine Griezmann came . off the bench to score two clinical goals. 'It's . not easy to score eight goals. It's good for confidence, although we . won't be over-confident,' Deschamps said. 'We played with a lot of . mobility, and there was a good understanding between the players.' Less . than a year ago, Benzema was fighting for his place after a dismal run . of 15 games without a goal, but has scored six in his past six and his . international tally has improved to a respectable 21 in 66. This was France's heaviest win since a 10-0 thrashing of Azerbaijan in 1995. Number three: Benzama celebrates his first, and France's third, as they thrashed Jamaica in Lille .

France created early pressure, and Giroud went close to heading in Mathieu Valbuena's teasing cross from the left. The defense remains vulnerable to set pieces, however, and defender Adrian Mariappa almost gave the visitors a surprise lead. France took the lead in the 17th minute with a well-worked team goal. Valbuena . found space on the edge of the penalty area, looped the ball up to . Giroud, who held off a defender before nodding the ball down to Cabaye. Sprinting into space, the PSG midfielder expertly controlled the ball on . his chest before volleying home as he he slid along the ground. In control: Olivier Giroud linked well with Benzema, eventually converting a cross to make it four . All together: France showed plenty of quality along with a team spirit which has been missing in the past . The . second goal came just three minutes later, as Benzema picked out .

"The CIA plotted twice to assassinate President Richard Nixon during the years before the Watergate scandal because the agency was angered when 'Tricky Dick' turned dovish and began to withdraw troops from Vietnam, according to an explosive book from a longtime Nixon confidant due for release on Monday. One hit was planned to occur at Nixon's Key Biscayne, Florida vacation house. A second plot to kill him was to culminate during a Miami speech in 1972. When both plots failed, writes best-selling author Roger Stone in 'Nixon's Secrets: The Rise, Fall and Untold Truth about the President, Watergate, and the Pardon,' the CIA settled for driving Nixon out of office by sabotaging the Watergate break-in. Scroll down for video . Richard Nixon was lucky to survive long enough to resign, judging from claims in a new book that describes two separate CIA plots to assassinate him . Controversial: Roger Stone's last book claimed President Lyndon Johnson was behind the JFK assassination . 'I first learned about this from Howard Liebengood,' Stone told MailOnline on Wednesday, referring to the Republicans' minority counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in the 1970s. 'The president was supposed to be assassinated,' he quotes Liebengood saying in his book. 'The first place he was supposed to be assassinated at was in Key Biscayne, the second place was when he was supposed to give a speech at the time of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War [VVAW] convention in Miami Beach 1972.' 'Veteran CIA assassin Edwin Kaiser was to supply the weapons to assassinate Nixon with.' Kaiser, an anti-Castro revolutionary, had killed for the CIA before, but Stone claims he and fellow CIA contract killer Frank Sturgis backed out of the mission when they learned who they were expected to kill. Stone said he obtained Kaiser's papers from his son Scott, who has his own book in the works. 'Edwin Kaiser's Covert Life: And His Little Black Book Linking Cuba, Watergate & the JFK Assassination,' will be published in October. 'I got confirmation from Kaiser's papers,' he told MailOnline. Stone claims in his book that Liebengood, who died in 2005, told him that Kaiser and Sturgis 'both insisted that they had not been informed that Richard Nixon was the target until after the intended weapon was obtained.' 'Both . Sturgis and Kaiser insisted they had been led to believe that they were . to execute a ""Communist""' at the VVAW convention, he writes that . Liebengood told him. 'Kaiser balked when he realized it was a domestic . political hit.' 'Nixon's secrets' is due on bookshelves August 11 and promises to shake up the historical understanding of the only US president to resign his office . He went to the FBI in Miami instead and the plot fizzled. Stone's claims are documented in part by an email from Scott Kaiser in which the assassin's son writes that his father had recalled talking to the CIA's plotters.The idea was to 'create a shoot-out using the Yippies and the Zippies' – anti-war student radical groups – 'and the other ""hard core commies"" they were so worried about,' he said his father had explained. 'The people I spoke to were going to put some of this equipment in their hands,' the elder Kaiser had said, according to his son's email reproduced in Stone's book, 'and some in law enforcement hands, and use some of the local vigilantes to start a shoot out.' 'This would finally straighten out Washington as to where the priorities were on overcoming the ""domestic communist menace"".' The planned diversion wasn't the CIA's first plot to rub out Nixon, Stone claims. In the . email he publishes in 'Nixon's Secrets,' Scott Kaiser wrote that a CIA . operative named Gerald Patrick Hemming told his father how associates of . Antonio Veciana, a Cuban emigre who had been involved in a CIA-led – . and Nixon-approved – plot to kill Fidel Castro, 'had a scheme to ... [fire a] missile at the compound' in Key Biscayne where the president . was staying. 'They . were gonna take out Nixon and put Agnew in power,' Hemming concluded, . suggesting that the CIA was also involved in that conspiracy. Some . of the same CIA operatives involved in the Nixon assassination plots – . including Kaiser, Sturgis and Hemming – were later planted among the . Watergate burglars, Stone explains in 'Nixon's Secrets.' (For . the conspiracy-minded, 'Nixon's Secrets' also notes that Hemming had . been JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's case officer at a naval air . station in Japan, a point of origin for top-secret U-2 spy plane . flights.) The . CIA, he claims, inserted its own people among Nixon's 'plumbers' over . time with instructions to make rookie mistake after rookie mistake. CIA theory: Stone says many of the Watergate burglars including Virgilio Gonzales (L), Frank Sturgis (2nd L) and Bernard Barker (2nd R) were also CIA operatives who were also involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination . Boom: Nixon's Key Biscayne, Florida vacation home, shown in December 1971, was to be turned to rubble with a missile strike, according to Roger Stone's book 'Nixon's Secrets' Their bumbling, which Stone claims as intentional, turned a professional surveillance operation of the Democratic National Committee headquarters into what history would regard as a 'third-rate burglary.' 'When they tried twice to get him killed, that doesn't work,' Stone told MailOnline. 'Then they infiltrate the Watergate break-in, and they sabotage it.' Liebengood, the Watergate committee lawyer who first told Stone about the assassination plots, had been a longtime aide to Sen. Howard Baker, a moderate Republican who assembled his own dossier on CIA involvement in the Watergate affair. Baker tried in vain for months to use that information to spark new committee investigations – which Democrats blocked at every turn. 'Baker’s incredible report was in the back of a 600-page book gathering dust at the Library of Congress, missed by the media and largely unknown until today,' Stone claims in his book. When the senator later looked into the relationship between the president and his CIA director, Richard Helms, he summed it up by remarking that 'Nixon and Helms have so much on each other, neither of them can breathe.' 'Nixon also aggravated the CIA,' Stone told MailOnline, by demanding their records of of the JFK assassination, which he wanted as leverage over the agency.' The president 'was furious when CIA Director Richard Helms refused to hand over the files,' Stone said. The late former Sen. Howard Baker (L), who died two months ago, amassed evidence that the CIA infiltrated the gang of Nixon-era Watergate burglars and purposely set them up to be caught, all in order to being down the president . 'Nixon's Secrets' is hefty at 661 pages, but readable and – mercifully – it requires little advance knowledge of the 1960s and 1970s, or the Watergate saga, to comprehend. The book includes a longish but entertaining introduction to Nixon's political life. Stone, at one time the youngest staffer at Nixon's the infamous Committee to Re-Elect the President, is clearly fond of his subject but makes no attempt to whitewash his crime and cover-up that spiraled out of control and ended his presidency in 1974. Killer? Frank Sturgis, one of the Watergate burglars, was one of two CIA assassins recruited to kill Nixon, according to Stone's book . And he explains clearly why the CIA would want Nixon out of the way and his later-disgraced vice president, Spiro Agnew, at the helm. The CIA and the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff were 'at war' with Nixon in 1969 and 1970, Stone claims, because 'they were opposed to the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam, they were opposed to the SALT [arms limitations] agreement with the Soviets, and they were opposed to the opening to China.' Recalling the mood when Nixon entered the White House in January 1969, Stone told MailOnline that President Lyndon Johnson had frustrated his spies and generals by 'trying to conduct the war personally, picking bombing targets and so on.' The CIA and the Pentagon, he said, 'felt handcuffed.' 'So now we've got a real hard-liner in Nixon. He's going to let us really go after the North Vietnamese,' Stone imagined them thinking. 'But of course that's not what happens. Nixon wants to get out of there, and they're violently opposed to that.' 'Their motivation is to upset this detente.' In 1969, he writes in his book, top military brass were even running a spy ring inside the White House because they were 'desperate to know what Nixon and [his national security chief Henry] Kissinger were up to. 'In December 1971, Charles E. Radford, a twenty-seven-year-old navy stenographer assigned to the National Security Council, working closely with both Kissingerand [his deputy Al] Haig, confessed to sifting through burn bags of top-secret White House documents and delivering these documents to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Thomas H. Moorer,' Stone writes. The naval Yeoman was 'going around copying documents, rifling desks – he actually goes through [Henry] Kissinger's briefcase – copying everything and sending it to the Joint Chiefs,' Stone said.","CIA and military Joint Chiefs infiltrated the White House and spied on Nixon, the late former president's longtime confidant Roger Stone writes .

"It was the South Korean pop song that took the world by storm in 2012 and was so catchy that you’re probably still humming it.

The number is more than YouTube is coded to  display, based on a 32-integer system, which determines how large a stored number can be. Because the number is stored as 0s and 1s there is a character limit based on the amount of memory taken to store it. So in the case of the Psy video, the number of views surpassed this limit, meaning Google had to upgrade and allocate more memory . It has fixed the problem by allowing 64-but integers and adding an animation. ‘Hover over the counter in PSY's video to see a little math magic and stay tuned for bigger and bigger numbers on YouTube,’ the blog post said. At the time of writing, ‘2152218058’ people had watched the music video with its distinctive horse-like dance.

"A stay of execution was ordered on Wednesday morning for a schizophrenic killer who was set to face lethal injection within hours amid outcry that he is not mentally fit to be put to death. The judgement from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas ordered that the execution of Scott Panetti, 56, be postponed 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions'. The condemned killer was due to be put to death at 6pm (CST) in Huntsville. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia some 14 years before shooting dead his estranged wife Sonja Alvarado's parents in front of her and their three-year-old daughter  in Fredericksburg in 1992. In a sworn affidavit in 1999, Ms Alvarado said that although she hated what her ex-husband did, he was a good man who suffered mental illness and should not be put to death. Scroll down for video . Texas death row inmate Scott Panetti, pictured in 1999, talks during a prison interview in Huntsville, Texas, where he is on death row for the 1992 murder of his wife's parents. He is due to be executed later on Wednesday - as attorneys made 11th hour pleas to save him, claiming he is too delusional to stand trial . One of Scott Panetti's self-portraits on death row. Attorneys who contend the condemned Texas inmate set to die today is too delusional for execution have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to halt his lethal injection . The prisoner's attorneys made an eleventh-hour appeal for their client saying he 'stands on the razor's edge of competency' and needs psychological evaluations to illustrate that his severe mental illness has worsened since he last was examined seven years ago. State attorneys contended Panetti's condition 'has not markedly changed' and he should not be given a reprieve from lethal injection. No court has ruled Panetti mentally incompetent or insane. The 56-year-old native of Hayward, Wisconsin, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1978. He had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before fatally shooting Joe and Amanda Alvarado at their home in the Texas Hill Country in 1992. Their daughter Sonja, who was married to Panetti, and her three-year-old daughter, Amanda Lea, had moved in with them and she obtained a court order to keep Panetti away. Ms Alvarado filed for divorce because of her husband's drinking and she said he was obsessed with the notion that the devil lived in their house. Scott Panetti's booking photos shortly after he handed himself into the police after shooting dead his estranged wife's parents in Fredericksburg, Texas in 1992 . Panetti had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for schizophrenia in the decade before he shot dead his wife's parents. He was allowed to act as his own lawyer at trial and characterized himself as a cowboy. Pictured, is one of the inmate's recent sketches . He buried furniture and nailed the curtains shut. Panetti was also having hallucinations that the devil lived in the walls of the house and began washing the walls, believing that they were running with blood. On the morning of September 8, 1992, Panetti armed himself with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and knives, dressed in camouflage clothing and broke into his estranged wife's parents' home in Fredericksburg, about 60 miles north of San Antonio. Both Joe and Amanda Alvarado were shot at close range in front of his wife and daughter, before Panetti allowed them to leave. He later changed into a suit and handed himself into the police. Panetti's attorneys also have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the broader question of whether executing people who have mental illnesses violates the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment. In 1986, the high court ruled states may not execute killers whose insanity means they can't understand why they're being put to death. In 2002, the justices prohibited the execution of the mentally impaired. Five years later, ruling on an appeal from Panetti, the court said mentally ill condemned prisoners could be put to death if they have a factual and rational understanding of why they're being punished. Panetti has insisted Satan is working through Texas prison officials to execute him to keep him from preaching the Gospel. Both Joe and Amanda Alvarado (pictured left) were shot dead at close range in front of Panetti's estranged wife Sonja (right) and the couple's three-year-old daughter . Panetti's attorneys want the death date withdrawn or at least delayed to allow for a new round of psychological testing to determine if he's competent to receive the lethal injection. The prisoner is pictured with his parents, Yvonne and Jack, on death row . Testimony from Scott Panetti's 1995 murder trial showed the depth of his delusions when he insisted on representing himself in court. He recounted the murders as such: . Panetti: '... Sarge woke up. Cut off Scott's hair. Sarge suited up. Shells, canteen, pouch, 3006, tropical hat, tropical top, bunkhouse, fast, haircut fast, suited up fast, boom, ready fast, fast, haircut, webgear, top, brush hat, boots, out the door, in the jeep, driving, wife, the bridge. Why is it taking so long? In front of Joe and Amanda's house... 'Sarge, everything fast. Everything fast. Everything slow. Tapped on the window, shattered window. Sonja screams, runs, follow her. She runs out, out the front, knife, Birdie, Birdie [Scott and Sonja's daughter]. Where's Birdie? Pick her up, she's in bed... 'Scott, what? Scott, what did you see Sarge do? 'Fall. Sonja, Joe, Amanda, kitchen. Joe bayonet, not attacking. Sarge not afraid, not threatened. Sarge not angry, not mad. Sarge, boom, boom. Sarge, boom, boom, boom. Sarge, boom, boom. 'Sarge is gone. No more Sarge. Sonja and Birdie. Birdie and Sonja. Joe, Amanda lying kitchen, here, there, blood. No, leave. Scott, remember exactly what Scott did. Shot the lock walked in the kitchen. Sonja, where's Birdie? Sonja here. Joe, bayonet, door, Amanda. Boom, boom, boom, blood. Demons. Ha, ha, ha, ha, oh, Lord, oh, you. Judge: Mr Panetti, let's stop. Panetti: You puppet. Panetti's delusions 'have become more pervasive,' according to one of his attorneys, Gregory Wiercioch, who met with the inmate last week. Wiercioch said Panetti told him devices implanted in his teeth by prison system dentists were sending command messages to his brain, that in the sixth grade he had a fight with future President Barack Obama at a Chicago museum and that his tooth told him to write a letter of apology to Obama. Ellen Stewart-Klein, an assistant Texas attorney general, told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that records failed to support claims that Panetti's mental condition had deteriorated and that some of his odd behavior could be deliberate. 'Panetti's mental health condition has long been exaggerated to his benefit and he continues this long established pattern here,' Stewart-Klein said. At his 1995 trial, Panetti acted as his own attorney, testified as alternate personality 'Sarge' to describe the Alvarado slayings and tried to subpoena Jesus Christ, the pope and the late President John F. Kennedy. Panetti wore a purple cowboy outfit, including a big cowboy hat, and largely ignored a standby attorney the judge appointed to assist him. Panetti as a child (right) and while he served in the U.S. Navy before receiving an honorable discharge (left). His mother said warning signs of her son's mental illness appeared in his youth but she associated them with 'teenager weirdness' During a prison interview in 2006,  Panetti claimed he had been taken over by an alter ego he called Sarge Ironhorse, The New York Times reported. He also clutched Bible verses and tried to pull off his prison overalls to show scars which JFK had healed with coconut milk while he fought with the late president in the Pacific during the Second World War. Three years after her ex-husband's trial for the murder of her parents, Sonja Alvarado filed a petition saying that he should never have been tried for the crimes. According to her affidavit in 1999, Ms Alvarado said that she and her mother had tried to alert the police about the threat that her ex-husband posed. 'My mother and I begged the police to take the rifles. Scott had his deer rifle, the 30.06 rifle he used to kill my parents, and the other shotgun at my parents house,' she said. 'Even though the police were told to take the guns, they did not. Scott had made threats against my parents.' She said that her initial police statement was made on the day of her parents' shooting before she had received medical care and was completely traumatized. Ms Alvarado said that she called the District Attorney about a week later when she felt her state of mind was more clear and wanted to add to her statement. She said: 'He [the DA] told me it was best to leave things as they were and they would stick to the original statement given.... Too many mistakes. I feel this was wrong of him... I feel now that I was used on the stand so that I would cover up for the law enforcement mistakes and the Sheriff of knowing Scott’s mental illness for years, not to mention all the other reports that were not written out.' She added: 'I do not hate Scott. I hate what Scott did. Scott was a good person except when he changed... I know now that Scott is mentally ill and should not be put to death.'","Scott Panetti was diagnosed with schizophrenia some 14 years before killing his estranged wife's parents in Texas in 1992 .

"It can be hard to tell whether an animals is content in its surroundings, but scientists have now discovered how goats express emotions. The findings could help farmers gain a better insight into the wellbeing of their stock and turn boost welfare. They believe the animals express contentment with a stable bleat and small ear movements. Scientists have examined how goats express subtle positive emotions, which could lead to greater understanding of their welfare. They discovered that goats are more likely to point their ears forward (stock image pictured) and keep their tail up when they are in a positive state . While it can be easy to spot an animal in distress, it is often harder for people who work closely with animals to know when they are content. Dr Alan McElligott and Dr Elodie Briefer of Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) studied goats at Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats in Monchelsea, Kent. They wanted to get a clear understanding of how the animals express their emotions through sound and behaviour in positive in mildly positive and negative situations. The researchers discovered that the goats were more likely to point their ears forward and keep their tail up when they were in a positive state. They also produced more ‘stable’ calls that varied less in frequency. The scientists hope that by studying how different animals portray their emotions, they can ensure that they are happy in their surroundings, which is of importance not only to animal welfare groups but to consumers who try and buy free range meat, for example. The scientists hope that by studying how different animals portray their emotions, they can ensure that they are happy in their surroundings, which is of importance not only to animal welfare groups but to consumers who try and buy free range meat, for example. Free range chickens are pictured . ‘It is often relatively easy to identify negative emotions in animals but we know little about how they show that they are experiencing positive states,’ Dr McElligott said. ‘Subtle hints from goats like small changes in their calls, their heart rate or the position of their ears tell us about what state it is in and could indicate whether their environment is good for their welfare or not.’ Dr Briefer, who is now at ETH Zurich, said: ‘In this study, we were able to identify not only indicators of emotional arousal, but also whether emotions were positive or negative. ‘Such indicators are important for the welfare of the animals, because they tell us when the animals are experiencing a negative versus a positive emotion, and we can thus adapt the environment to avoid negative emotions and promote positive ones.’ Horses look at each other's ears to read emotions (stock image) and when they are interested, their ears prick up . Just like humans, horses read each other’s faces. But, unlike us, they gain important information by specifically examining the ears, according to a study published in August. It seems that when a horse is interested in something, it pricks up its ears and swivels them towards whatever has caught its attention. When a horse's ears are flopping down, it means the creature is relaxed, but when they are pinned back, the horse is expressing anger. The movements are so important that, if its ears are covered up, another horse struggles to know what it is thinking. The finding comes from University of Sussex researchers who studied what makes one horse pay attention to another horse. Researcher Jennifer Wathan, a PhD student said: ‘Although horses have very mobile ears, they can only swivel them round, point them forward, pull them up or flatten them back. Cats and dogs have more movements.’ She added that a greater understanding of how horses communicate could help improve their welfare.","Researchers at  Queen Mary University of London have examined how goats express subtle positive emotions - though calls and behaviours .

But with Vettel now headed for Ferrari, Red Bull's attentions quickly turn to 2015 and pooling their resources behind Ricciardo and new team-mate Daniil Kvyat. Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo and McLaren's Jenson Button wave to the crowd in Abu Dhabi . Ricciardo said he is ready to be the team's main driver after German Sebastian Vettel left for Ferrari . Ricciardo recognises that after a successful debut campaign with Red Bull in which he won three races and finished third in the drivers' standings behind the all-conquering Mercedes duo of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, he is the man in the spotlight. 'The weight of expectation won't affect me,' Ricciardo said. 'But the reality is now I can win. People know I've - shall we say - got the goods. 'So if I'm coming sixth and seventh when they feel the car should be fourth and fifth then that obviously isn't meeting expectations, but it honestly doesn't add any more pressure to me.' Ricciardo, however, answered a lot of his critics who suggested his promotion from Toro Rosso was based on the back of some inconsistent performances with the Faenza-based marque.

Ricciardo, though, will not have it all his own way in 2015 as Kvyat proved on numerous occasions in his rookie campaign this past season he also has what it takes. Assessing the 20-year-old Russian, Ricciardo said: 'To be honest I've followed him probably for the last five years and he's always been pretty quick and adapted very quickly. 'I really thought he had some fantastic showings this year in Formula One, and I wasn't too surprised (he took up Vettel's seat) in the end. 'He's young, but I expect him to be quick.

"A teenage girl almost died on her birthday after suffering a one in a million toxic reaction to her epilepsy medication. Danika Heron's skin began to burn from the inside out, after the new epilepsy medicine she was prescribed triggered an extremely rare illness. She was struck down by Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and TENS - Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome - which caused severe burns to her organs and skin. The rare reaction caused the skin on over half of her body to burn,  blister, scab and fall off. Her lips swelled so much they burst and she was wrapped from head to toe in bandages. Danika Heron, 19, suffered a horrific reaction to her new epilepsy medications on her birthday, which left her in hospital for three weeks and fighting for her life. She is pictured here before the horrific incident . Miss Heron was struck down with Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and TENS - Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome - which caused severe burns to her organs and skin . The conditions caused half the skin on her body to burn, scab and fall off (left). Her eyes and lips had swollen painfully (right), she couldn't breathe and her neck had swollen so much she couldn't even drink . Miss Heron, from New South Wales, Australia, was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 18. Shortly before her 19th birthday she was prescribed Lamictal and Keppra, two different epilepsy medications which help control seizures. But on the day of her 19th birthday in May, she noticed her eyes and lips were swollen. She developed a small rash on her chest which quickly spread over her entire body. She went to a hospital in Sydney where doctors initially misdiagnosed her condition as herpes and sent her home. Over a period of four days, Miss Heron's symptoms got progressively worse and her mother, Carmen Heron, 43 took her to another hospital in New South Wales. There, she was diagnosed with foot-and-mouth disease, measles and chicken pox before tests revealed she had SJS and TENS and she was rushed to a hospital in Sydney for treatment. These conditions cause large areas of the skin to peel, as well as blistering of the body's mucous membranes in the mouth, eyes, and vagina. If left untreated they can cause permanent blindness, lung damage and death. Although rare, SJS and TENS have been reported as side effects of Lamictal and Keppra, the two epilepsy drugs Miss Heron was taking. Mrs Carmen Heron said her daughter's condition was so rare and severe it was touch-and-go as to whether she would make it through the night. As the rash spread over her body, her mother feared she wouldn't make it through the night. There is no cure for SJS and TENS, patients are treated with fluids and pain relief like burns victims . Miss Heron's entire body was bandaged up as her mouth fused shut and she lost the top layer of her skin on her face, chest, back and arms (left). She survived the ordeal and is now at home recovering (right) She said: 'I just cried when I saw her, she was staying at her boyfriend's at the time and his mum brought her over as Danika works in Sydney. 'She looked like death warmed up, the rash covered her body, her lips were huge and eyes and lips were weeping gunk. 'Over the next few days her condition got worse, she couldn't breathe and her neck had swollen so much she couldn't even drink. 'The rash was spreading and fast, she went through a box or more of tissues, dabbing her lips and eyes of gunk. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome (TENS) are two forms of the same life-threatening skin disease that cause rash and skin peeling or burning. They also cause sores on the 'mucous membranes' inside the nose, mouth, lungs, and many other parts of the body. SJS and TENS usually are caused by drugs or a bacterial infection. Typical symptoms for both diseases include fever, body aches, a flat red rash, blisters that break out on the mucous membranes. SJS causes small areas of peeling skin while TENS causes large areas of skin to peel. In SJS, a person has blistering of mucous membranes, typically in the mouth, eyes, and vagina, and patchy areas of rash. In TENS, there is a similar blistering of mucous membranes, but the entire top layer of the skin also peels off in sheets from large areas of the body. Sufferers are hospitalised in a burns unit, given IV fluids and high calorie formulas to promote healing. Sometimes they will be given steroids and antibiotics. Once diagnosed, doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable. If left untreated both conditions can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage. 'It was heart breaking to see her like that. It came to a point when I thought I was losing her, I was begging her to fight it, willing her to pull though.' Miss Heron spent almost a month in hospital as her entire body blistered, her mouth fused shut and she lost the top layer of her skin on her face, chest, back and arms. She struggled to breathe and had to be fed through a tube as the condition ravaged her body, burning her from the inside out causing her to vomit skin and blood. Her mother said: 'One day I was visiting her and she was struggling I was yelling ""you stay with us you fight this, Danika, please don't go."" 'I went and grabbed a nurse, next thing I knew all these doctors were in there they put a camera down her throat and I ran out of the room hysterical. 'My husband Scott stayed in there the whole time but when I walked in he had tears running down his face, he explained Danika had thrown up all this gunk, which was skin and blood but her breathing was better. 'They had given her oxygen, and a tube was put down to feed her through, she was out of it, she was taken up to a burns unit after that. 'After that day, it was like everything happened in slow motion, we didn't know if she would make it.' Miss Heron's biopsy came back diagnosing her with TENS. Her mother said: 'They say one in a million get SJS and it's even more rare for TENS, one in three can die and re-occurrence is at about 40 per cent.' There is no known cure for SJS or TENS; once it strikes there is no way to stop it, so Miss Heron was forced to fight for her life as the condition ran its course. Sufferers of SJS and TENS are treated like burns victims and given pain relief and fluid replacement. Miss Heron spent a total of three-and-a-half weeks in hospital battling the life-threatening conditions. She said much of her time in hospital was a blur but she's thankful to have made it out the other end and is looking forward to putting it behind her. She said: 'I don't remember a lot about the first week, I just remember I was in a lot of pain, it felt like I was on fire. 'It scares me as I didn't realise how bad it was until I looked at the photos. 'I'm just grateful to be here, I'm glad to be home and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal again,' Miss Heron says. She is now campaigning for warnings on medications, outlining the symptoms of SJS. Here, she is pictured with her mother Carmen Heron before being hospitalised . 'After I left hospital my hair started falling out and my finger and toes nails did too. 'I have severe dry eyes, struggle to swallow sometimes and my skin is still a bit scarred but I'm hoping that will heal in time. 'I'm just grateful to be here, I'm glad to be home and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal again. 'I think there needs to more done to raise awareness of SJS and TENS, there needs to be more research into the condition and more training in hospitals as it's so rare it isn't easy to diagnose. 'I think there should be warnings on medication, labels outlining the symptoms so people know what they to do if they experience any of them. 'It may be rare but I wouldn't wish this condition on anybody and I think we should do everything we can to prevent people from going through what I went through.'

"Chris Evert has promised Serena Williams that she will take her out to dinner to celebrate passing her career total of 18 Grand Slam wins.

Scroll down for video . Chris Evert (far right) has tipped Serena Williams to overtake Steffi Graf’s all-time mark of 22 majors .

Margaret Court - 11 . ‘If she stays healthy and motivated she can win at least three or four more in the next few years. I think this will fire her up for the French Open.’ Williams has ‘only’ won Roland Garros twice, and given her age it is essential that she keeps on winning if she is to catch the great German. Some are of the view that she has already proved herself the better player because Graf’s total was inflated by the tragic events in Hamburg in 1993 when Monica Seles was stabbed by a deranged fan. Evert is among those who would assert that Seles was the better player at the time but the fact is we will never know what might have been without that gruesome intervention. For now Williams is heading straight back on to the treadmill as she said after her victory on Saturday that she will be fulfilling her commitment to fly to Argentina where she is due to represent the USA in the Fed Cup.

You would expect Williams to pace herself more and try to peak for the Grand Slams this year, as she seeks to return to the form of 2013, when she won two of them. Her cause will be aided by the new three-week gap this year that comes between Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

Balotelli's post included a picture of Super Mario, which could land him in trouble with Nintendo, according to Irwin Mitchell. 'The use of Nintendo’s image for these purposes could get him into hot water for both copyright and trade mark infringement, especially given the content which could be said to bring Nintendo’s rights into disrepute or be denigrated,' said Georgie Collins of the London firm. However, the 24-year-old arrived at the club's Melwood base on Wednesday in his £240,000 Ferrari F12 Berlinetta that has been shipped over from Italy. Balotelli insisted that the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’. His statement read: ‘I apologise if I have offended anyone… I now understand that out of context may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have moustache, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money. ‘I used a cartoon by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive. I am sorry.’ The FA, however, will continue their investigation and they can impose a minimum ban of five matches if they believe Balotelli has ‘brought the game into disrepute by making comments which included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race’.

"Soon you won't need to rely on Jeremy Kyle to reveal whether your friend or lover has been telling untruths. An affordable lie detector, named the ‘Kokoro Scanner’, is worn on the forehead and changes colour based on the wearer’s heart rate. It first monitors the pulse to establish a baseline, and then compares this to any changes in heart rate - this in turn reveals whether the wearer is panicking about having to conceal the truth. Crunch time: The ‘Kokoro Scanner’ is worn on the forehead and changes colour based on heart rate . The toy shows green if the person’s pulse is normal, suggesting that they’re telling the truth, yellow if they may be lying, and red if the device thinks they are definitely lying. Created by Tokyo-based toy company, Takara Tomy, the scanner is supposed to be a cheaper version of a polygraph machine. A polygraph works on the assumption that the body reacts involuntarily to the stress of lying. It measures reactions such as changes in skin conductance, pulse rate, blood pressure, and breathing while the subject is asked a series of questions. Truth or dare? Created by Tokyo-based toy company, Takara Tomy, the scanner is supposed to be a cheaper version of a polygraph machine. The device costs £28 ($45) and comes with a set of 15 questions written out on cards ranging from relationships to secret fantasies . Lie detectors, used by law enforcement agencies around the world, work on the assumption that parts of a person's brain will respond involuntarily to certain cues. But last year scientists discovered that a significant proportion of people are able to suppress their brain activity that related to remembering, making them appear innocent and helping them to evade detection. Researchers from the universities of Kent, Magdeburg and Cambridge alongside the Medical Research Council devised an experiment where candidates committed a mock crime, after which they were questioned while experts monitored their brain activity. Their findings have implications for the professionals who rely upon brain activity lie detector tests when questioning criminals. Japan, India and the US use the technique that is based on the assumption that it is impossible to control activity deep in the areas of the brain used for memory. The team behind the study said their results show the technique is 'of limited value' and suggested that investigators using lie detectors in their inquiries should not work on the assumption that a person's brain activity is completely beyond their control. Using a number of sensors attached to the body, physiological changes can be used to determine whether someone is telling the truth. The Kokoro Scanner, however, only monitors changes in pulse using infrared rays.

"The former club of rapist footballer Ched Evans is split over whether the £3million striker should be re-signed, it has been claimed. Sheffield United last week denied rumours the striker was set to be offered a new two-year contract worth £500,000 following his release from prison - but admitted they were continuing to 'deliberate' on a decision. But this morning it has been reported that the club's board are split over whether to let the disgraced Welsh striker play for them again. Ched Evans, left in his police mugshot and right this week after his release, maintains he was innocent. His old club Sheffield United are continuing to 'deliberate' over whether he should play for them again . The 25-year-old left Wymott Prison last Friday having served half of a five-year sentence. He has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales, insisting it was ‘consensual and not rape’. The Sun quotes a source as saying: 'Club bosses seem to think having Ched back is the right thing. They want to help rehabilitate him. 'But some of the board are still uneasy. They could still be a few weeks away from making public their decision.' The newspaper reports that the club have declined to comment further. Ched Evans issued a statement with his girlfriend Natasha Massey pleading for a second chance to play football again - and insisted he was innocent . Evidence: Evans' victim on CCTV at the hotel in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales, on the night of the assault . Last week co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps issued a joint statement denying reports that they have offered Evans a new contract. They described the reports as 'false and damaging to the club' but added: 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.' Earlier this week it was reported that an online petition against Evans returning to Sheffield United had gained more than 150,000 signatures. Ms Massey (right) has led a campaign to have Evans' conviction overturned in a case review . Evans, pictured in action for Sheffield United, wants to restart his career after serving a sentence for rape . Evans broke his silence for the first time on Wednesday to apologise to his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25. But he was criticised for not mentioning his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result. In the statement he said he has 'constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it'. He added: 'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. Now that I've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years, it is my hope that I will be able to return to football. But he said he was 'determined to continue to fight to clear my name' and has now submitted his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.","Sheffield United continuing to 'deliberate' on decision over football rapist .

"The Amundsen Sea has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. Now, a new US study suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago. Researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in West Antarctica, which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre, may be irreversible. Scroll down for video . The Amundsen Sea (pictured) has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the West Antarctic. Now, a new US study suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago . The findings of the 21-year study by Nasa and the University of California, Irvine claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Scientists found the rate by taking radar, laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers' mass between 1992 and 2013. They found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion U.S. tons), or the equivalent of losing the water weight of Mount Everest every two years. 'The mass loss of these glaciers is increasing at an amazing rate,' said scientist Isabella Velicogna, jointly of the University of California, Irvine and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 'Previous studies had suggested that this region is starting to change very dramatically since the 1990s, and we wanted to see how all the different techniques compared,' added lead author Tyler Utterley of UCI. The study found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year (91.5 billion U.S. tons), or the equivalent of losing the water weight of Mount Everest (pictured) every two years . 'The remarkable agreement among the techniques gave us confidence that we are getting this right.' The researchers reconciled measurements of the mass balance of glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Mass balance is a measure of how much ice the glaciers gain and lose over time from accumulating or melting snow, discharges of ice as icebergs, and other causes. Measurements from all four techniques were available from 2003 to 2009. Combined, the four data sets span the years 1992 to 2013. The glaciers in the embayment lost mass throughout the entire period. The researchers calculated two separate quantities: the total amount of loss, and the changes in the rate of loss. It takes just 10 years for a single emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) to have its maximum warming effects on the Earth, according to a new study by the Carnegie Institute for Science. Pictured is the average global surface temperatures in 2013. Red and dark orange show warmer-than-average temperatures . Many scientists believe it takes several decades for the effects of global warming to be felt on Earth. But in fact, it takes just 10 years for a single emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) to have its maximum warming effects on the planet. This is according to Washington-based researchers who claim to have dispelled a common misconception that the damaging effects from a CO2 emission will only be felt by future generations. The results suggest that warming can persist for more than a century and that the benefits from emission reductions will be felt by those who have worked to curb the emissions. Some of these benefits would be the avoidance of extreme weather events, such as droughts, heatwaves and flooding, according to scientists at the Carnegie Institute for Science. However, some of the bigger climate impacts from warming, such as sea-level rise, melting ice sheets and long-lasting damage to ecosystems, may not occur for hundreds or thousands of years later, they claim. 'A lot of climate scientists may have an intuition about how long it takes to feel the warming from a particular emission of CO2, but that intuition might be a little bit out of sync with our best estimates from today's climate and carbon cycle models,' said lead author of the study Dr Katharine Ricke. The rate of loss accelerated an average of 6.1 gigatons (6.7 billion U.S. tons) per year since 1992. From 2003 to 2009, when all four observational techniques overlapped, the melt rate increased an average of 16.3 gigatons per year - almost three times the rate of increase for the full 21-year period. The total amount of loss was close to the average at 84 gigatons. The scientists said that glacier and ice sheet behavior worldwide is by far the greatest uncertainty in predicting future sea level. 'We have an excellent observing network now. It's critical that we maintain this network to continue monitoring the changes,' Ms Velicogna said, 'because the changes are proceeding very fast.' The results were released as a global warming conference has begun in Peru. Those talks are seen as critical to reaching a multilateral accord next year in Paris .

"Internet providers have been accused of being 'complicit' in exposing children to porn by refusing to help parents block it from computers in the home. The Mail tracked down Steven Hirsch, who has made millions from hardcore pornography films for the internet, and along the way found it was not just him that stood to lose a great deal of money if a block was in place. We found he is just at the end of the line. Visits to explicit sites can last between 15 and 20 minutes, meaning that a large amount of data is downloaded handing Internet service providers large amounts of cash because of the way their fees are structured. Steven Hirsch admits he is worried about his multi-million-pound business. For 28 years he has ensured that his company, Vivid Entertainment, has been at the forefront of harnessing new technology such as the internet to become what he might call a ‘respected market leader’. Speaking from his lavish offices in Los Angeles, Hirsch exudes an evangelical zeal about his film industry. But rather than the blockbuster family movies Hollywood is so famous for, Hirsch offers a very different kind of on-screen experience. Since the mid-Eighties, Vivid Entertainment has been producing 60 hardcore pornographic films every year. And with the advent of the internet, business was soon booming. Porn baron: Steven Hirsch poses with Savanna Samson, one of his Vivid Entertainment stars . It is for that reason that Hirsch is very much against the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign, which is aimed at protecting children from the dangers of encountering his so-called ‘adult entertainment’. His arguments are jaw-droppingly self-serving. In a broad Californian drawl, the multi-millionaire chairman and chief executive says: ‘Ten-year-old kids are not interested in watching people having sex because they don’t have sex themselves. They are much more interested in watching the new Batman film.’ When I put to him the findings of this month’s parliamentary inquiry that one in three ten-year-olds have seen pornography online, he seamlessly shifts his position. ‘Ultimately, it’s the parents’ responsibility. They need to be aware of what their children are doing online,’ he says. ‘But kids don’t go online to look for porn.’ Point out that pubescent children naturally have a developing interest in sex, and younger children risk stumbling across obscene material by mistake or view it out of curiosity or the desire to be ‘daring’, and he abandons his line of argument and instead plays the civil liberties card. ‘I think we take a step back as a society when you allow the government to dictate what you can and can’t watch. I mean, just who are the moral police? This ultimately leads you down a path of taking our freedoms away.’ This well-worn argument seems to be the best Hirsch can muster to justify his opposition to restrictions on porn — restrictions that would limit him and others in his sordid profession from making vast profits from a business worth billions a year. And that’s the true reason. We both know the real reason he doesn’t want people having to ‘opt in’ to receive his movies, rather than currently having to opt out: because it threatens his business. ‘Look, some people may feel uncomfortable about letting their Internet Service Provider (ISP) know they want adult content,’ he says. ‘In a free society we should be able to take that decision for ourselves.’ But he would say that, wouldn’t he? The question is why many of Britain’s leading ISPs appear to be aligning themselves with porn barons like Hirsch by rejecting the idea of an opt-in system. For the answer, look at the latest research into the nature of internet usage. Of all the searches carried out on the internet, around a third are for sexual content. The world’s biggest adult website receives an estimated 4.4 billion ‘hits’ — or page views — each month. And while a visit to a news website lasts, on average, up to six minutes (just long enough to read one or two articles) a trawl of a pornographic site typically lasts between 15 and 20 minutes. That means more data is downloaded. But it’s not just a matter of how long you stare at the screen. A news site does not contain a large amount of data because it is often made up of just a few pictures and a lot of text. However, a pornographic site is filled with pictures and videos. Watching them involves downloading vast amounts of data. The more gigabytes of data a customer uses, the more likely they are to have to choose more expensive ISP packages — ones with the option of a higher or limitless download capacity. Obviously, that means more money for the provider. If a third of web searches are for pornography, the potential earnings are enormous. That is why, according to some independent academics, ISPs — which make £3 billion a year from selling internet access to consumers — do not want to have the ‘opt in’ to adult content option made law because it could affect profits. Not suitable for children: This screen grab from . Google shows just some of the free-to-view smut websites that can be . easily found through the search engine . Certainly, some ISPs structure their fees to rake in money from large data downloads. In one package, BT, for instance, charges £13 for 10 gigabytes downloaded each month (an hour-long movie, for example, can take up 1GB). If the customer exceeds that amount he will, after a one-month grace period, be charged a further £5 for each extra 5GB used, up to a maximum of an extra £15 a month. Sky TV customers receive 2GB each month as part of their free internet package. If they exceed that twice in a six-month period they will automatically be placed on the £7.50 a month unlimited package. Though the big six residential providers — BT, Virgin Media, Talk Talk, Sky Broadband, Orange and O2 — have 20 million customers between them, in real terms broadband prices are falling (the average monthly rental dropped from £26 in 2005 to £14 in 2010) as greater competition has cut prices. This means it’s more important than ever for ISPs that they win every customer they can — and extract as much money as possible from each of them. And it is hard not to conclude that if porn was effectively blocked at source, they would lose considerable sums in revenue from the drop in the amount of data being downloaded and paid for by customers. Among the major ISPs, only TalkTalk allows parents to block all adult material from the entire network affecting every device, from computers to mobile phones, that logs on to its broadband. The others insist that filtering software available in their packages can be used to protect children from the perils of adult material. However, these can be applied to just three computers in a household, and do not work on tablets and smartphones, the devices so popular with children. The Internet Service Providers’ Association, which represents the ISPs, insists it’s wrong to say its members are opposed to the ‘opt in’ to adult sites campaign because they fear it could cut profits. Instead they claim it would ‘lessen parental mediation, lulling them into a false sense of security’ and could even block sites that are not actually pornographic (asked for an example, they suggest a biology website which might be useful to a student’s studies could be blocked). ‘The objection is not because ISPs directly benefit from pornography, but because we believe that other filtering options provide better protection for children,’ said the spokesman. And Steven Hirsch insists he takes full responsibility for what his three children aged 16, 11 and eight view online, even monitoring their passwords. Compulsive: Internet service providers make much of their profits through high bandwidth downloads, much of which is pornography . Hirsch is not alone in his blithe promotion of the porn industry’s interests. Michael Klein, the president of the U.S. company Hustler — one of America’s leading porn conglomerates — is adamant that software filters currently available are adequate. He says it is the ‘responsibility and job of the parent’ to stop children being able to log on to adult sites. He effectively suggests that the rights of those wanting to view ‘good pornography’ are more important than protecting children. ‘What is being proposed in the UK would punish people who want to see good adult entertainment just because others are worried that parents can’t do a good enough job of stopping their own children from viewing such content,’ he says. ‘As long as what you are watching does not include any child pornography or any actual images of someone being hurt or injured against their will, then each person should be able to have freedom to watch and enjoy the programming that they want. ‘What if the next step is that they decide they don’t like martial arts movies or action movies, and decide that in their mind they want to block your ability to see that on the internet as well because they don’t think you are responsible enough to make sure that your kids don’t see that Sylvester Stallone or Bruce Willis action movie?’ Except, of course, that action movies do not irreparably warp children’s view of sexuality. As porn will continue to do, until the Internet Service Providers agree to clamp down on this sordid — but oh so lucrative — business.","Steven Hirsch said parents should take responsibility for what their children are looking at - not him .

"Italian football will soon be dying if it does not overcome its deep-rooted structural problems, Juventus president Andrea Agnelli said on Friday. 'We are in progressive decline,' he told a shareholders' meeting in Turin. 'Italian football will soon be dying if it is unable to face up to a double challenge: on the domestic front the fans have to fill up the stadiums, and abroad the challenge of a truly global market.' Paul Pogba (R) wins the ball while playing for Juventus, but Italian football is not what it used to be . Juventus president says structural limits are in danger of destroying Serie A . 'England, Germany and Spain have overtaken us in any number of criteria, revenue, sustainability of the business, sporting results, the value of their stadium and the UEFA ranking,' he said. 'Today, we are struggling to defend fourth place from Portugal,' he added, referring to the coefficients which determine how many places each country is allocated in the Champions League and Europa League. 'Our main competitors Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona have clearly moved ahead of us,' said Agnelli. 'No Italian club is in a state where they can grow at that rhythm, the sign of the structural limits which affect our football.' 'Ten years ago, Serie A generated almost the same receipts as the Bundesliga, a little less than La Liga and almost a third of the Premier League. Then, we were a tortoise, now we are a shrimp.' No Italian side has won the Champions League since Jose Mourinho's (C) Inter Milan in 2010 . No Italian team has progressed beyond the Champions League quarter-finals since Inter Milan won the trophy in 2010 and there has been an exodus of big-name players, culminating in Zlatan Ibrahimovic's departure from AC Milan two years ago. Nowadays, Serie A teams tend to attract players who have fallen out of favour at bigger clubs, such as Juventus forward Carlos Tevez and AC Milan's Fernando Torres, or young foreign players hoping to use it as a springboard to another league. Juve are the only Serie A club who own their own stadium while others play in often dilapidated municipally-owned arenas. Star draw Zlatan Ibrahimovic left Serie A to play for Paris Saint Germain in Ligue 1 . Out of favour stars like Fernando Torres (L) and Carlos Tevez have stepped down from the Premier League . Agnelli said the election of Carlo Tavecchio as Italian federation president in August was another sign of the problems. Tavecchio, 71, was chosen despite referring to African players as 'banana eaters' in a speech and has been banned from any UEFA-related activity for six months by European soccer's governing body over his remarks. 'His election has ignored the indications of footballers, coaches, referees and a substantial part of Series A,' said Agnelli. Carlo Tavecchio has been banned for six months by UEFA after referring to African players as 'banana eaters' 'It was a defeat for many people and a victory for some crafty characters, whose consensus was born in a time from long ago. 'I am convinced that the conservative forces in Italian football, which seem to prevail at the moment to protect small and large special interests and personal incomes, will not be able to stifle those who support the change.' An Inter Milan statement read: 'FC Internazionale is saddened to hear that Juventus president Andrea Agnelli has once again attempted to distort the facts and change history. Unfortunately for him, and for Italian football as a whole, 2006 was a disastrous year in which the Scudetto was legitimately awarded to Inter by the FIGC and Juventus were relegated to Serie B along with their reputation. 'Those are the facts. We will not allow anyone to change them or act as if they did not happen.'","Juve president Andrea Agnelli says Italian game is in 'progressive decline'

"More than two million Pakistanis are trapped in 'modern-day slavery', condemned to a lifetime of hardship to pay back supposed debts, labour campaigners say. Laws have been in place since the early 1990s to outlaw bonded labour, but still the cycle continues, with thousands of children sucked in every year to help pay back money their parents have often borrowed out of desperation. At an open-air factory on the edge of Hyderabad, around 90 miles north of Karachi, tall, tapering chimneys belch out noxious smoke. Scroll down for video . More than two million Pakistanis are trapped in 'modern-day slavery', condemned to a lifetime of hardship to pay back supposed debts . A Pakistani labourer makes bricks at a brick kiln factory on the outskirts of Hyderabad; A global survey of slavery published last month by the Australian campaign group the Walk Free Foundation said Pakistan had the third most 'slaves' in the world, after India and China. Crouching children gather lumps of clay and pack them into rectangular moulds. On the ground, long rows of unbaked bricks wait to go into the kiln. These are the scenes that have been the backdrop to Ranjhan's life since he was a child. For several decades he has worked in a brick kiln as a bonded labourer, tied to his employer by a debt his salary will never enable him to repay. The father-of-three said: 'I've spent the last 40-odd years in this grind, sometimes in one factory, sometimes in another.' Ranjhan works seven days a week at the coal-fired kiln, where 1,000 bricks will earn him a little over £1, every cent of which goes straight back to his employer. 'I borrowed 40,000-50,000 rupees (£413-516) to buy food for my children. I will never pay it back before I die - my debt will die with me.' A global survey of slavery published last month by the Australian campaign group the Walk Free Foundation said Pakistan had the third most 'slaves' in the world, after India and China. Most work in brick making or agriculture. Walk Free says the government needs regulate brick kilns and enforce anti-slavery laws. Ranjihan says little about why he took out the loan in the first place. From buying food to wedding dowries to hospital visits - there is no shortage of reasons why workers enter into lifelong deals with their employers. Puno Bheel, who set up a brickworkers' union in Hyderabad a few years ago, said: 'Before the union, the workers here didn't even have names, just numbers. If someone came and asked them their name, they'd say 'Ask the boss, he'll tell you.' From buying food to wedding dowries to hospital visits - there is no shortage of reasons why workers enter into lifelong employment deals . And the debt often escalates, as accommodation and food costs are often added. Some small trade unions are lobbying bosses to raise salaries to the equivalent of $3 a day and to not trap their workers in the debt cycle. Puno Bheel, who set up a brickworkers' union in Hyderabad a few years ago, said: 'Before the union, the workers here didn't even have names, just numbers. If someone came and asked them their name, they'd say 'Ask the boss, he'll tell you.' But despite their best efforts the unions are fighting a difficult battle. A few employers may have improved wages and conditions, but the unions have not persuaded any to free bonded labourers. But some workers, like Sajan Kumar, have been able to escape. Five years ago the owner of a rice and pepper farm where he had worked for years with his family demanded £2,877, claiming their work had not covered the cost of feeding them. Mr Kumar's uncle went to the Green Rural Development Organisation, a campaign group, which took the matter to court. Some small trade unions are lobbying bosses to raise salaries to the equivalent of $3 a day and to not trap their workers in the debt cycle . Workers debts often increase, rather than go down, as their employers add accommodation and food costs to the total they owe . But things only got worse for the farmer and his family. Mr Kumar claims the owner and his men threw him and his extended family in vehicles and drove them into the desert 'chained like animals'. After days of being held captive, the 87 members of Kumar's extended family, all from the Hindu minority, were rescued by the police. Mr Kumar said: 'It was slavery, what else would you call it? We were treated like animals, we worked day and night.' Once freed, the family accusing the landowner of illegal detention, an audacious move in a country where the rich and powerful rule virtually unchallenged in rural areas. Mr Kumar and his family got more than £12,797 in an out-of-court settlement. He now lives in the village of Azad Nagar, near Hyderabad, which is populated by former bonded labourers. Ghulam Haider, the head of the Green Rural Development Organisation who set up Azad Nagar in 2006, said they had managed to free 28,000 people, but around half of them have ended up back in bonded labour for want of any other work . The family bought a minibus and Mr Kumar opened a grocery. Ghulam Haider, the head of the Green Rural Development Organisation who set up Azad Nagar in 2006, said they had managed to free 28,000 people, but around half of them have ended up back in bonded labour for want of any other work. For little Jenny, her hands worn from work at just 12 years old, the future looks bleak. She has already spent years feeding animals, working in the fields, cleaning houses and pumping water for a landowner. She said: 'We only got to eat at the end of the day and they beat my brothers. We would say to them, 'Why are you so cruel to us?' and they would reply 'Pay me!'","More than two million Pakistanis are believed to be trapped in life long contracts to pay back their debts .

"Ronald Koeman will want his side to perform well at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night - but maybe not that well. The high-flying Saints face an Arsenal side who have been struggling to maintain their top-four credentials so far this term. The Gunners have spent very little time in the Champions League positions but victory will certainly go some way to achieving that, against a team which has produced a number of their top talent in recent years . Arsenal's young talent including Aaron Ramsey and Calum Chambers in training at London Colney . Nathaniel Clyne celebrates scoring for Southampton, who are flying high in third place in the Premier League . Theo Walcott moved to Arsenal from Southampton for £9million in January 2006 . Arsene Wenger has signed three players from Southampton for a combined £35million. They are: . Theo Walcott - Signed for £9m in January 2006 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - Signed for £12m in August 2011 . Calum Chambers - Signed for £12m in July 2014 . Wenger was also interested in signing these three players from the Saints: . Gareth Bale - Moved to Tottenham Hotspur for £7m in May 2007 (before leaving for Real Madrid in a world-record £86m deal in September 2013) Luke Shaw - Moved to Manchester United for £31m in June 2014 . Morgan Schneiderlin - Still at St Mary's . Arsenal's talent spotters have traditionally found St Mary's a happy hunting ground. Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers have all arrived in north London from the south coast in recent years. There could have been more: Gareth Bale, Luke Shaw and Morgan Schneiderlin have been on Arsene Wenger's radar at one time or another. Speaking in 2012, Arsenal manager Wenger said: 'The question of Southampton's academy set-up is a very good one because they have done a fabulous job. 'Why? It is down to the quality of their scouting, the quality of their coaching and education. When you look at what Bale is doing, and Walcott. 'And now they have they players like Morgan Schneiderlin, they have brought some players of top, top quality and they work well. They have fantastic scouting.' Glowing praise, indeed. No wonder Arsenal have kept such a close eye on Southampton's talent pool. Having already won at the Emirates Stadium this season, albeit in the Capital One Cup, victory on Wednesday will confirm Koeman side as bona-fide Champions League contenders. And while Arsenal have never been out of touch with the top four, they are yet to stake a firm claim in the elite pack so far this season. Wednesday night is a big test for both clubs in north London. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain swapped St Mary's for the Emirates when he moved for £12m in August 2011 . Calum Chambers also moved from the Saints to Arsenal for a £12million sum last summer . Let's face it, we all expect the wheels to come off at some point between now and the end of the season for Southampton. The Saints were heavily tipped to struggle this season following the much-publicised summer exodus of their top players. Relegation was even mentioned in some circles, a thought those who made such assumptions would never admit. But the quality of their scouting system has shone through once more. Arsenal also tried to sign Luke Shaw (left), who moved to Manchester United for £30million last summer and Morgan Schneiderlin, who remains at St Mary's Stadium and has excelled so far this season . Arsene Wenger was tracking Gareth Bale while he was at Southampton but he is now at Real Madrid . And what if Arsenal come knocking again? There's plenty on offer at St Mary's. Graziano Pelle arrived as Rickie Lambert's replacement and was hardly a household name on these shores. However, speak to some of Pelle's Saints team-mates today and they'll tell you the Italian is an upgrade on Lambert. Nine goals since his arrival in England tells its own story. Dusan Tadic was signed as Adam Lallana's replacement. Again, not a name many Barclays Premier League followers would know much about. Danny Welbeck is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring a vital goal for Arsenal against West Brom . Santi Cazorla guides Aaron Ramsey during the victory over the Baggies at the weekend . Ronald Koeman has impressed as manager so far and will look to continue his good work against Arsenal . Graziano Pelle has been an excellent signing for Southampton so far this season, scoring nine times . They definitely do now, though; the Serb's pace, skill and intelligence down Southampton's left has been a key feature of Koeman's attacking blueprint. Ryan Bertrand replaced Luke Shaw at left back and Saints fans have hardly noticed the £31m man's departure. Even the decision to allow Chambers to leave for Arsenal was part of a grand plan: to allow Nathaniel Clyne to fully establish himself as the club's first-choice right back. Dusan Tadic (right) has added pace, skill and intelligence to Southampton's left-hand side . He's not only accomplished that task, but he is now, arguably, England's first-choice right back. And following an astonishing run of 11 wins in 12 games, Southampton found themselves in the top four last month. Those who doubted how they'd cope without Lallana, Shaw, Lambert and Chambers were eating their words. But two games without a win has once again cast doubt on Southampton. So while the south coast pretenders occupy a seat at the top table they must fear they'll lose more talent to the likes of Arsenal if they maintain their remarkable start to the season.

England are 2-0 down in the seven-match series after back-to-back defeats in Colombo, and will need a win in Hambantota to drag themselves back into the series. Cook's side know they need to improve in all areas after being bowled out for 185 in the second one-day international before watching Sri Lanka stroll to their target inside 35 overs. England dropped Ian Bell and brought Alex Hales back to bat at No 3 in the third one-day international against Sri Lanka.

"The father of the four brothers, who left Australia to fight in Syria, has revealed a mysterious man had been in close contact with one of his sons just weeks before he fled the country to fight for the Islamic State. Issam El Baf said he couldn't tell what his son Bilal, 25, and the unknown man were doing and but he would come by the family home once every fortnight or each week. Mr El Baf said Bilal had been friends with the man for a few weeks. This comes as pictures emerged of Taha El Baf, the youngest of the four Western Sydney brothers. Taha El Baf, 17, and his older siblings – two of whom weigh over 140kg and have been described as too unfit to be terrorist fighters – flew via Turkey to join the extremist group last month. The distraught father of the four brothers said he has not heard from them since receiving a text saying 'see you in paradise'. Scroll down for video . Bassima (left) and Issam El Baf (right) - the parents of four brothers from Sydney's south-west who left Australia to fight in Syria . Muslim community leader Dr Jamal Rifi (centre) pictured with concerned parents of four boys . El Baf, who was in his final year of high school at Birrong Boys High School before he fled his family home in Yagoona, was a promising student and played for a local rugby league team, while his brothers had stable jobs. Before they were due to come home last month, the parents received a text stating: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in paradise'. Bilad al-Sham is a region in Syria. Despite the text, parents Bassima and Issam El Baf went to the airport to pick up their sons but they never arrived. They now fear their boys have been lured into the clutches of the IS terrorist organisation. Their father Issam El Baf said he hadn't heard anything since receiving the haunting text. 'It's bad, very bad,' he said. 'It's very frustrating. We haven't heard anything for three weeks.' Authorities tracked the sons down in Turkey after the family alerted them but it is believed they have since crossed the border into Syria. Taha El Baf, 17, from Yagoona, and his three older brothers flew to Syria to join the Islamic State last month . The 17-year-old also appeared in a school anti-bullying video which was posted to YouTube last year . More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls. In a statement last month, their mother pleaded with them to come home. 'My sons, you are dear to us. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. 'Come back. We love you.' Last month, leading Islamic community leader Dr Jamal Rifi said revealed two of the four Sydney brothers are 'obese' and may be snubbed by fellow terrorists if they eat all their rations. Dr Rifi said the men would not make good foot soldiers for the terror group, and believes they will be used for propaganda videos instead. When the brothers sent their shocked mother a one line text message saying they had arrived safely in Syria last month, she thought it was a cruel joke. Dr Jamal Rifi said two of the brothers are over 140kg and would not make good foot soldiers for IS . The message read: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in Paradise.' One of the brothers had initially told the mother that he won four tickets to Thailand and he was going to take his brothers with him. The parents say if they knew their sons - Omar, 28, Bilal, 25, Hamza, 23, and 17-year-old Taha - were going to Syria they would never have driven them to the airport. Mr El Baf said there was nothing to make him or his wife think their sons would travel to Syria. 'They have been brought up fairly highly educated, went to a good school,' he said on Wednesday. 'They are very good kids. They never play in the street ... they were always home with us.' Ms El Baf could barely speak through her tears as she pleaded with her boys to come home. 'They are my babies, still my babies,' she said. Dr Rifi told radio station 2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back. 'We are hoping the fact that because two of them are quite obese they will not good foot soldiers, they are over 140 kg. 'People are going to realise what are we going to do with them? Are they going to eat al the food and you can't even run on the field.' Dr Rifi said the family was trying to get messages to the brothers but they had not responded and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS. He explained the family had given all the information to the authorities who were trying to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. Their mother is of Lebanese descent and their father is a taxi driver, they also have another brother and sister living at home. Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) Dr Rifi added they were 'simple boys' who could not organise trip properly, and he revealed they had missed the first flight they had booked and had to re-book one for the next day. He said: 'They have no life experience. They (the parents) had no idea what their kids were planning such a move, these are ordinary kids who live at home, they showed no sign of radicalisation.' The fifth son went to meet a flight that was coming in from Thailand last month, hoping it was a joke. Dr Rifi said the family had alerted the authorities to the brothers' departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. It emerged on Saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south-west Sydney - as far as Turkey and alerted the family last week. Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar',The Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police,' he said.
