"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . A month after insisting it remained 'some distance' from being able to stage the Open in Northern Ireland for the first time since 1951, the R&A is set to announce Royal Portrush will host the championship in 2019. Rumours of the Open returning to Portrush have been circulating for some time, with reports on May 11 claiming a deal had been done for 2019, 68 years after Max Faulkner won the only Open staged outside England and Scotland. The R&A's initial response on Twitter labelled such reports as 'Portrush rumours' and a statement issued later read: 'As part of our commitment to examine the feasibility of staging an Open Championship at Portrush, The R&A continues to discuss this at a conceptual level with Royal Portrush Golf Club and the Northern Ireland Executive. Magnificent: The green on the par 4, 5th hole 'White Rocks' at Royal Portrush . 'Discussions have been positive but we are still some distance from being in a position to take The Open to Northern Ireland.' However, it is understood an announcement is expected to be made shortly, possibly on Monday to coincide with the first day of the Amateur Championship which is being staged at Portrush and Portstewart. The R&A denied reports last summer that the Open was set to be held at Portrush in 2018. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson admitted that it is 'a fantastic golf course', but concerns remained over the infrastructure required to stage a major and Dawson feels the current nine-course Open rota is 'about right.' Portrush has not hosted a major championship since the 1951 Open, but the Irish Open drew massive crowds there in 2012 and the likes of major champions Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Graeme McDowell have been lobbying on Portrush's behalf. It has also been suggested that the R&A would hasten their decision after Portrush emerged as a surprise contender to stage the US PGA Championship. Picturesque: A view over the 4th fairway and 7th green in evening light on the Valley Course at Royal Portrush . The PGA of America is studying the impact of holding the event outside the United States, with the earliest possible date in 2020. It had been thought that Asia would be the most likely venue, but PGA of America president Ted Bishop said in November last year that he was interested in Portrush. Portrush native McDowell, whose brother works at the club, said at the time: 'It's always been a dream of mine to play the Open there but the US PGA would do nicely. 'It's very bizarre and an amazing statement. I couldn't believe it and read it three times. I had heard the US PGA was looking at going global, which is a very positive step forward, but I was expecting Asia, not the north coast of Ireland. 'Even if it never comes to fruition it's a great boost to be mentioned in that breath. My brother Gary is on the greenkeeping staff there and he will have a spring in his step.'","The R&A is set to announce Royal Portrush will host the Open Championship in 2019 .

"By . Freya Noble . Casey Veal, pictured here with her baby Zayden, said she wants her son's legacy to be one of happiness . Nearly two years ago to the day, Casey Veal lost her  baby when a drug-crazed intruder broke into her home and beat her 10-month-old boy Zayden Veal-Whitting to death. On June 15, 2012, Zayden was killed in a senseless and unprovoked attack, bludgeoned over the head with a homemade baton more than 25 times. The man found guilty of the brutal killing, Harley Hicks, was 19 and high on the drug ice at the time. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. Hicks was on a drug-fueled crime spree which included a series of other break-ins on that night night in Bendigo, Victoria. Despite maintaining his innocence over the murder of Zayden, the Crown has called for a life sentence for Hicks. Casey told the MailOnline she knew the killer in high school, but had no connection with him since, nor at the time of her son’s murder. During a plea hearing in the Supreme Court in Bendigo, Crown prosecutor Michele Williams described the attack as 'an evil killing without any real, rational explanation'. 'This killing falls within the worst case category of murders and as such we call for a life sentence,' Ms Williams said. News of this brutal and unprovoked attack shocked not only the community in Bendigo, but people all around Australia. But Casey insists she doesn’t want people to remember her second-born boy as the baby who was beaten to death. Scroll down for video . After Zayden's (right) death, Casey had her older son Xavier (left) removed from her care for four months . ‘I want everyone to remember him as Zayden, as the little boy that was really happy and that was taken too soon. ‘Instead of “the murdered baby” or “the bludgeoned baby”…we know he died traumatically beyond what words can express. Even I can’t express that and I’ve seen it, it’s beyond horrible but I don’t want people to remember him as that.’ A court heard that Hicks broke into Casey's house as part of a string of burglaries, and unplugged the baby monitor before he struck Zayden, his possible motive said to be to silence the baby. When Casey awoke the next morning her eldest son Xavier let her know all the doors were open in the house, and they soon discovered they'd been robbed as wallets and other belongings were missing, with their car also broken into. It was then Casey discovered her youngest child, bruised and covered in blood, beaten almost beyond recognition. There was 'blood everywhere' and 'his face was swollen and bruised, he was unresponsive,' she said in court according to the Bendigo Advertiser. The murder weapon was later discovered with both Hick's and Zayden's DNA on it, at Hick's property. Casey, 24, now wants her child’s legacy to be a positive one, and she is trying to combat the stigma and the silence of parents who have their children taken from them too soon. ‘I want it to be at a point where it’s not weird or taboo anymore, where it’s just normal,’ she told the MailOnline. Harley Hicks, pictured here in a police interview, was found guilty of Zayden's murder and is set to be sentenced on Friday . ‘For them to speak their names and feel freely enough to do that… they can talk about them and whenever they’re comfortable they can tell the story of their child.’ Xavier, now nearly five, is Casey’s eldest child and was taken away from his mother by the Department of Human Services (DHS) almost immediately after his little brother’s death. ‘I didn’t know what to do, because I’d had at least one child since I was 19 and I’d always had someone to look after and then it was just me again at 22,’ Casey said.' In a harrowing piece Casey penned herself published on Mamamia, the 24-year-old described in heartbreaking detail how her life has dramatically altered since the murder of her young son. 'A nightmare I never woke from again. I awoke to find my son, my world, my mini me, stolen…' She has also spoken of of Xavier’s trust issues since the death of his brother, and claims the way her family was treated by the DHS still affects her relationship with her eldest son. ‘They were very inconsiderate, compassionless; they had no empathy at all. They had no information bar what they had read in the newspaper, which wasn’t accurate at times to start with. 'I think he [Xavier] suffered the most, he’s very similar to me I think, he thinks a lot, he expresses passion and he’s very empathetic. Casey says if Zayden (left) hadn't been killed it could have been Xavier (right), and she has to let go of the what-ifs . Supervised visits were the only way Casey was able to see Xavier for months, as she had to be cleared of Zayden’s murder before her first son was returned. She struggled daily without either of her sons by her side, and claimed the DHS were misinformed and acted insensitively during some of her darkest days. Casey said she was blindsided by officials from the service who turned up at her house the same day of the murder and tried to ban her from seeing her older son Xavier at all for the days following. ‘They tried to make it from the day Zayden died [Friday], all that weekend and the Monday that I wasn’t allowed to have any contact with my son [Xavier] at all. ‘In the long run they made sure I wasn’t a drug dealer after I’d already been cleared by the police and the police charged Harley. [Then] once they cleared me and made sure I’m okay and I can parent they gave me a half-arsed sorry and gave him back. After putting me through an emotional hell for months.’ Since the attack Casey has struggled with crippling anxiety, depression and struggles in social situations. Casey and her family were due to move out of their home the day after Zayden was murdered, and most of the house was already packed into boxes. But she said she can’t let the thoughts of what could have happened rule her life. Casey hopes that speaking out about the loss of Zayden will encourage other parents to share their experiences . ‘I can think about what-ifs until I am 100, easily, the biggest one is what if I put Zayden in with me that night cause he was sick, like I used to, and I thought no I don’t want to break the sleeping cycle. ‘The constant thought of that was what if he had hurt Xavier? Would he have hurt my older son? ‘If I take one out of the equation, it could mean it takes another one, it could have been me instead or it could have been my partner at the time instead,’ she said. ‘I for a long time blamed myself for it, and no matter which way I went I can’t find any answers for any where it’s my fault.’ One of the hardest times of the year for Casey and Xavier can be around Christmas, when all Xavier wishes for is his little brother to come home. ‘He’ll ask for a toy or a balloon to give to Zayden, or he’ll ask for his brother to come back. I think he understands he can’t come back but he thinks if he just keeps crying it might work just once,’ Casey said. Other days can be just as hard, and Casey shared a heartbreaking anecdote of the struggles her older son, who was just three when he lost his baby brother, still faces. Xavier (left) has been the most affected by his brother's death, and his mum Casey (right) says on Christmas his only wish is for Zayden to come home . ‘Some days he will cry for no reason…he just goes to his room and he’ll be very quiet for a time and I’ll ask “what are you doing little buddy?” and I’ll go in there and he has his little head in his hands and he just cries. ‘He’s only five in a couple of weeks and some days you would just think he’s an adult. He’s been through so much in such a short amount of time, he’s really resilient and I couldn’t be prouder of him, but he does say so many adult things and he’s looked after me, which he never should have had to do, ever.' Despite the unimaginable hardship Casey and her family have faced over the past two years, she's doing her best to keep moving forward with her life. She is living with a new partner, and works in the centre of town, though sometimes finds it hard when she is recognised. The mother now looks at the death of her child almost philosophically, refusing to hide her grief and insisting on speaking out about Zayden. ‘I think he was sent to me for a reason, so I try to speak out as much as I can about child loss so that it doesn’t stay hidden anymore and it’s not shameful to speak out. ‘I like to think he chose me for a reason and he knew it’d be short and horrible but that I could handle it, and that he watches over me every day. 'I like to think that one day I will see him again but until then he’ll watch over and help me going where I’m going, and that gives me that little bit of hope.’ The boy's mother said she believes the loss of Zayden (left), pictured here was big brother Xavier was for a reason and he now watches over her .

"By . Emily Crane . and Chris Pleasance . Toyota is recalling 2.27 million vehicles worldwide and 19,600 in Australia over fears a faulty airbag inflator could explode and cause a fire. The company said it was notifying owners of vehicles involved in a 2013 safety recall to replace airbag inflators, having previously asked dealers to inspect airbags and only replace those judged to be faulty. The recall involves about 20 Toyota . models, including some Corolla compacts made in . 2003-2004 and some 2002-2004 Lexus SC 430 coupes. Toyota is recalling 19,600 vehicles in Australia and 2.27 million worldwide over fears the airbag inflators could explode . 'The involved vehicles were equipped with front passenger airbag inflators which could have been assembled with improperly manufactured propellant wafers,' the car maker said in a statement. '(That) could cause the inflator to rupture and the front passenger airbag to deploy abnormally in the event of a crash.' A company spokesman in Tokyo said it had received a complaint from a Japanese customer who said his passenger seat was burned from the defect. The spokesman added that no serious injuries or accidents had been reported. Of the total number of vehicles affected by the current recall, 650,000 are in Japan and 1.62 million in the rest of the world. Nissan and Honda are also investigating whether to recall more vehicles after parts maker Takata admitted that it had not fully identified the flawed components during a 2013 recall. Last year carmakers including Toyota, Honda, Nissan . Motor Co and BMW recalled 3.6 million vehicles due to . problems with the airbag inflator that could potentially explode and . injure the driver or passengers. Shares of Takata dropped after the announcement and were down over 4 percent when the Tokyo market closed. The Takata recall in 2013 was the largest airbag-related recall in history and came after a series of accidents and at least two deaths allegedly caused by faulty airbags. In 2013 Nissan, Honda, Toyota and BMW recalled a total of 3.6million vehicles after the fault was discovered. Nissan and Honda are investigating whether they are affected by this new fault . Takata admitted it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of propellants used to inflate airbags, some of which were used in Honda vehicles .","Toyota is recalling 2.27 million cars worldwide over airbag inflator fault .

"By . Katy Winter . A woman has undergone plastic surgery costing £8500 in order to feel beautiful on her 21st birthday. Sophie Cooper, 20, from New Eltham, South East London, hated her wonky nose and flat, uneven breasts. So she was thrilled when her parents offered to help pay for the life-changing surgery. Sophie Cooper, left, pictured with her mother Angela, right, desperately wanted to feel beautiful on her 21st birthday . Sophie had hated her nose since childhood: pictured before (left) and after (right) her rhinoplasty . Sophie, picture in hospital after surgery, says her nose used to be too wide and had a huge hump in the middle . Sophie had surgery on her nose and breasts just in time for her birthday, and says she now loves her new look. Sophie said: 'Pictures from your 21st stay with you forever and the last thing I wanted was to look back and remember how I looked. 'I booked my operations in a few months before my birthday as I was worried I everything wouldn't be all healed if I left it too late.

'My parents knew how much I hated my nose, I wasn't worried about telling them about the operation I planned to have in time for my birthday.

It was wide and had a huge hump in the middle - I always felt like it didn't match any other features on my face. Sophie holds up a picture of her own face before surgery and says she is delighted with the results . 'My boobs were impossible to buy bras for as they were uneven sizes. 'It was awful.' Sophie had promised her parents she would wait until she was older before she began looking into cosmetic surgery. Last year she began researching cosmetic surgery clinics for a nose job and came across the MYA group. Sophie said: 'MYA offered a free initial consultation which was great. 'I booked in to have a rhinoplasty for the following year.' Soon after her consultation Sophie started saving for the operation - unaware that her mother was planning to help her pay for it. Angela said: 'We knew how much Sophie wanted a new nose. 'It wasn't until she booked it that we told her that we were going to help her pay for it. 'She was so surprised when we told her it was going to be part of her 21st birthday present. 'I was so happy for Sophie, it was great being able to surprise her with the cash for her new nose.' Sophie is petrified of needles and underwent a hypnotherapy session before the operation went ahead. She said: 'It was scary knowing I would need a needle in order to go under anaesthetic. 'But my therapy session helped calm my nerves.' Just six weeks after Sophie underwent a rhinoplasty, she went under the knife once again after deciding upon a breast augmentation. Sophie said: 'I booked my boobs in after flicking through one of MYA's books, they had loads of great before and after breast augmentation pictures. Sophie had promised her parents she would wait until she was older before going under the knife, and was delighted when her mother Angela (right) announced they would help her pay for the operations . Despite her needle phobia, Sophie feels that having two operations in six weeks was worth it . 'One of the women featured had uneven boobs identical to mine and hers looked amazing after surgery. 'I knew that by booking in both procedures at the beginning of the year that I would recover in time for my birthday. 'It was important that I could feel beautiful for my birthday. 'I had my nose job in March and in May I had my boobs done - I went from a 34B to a 34D - I feel so much more confident.' Sophie is delighted that she has been able to heal from both operations in time for her birthday . Sophie is now looking forward to a big night out with friends for her birthday. She said: 'I'm finally happy with my appearance and I'm excited to celebrate my birthday in August. 'Undergoing two operations in six weeks was definitely worth how I feel now. 'I can't praise MYA enough - and the aftercare has been fantastic.' http://www.mya.co.uk .","Sophie began hating her looks, especially her nose, as a child .

"By . Bianca London . When Kelly and Sharon Osbourne announced that they were unveiling a 26-piece make-up range for MAC Cosmetics, beauty aficionados couldn't control their excitement. And now, the mother-daughter duo are preparing for a stampede as they get set to unveil their new beauty range in the UK early next week. And if that wasn't enough, they're coming to London to share their beauty tricks, too. The collection is a vibrant selection of statement-making hues for eyes, lips, face and nails and the range is encased in limited-edition packaging inspired by the duo's signature red and violet colour palettes. It's finally here! Kelly, 29, and Sharon Osbourne, 61, have unveiled their range for MAC and will be coming to London to show beauty buffs how to copy their signature looks . Kelly, 29, took to her website to reveal how excited she was about the big launch. She wrote: 'It is such an honor for both me and my mother to be the first mother daughter duo to design our individual collections for MAC Cosmetics. 'Ever since I can remember, MAC has been my favorite make-up, not only for their wide range of colors but their ingenuity and forward thinking and how they are able to change public perception through the use of make-up. 'I had so much fun working with the MAC team, playing with pigments and learning what really goes into makeup, because let’s think about it Ladies and Gentlemen ;) … we put make-up on our face almost everyday, we should know what’s in it. Behind the scenes: Kelly has admitted that she is the inspiration behind the range because she wanted to create a collection that she would love and wear herself . A hard day in the office: Sharon, 61, looks better than ever as she has her make-up applied whilst enjoying a nice glass of champagne backstage on the shoot . 'It was . really important while designing this collection that I stayed true to . myself while creating fashion forward pigments that applied the right . way would look amazing on almost every woman of every color and every . size.' The Fashion Police host has also revealed the inspiration behind the range to be none other than herself! Speaking . to ET Fashion, she said: 'I keep giggling when I say this because I was . my inspiration, and I know it's really narcissistic to say but I wanted . to stay true to me and the colours I love, but at the same time, kind of . slightly tweaking them a bit so they're a bit more for every woman . because I know my taste isn't for everyone. Joking around: The Fashion Police presenter and her mother mess around backstage on the shoot for their beauty range . 'So I had to leave my ego at the door with this, and really think about it.' The line, which includes make-up tools, a mineralized face duo, lip pencils, eyeliner and blusher, comes in bright and pastel shades (courtesy of Kelly), while Sharon champions deep bronzes and dark red shades. Sharon, 61, and daughter Kelly are even coming to Selfridges in London on Monday to offer their best beauty advice as part of the store's Beauty Project. They will join MAC Senior Artists John Stapleton and . Neil Young at an exclusive . demonstration where they will share how to achieve their signature . looks.

"By . Dan Bloom . Shock: Dr John Sentamu said life expectancy gaps in Britain were a 'human rights abuse' The Archbishop of York has said Britons should not be 'smug' when they see poverty in Brazil because gaps in life expectancy in the UK are a 'human rights abuse'. John Sentamu said shocking photos from Rio de Janiero ahead of the World Cup, where plush hotels sit alongside poverty-stricken favelas, were not the only story of inequality in the world. Instead he said poverty, poor education, unemployment, high crime levels and isolation affected towns, cities, villages and the countryside in Britain and the rest of the European Union. The 64-year-old Archbishop, who is leading an inquiry into whether to introduce a national 'living wage', told a conference today Britain was lagging behind the rest of Europe. The nation needs to tackle health and income inequality, youth unemployment and relatively low levels of happiness in children compared with other countries, he told the international fairness conference in York. He singled out gaps in life expectancy between richest and poorest neighbourhoods saying that this was 'perhaps the biggest human rights abuse' in rich developed countries - worse, perhaps than a similar period of detention without trial. 'Within almost all British cities there are differences in life expectancy between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods of anywhere from five to 12 years,' he added. Dr Sentamu spoke after figures revealed babies born in leafy suburbs of Guildford, Surrey, can expect to live up to 20 years longer than those in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Boys born in Guildford and Waverly can expect to live to 70.3 years and girls 71.3 years - but 220 miles away, babies in Bradford can expect to live to only 52.5 years for boys and 51.6 for girls. The figures were released in March by the Office for National Statistics. Dr Sentamu said he believed a large part of the difference in life expectancies was due to 'psycho social' factors such as social status and experiences in early childhood. Wide gulf: Figures released in March (pictured) showed a huge gap in life expectancy across England . 'As a nation we need to protect the principles of (Aneurin) Bevan that allow each man, woman and child access to health care whenever they need it,' he said. 'But we also need to work hard on building safe and caring communities in which people can flourish.' He added that income inequality seemed to make societies 'more anti-social'. 'By increasing social status differences - and social distances - greater inequality increases all the problems associated with social status - drugs, violence, poor educational performance, teenage births,' he said. 'Greater income inequality has so many damaging effects because it amplifies and strengthens all the ways in which social class imprints itself on us throughout life.' Have-nots: Dr Sentamu said images of poverty in Rio de Janiero (pictured) shouldn't make Britons feel 'smug' If we want a happier and less divided society, he said, than reducing the scale of income differences between rich and poor would be an 'important step forward', he said. Dr Sentamu’s spoke in November of his shock at reading of a rise in hospital admissions for malnutrition and food poverty within his own diocese, a phenomenon he described as 'a dark stain on our consciences'. He said the need for Church action was now more urgent than ever as 'hard-pressed' people found they were on a 'down escalator' in life. Dr Sentamu is the chairman of the Living Wage Commission, which is examining the case for introducing a “Living Wage” of £8.80 in London and £7.65 outside the capital. The commission is due to report later this month and its findings could be made law by the government.","John Sentamu, 64, said poverty in Brazil should not make Britain 'smug'

"By . Ashley Pearson . Father's Day can be a bit tricky. First of all men always seem harder to buy for and this year I am determined to avoid the whole tie, cufflinks, socks and whiskey thing. Adding to the pressure, it's my husband's first Father's Day as a qualifier and I want it to be really special. As for the whole gifting process, the two non-lingerie arenas certain to exite him, electronics and power tools, I have utterly abandoned as I always seem to get it wrong, spending far too much money on contraptions that seem massively useful to me but are met with pretend enthusiasm and fake smiles. Give Dad a real surprise this Father's day by getting him something other than cufflinks! Thus I have compiled a useful guide if like me; you still have some shopping to do: .

"By . Emma Innes . Twin brothers are getting stronger each day after they were saved by laser surgery while still in the womb. Nathaniel and Joshua Cavalier will be four months old this week, despite being given only a 33 per cent chance of survival. Their mother, Verena, has also seen her twins fight off blood poisoning and meningitis - and only now are they the normal size of newborns. Twins Joshua and Nathaniel Cavalier, now four months old, are thriving after surviving laser surgery in the womb. They had to have an operation after developing a potentially fatal condition called twin to twin transfusion syndrome. They are pictured with their mother, Verena, and sister, Magdalena . The teacher, from Rayleigh, Essex, had to undergo an operation after it was found the twins had developed a rare and potentially fatal condition known as twin to twin transfusion syndrome. The condition, in which one twin has a higher blood volume than the other, can occur in identical twins whose umbilical cords are attached to a shared placenta. It was spotted by a consultant at Southend Hospital during a routine scan, and sparked an extraordinary sequence of events that saw Mrs Cavalier have surgery on the same day. She said: ‘I was diagnosed with the condition in December, during a scan at 21 weeks into my pregnancy. ‘Because the hospital knew I was expecting identical twins, I was having scans every two weeks. ‘I was very lucky because it can develop very rapidly and I wasn't due another scan for a week, but my consultant said she would do it early as she was going on holiday. The babies were born at just 31 weeks but are now the size of average newborns. Image shows Nathaniel . The babies were given just a 33 per cent chance of survival before the operation. Image shows Joshua . ‘She spotted signs of the condition and I was told to go to King's College Hospital in London. ‘That was at noon and by 5pm I reached the hospital. They did an ultrasound and confirmed the condition.’ Amazingly, an hour later Professor Kypros Nicolaides performed the surgery. Mrs Cavalier said: ‘He inserted a laser into my tummy and severed the connections between the babies to stop one baby taking too much from the other.’ Things moved so rapidly, Mrs Cavalier only just had time to call her husband Paul to let him know she was being operated on. She added: ‘One minute I was at Southend Hospital and the next I was on the train. ‘My husband was at work so I had to make the decisions myself. He got there just as they started the surgery. Twin to twin transfusion syndrome can affect identical twins who share a placenta. It is caused by abnormal connecting blood vessels in the twins' placenta. This causes an imbalanced blood flow from one twin to the other. It leaves one baby with a greater blood volume than the other. It affects 10 to 15 per cent of identical twins who share a placenta. If it goes undetected, there is a very high risk of the babies dying or being left severely disabled. There are a number of treatment options, including laser treatment, but in some cases it is necessary to sacrifice one twin in a bid to save the other. Source: NHS Choices . ‘It was an awful decision to have to make because of the risk of the surgery, but there was no time to lose. The longer we waited, the higher the chance the babies could die or be brain damaged.’ The procedure was carried out under a local anaesthetic with Mrs Cavalier, 32, fully aware of what was happening to her and her babies. She said: ‘They had a camera attached to the laser with a monitor nearby. ‘I could see what they were doing. I could see a little hand moving about and I prayed the babies wouldn't move and get caught by the laser. ‘It took 45 minutes and then I was sent to recover in a quiet room. Another scan showed the babies were both well and I was allowed to go home.’ Despite its success, the couple were told the chances of both twins surviving the surgery was only 33 per cent. They then had to face a 20 per cent chance of a miscarriage over the following six weeks. Mrs Cavalier added: ‘I'd had two miscarriages before, so I was convinced I would lose them. ‘I went back to work because I didn't want to sit at home and panic. ‘At 29 weeks, my waters broke. However, I didn't go into labour for another two weeks, which gave them vital extra time. I was also given cortisone in that time to help the babies' lungs develop.’ The twins arrived on February 12 by caesarean section. Nathaniel weighed 3lb 12oz and his brother Joshua weighed just 3lb 1oz. Both had to overcome a potentially fatal infection of the stomach and blood poisoning, but survived thanks to Southend Hospital's neonatal unit. They went home to be with their sister, two-year-old Magdalena, on March 9, but had to return after catching bacterial meningitis. However, they pulled through again and now weigh 8lb 3oz and 6lb 10oz. Mrs Cavalier said: ‘They are four months old now. People ask me how old they are and are very surprised when I tell them. ‘We owe Professor Nicolaides so much. Without him, we wouldn't have our boys. We would have lost them. ‘We are really grateful to Southend Hospital neonatal unit as well. They were all wonderful there.’","Nathaniel and Joshua Cavalier developed twin to twin transfusion syndrome .

"By . Emma Innes . They are not the photos that any parents would ever want to take. But the mothers and father of these youngsters hope that by sharing them, they will raise awareness of the gruelling journey cancer has taken them on. They posted the heart-rending pictures of their children before, during and after their treatment on a designated Facebook page in a bid to show what their children have been through. The parents of children being treated for cancer at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital have shared pictures of them before, during and after treatment in a bid to raise awareness of the disease. Image shows Ruby Mae who was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of five . The photos of children, being treated on . Ward 84 at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital (RMCH), were shared in . response to the ‘no make-up selfie’ trend sweeping the internet. The parents feared that make-up free selfies could trivialise cancer and wanted to show how the disease really affects people. The page, which tells the stories of 60 patients, has already had more than 4,700 ‘likes’. Heartfelt tributes have also been left to children who passed away from the disease. The aim of the page is also to raise money for the RMCH charity and other causes supporting children with cancer. Eleanor Massey, 30, was one of the parents who came up with the idea for the page. The parents were inspired to set up the Facebook page by the 'no make-up selfie craze' which they felt trivialised the disease. Image shows Josh, three, who had lymphoma . The children in the photos were all treated on the hospital's Ward 84. Image shows Mackenzie, six, who suffered from acute lymphoblastic lymphoma .

Her son Jacob, three, was treated on Ward 84 after being diagnosed with leukaemia in December 2013 and is now in remission. Ms Massey, said: ‘We’ve always had a Facebook group for people whose children are being treated on Ward 84 and a lot of people were offended by the ‘no make-up selfie’ thing. ‘They were concerned people were just posting photos but not understanding they also had to make a donation to cancer charities. ‘We wanted to show the real face of cancer and have also asked people to describe their child’s symptoms as lots of parents want to know what to look out for. ‘We hope by letting people into our world a bit we can raise awareness of childhood cancers and raise money for charities who have helped us.’ The Facebook page is also designed to raise money for children's cancer charities. Image shows Euan who was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a type of bone cancer - in 2003 at the age of four . Image shows Megan, 14, from Stockport, who developed leukaemia . Sophie, from Wythenshawe, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a nerve cell cancer - when she was four . Clair Beswick’s daughter Lily was also treated on Ward 84 - but sadly passed away eight months after being diagnosed with soft tissue cancer rhabdomyosarcoma at just one year old. Ms Beswick, who lives in Bolton, said: ‘It’s good that it raised so much money but I found the no make-up selfie thing quite indulgent. This is our way of raising awareness of cancer.’ Sarah Naismith, head of charities for RMCH, said: ‘The Faces of Ward 84 page is inspiring and heart-breaking in equal measure and we applaud the bravery of the patients’ families in sharing their stories.’ For more details go to facebook.com/Facesofward84 or to donate text RMCH14 and the amount you wish to donate to 70070.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The solar system is rich in asteroids - there are thousands said to be in the vicinity of Earth and hundreds of thousands more towards Jupiter, many of which reside in the asteroid belt. In a mesmerising animation, astronomer and gamer Scott Manley from San Francisco has revealed the multitude of these asteroids that have been spotted since 1980. As the animation progresses, more and . more asteroids appear which reflects how our capabilities . to find them increased dramatically at the turn of the century. The animation, with music by Kevin Macleod called The Way Out, shows a model of the inner solar system with various objects in orbit. An asteroid . is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions in the early solar . system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets. At the centre is the sun, and the blue dots in orbit around it are the innermost planets in order: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Towards the edge of the screen is Jupiter, and between this gas giant and Mars is where the asteroid belt is located. Over time, astronomers have found more than 600,000 asteroids in the inner solar system. Of these, about 10,000 are Near-Earth objects (NEOs) and, in turn, almost 1,500 are Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). These are ones that are said to potentially pose a threat to Earth soon or in hundreds of years. According to Nasa, our planet is currently bombarded with more than 100 tonnes of dust and sand-sized particles every day. This graph from Nasa shows how our capabilities to find asteroids have increased drastically in the 15 years, thanks to new and improved asteroid-hunting telescopes being built on Earth and launched into space. About 10 per cent of these are potentially hazardous but don't pose any immediate threat . Every year, on average, a car-sized asteroid plunges into the atmosphere, burning up before it reaches the surface. Every 2,000 years, a meteoroid the size of a football field makes it through the atmosphere and hits the ground, causing significant damage. And it is estimated that once in a few million years an object large enough to threaten civilisation as we know it enters our atmosphere. This latest animation comes just days after a large asteroid dubbed 2014 HQ124 came within 770,000 miles (1.25 million km) of Earth. Although there was little to no chance of it hitting Earth, it highlights how vulnerable our planet can be to large rocks drifting through space. An asteroid (illustration shown) is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions in the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt, but a growing number are being found that are locate closer to Earth or towards the inner solar system .","A video shows all asteroids found between the sun and Jupiter in 34 years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teenager who ballooned to 19st after eating two dinners every night shed 6st to take his dream girl to his school prom. At 15 years old, Waira Mungai, was obese as a result of eating fried chicken, steaks, mashed potato and gravy in double portions every night, along with half a bag of Doritos and two litres of fizzy pop. He rarely exercised, staying indoors for hours playing computer games, isolating himself from his peers. Waira Mungai, now 21, lost 6st to drop from 19st (left) to 13st (right). He achieved this by eating healthily . He decided to lose weight after ripping the last pair of jeans that still fitted him when bending to put his rucksack into the back of a car, meaning he was forced to go to school wearing shorts in the middle of winter. After months of eating only blueberry shakes, chicken or tuna breasts and occasionally brown rice or fruit and a strict exercise regime, he managed to lose 6st and pluck up the courage to ask the girl he’d been obsessed with throughout school to the prom. They have remained in a happy relationship since and he is now 21. He blames his weight gain on his family’s culture of eating unhealthily, combined with depression because his father left the family when he was very young. Waira, from Kansas, told the magazine Man V Fat: ‘My family always ate fried foods, heavily-processed foods, high-sugar foods and a lot of very big portions. 'Without a father figure in my life I possibly would have been overweight anyway but because he was gone there was a hole I was trying to fill. I was unhappy from a young age. As I grew up food numbed those feelings.’ Waira (pictured during his weight loss) put on weight because he ate two fast food dinners every night and drank litres of fizzy drinks every day . Waira (pictured as a child) decided to lose weight after he ripped the only pair of trousers that fitted him by bending over to put something in his car . Playing computer games became a way of escaping the reality of being fat and unpopular for Wiara. He said: ‘In video games I could escape, I didn't have to deal with the reality and I was in control. My avatar in the games was a lot thinner than I was - it was so clearly a wish-fulfilment thing.’ The tipping point came at the age of 15, when he was forced to wear shorts to school after ripping the last pair of jeans he could still fit into. He said: ‘I was getting into the car and I bent over to put my backpack in the car and my jeans just completely ripped. 'My mum was running late for work so she was shouting at me to get a move on. I had to run inside and in the middle of this snowy, frozen day I had to go to school in the only thing that would fit - a pair of shorts. Waira believes he gained weight because his family always ate junk food and he was given huge portions. He is pictured (left) before his weight loss and (right) now . Waira (pictured before his weight loss) started dating his childhood sweetheart after his weight loss . ‘Walking up to school there was a big glass window and I could see the reflection of my legs in the window. They were just huge and this feeling of sadness and disgust grew around me. That was the moment that I thought, you know what, I don't want to be like this anymore.’ He joined the local YMCA gym and began eating healthily, losing more than half a stone in a week. He said: ‘I restricted myself from eating any sugar - bananas even, processed foods - I went cold turkey. At the end of that first week I lost 9lb. And that was enough for me to believe that if I continued with this I really could change my life.’ After more than a year of dieting he came back to school after the summer holiday and his friends no longer recognised him. People he’d never met began to notice him for the first time. He describes how the attention was unwanted after years of isolating himself and fading into the background. ‘It was the most uncomfortable feeling I've ever had because I was a bigger person who didn't exist, I just wasn't used to being seen,’ he said. Waira has now set up his own fitness company to help other people lose weight. He is pictured (left) before his weight loss and (right) afterwards . ‘I remember people would look at me and smile and I'd turn around thinking someone was behind me, but it was me they were smiling at. To be completely honest the world is a different place when you're not obese.’ Now, he has set up his own fitness company, WairaFit, to inspire others to lose weight. He says the best advice for those wishing to shed the pounds is to visualise a goal: a new body or a confident future persona. ‘Every single day I was on that elliptical at the beginning I was sweating and panting away but in my head I had already become the thin and strong person I wanted to be. I had an image of what I looked like taking a girl to the junior prom,’ he said. ‘And you know what, I did take a girl to my junior prom. The girl I really, really liked all throughout middle school, all throughout high school. I was too afraid to ask her out when I was bigger, but I'm with that girl today – my story has a happy ending.’","At 15 years old Waira Mungai weighed 19st and was depressed .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . and Associated Press . Tokyo firm Softbank has unveiled a robot called Pepper, which it says can read human emotions . In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots. Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions. Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. It touched hands with Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, described by the firm as a Genesis or 'E.T.' moment. Pepper uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to study gestures, expressions and human speech tones. 'Our aim is to develop affectionate robots that can make people smile,' Son said. Robotic companions are hugely popular in Japan, but no companion robot has emerged as a major market success yet. Japanese electronics and entertainment company Sony discontinued the Aibo pet-dog robot in 2006, despite an outcry from its fans. At that time, Sony had developed a child-shaped entertainment robot similar to Pepper but much smaller, capable of dances and other charming moves. However, it never became a commercial product. Scroll down for video . The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands, appeared on a stage in a Tokyo, cooing and humming. It touched hands with Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son in a moment described by the firm as a Genesis or 'E.T.' moment . Mobile carrier, Softbank, said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1.130 or $1,900).  Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is shown interacting with the robot . Honda has developed the walking, talking Asimo robot, but that is too sophisticated and expensive for home use, and appears in Honda showrooms and at gala events only. Even then, it is prone to glitches because of its complexity. Many other Japanese companies, including Hitachi and Toyota, not to mention universities and startups, have developed various robots, that entertain and serve as companions. There is little emphasis on delivering on practical work, in contrast to industrial robots at factories and military robots for war. But the potential is great for intelligent machines as the number of elderly requiring care is expected to soar in rapidly-aging Japan in coming years. Pepper uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to study gestures, expressions and human speech tones. Pictured is Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son appearing on stage with Pepper . The 48 inch (121 cm) (48 inch) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) Pepper has no hair. but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. 'Our aim is to develop affectionate robots that can make people smile,' Masayoshi Son said (left) In Thursday's demonstration, Pepper sang, 'I want to be loved.' Softbank's chief executive (right), Masayoshi Son said Pepper can also dance and tell jokes . Robotics are already used to check on the elderly and monitor their health and safety, but they might also play a role in reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation. The prospect of robot overlords, friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years. But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist. This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims. A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly. This means. if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans. The 48 inch (121 cm) (48 inch) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots. Besides featuring the latest voice recognition, Pepper is loaded with more than a dozen sensors, including two touch sensors in its hands, three touch sensors on its head, and six laser sensors and three bumper sensors in its base. It also has two cameras and four microphones on its head and has Wi-Fi and ethernet networking capabilities. In Thursday's demonstration, Pepper sang, 'I want to be loved.' Softbank said Pepper can dance and tell jokes. 'I've believed that the most important role of robots will be as kind and emotional companions to enhance our daily lives, to bring happiness, constantly surprise us and make people grow,' said Bruno Maisonnier, founder and chief executive of Aldebaran, who appeared on the stage with Son. Aldebaran has produced more than 5,000 of its Nao humanoid, its first product, which is used for research and educational purposes.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The mystery of how farming techniques spread throughout Europe, signalling a significant shift away from hunting, has baffled scientists for decades. Now, the DNA of the first Near Eastern farmers living 10,000 years ago has revealed migration, rather than cultural adoption, was to blame. Experts believe genetic similarities between the DNA of the first Neolithic populations and the DNA of the first Catalan and German farmers, suggests small pioneering groups migrated across Europe, taking farming methods with them. The mitochondrial DNA of the first Near Eastern farmers (remains pictured) living 10,000 years ago has been sequenced. Experts believe genetic similarities between this DNA, and the DNA of the first Catalan and German farmers, suggests small groups migrated across Europe, taking farming methods with them . The Neolithic Revolution was the world's first verifiable revolution in agriculture. It saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures moving from hunting and gathering practices, to ones of farming and building small settlements. Archaeological evidence suggests the domestication of a number of animals and the growing of plants, evolved in different locations around the world, perhaps beginning in what is now Turkey around 12,000 years ago. The revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travelling men into settled communities who built villages and towns. Some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques. Others stored food for times of hunger, and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies. Scientists analysed samples dating to around 8,000BC from three sites located in the birthplace of Neolithic farming practices - in the Middle Euphrates basin and the oasis of Damascus, in modern Syria. It is thought that agricultural practices originated in a region of the Near East known as the ‘Fertile Crescent’ in around 12,000BC. These practices resulted in a profound social, cultural and economic transformation of human populations as communities became more settled and started founding the very first towns. Eva Fernández, an author of the study from the University of Barcelona, said: ‘The Neolithic Revolution rapidly expanded from these territories into Europe, where the hunter-gatherer subsistence economy - prevailing till then - was replaced by an agro pastoral (farming and livestock) producing system.' For the past 50 years, scientists have debated whether knowledge spread as the result of population migration, or cultural adoption. Different research fields including archaeology, physical anthropology, linguistics and human palaeogenetics have made contributions to the discussion. Scientists analysed samples dating to around 8,000BC from three sites located in the birthplace of Neolithic farming practices - in the Middle Euphrates basin (marked with shading) and the oasis of Damascus, in modern Syria (also marked) For the past 50 years, scientists have debated whether knowledge spread as the result of population migration, or cultural adoption. One of the sites from which the samples were taken is pictured . While there have been some breakthroughs in hinting at  the genetic composition of first Neolithic populations, this latest study, published in the journal PLOS Genetics by experts at University of Barcelona, Liverpool John Moores University, the Spanish National Research Council and the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, is the first to reveal their genetic makeup. They studied maternally inherited DNA from the first Neolithic farmers taken from samples. The sites are located in modern day Syria. Here, an archaeologist painstakingly reveals an ancient structure hidden by the earth . Professor Daniel Turbón, from the University of Barcelona, said the results ‘are the first ones regarding first Near Eastern farmers - in other words, the genetic stock of original Neolithic.’ ‘Conclusions of previous studies are based on the comparison with current Near East populations, as first agricultural societies and genetics have remained unknown until now.’ Genetic similarities have been observed between the mitochondrial DNA of first Neolithic populations and the DNA of first Catalan and German farmers. This suggests Neolithic expansion probably took place through pioneer migrations of small groups of people. The two main migration routes - Mediterranean and European - might have been genetically linked, the experts explained. Dr Fernández said: ‘The most significant conclusion is that the degree of genetic similarity between the populations of the Fertile Crescent and the ones of Cyprus an Crete supports the hypothesis that Neolithic spread in Europe took place through pioneer seafaring colonisation, not through a land-mediated expansion through Anatolia, as it was thought until now.’ Other scientists have already challenged the notion that ancient man – a group living after the Ice Age known as Proto-Indo-Europeans – spread from Anatolia in modern Turkey. Dr Turbón added: ‘Recent archaeological finds have proved that the Neolithic arrived in Cyprus around 10,600 years ago, some years after the first documentation of agricultural practices in the Near East.’ Architecture and burial models found in Cyprus’ sites are similar to the ones found in the Middle Euphrates basin, which ‘indicates a direct colonisation of these territories,’ he said. Radiocarbon dating of different objects from Neolithic sites in the Near East and Europe also suggests that a journey by sea was first made via Cyprus. The team of experts will analyse a larger number of human Neolithic samples from other regions of the Fertile Crescent in a bid to increase the number of genetic markers examined in the samples. It is thought agricultural practices originated in a region of the Near East known as the 'Fertile Crescent' in around 12,000BC. This resulted in a profound social, cultural and economic transformation of human populations as communities became more settled. Samples were taken from the ancient site pictured .","Genetic similarities between the DNA of the first Neolithic populations and the DNA of the first Catalan and German farmers have been spotted .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Passengers on European British Airways flights will soon be able to keep on top of their emails, check Facebook and stream films thanks to the introduction of high-speed in-flight broadband . The airline hopes the partnership with satellite firm Inmarsat will help it push ahead of rivals with the lure of super-fast and reliable internet across European airspace. It is thought the service could begin on domestic UK routes within three years before being rolled out across Europe, but how much it will cost has not yet been announced. From 2016 European British Airways flights will be kitted with high-speed Internet provided by London-based satellite firm Inmarsat. The company will be launching a satellite in 2016 to provide the service, which is expected to bridge the gap between airborne WiFi in the UK and the U.S. (stock image shown) A similar service in the United States, called Gogo, costs £3 ($5) per hour or just under £10 ($17) for a card with 24 hours loaded onto it. Following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia flight MH370 in March, Inmarsat announced last month it is going to track flights free of charge to prevent such a disaster happening again. A total of 11,000 commercial passenger planes will be monitored and followed by the satellite firm, which helped reveal the last position of MH370 in March. In addition, the firm will also provide a ‘position reporting’ tool in case flights veer off track, and a so-called ‘black box in the cloud’ to track real-time data remotely. This remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course, or communication is lost, and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts. Inmarsat’s service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings. This service is being offered to planes which are already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection, which the firm claims is ‘virtually 100 per cent of the world’s long haul commercial fleet’. Europe lags far behind the U.S. where WiFi is already widely available to air travellers. But Inmarsat plans to spend up to £270 million ($450 million) to bring Europe up to speed with passengers across the Pond. About half of the money will be spent on launching a new satellite called Europasat, to beam WiFi down to planes in the air. It will share the cost with French-Italian space group Thales Alenia Space and expects the satellite to be ready for launching into orbit by 2016. Inmarsat also plans to build a network of 300 ground stations across Europe’s 28 countries over the next six years, using the same 4G broadband technology as the latest smartphones do. It said the 4G ground network meant on-board WiFi could be as fast, reliable and cheap as the internet people use at home, for the first time in Europe. British Airways will test the service on domestic routes at first, before rolling it out across Europe, where it operates 600 flight per day on about 130 planes. It already offers a limited internet and text message service on its transatlantic business class-only London City to JFK New York service. And the airline last year became the first in the UK to allow passengers to use electronic devices during take-off and landing, after European rules were relaxed.

It already offers a limited internet and text message service on its transatlantic business class-only London City to JFK New York service . Kate Thornton, head of product and service at BA, said the airline could soon be ‘leading Europe in a new era of broadband in the air’. Conservative MP David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, welcomed the partnership between two leading British firms. ‘Today’s announcement is an important investment in new infrastructure that will promote productivity and growth in the UK and across Europe,' he said. Meanwhile, Inmarsat boss Rupert Pearce said he expects in-flight WiFi to be a ‘multi-billion dollar’ industry by 2020. He hopes to do deals with other European airlines, with British Airways set to be the first to get its hands on WiFi in mid-air. ‘Inmarsat . will deliver high-speed mobile broadband to the seat back or to the . passengers’ own mobile device, whether that’s a laptop or a phone or a . pad throughout Europe,’ he said. ‘This transforms the potential for connectivity for aircraft flying around Europe.’ Pricing . would be decided by the airlines, Pearce said, and passengers could be . charged by capacity or per flight, or monthly for frequent flyers. ‘It’s going to be at a rate that is commensurate with terrestrial services,’ he said.","Fast internet will be soon be available on European British Airways flights .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . One of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpieces, drawn in the early 1500s and thought to be a self-portrait, is in extremely poor condition and continues to deteriorate each day. The artwork, drawn in red chalk, has been exposed to humidity over the centuries and has yellowed, but thanks to breakthrough technology there is new hope for halting its degradation. Scientists have developed a new approach to identify the culprit of the yellowing without interfering with the original drawing and the knowledge gleaned could be used to preserve and save the precious self- portrait. Look carefully: A chalk drawing by Leonardo Da Vinci which is thought to be a self-portrait has suffered considerable discolouration because of humid storage conditions over the centuries. Now scientists have developed a new approach to identify the culprit of the yellowing without interfering with the original drawing, and this knowledge could be used to preserve and save the precious portrait . Centuries of storage in humid conditions has led to widespread yellowing and browning of the paper, which is reducing the contrast between the colours of chalk and paper, diminishing the visibility of the drawing. Experts in paper degradation from Italy and Poland were tasked with determining whether the destructive process has now slowed after conservation measures have been taken, or if the ageing process is continuing and could threaten the survival of the drawing. To do this, they developed an approach to non-destructively identify and quantify the concentration of light-absorbing molecules known as chromophores in ancient paper, which are responsible for the ‘yellowing’ of the cellulose within ancient documents and works of art. ‘During the centuries, the combined actions of light, heat, moisture, metallic and acidic impurities and pollutant gases modify the white colour of ancient paper's main component: cellulose,’ Joanna Łojewska, a professor in the Department of Chemistry at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland explained. The new technique could be used to preserve and protect the drawing and other artworks and letters (stock image) ‘This phenomenon is known as “yellowing,” which causes severe damage and negatively affects the aesthetic enjoyment of ancient art works on paper.’ Chromophores are key to understanding the visual degradation process because they are among the chemical products developed by oxidation during ageing and are behind the ‘yellowing’ within cellulose. Yellowing occurs when ‘chromophores within cellulose absorb the violet and blue range of visible light and largely scatter the yellow and red portions, resulting in the characteristic yellow-brown hue,’ said Olivia Pulci, a professor in the Physics Department at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. The experts can now identify and quantify the concentration of chromophores within paper to determine the degradation rate of the paper. Their new technique involves obtaining ‘optical reflectance spectra’  - the measure of the proportion of light or other radiation striking a surface which is reflected off it - of paper samples in the near-infrared, visible and near-ultraviolet wavelength ranges. Using the data, they calculated what sort of light is absorbed by the cellulose fibres in the paper. They then applied computer simulations based on quantum mechanics to calculate the light absorbtion spectrum of chromophores in cellulose. Adriano Mosca Conte, a researcher at the University of Rome Tor Vergata said: ‘Using our approach, we were able to evaluate the state of degradation of Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and other paper specimens from ancient books dating from the 15th century.’ ‘By comparing the results of ancient papers with those of artificially aged samples, we gained significant insights into the environmental conditions in which Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait was stored during its lifetime.’ The new technique involves calculating what sort of light is absorbed by cellulose fibres in paper. This data is then applied in computer simulations based on quantum mechanics to calculate the light absorption spectrum of chromophores in cellulose. IT could be used to prevent the decay of old books (pictured) and other drawings . Mauro Missori, a researcher at the Institute for Complex Systems in Rome, said explained that the type of chromophores present in Leonardo's self-portrait are ‘similar to those found in ancient and modern paper samples aged in extremely humid conditions or within a closed environment, which agrees with its documented history’. One of the most significant implications of their work is that the state of degradation of ancient paper can be measured and quantified by evaluation of the concentrations of chromophores in cellulose fibres. Dr Conte said: ‘The periodic repetition of our approach is fundamental to establishing the formation rate of chromophores within the self-portrait. Now our approach can serve as a precious tool to preserve and save not only this invaluable work of art, but others as well.’ A British chemistry teacher has explained the distinctive scent of antique books. Old books have a sweet smell with notes of vanilla flowers and almonds, caused by the breakdown of chemical compounds in the paper, while new books smell like they do because of chemicals used in their manufacture. The anonymous blogger said the chemical breakdown of compounds within paper leads to the production of ‘old book smell’. Paper contains cellulose and small amounts of lignin - a complex polymer of aromatic alcohols – and finer papers contain less lignin than cheaper material like newsprint. Lignin is what makes paper yellow with age because oxidation reactions cause it to break down into acids, which then help break down cellulose, he explained in the Compound Interest blog. The smell of old books comes from chemical degradation and a number of compounds have been pinpointed. Benzaldehyde adds an almond-like scent, vanillin smells of vanilla and ethyl hexanol has a ‘slightly floral’ scent. Ethyl benzene and toluene, which are also produced give off sweet odours. These volatile organic compounds are created by reactions known as ‘acid hydrolysis’ and together make up the smell of old books along with other alcohols produced by the reactions.","Scientists from Poland and Italy developed the new approach to identify the culprit of the yellowing without interfering with the original drawing .

That's according to a security report by California-based group, McAfee, which suggests cybercrime is now such big business, it is worth more than the wealth of some countries. As a business, cybercrime would be ranked 27th in the world based on revenue, and the attacks are currently costing the world more than £238 billion ($400 billion) a year. Scroll down for video . Not protecting yourself online is so irresponsible that, in the long-term, it could threaten the economy of entire nations. That's according to a security report by California-based group, McAfee, which suggests cybercrime is now such big business that it is worth more than some countries . Operation Tovar, which disrupted the viruses that led to the National Crime Agency issuing a two-week alert last week, has been highlighted as an example of the sort of global collaboration that needs to occur more often. The U.S.-led operation has thwarted an international crime ring that infected hundreds of thousands of PCs across the globe with malicious software that stole more than $100 million (£59.4 million) from businesses and members of the public since 2011. The Justice Department announced earlier this month that anywhere between 500,000 and 1 million machines worldwide were affected by the virus's known as Gameover Zeus which stole banking passwords and Crytolocker, which encrypted files and blackmailed the users for their release. 'These schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative, and the cyber criminals did not make them easy to reach or disrupt,' said Leslie Caldwell, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division, to a news conference. But while the grip of those behind the 'malware' has been weakened by the counter attack, computer experts said users must take this opportunity to install anti-virus software and update their operating systems to the latest versions to stop it regaining its hold. This is equal to more than 0.5 per cent of the world’s total gross domestic product, damaging the global economy almost as much as illegal drugs and piracy, according to ‘The Global Cost of Cybercrime’ report. Security experts, including from EU law enforcement agency Europol and Nato, have been discussing the report, and what more needs to be done to stop the increasing amount of web attacks. They claim the big problem remains a lack of understanding among the public about different threats that exist. ‘I’ve got young children, and I know that I can’t be there every time they cross the road,’ said Raj Samani, the chief technical officer of McAfee in Europe and a special adviser to Europol. ‘What I can do is teach them the dangers of crossing the road and hope that they can protect themselves. Technology does play a part, but the user plays a part as well. ‘[Last year] I went to a shopping centre, and there were people giving away chocolate in exchange for your personal data,’ he added. ‘The queue was 40 people deep. I said ‘why are you giving up your data for a piece of chocolate? Do you not realise it has more value?’ As part of the report, Samani revealed there are 20 to 30 cybercrime groups that are operating on a ‘nation-state level’. This means they are working on an industrial scale, and overcome almost any sort of web defence they face. ‘We want the economy to grow, and it’s being held back by cybercrime. ‘If you’re not taking important measures you’re contributing to criminals, and I mean nasty criminals, making money off you. Not taking action is resulting in people losing their jobs,’ he said. He added that ideas are the currency of the digital age and our ideas are being stolen. ‘Do you want the next Facebook to be out of London and Silicon Roundabout? It won’t be if we don’t protect our data because they’ll steal it and run it somewhere else,’ he said. Operation Tovar, which disrupted the viruses that led to the National Crime Agency issuing a two-week alert last week, has been highlighted as an example of the sort of global collaboration that needs to occur more often. Paul Gillen, from Europol, said that this operation, which involved officers from the U.S., the UK and around the world, was the perfect example of the collaboration that is needed to take on cyber criminals. ‘No single law enforcement agency can get an instant result on their own. We have to work in partnerships and Operation Tovar was a great example of this with the pooling of resources and ideas. This is not the end of the war however. The war goes on,’ he said. As a business, cybercrime would be ranked 27th in the world based on revenue, and the crime is currently costing the world more than £238 billion ($400 billion) a year.  This is equal to more than 0.5 per cent of the world’s total gross domestic product, according to ‘The Global Cost of Cybercrime’ report . The report found that more than 200,000 jobs had been lost as a result of cybercrime - through reputation damage or loss of assets. The news comes in the wake of continued efforts to improve web security before the ‘two-week threat’ elapses, and two viruses that have infected thousands of computers are active again. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers - whose attempts have been temporarily thwarted - can rebuild their network. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers. If systems do not offer automatic updates, people should enable it, the department said. It also advised changing passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during the infection.","Cyber attacks cost world more than 0.5% of its gross domestic product .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Following a number of high-profile security breaches, experts are once again predicting the demise of traditional passwords, but what is the alternative? Researchers from New Jersey believe they've come up with a solution that adds a new, more secure spin to the grid-based patterns currently used on iPhones and Android devices. It is the first free-form gesture password system that lets someone access a tablet, phone or computer simply by mimicking their previous motion on screen. Scroll down for video . Researchers have studied the practicality of using free-form gestures (pictured) for access authentication on smart phones and tablets. With the ability to create any shape in any size and location on the screen, the gestures had an inherent appeal as passwords and were harder to copy by hackers . As more people use smart phones or tablets to pay bills, make purchases, store personal information and even control access to their houses, the need for robust password security has become more critical than ever. It may not have all the bells and whistles, or the expense, of Apple’s fingerprint scanner, but Google does offer an alternative way to unlock an Android phone - and it involves using your face. The Face Unlock feature was originally introduced in 2011 as part of Android 4.0, also known as Ice Cream Sandwich, but despite this, it is still a relatively unknown tool. It can recognise a person’s face, and recent updates mean it can even establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real, or is a photograph. Once a photograph is taken it is stored in an encrypted file and each time a person wants to unlock their phone with their face, the Android system will cross-reference the image with this original photograph. The study by Rugers University in New Jersey shows that free-form gestures - sweeping fingers in shapes across the screen of a smart phone or tablet - can be used to unlock phones and grant access to apps. These gestures are less likely than traditional typed passwords or newer 'connect-the-dots' grid exercises to be observed and reproduced by 'shoulder surfers' who spy on users to gain unauthorized access. 'All it takes to steal a password is a quick eye,' said Janne Lindqvist, one of the leaders of the project and an assistant professor in the School of Engineering's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University. 'With all the personal and transactional information we have on our phones today, improved mobile security is becoming increasingly critical.' Lindqvist believes this is the first study to explore free-form gestures as passwords. The researchers will publish their findings this month as part of the proceedings of MobiSys 2014 - an international conference in mobile computing. In developing a secure solution to this problem, Lindqvist and the other researchers from Rutgers and collaborators from Max-Planck Institute for Informatics and University of Helsinki studied the practicality of using free-form gestures for access authentication. With the ability to create any shape in any size and location on the screen, the gestures had an inherent appeal as passwords. Since users create them without following a template, the researchers predicted these gestures would allow for greater complexity than grid-based gestures offer. Most passwords today are in the form of text or a pin (stock image shown), but future authentication for machines may be more possible with free-form gestures. Some modern devices like Android smartphones already employ a grid-based password system, while Microsoft's Windows 8 has a 'picture password' method . 'You can create any shape, using any number of fingers, and in any size or location on the screen,' Lindqvist said. 'We saw that this security protection option was clearly missing in the scientific literature and also in practice, so we decided to test its potential.' To do so, the researchers applied a generate-test-retest paradigm where 63 participants were asked to create a gesture, recall it, and recall it again 10 days later. The gestures were captured on a system designed by the team. Using this data, the authors tested the memorability of free-form gestures and invented a novel method to measure the complexity and accuracy of each gesture using information theory. To put this analysis into practice, the Rutgers researchers then had seven computer science and engineering students, each with considerable experience with touchscreens, attempt to steal a free-form gesture password by shoulder surfing. None of the participants were able to replicate the gestures with enough accuracy, so while testing is in its preliminary stages, the gestures appear extremely powerful against attacks. While widespread adaptation of this technology is not yet clear, the research team plans to continue to analyse the security and management of free-form passwords in the future.","Scientists in New Jersey have devised a new free-form password system .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . One of the holy grails of energy generation has long been fusion power, replicating the reactions that take place in stars like the sun. So far such efforts have proved very difficult – but one company claims to have found a solution that could provide the world with a huge, renewable and green source of energy. The Focus Fusion project is entering its final phase, with scientists aiming to prove that their concept really works. Scroll down for video . Lawrenceville Plasma Physics claim to be close to cracking the 'holy grail' of energy generation with their Focus Fusion project (illustration shown). They have already successfully heated fusion fuel 200 times hotter than the centre of the sun, and now plan to increase the density with sufficient funding . The project is being run by Lawrenceville Plasma Physics (LPP) by chief scientist Eric Lerner. They are currently running a fundraiser on Indiegogo to seek money for what they claims is the last step in their research. At the heart of the dense plasma focus are two cylindrical electrodes only a few inches across nested inside each other. The electrodes are enclosed in a vacuum chamber, with a low pressure gas filling the space between them. A pulse of electricity from a capacitor bank and energy storage device is discharged across the electrodes. For a few millionths of a second an intense current flows from the outer to the inner electrodes and ionises the gas. Instabilities first compress the plasma into dense filaments. These filaments are whirlwinds of current. The sheath of filaments merges together in a dense pinch or focus, combining all the filaments into one. This filament kicks and twists itself into a tiny dense ball, only a few thousands of an inch across called a plasmoid. Instability in the plasmoid creates powerful beams in opposite directions. Positively charged nuclei stream in one direction, and electrons in the other. Rapid compression heats the trapped plasma to billions of degrees, hot enough to fuse nuclei together to release fusion energy. They have passed two of their goals to proving their method of fusion power is successful, with a third apparently within reach. In a March 2012 paper the team successfully heated fusion fuel up to 1.8 billion degrees – too times hotter than the centre of the sun. This was confined within a tiny plasmoid for 10 billionths of a second, a short amount of time but enough to achieve this goal. Their next step is to increase the density of the fuel 10,000-fold, which they plan to do in the next 18 months. ‘Our team fully supports using today's existing renewable energy technologies like wind and solar, but it is clear we need even greener, more affordable energy solutions,’ the company says on Indiegogo. ‘Some 20 per centof the global population is without electricity, while almost half of the world lives on less than $2.50 [£1.50] per day. ‘The International Energy Agency forecasts that 1.2 billion people will remain without electricity. ‘ . They say their system would not only stop climate change by lowering the emission of greenhouse gases, but it would also provide nuclear power without nuclear waste. Current nuclear plants, they say, are based around nuclear fission, which produces as a waste product long-lived radioactive waste. Fusion energy, meanwhile, is comparatively ‘clean’. But, as LPP says, governments around the world ‘have spent billions of dollars on fusion with little to no success.’ LPP Fusion claim that theres there innovation will provider cheaper and cleaner energy for all, doing away with nuclear waste (nuclear plant pictured) and other pollutants that contribute to climate change and cause other problems. They also say their system could allow for smaller power stations that are decentralised . So what makes them think they’ll be successful? ‘First, we’re using the natural instabilities of plasmas to concentrate the energy,’ they write. ‘We’re using the same processes, like the pinch effect, that occur in solar flares and other astronomical phenomena, but scaling them down to laboratory size. ‘The government-sponsored programmes have been fighting these instabilities. So they have taken a far more difficult route. ‘Ours is much easier since we are using natural processes, not fighting them. ‘Second, it doesn’t always take billions to get earth-shaking inventions. ‘The first airplane cost $30,000 [£17,900] in today’s dollars, and the first transistor was built by a team of three who only spent two years working on it. In March 2012 the team published their first research in the journal Physics of Plasma. At the time the group came under some criticism for the paper, notably from Mike Hopkins, the CEO of Impedans, a manufacturer of plasma diagnostic equipment. ‘I am not expecting to see fusion energy from Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, New Jersey, despite the fanfare,’ he wrote on his website. LPP, however, are confident their method will work, or at the very least provide useful research into fusion reactions. Fusion power is seen as being very appealing as it mimics the huge energy-generating process that takes place in the centre of stars (illustration shown). Many experts say that if true nuclear fusion can be achieved, it will provide us with a much cleaner and greener source of energy than anything currently available .","US company LPP Fusion claims to be on the brink of solving fusion .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . He may not be able to bring people back from the dead, but one scientist can make corpses look fresher thanks to s secret chemical bathing process. Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas has developed an unusual method to transform gnarled human remains into plumper and more life-like bodies. The process is so useful as it can reveal features such as fingerprints, scars and tattoos, which can be used to identify individuals and solve crimes. Scroll down for video . Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas (pictured) has developed an unusual method to transform gnarled human remains into plumper and more life-like bodies. He plunges whole bodies - as well as body parts (pictured in the boxes) into a large tank filled with a secret mixture of chemicals . Only Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas knows the ingredients of this secret soak which is used to refresh corpses. After a few days to a week, shrivelled and partially-mummified remains are 'pumped up' and look like fresher corpses. Features such as scars, tattoos and moles are revealed that can identify individuals and can potentially be used to solve crimes. Bathing a hand can also revive it enough so that fingerprints can be taken. While other methods are also used to obtain fingerprints from shrivelled hands, Dr Cárdenas' is thought to be the only one that can freshen up whole bodies. They are bathed in a tank containing 60gallons (273litres) of his secret mixture. Dr Cárdenas told Motherboard that he divides him time between dentistry, teaching forensic courses at Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez and identifying human remains at the Juarez Forensic Science Lab in Chihuahua, Mexico – a region renowned for its violence and high murder rate. Since 2008 he has been plunging bodies – some shrivelled and scorched and some disfigured from accidents – into a tank that he refers to as the ‘jacuzzi’. It holds approximately 60 gallons (273 litres) of a secret chemical formula which magically turns back time and plumps up bodies left to soak for around five days. The method has so far revealed scars, moles, tattoos and wounds as well as fingerprints that have been used to identify missing people. Heads shrivelled in the desert heat regain plump lips and bruises that hint at a person’s final moments. Bodies go through seven stages of decomposition and Dr Cárdenas’ technique reverses two of these stages – putrefaction when the proteins in the body break down so that tissue rots and decomposition, when water in the body dries up – leaving shrivelled remains. Since 2008 Dr Cárdenas has been plunging bodies - some shrivelled and scorched such as the head and hand pictured - into a tank that he refers to as the 'jacuzzi'. His method has so far revealed scars, moles, tattoos and moles which can be used to identify individuals and potentially to solve crimes . Dr Cárdenas added that his patent-pending secret soak can reveal a corpse’s identity and sometimes the cause of death. He has done hundreds of body part rehydrations and around a dozen full body soaks. When a body is taken out of the bath it feels plump and limbs and joints such as fingers are pliable – but it smells. While he bathes the bodies, he talks to the corpses and condoles them, according to a report in The New York Times. He sometimes plays them romantic music while they float, or turns on rap and hip-hop for victims whose faces look ‘menacing’. Glycerin injections have long been used to reconstitute fingers from which to get fingerprints, but the method cannot be used for whole bodies. It is of particular use in the dusty region, where bodies decompose and mummify rapidly in the fierce heat of the city and its surrounding desert landscape. Dr Cárdenas does what many people might consider a grim job to give grieving families the chance to bury loved ones dumped in sprawling mass graves in the city of Ciudad Juarez (mapped) which contains unidentified bodies . Dr Cárdenas said that his patent-pending secret soak can reveal a corpse's identity and sometimes the cause of death. Fingertips can be 'plumped up' so that prints can be taken from them (pictured) - even if the remains were formerly partially mummified. Other methods exist to extract prints in this way, but Dr Cárdenas is thought to be the only one that can 'revive' whole bodies . Forensic researchers from the University of Southern Mississippi secured a patent for a rehydration technique to obtain fingerprints from dehydrated fingers. Their ‘PCOME’ method uses sodium hydroxide to plump up a finger, but timing is critical as too much of the chemical could dissolve it completely. It is unknown whether the same chemical is used in Dr Cárdenas' process, but experts think he is the only person attempting the feat on such a large scale. Dr Elizabeth Gardner, a forensic researcher at University of Alabama, Birmingham has witnessed a full-body rehydration and said: ‘It was quite amazing. It looked like a relatively fresh body.’ Dr Cárdenas does what many people might consider a grim job to give grieving families the chance to bury loved ones dumped in sprawling mass graves in the area which contains unidentified bodies. He even funds the rehydration technique himself.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

A group of university professors recently unveiled a fingerprint technology that they believe can detect the perfect job for anyone - simply by looking at their fingerprints . The new biometric test was used at a careers convention in Krasnodar, a city in southwestern Russia. To use the scanner, people place their fingers upon the fingerprint reader and computer technology linked up to sensors reads back what sort of work would suit the individual. The device bases its results on a database of how fingerprint shapes correlate to job selection. This database was created using a variety of previous employment studies. Local employers linked up with researchers from the city's Kuban University of Physical Education and Sport to road test the technology. Twenty one-year-old Oscar Galkin, a mathematics graduate, said: 'I got the feedback that I would be suited to a job in IT - which is exactly what I want to do. While the science remains in contention, the group claim that in the future, fingerprints could help reveal key personality traits.

The new biometric test was used at a careers convention in Krasnodar, a city in southwestern Russia. People placed their fingers upon the fingerprint reader and computer technology linked up to sensors read back what sort of work would best suit each individual . 'The basic concept is that although everybody's fingerprints are completely unique, there are obvious characteristics that were common on the fingers of certain professionals working in certain jobs,’ said researcher Ravil Yudin. ‘It's not really a new concept because palm readers have been saying for hundreds of years that you can predict a person's future by reading their palm. ‘We want to match that by looking at fingerprints and trying to predict what career path people would choose. ‘In a way it's also kind of like predicting the future, and we are now testing it out by trying to give people advice on what their fingerprints say is in store for them.' While Russian scientists are focusing on finding a link between fingerprints and personality, the idea that the shape of hands indicates different traits has long been studied by researchers. For instance, scientists have noticed an extraordinary link between the ratio of two digits on the hand — the ring and index fingers, known in scientists’ jargon as 2D and 4D — and a whole host of seemingly unrelated traits. Evidence is growing that this ‘digit ratio’, especially when applied to the right hand, is a fundamental indicator of sexuality, aggression and ­diseases suffered by men. A number of years ago evidence emerged of a link between the ‘2D:4D finger ratio’ and a man’s likelihood of developing prostate cancer. Specifically, men whose index fingers are longer than their ring fingers were significantly less likely to develop the disease, according to scientists at the Institute Of Cancer Research. A long index finger also correlates strongly with a lower risk of early heart disease and, in women, a higher risk of breast cancer and greater fertility. People with relatively long index fingers are also more likely to suffer from schizophrenia, allergies, eczema and hay fever. Young boys are more likely to be clingy and anxious than their low-ratio peers but also, ultimately, less attention-seeking and better behaved in school, research claims.","Device was created by Kuban University of Physical Education and Sport .

"By . Mike Dawes . Yorkshire's Gary Ballance will take on the crucial No 3 spot for England when they begin their Test series against Sri Lanka at Lord's on Thursday. Captain Alastair Cook confirmed the 24-year-old would come in at first drop in the first Investec Test, with Ian Bell and Joe Root set to follow in the middle order. When England last played the longer format, the fifth and final Test of the Ashes whitewash in Australia, Ballance batted at five in the first innings, due to a nightwatchman, and four in the second knock. Focused: Gary Ballance will bat at three when England take on Sri Lanka at Lord's on Thursday morning . On the eve: Captain Alastair Cook (right, pictured alongside Sam Robson) delivered the news on Wednesday . Bell, a veteran of 98 Tests, went in ahead of him on both occasions but will not now take over the role held for several years by his Warwickshire colleague Jonathan Trott. Cook, who will open alongside debutant Sam Robson, was untypically ready to confirm the make-up of the top six - a move that would have been anathema under the secretive Andy Flower reign. Asked where Ballance would bat, Cook said: 'Gary will bat at three, Belly at four, Rooty at five and Mo (Moeen Ali) at six.' As well as clarifying the batting order, Cook effectively confirmed the team, with Chris Woakes the likely odd man out. After years of guarding even the most obvious facts under Flower, Cook's eve-of-match admission rang true with new head coach Peter Moores' change of style. Ready to go: Cook with Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews ahead of the two-Test series . Raring: Moeen Ali will make his Test debut for Peter Moores' side against the tourists . The series is set to get under way with emotions still high about Jos Buttler's 'Mankad' dismissal in the one-day international at Edgbaston. England's wicketkeeper was run out backing up at the non-striker's end by Sachithra Senanayake having twice been warned for leaving his ground. It was a legal but controversial mode of dismissal, infuriating England and their fans. Cook spoke in measured tones about the incident ahead but could not hide the fact that it will add spice to the encounter. 'Both sides will play a particularly hard game of cricket, but we have a responsibility to do it in the right way,' he said. Cling on to that! Ballance takes a smart catch at second slip as England run through their fielding drills . Controversial: Sachithra Senanayake appeals to the umpire for a run out of Jos Buttler at the non-striker's end . 'There will be a lot of people watching us, a lot of kids as well, but they want to see tough cricket. 'What happened last week...I was quite emotive about it, but I've settled a bit. 'It was frustrating at the time and it still is...but he (Senanayake) was in his right to do it. The bottom line is you can't really argue against it.' Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews was strident when asked about the Buttler run out. He is content his side acted within the rules and simply punished Buttler for seeking to steal an advantage. Not happy: Buttler reacts after being run out in the ODI but Sri Lanka insisted that he had been warned . 'Buttler was warned a few times,' said the all-rounder. 'We analysed the Lord's ODI and they had taken 21 twos in the last 10 overs. 'He was backing away (backing up) and we did nothing about, but we couldn't let him do that every game. 'We warned him twice. There is a law and if you're going to judge the captain of the other team (for using it) there shouldn't be a law; if that's the case it should be taken out. 'We played within the rules and stuck to the spirit of cricket, but we shouldn't let anyone take advantage of us.' 'Buttler was warned a few times,' said the all-rounder.

The Duke described United for Wildlife as a 'powerful global alliance of seven of the most influential conservation organisations, while Beckham said he was proud to be part of an 'amazing team' Beckham added: 'It's something that we all feel very passionate about. 'As lead ambassador I'm very proud to also be part of an amazing team - an amazing array of famous faces that are very important to this organisation and very important to this cause.' Speaking to reporters afterwards, Beckham said: 'I want to make a change, I want to make a difference and If I can do that by just shining a light on something as important as this then it's a good thing."" Asked if he expected to able to influence the parts of the world that drive the illegal wildlife trade, he said: 'Obviously I have quite a big following throughout Asia and especially in China and if it can shine a light on something as important as this then it's job done. 'But obviously having the Duke, the future king of England involved in something like this - there's nothing better.' During the event, William stood with his hands clasped in front of him as a short film was played highlighting the issues facing park rangers who must face the ever present threat of poachers and risk their own lives in doing so. The Duke described United for Wildlife as a 'powerful global alliance of seven of the most influential conservation organisations'. William is also involved through the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Well wishers and fans waited to greet the Prince as he arrived at the event today at Google Town Hall in London . William, who is also involved through the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, waves at the waiting crowd upon his arrival . William headed inside where he joined David on stage and watched a film on the issues facing park rangers . The second in line to the throne went on: 'In February we set out our commitments to improve protection and enforcement, reduce demand and to help the business community to tackle international trafficking. 'That was our first step, but we knew we needed to do more to bring this trade into the open. The illegal wildlife trade thrives because it is hidden, often invisible, making it easy for criminals to build and expand. 'We wanted to find a way to show the world what was happening. Join us and help stop illegal poaching.' It is hoped the #WhoseSideAreYouOn debate will gather pace on social networking via Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and YouTube to raise the profile of the issue. In the run up to the launch, William and his brother Prince Harry posed side by side for a photo for United for Wildlife's Twitter account, each holding a sign bearing the start date '9th June 2014' and their own signature.

Merode, the director of Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic . of Congo, who spoke of the dangers faced by rangers from poachers. Two . rangers are killed every week and he was shot himself earlier this year. He . said the issue was about more than just conservation. 'You have to . picture wildlife crime in the context of the overall damage that's being . done to people's resources, and in Congo there is perhaps no greater . example than that, no more extreme example, because it has provoked a . war, and this war has seen the death of over six million innocent . people,' he said. 'This is a war that's driven by the illegal exploitation of natural resources, of which wildlife crime is a part."" Mr . De Merode, who is a Belgian prince, said he would he able to return to . Virunga and tell his rangers they were 'in incredibly good company now'. He was shot in the stomach and legs by unidentified gunmen in April and . is thought to have been targeted because of his conservation work. Beckham, who worked closely with the Duke on England's World Cup bid and attended his wedding, heads a team of sporting stars backing the campaign including Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, India's former batsman Rahul Dravid and retired South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar. Last September, William and Beckham teamed up when they recorded two video campaigns against illegal wildlife products for WildAid. Beckham said at the time: 'When I learned of the current poaching levels in Africa, I immediately agreed to help get this message out. BBC presenter Kate Silverton also attended the event which is being supported by celebrities and sporting stars including Wimbledon champion Andy Murray . 'It is shocking to think that we could lose these animals from the wild in our lifetimes.' The fight against illegal wildlife trade is close to William's heart. In February, he hailed a major international conference in London on the trafficking of endangered wildlife as the 'beginning of the end of this despicable trade'. World leaders agreed concrete steps to help safeguard endangered animals from poachers - putting their signatures to a declaration of intent. William attended the event with Harry and their father the Prince of Wales, who gave the keynote speech, as politicians gathered to discuss how best to combat the illegal trade in rhino horn, tiger parts and elephant tusks which fuels criminal activity worth more than an estimated £11.5 billion each year.

Previously images of the handset have leaked online. The latest images (pictured) reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone . The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen. These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements. It can also alter the perspective of visuals on the screen and make them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses.

She shared pictures of herself posing with doctors, suffering the ‘hell’ of contractions and being injected with an epidural. And although she spared her followers the gory details of the final stages, Mrs Thomas was back online just 20 minutes after giving birth as she breastfed daughter Ferne for the first time. Yesterday, the former marketing executive, who lives with husband Iain and their three-year-old son Teddy, explained why she had shared such intimate moments so publicly. ‘When I got there I thought, “what can I do to pass a few hours before it all kicks off?” she said. Meet the team: Mrs Thomas poses with a doctor (left), while her husband Iain naps on a hospital bed (right) This is going to hurt: Shortly after nine o'clock, Mrs Thomas receives an epidural while sucking on a gas pump . ‘I wanted to capture as much as I could, even during my contractions. It was a way of keeping my mind off the pain and telling friends what was happening/ . ‘It was also a kind of social experiment to see what the reaction would be like. ‘Everyone was very positive. People were even guessing the weight and the time I would give birth. The staff were all talking about it too.’ Mrs Thomas was ten days overdue when she was induced on May 16 at Whittington Hospital in North London. Not long now: As the birth draws closer, she shuts her eyes in agony as she inhales gas to relieve the pain . All smiles: Mrs Thomas's midwives pose during the excruciating 12-hour labour, which was shared on Twitter . She arrived just after 8am and tweeted the first of nearly 50 updates posted over the course of her labour, writing: ‘Today’s the day! Today we meet our daughter all being well!’. She used the hashtag ‘lyndseygivesbirth’ so friends and new followers could easily keep up to date with how she was doing. By 11.30am she had shared a photo of her bed in the labour ward and got the doctors and midwives to pose for her. An hour later, she had written of hearing the ‘first screams on the ward’ as another woman gave birth nearby. We did it! Mrs Thomas cradles her baby daughter, Ferne, weighing 7lbs 4oz, shortly after her birth at 1.04am . Just . before 1pm, she had updated her followers: ‘Protin gel at 12.50pm. Ouch that . hurt! Sit and wait time.’ Less than 20 minutes later, she had announced she . was 2cm dilated and posted pictures of herself posing in bed in a nighty . and bed socks. ‘Am I having contractions?’ she asked, anxiously. ‘Timed 2, 15 secs each 13 minutes apart. Will see if another comes along . before calling midwife.’ Ready for her close-up: Baby Ferne Eileen Thomas . At 5pm her contractions had kicked in, prompting her to tweet: ‘It’s true what they say – feels like I have the worst stomach bug in the world. Apparently these are just mild ones #ouch.’ Nine o’clock passed and she had shared the moment she received an epidural as she sucked on a gas pump, writing: ‘I’m high as a kite.’ As the birth drew closer, she uploaded a photo of herself holding her bump with her eyes shut in agony, revealing: ‘Was scary for a good half hour.’ Then, in the early hours, just a short while after her ordeal, she introduced her daughter to her followers, writing: ‘Ferne Eileen Thomas born at 01.04 weighing in at 7.4.’ She then recorded their first breastfeeding session, proudly tweeting: ‘20 minutes old & latched straight on.’ Throughout the day, Mrs Thomas had also kept followers up to date with how her husband was coping. She had posted a picture of him napping on a hospital bed during the early hours of labour, writing: ‘Hard work this supporting the wife whilst she’s in labour lark.’ The Arsenal fan was desperate for his wife to give birth before the FA Cup final on May 17. He went to the game a few hours after the birth of his daughter to watch his team beat Hull City. Mrs Thomas, who has given up her job in marketing to focus on being a mother, has continued to tweet updates on her daughter’s progress, telling followers about her exhaustion, the perils of breastfeeding and how she is rapidly losing her baby weight. There have also been a steady stream of pictures of Fearne, who is now three weeks old. New father: Mrs Thomas's husband poses with his newborn daughter (left), and Fearne takes a nap (right) Mrs Thomas added: ‘The staff at the hospital were phenomenal – flawless from beginning to end. Every single person that dealt with me was fantastic. ‘Everything I wanted I was given, so I want to say a huge thanks them.’ A Whittington Hospital spokesman had kept a close eye on the tweets during the day, writing to Mrs Thomas: ‘Wishing you well. We’ll certainly be following you!’ Growing up: Since the birth, Mrs Thomas has continued to tweet photos of Fearne, who is now three weeks old .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Towns and holiday attractions in Cornwall are worried that tourists will stay away this summer after the number of Blue Flag beaches in the country plummeted to just one. In the sun: Porthmeor Beach, near St Ives, will not be able to boast Blue Flag status this summer . This is a drop of 80 per cent on 2013. Last year, five coastal strips in the region flew the prestigious marker . of quality and cleanliness, and there are fears among those who rely on . tourism from their income that potential visitors will be put off by . the news. Only Carbis Bay – a privately owned beach on the north coast of the Cornish peninsula, near St Ives – will have Blue Flag status this year after Cornwall Council decided not to involve itself in the application process, arguing that it is too costly. Beaches keen to boast the Blue Flag stamp of approval have to apply each year – and pay for the privilege. It costs £820 for an inspection to deem whether a beach is up to scratch. A statement from Cornwall Council has defended its stance on the matter. Pole position: Carbis Bay, which is privately run, will be the only Cornish beach to boast Blue Flag status in 2014 . ‘Cornwall Council, like other beach owners, has to pay to apply for Blue Flag status,’ it says. ‘Consequently, we will not be applying for the Blue Flag this season on any of the sites that formerly used to have the award – Gyllyngvase, Porthtowan and Polzeath.’ Porthmeor Beach in St Ives was also on the Blue Flag list last year – bringing to four the number of coves which could be deemed to have reduced status in 2014. Richard Gates, a town centre manager in Falmouth, where Gyllyngvase Beach is among the downgraded quartet, says that the council’s decision is a disappointment. Not included: Polzeath Beach is a popular spot for families and surfers, and had Blue Flag status last year . ‘We think it is very important,’ he told the Cornish Guardian. ‘It is an internationally recognised standard, and a lot of people do take notice.’ He added that Falmouth may take charge of its own application next year to ensure that the standard of its beaches is acknowledged. Cornwall Council has signed up for a rival award this summer – and is keen to reassure potential visitors that its beaches are as clean as ever. ‘We will be replacing the Blue Flag with a Seaside Award on [the beaches] for the forthcoming season,’ the statement continues. Good enough for the PM: David and Samantha Cameron took a short break at Polzeath Beach last year . ‘It is however important to reassure beach users that we will not be reducing standards of service on any of our beaches and will strive, as always, to keep them clean, safe and healthy.’ In contrast to Cornwall, neighbouring Devon has eight Blue Flag beaches – four of them in Torbay. The Blue Flag programme runs in over 40 countries across the world. In the UK, it is administered by Keep Britain Tidy – which argues that the award has worked wonders for the perception of the country’s beaches. ‘Over the years [the programme] has acted as an incentive to many beach managers to improve the quality of the coast,’ the organisation explains. ‘Their hard work has led to a revival of the UK coastline and beaches around the world.’ Surf's up: Polzeath Beach, on the north coast of Cornwall, is an excellent spot for surfing . Some 3500 beaches across the planet, in 41 countries, can claim Blue Flag status.","Number of Cornish beaches with Blue Flag status falls 80 per cent on 2013 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Prime Minister David Cameron hopes to woo UKIP voters with his promise of an in-out EU referendum if he wins the 2015 general election . David Cameron has ordered a ‘war on two fronts’ to counter the duel threat of Labour and UKIP between now and the general election.The Prime Minister hopes to counter the threat of UKIP with a ‘blue-on-purple’ battle focused on reviving his bid to legislated for an in-out EU referendum. And he will target Ed Miliband in a ‘blue-on-red’ over the stewardship of the economy and exploiting voters’ doubts about the Labour leader’s ability to run the country. In a major boost for the Prime Minister, it was announced today that a backbench Tory MP will launch a second bid to enshrine the pledge of an in-out EU referendum in law. Former minister Bob Neill was the highest placed Conservative MP drawn at random this morning. He will resurrect the EU Referendum Bill unsuccessfully proposed by colleague James Wharton in the last parliamentary session. Mr Neill said: ‘One of the first votes I ever cast was on EU membership in the 1970s . ‘Now, as I pick up my bus pass, I am getting the chance to work with colleagues to secure a referendum for the British people. ‘Britain needs a new deal with Europe and the Conservatives have a plan for change in Europe - renegotiate, reform and put the deal to the British people in an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. ‘Parliament now has the chance to pass my backbench bill and guarantee that the British people have the final say.’ Some Conservatives complain that Mr Cameron’s promise of a referendum, first made in January last year, has failed to cut through to voters. He vowed to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU before putting it to the British public. It is seen as a key weapon in the attack on UKIP’s support base. Tory strategists have set a deadline of the party conference season in October to build the foundation for an outright majority at the general election in May next year. The Conservatives have been buoyed by winning the Newark by-election, despite Mr Farage’s claims his People’s Army was on the march to an historic victory. Many Tory MPs are privately delighted that the party won on an optimistic message of a ‘brighter future’, which had echoes of Mr Cameron’s early leadership when he declared: ‘Let sunshine win the day.’ The Prime Minister has told aides to fight a war on two fronts: targeting Ed Miliband's Labour party and Nigel Farage's UKIP . Number 10 was especially struck by a poll from Newark which showed support for UKIP was much weaker among women. Meanwhile, the Tories will contrast Mr Cameron with Mr Miliband, with polls showing barely a quarter of voters think the Labour is up to the of being Prime Minister. A source close to Mr Cameron told MailOnline: ‘The PM describes it as a war on two fronts. Tory MP Bob Neill is to try to legislate for an in-out referendum, in the face of opposition from the Lib Dems and Labour . ‘Between now and the conference season we have got to show we are more economically competent than Labour and set out a more optimistic vision than UKIP. ‘It is blue-on-red and blue-on-purple. Over the next few months you will see much more about what we would without being in coalition.’ The Prime Minister has said he is ready to invoke the Parliament Act to force through referendum legislation, after Mr Wharton’s bill collapsed in January in the face of Labour and Liberal Democrat opposition in the Lords. The Tories have been forced to fall back on private members’ legislation as their Lib Dem coalition partners have refused to sanction a Government bill, which would have much greater prospects of success. For the Parliament Act to apply, a bill identical to that proposed by Mr Wharton would have to pass the Commons without any amendments - which may prove difficult to achieve. Even if the Conservatives cannot get a bill into law, Tory strategists believe they can still gain by forcing Labour and the Lib Dems to vote against a measure that is popular with many voters just months - or weeks - before a general election if they want to block it. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: ‘Voters support a referendum, business supports a referendum and so must Parliament. ‘The EU has changed dramatically over the past 40 years and the overwhelming message from the European elections is that voters want their chance to have a say. ‘This Private Members’ Bill provides a genuine opportunity to give people that chance, which is why MPs must not only back this Bill, but they should not be afraid to use the Parliament Act if peers fail to give the public what they want.’","Prime Minister orders summer blitz on rival parties to get onto front foot .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today admitted the Tories have more to do to defeat UKIP, despite romping home to victory in the Newark by-election. The Prime Minister warned the Conservatives 'the job isn't finished yet' on hammering home key messages on the economy, tax cuts and jobs. Tory candidate Robert Jenrick held on to the Nottinghamshire seat with a majority of 7,403, halting the march of UKIP's People's Army which Nigel Farage had boasted was on the verge of securing its first MP. Scroll down for video . Newly elected Conservative Party MP Robert Jenrick and wife Michal arrive at the Bramley Apple pub in Southwell . The result is a setback for UKIP leader Nigel Farage who hoped to secure the party's first seat in the Commons . David Cameron, attending D-Day commemorations in Bayeux with his wife Samantha, said the result in Newark showed the Conservatives still had more to do to win the argument over UKIP . The Conservatives secured a majority of more than 7,000 over UKIP, down from 16,000 in 2010 . Mr Jenrick attracted 17,431 votes - a comfortable majority over Ukip's Roger Helmer, who received 10,028. Labour's Michael Payne was pushed into third place with 6,842 votes, ahead of independent candidate Paul Stephen Baggaley, who finished with 1,891, and the Green Party's David Kirwan who attracted 1,037 votes. It was a disastrous night for the Liberal Democrats however, whose candidate David Watts was beaten into a humiliating sixth place, barely scraping 1,000 votes. The contest was triggered by the resignation of disgraced former MP Patrick Mercer, and had been seen as a crucial test of Nigel Farage’s ability to secure an historic first UKIP MP in the Commons. However the Tory majority was more than halved from 16,000 in 2010, with Ukip surging from a distant fifth place in that election, taking an additional 10,000 votes this time around. Downing Street will hope that the result will quell fears on the Tory backbenches that the party can hold back the UKIP tide at the general election in May 2015. But speaking in Bayeux ahead of D-Day commemoration events, Mr Cameron said more had to be done to tackle the threat from UKIP in the run-up to the 2015 general election. He told reporters: 'We need to work between now and the next election to say very clearly we have got a long-term plan, we are getting Britain back to work, we are cutting people's taxes, we are helping hard-working people. 'The job isn't finished yet but we are on the right track, let's stick at it.' UKIP secured a swing of 22.1 per cent, with the Lib Dems down 17.4 per cent on another dreadful night for Nick Clegg's party . Hundreds of Tory activists flooded into the seat in a bid to secure victory over UKIP . Defeated: Roger Helmer (left) and Nigel Farage (right) arrive to hear the results. Despite finishing second, the Ukip leader said 'tremors are still being felt' two weeks after the party's European election triumph . New MP Mr Jenrick said: 'The people of Newark have voted to back this Government, to back this Government's long- term economic plan to secure the future of this constituency and of this great country.' Mr Farage sought to put a brave face on the Tory victory, insisting UKIP had made 'huge gains'. Speaking after the result, Mr Farage said: 'I think there'll be an awful lot of Conservatives with a majority of less than 10,000 who will look upon this result in sheer horror.' But he admitted he would have liked to have done better in Newark. 'Yes, I mean the majority's halved and we thought we'd bitten into it even more than that, but nonetheless for U it's still a good night's work,' he said. Denying he should have spent more time in the constituency, he said: ‘UKIP is about much more than Nigel Farage.’ Mr Cameron made four visits to the seat, including a tour with Boris Johnson, in an attempt to seal victory. By contrast Mr Farage visited just once during the campaign. David Cameron hailed the victory, insisting Mr Jenrick would 'deliver a brighter future for all' David Cameron visited the seat four times, including touring a street market with London Mayor Boris Johnson . The Tories flooded the constituency with activists and MPs to prove the party machine could see off the threat from UKIP . The result will be a setback for Mr Farage, who had hoped to use victory in the European Parliament elections last month as a springboard to gaining a seat in Westminster. He promised to do ‘everything we can’ to win the by-election, declaring: ‘The people’s army of Ukip now marches on Newark.’ However, on the eve of the vote the UKIP leader was pictured partying in Malta after giving a speech to the tourism industry. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer, who faced being suspended from the Commons after being caught in a lobbying sting . It suggested he had all but given up hope of seizing the Tories’ 44th safest seat. Yesterday he was pictured walking hand-in-hand into a hotel with a tourism executive but he insisted today: 'I didn't go to bed with her'. The UKIP leader claimed he was the victim of 'abhorrent mischief making' after he was photographed with Ande Soteri at 3.42am after a gala dinner in Malta. UKIP strategists hoped to use Newark to mimic the success of the Reform party in Canada which used a by-election as a springboard to becoming a dominant political force. Local teacher Deborah Grey won Reform's first seat in Parliament in 1989, and four years later the party overtook the Progressive Conservatives as the main right-wing party . Mr Farage was accused of ‘bottling it’ after refusing to stand in the by-election himself, claiming he did not want to cause a ‘huge distraction’ from the Euro election campaign. He reportedly told the BBC that if he lost Ukip would be finished: 'The bubble is burst.' He stepped aside in favour of Roger Helmer, who was elected as an MEP for UKIP last month. Many Tories despaired when the contest was called after Mr Mercer’s sudden resignation. The outspoken critic of Mr Cameron quit the Tory party in July last year after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji. He referred himself to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and promised to quit the Commons at the next election. But in April it emerged the standards watchdog was going to recommend he be suspended from the Commons for six months, so he fell on his sword. The former Army colonel said that as an ex-soldier he believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to it. He added: ‘No point in shilly- shallying or trying to avoid it. What has happened has happened, I’m ashamed of it. Therefore, I’m going to do what I can to put it right . . . I’m going to resign my seat.’ The market town of Newark lies on the River Trent in Nottinghamshire has been held by the Tories since 2001 . Newark is a largely rural constituency which, since Patrick Mercer was elected in 2001, has been considered a safe Conservative seat. Centred on the affluent cathedral town of Southwell and the market town of Newark, and dissected by the River Trent, around half of the area's 72,000 voters live in villages and rural areas. It borders Labour-held Bassetlaw in the north and lies to the north east of a number of Labour-voting constituencies in the city of Nottingham. But unlike Nottinghamshire's more urban areas, Newark has a traditionally Conservative-voting population, like that of its two neighbouring Lincolnshire constituencies, Gainsborough and Sleaford and North Hykeham, which border it to the east. Newark's electorate is 93 per cent white British, and 67 per cent describe themselves as Christian, with less than one per cent considering themselves Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Jewish. More than 70 per cent of homes in the constituency either owned outright or mortgaged, less than 10 per cent of households have council or housing association tenants and only 20 per cent of the electorate are younger than 34. Well over half of voters are employed, with nearly one in five retired and only three per cent unemployed. Traditionally Tory, it was held by the party for the first half of the 20th century, but swung to Labour after the war, with Labour MPs George Deer and Edward Stanley Bishop representing it from 1950 to 1979. It swung back to the Conservatives in 1979, with Tory Richard Alexander holding the seat until 1997, when Labour's Fiona Jones won a slim majority as Tony Blair swept to power. Mrs Jones could only hold the seat for one term however and Mr Mercer won it back for the Tories in 2001. At the last election, the Tories won 54 per cent of the vote, giving them a huge majority over Labour, who polled at only 24 per cent.","Conservatives held on to the seat with a comfortable majority of 7,403 .

After the ceremony, Karlesha was proudly showing off her daughter to friends when Aaliyah became hungry. Still dressed in her cap and gown, Karlesha decided to feed her baby and a friend, who thought it cool, asked if they could take a picture. A couple of days ago she posted the photo on the Facebook page, Black Women Do Breastfeed, to support a woman who wrote of getting dirty looks while nursing in public. ‘I did it to show it’s natural, it’s normal, there’s nothing wrong with it,’ Karlesha told Today.

'It’s not disgusting, it’s not a bad thing, it’s not a negative thing. It’s the best thing for my daughter. More people should do it,' she added. Though Karlesha has since deleted her photo, the Facebook group decided to share the photo as part of their efforts to try and normalize breast-feeding in public. ‘Congratulations, mama!!!! Giving her daughter more gifts than one! Isn't this beautiful?! #normalizebreastfeeding,’ read the caption. As the photo spread, the Facebook page – and Karlesha - received a lot of support.

Some people though it was inappropriate and that she should have covered up. 'Maybe I still have sleep in my eyes but did U just see a pic of a chick really breastfeeding during middle of her graduation?' tweeted Moderate. Karlesha, however, has no regrets. ‘I was proud of the fact that not only did I graduate but that I got to share the moment with the one person who is the most important to me and that is my daughter,’ she told Today.","Despite getting pregnant in her last year at college, Karlesha Thurman, 25, remained in school and secured an accounting degree .

The weekly figure for England is the highest on record, Labour said – and indicates that the NHS is facing a summer A&E crisis. In the same week last year, the total attending casualty was 273,477. Ambulances outside Leeds General Infirmary: Amid rising concerns about the failure of GPs to offer services out of hours, it was revealed that 296,667 people attended casualty in the week ending May 25 . The huge numbers going to casualty mean that tens of thousands are having to wait more than four hours before they are treated. Last night a leading doctor said lives will be ‘endangered’ by the increasing pressure on A&E units. Critics say the pressure is being made worse by the failure of family doctors to open at evenings, weekends and – as the Mail revealed on Monday – in the afternoons. An investigation found that a quarter of GP surgeries shut their office for at least one half-day during the week, while others close for more than four hours for lunch. Patients who ring at these times are either diverted to out-of-hours firms or hear a message telling them to call back. It is feared that many head to A&E on hearing such messages. The official NHS figures show that of the 296,667 who turned up at A&E in England in the week ending May 25, 77,745 were admitted to a hospital ward. That is also a record. The NHS is supposed to meet a target that 95 per cent of patients should be assessed, treated or discharged in casualty departments within four hours. But in that week, 24,503 people had to wait longer than four hours – below the target at 94.6 per cent. Over the whole of May, a total of 92,811 waited more than four hours before being treated. This is much higher than the 57,810 recorded over the same period last year, the 57,352 in 2012 and the 48,259 in 2011. In each of the four weeks this May, the 95 per cent target was missed. Casualty units usually face a more difficult time over the winter, but the latest figures indicate the situation could be even worse this summer. Whittington Hospital Accident and Emergency department in Islington: The official NHS figures show that of the 296,667 who turned up at A&E in England in the week ending May 25, 77,745 were admitted to a hospital ward . Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said the statistics underlined the need for ‘significant action’. He wants the NHS to provide more alternatives to A&E such as better GP out-of-hours services or more minor injuries units. Dr Mann also called for greater efforts to ease congestion so patients can be moved out of casualty and into other wards. ‘Failure to do so will mean these figures go from bad to worse and lives are endangered,’ he said. Jamie Reed, a Labour health spokesman, said: ‘People can see that the NHS is heading downhill under this government. ‘A&Es are facing the worst year in a decade – there’s now a summer crisis that’s worse than the winter one.’ The Department of Health said: ‘More than 400,000 patients were seen at A&E within four hours last week – a testament to the hard work of staff.’","Leading doctor warns lives will be put at risk by pressure on A&E wards .

"By . Luke Salked . Stunned: Glenn Buscombe, 60, was attended to by paramedics after suffering agonising pain in his leg . Writhing in agony in the back of an ambulance, all Glenn Buscombe could think about was getting to hospital as quickly as possible. But it seems his driver had other ideas. To the 60-year-old patient’s amazement, the speeding ambulance stopped on a dual carriageway... to pick up two early morning hitchhikers. The door then opened and a woman in a short skirt who ‘looked a bit worse for wear’ climbed into the back with Mr Buscombe while her male friend got into the front. The driver gave the couple a lift to the next town before taking Mr Buscombe on to hospital in Plymouth. The retired carpenter – who was suffering with deep-vein thrombosis – was then told by doctors he might have to have his right leg amputated. But after being transferred to another specialist hospital unit, medics managed to restore his blood flow with injections. The grandfather is now recovering at home in Polperro, Cornwall, from an operation to repair his blocked artery and has complained to the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust about the alleged incident on April 6. His ordeal began when his leg started swelling up and his  doctor, who had made a late house call, phoned for an  ambulance at 12.15am. Two paramedics arrived around 45 minutes later and helped Mr Buscombe into a seat in the back of the vehicle. They set off along the A38 dual carriageway towards  Plymouth, driving at speed  but without their blue emergency lights flashing. Home: The medics helped the grandfather into an ambulance outside his home (pictured) in Bodmin, Cornwall. But just minutes after setting off, the vehicle reportedly pulled over - and a male and female hitchhiker got in . Retired carpenter: Shockingly, the woman then started asking Mr Buscombe questions about his condition . Mr Buscombe, who has three grown-up sons with his  wife Sandra, said: ‘I was in  terrible pain. ‘We were going at quite a speed when the ambulance came to an abrupt stop. ‘All . of a sudden the door slid open and there was a girl  standing there in . the roadside. She looked a bit worse for wear and bedraggled. ‘She was just wearing a skirt and a blouse despite the fact it was foggy and raining. ‘Then a man got in the front seat. They looked like they’d had a few beers and missed their lift back home. ‘The woman started asking me all sorts of questions – who I was, what was wrong with me. ‘I . said, “How the hell do I know, I haven’t been to hospital yet”. I . couldn’t believe what was going on. The paramedic in the back with me . looked as  confused as I was.’ Destination: Mr Buscombe said the ambulance's route to Plymouth Derriford Hospital (above) was further delayed after the driver stopped to drop off the hitchhikers at a garage. He is now recovering at home . Mr . Buscombe says the ambulance carried on  driving before it reached . Saltash and pulled over again, where the two hitchhikers jumped out at a . garage. The vehicle then continued  on to Derriford Hospital. Mr . Buscombe said: ‘It was a race against time to save me and my leg and . yet the driver was messing around giving people lifts – it’s just not . on. ‘If he was worried about these people he could have called the police. ‘The . girl didn’t even say goodbye or thanks when she  got out. There are a . lot of  valuable drugs in the back of an ambulance and for all he knew . these two could have been armed with a knife or something. I wouldn’t . want anyone to lose their jobs over this but it cannot be allowed to . happen again.’ It is . believed the ambulance may have stopped because the crew thought the . couple had been in a road traffic accident, or may have been at risk . because of the bad weather. However an ambulance service spokesman said . details would not be disclosed until the investigation was completed. The . spokesman added: ‘The Trust takes all complaints  seriously and has . started an investigation to establish exactly what happened.’","Glenn Buscombe picked up by paramedics following severe pain in leg .

Lexi Antorino, 8, of Palmetto suffered severe head injuries when a swing set fell on top of her, according to a report by the Bradenton Herald. She died at 11:30am at All-Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, less than a month before her 9th birthday. 'Little fighter': Lexi Antorino, pictured, died on Monday aged eight . Family: Lexi is seen here in a 2008 file photo with her brother Nick Jr. Antorino's parents, Sarah and Nick, took care of her with the help of family and friends as their daughter was 'semi-comatose' and required both constant care and the use of a ventilator, the paper reported. 'She's touched so many lives and brought people closer to God,' Sarah Antorino told the paper. 'She showed people how to fight. She was a little fighter. She gave people strength. She made me realize how strong I am.' Antorino died due to complications from pneumonia and a gastrointestinal problem, the latter of which seemed to begin in April. 'She was really fine before that, no major issues,' Sarah Antorino told the Herald. 'Lexi had never been in the hospital since we took her home after the accident.' Family outing: Nick and Sarah Antorino put sunscreen on their daughter's face in this photograph . Mother: Sarah Antorino, pictured, is seen standing in her late daughter's bedroom . 'She had e. coli in her blood and urine,' she added in reference to a hospital visit last week. 'We don't know why. She was crying at the hospital. The only way I really knew Lexi was crying was a nostril flair or one tear, but both of her eyes were crying. She was in agony.' Caretaker Joan Lewis also recalled happy memories with Antorino. 'Up until the end, when she was in pain, I think she was happy,' she told the Herald. I danced for her. We watched princess movies and read stories.' Family friend Delilah Toledo, 13, and her mother Naya Toledo were photographed mourning Antorino's death at the family's home. Sarah Antorino told the Herald she will release butterflies as part of her daughter's memorial service on Saturday in Ellenton.

"By . Louise Cheer . Vegetable growers hope celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's star power will help convince Woolworths to cancel a 40-cent-per-crate of food levy to be imposed by the supermarket to fund the Jamie's Garden promotion, a charge that could cost farmers thousands of dollars each. The group that represents growers, Ausveg, wrote to Oliver on Tuesday asking him to step in after farmers expressed outrage at being charged an extra 40 cents per crate, on top of the up-to five per cent of the total cost of produce they are already charged to cover marketing costs. Mr Oliver's publicity manager Peter Berry  said from London that the chef was aware of what was being said, but did not confirm if the media personality had received the letter, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 'At the end of the day, Jamie supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition,' Mr Berry said. Scroll down for video . Vegetable growers have written to Jamie Oliver, appealing for him to help cancel the new 40-cents-per-crate levy . 'And in this case that means Woolworths and the many farmers and growers who have signed up for this important initiative to whom Jamie is very grateful.' Ausveg public affairs manager William Churchill said some farmers were expecting to see a 30.5 per cent drop in profits because of the new levy. 'Growers around the country are furious at this arrangement,' he said. 'One grower will be paying $300,000 in this new levy, others will be paying tens of thousands. 'We see this as essentially double dipping on growers and this is a company that posted a $1.32 billion net profit in February. 'When you have that kind of money you don’t need to be slugging farmers’ hip pockets twice.' The levy will be used to help fund a new campaign from the supermarket giant called Jamie's Garden . Mr Churchill said Woolworths gave growers no warning this levy was going ahead and Ausveg were only made aware of it when farmers started coming to them. 'They have not received any undertaking from Woolworths about what return they will see under this new scheme,' he said. Ausveg spokesman William Churchill said growers were already paying up to 5 per cent of the cost of produce for marketing . 'They were afraid of being seen as uncooperative and it would have impact on their business, and would receive fewer orders or be struck out all together.' But a Woolworths spokeswoman said it was disappointing that Ausveg had not contacted them because if they had it would have been explained to them that the levy was 'entirely voluntary'. 'We could have explained...how around half our suppliers chose to work with us on the campaign which benefits the whole fruit and vegetable industry and how participating growers are paying less than 2 per cent of the cost of a case of produce,' she said.","Farmers asked to pay a 40c per crate levy on vegetables to pay for the Jamie's Garden promotion .

"By . Mia De Graaf . This is the 'death trap hotel' which hosted more than 90 guests a night before it was forced to shut down. With caved-in ceilings, no water supply in half the building, and just a single pole holding up the roof, New Kimberley Hotel in Blackpool, Lancashire, was branded a hovel of 'jeopardy' by horrified fire safety officers who raided the building last year. Twenty smoke alarms were found to be disabled and fire exits were chained shut. 'Jeopardy': The roof of New Kimberley Hotel, Blackpool, was held up by a single pole, fire officers discovered . More than 90 guests a night stayed in the hotel before it was forced shut. Inspectors found caved-in ceilings . The bedrooms were strewn with plastering, and there was no water supply in half the building . Today, owner Peter Metcalf, 51, has been found guilty of 15 fire safety breaches at the property, which was closed after the raid in March last year. Mark Cairns, fire safety enforcement team . leader for Lancashire Fire and Rescue, said: 'The consequences of the . inadequate fire safety measures and inadequate management could have led . to serious injury or loss of life and circumstances left us no option . but to take this action.' Mr Metcalf, who hosted BNP conferences at the hotel, was handed a 12-week prison sentence suspended for 18 months in 2010 after admitting 13 food hygiene charges. On that occasion, environmental health officers found the kitchen smothered in mould, with out-of-date food left strewn across the top. Alex Bracken, Blackpool Council’s housing enforcement manager, who was among those inspecting the property, said after the raid last year: 'I would say it was a deathtrap. Fire safety officers raided the hotel in March 2013, three years after it was found to breach flood safety rules . Fire officers blasted the conditions of the property after they discovered fire exits were chained shut . This is one of the 20 smoke alarms that were disabled and left dangling from the ceiling while guests stayed . 'If a fire had broken out, which is highly likely given the conditions in the hotel, it would have actually put the fire team in jeopardy. 'The electricity was connected by illegal means and there were some big fire exit blockages and some doors were nailed shut.' Councillor Gillian Campbell, Blackpool Council cabinet member for housing, said: 'The New Kimberley Hotel has been a concern to our public protection team for a number of years. Councillors inspect the building (left) where mattress frames blocked fire doors as business continued (right) Owner Peter Metcalf, 51, being confronted during the raid. Today he was found guilty of 15 safety breaches . 'It’s been one of the most problematic properties we’ve had to deal with and, as a result, we are extremely pleased with the outcome of the case. 'Fire safety is no laughing matter and property owners who fail to make their premises secure are putting lives at risk. 'We have worked together with Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service throughout and together we will continue to tackle landlords who fail in their obligations.' Metcalf is due back in court to be sentenced on June 11.","New Kimberley Hotel, Blackpool, shut down for putting guests in 'jeopardy'

"By . Ashley Collman . The world-famous doctor who caught David Letterman's deadly heart condition helped save the life of another New Yorker this March. Parking garage attendant Errol Mair, 66, was working the early shift at the Capital Parking lot at 470 E 63 Street when he felt a sudden jolt in his left arm. 'I was saying to myself, ""Oh my God, I got a stroke,""' Mair told DNAinfo. 'And I was thinking about my kids.' Lifesaver: Dr Louis Aronne (right), the doctor who diagnosed David Letterman's (left) deadly heart condition in 2000 saved another life last March when a parking lot attendant started suffering a stroke . He called for a co-worker, who put him in a chair and then ran to call the manager and 911. 'His eyes started rolling back and his arm went limp,' co-worker Elease Arnold said. When the ambulance didn't arrive after 10 minutes, parking lot manager Eurold Principale ran out onto the street where he ran into Dr Louis Aronne, a regular customer. Dr Aronne is an internationally-recognized expert on obesity and an internist who works at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell hospital and helped spot David Letterman's life-threatening heart condition in 2000. Dr Aronne knew Mair and had just seen him that morning doing fine. He saw the manager running down the street and asked what was wrong and if he could help. Parking lot attendant Errol Mair started experiencing a stroke while working at the Capital Parking garage at E 63 Street one morning last March . When he saw Mair in the chair, half of his face going limp, he knew that the man was having a stroke and needed to get the hospital right away. Instead of wait longer for the ambulance to arrive, he had another parking attendant bring his car around so he could rush Mair to the hospital himself. 'I felt we had to get him there as quickly as possible,' Dr Aronne said. 'We couldn’t take the chance that the ambulance would take more time. Every minute counts in that situation.' Dr Aronne drove Mair to Weill Cornell's emergency room just a few blocks away where ER doctors dissolved the clot with special medication. Dr Aronne personally drove Mair to Weill Cornell's emergency room where he was giving a life-saving dose of medication . Dr Athos Patsalides says it was Dr Aronne's quick thinking that helped save Mair's life and limit the damage of the stroke. 'The treatments for stroke are effective only if they are done in the first three hours,' he said. 'If the same treatment is done at two hours and 10 hours, it will have completely different results.' Two months later, Mair is still recovering at home with his wife and four kids but is doing fine except for some weakness in his left arm. He's still not sure if he's return to work, but the customers are constantly asking after the well-liked attendant. 'The customers all ask how he's doing, if he's coming back,' Arnold said. 'They all look for him in the morning.' Mair told the New York Post that he appreciates the ER doctors, but is especially grateful to Dr Aronne for all of is help.","Parking lot attendant Errol Mair, 66, experienced a stroke on the job two months ago .

"By . Kate Lyons . Julia Gillard's former boyfriend and ex-union official Bruce Wilson has admitted he charged a construction company without providing them any of the training services he promised for almost a year. Thiess was invoiced by the Australian Workers' Union Workplace Reform Assocation, an alleged slush fund legally established by Julia Gillard and operated by Mr Wilson as treasurer. It is alleged that the money paid by Thiess was in part used to pay for Mr Wilson's home at Fitzroy in Melbourne. Former AWU official and ex-boyfriend of Julia Gillard, Bruce Wilson, arrives to give evidence at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, in Sydney today . 'The training work that you say was done began in the beginning of 1993,' counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar said, addressing Mr Wilson. 'So no training [of] the workers was done by the association for the calendar year 1992?'Mr Wilson told the royal commission into union corruption that was correct. 'I had some access to some paper work and I had looked at some things but in terms of on the site, that's correct,' he said, adding that self-confessed union bagman and associate Ralph Blewitt knew this as well. Mr Wilson denied the invoices were fraudulent, saying that the agreement was like a legal retainer between a law firm and a client. 'The agreement between Thiess and ourselves [was] that we would invoice them from the beginning of the contract to the nominated end of the contract,' he said. 'If for whatever reason you don't do legal work you still send the bill, I bet,' Mr Wilson said. The Royal Commission into union corruption is investigating union slush fund activity and whether money from the Australian Workers' Union funded the renovations of Julia Gillard's house . Bruce Wilson is the ex-boyfriend of Julia Gillard and allegedly made payments to her in the mid-90s . The royal commission into trade union governance and corruption is examining whether money was used to pay for renovations at Ms Gillard's Abbotsford property as well. Bruce Wilson was also confronted with a denial from beyond the grave by the man he says was central to a purported workplace safety scheme that has been described as a corrupt union slush fund. Mr Wilson told the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Thursday that the late Glen Ivory had been appointed as training officer on a Western Australia building site on behalf of the Workplace Reform Association (WRA), the organisation he set up with the assistance of his then-girlfriend and union lawyer Ms Gillard. However Mr Wilson was presented with a statement, made by Mr Ivory before his death, in which the one-time president of the WA branch of the Australian Workers' Union said no training officer was ever appointed and he was never aware of around $2,000 a week billed to construction firm Thiess to pay for the role. Mr Ivory died in 2004 but in a statement given to West Australian police in 1997, said the union had never authorised establishing the WRA or opening bank accounts in its name. Counsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar SC, asked Mr Wilson if his evidence that Mr Ivory was the training officer, was false. Mr Wilson denied that and questioned Mr Ivory's statement. 'I would like to know who prepared this statement for Ivory because it wasn't him,' Mr Wilson said. Mr Stoljar said: 'There seem to be a long list of people, according to you, who are not telling the truth.' 'You have used the name of the late Mr Ivory knowing that he's no longer with us and can't defend himself, is that right?,' Mr Stoljar said. Mr Wilson replied: 'Not at all. In fact I wish he was.' Yesterday, a builder told the commission that Mr Wilson paid for the renovations of Ms Gillard's home in 1993. Athol James, 84, said that he was paid by Julia Gillard for the renovations, who in turn was funded by cash payments from Mr Wilson, suggesting for the first time that there was a direct link between the former prime minister and the union funds. 'During the work I would deal with Ms Gillard in relation to any payment for the completed work,' Mr James said. 'I would give her the invoice. I am pretty certain she said she would get money from Bruce and pay me in the next few days. I'm certain she said Bruce was paying for it.' Mr James replaced some doors and windows in the home between March and June 1993 at a cost of $6,040 according to invoices tendered in the commission. In August a further invoice of $2,986 was submitted by Mr James' company for fencing and flooring at the home. One of Mr Wilson's former employees, Wayne Hem, a researcher and librarian for the Australian Workers' Union, also told the commission yesterday that in 1995 Mr Wilson gave him $5,000 to deposit in Ms Gillard's account. 'He took a wad of notes out of his pocket and he wrote on a piece of paper a bank account number,' Mr Hem said in his witness statement,' Mr Hem said of Mr Wilson. 'He handed me the cash and the piece of paper and asked me to deposit the cash. 'I looked at the paper, asked him to tell whose account it was, and handed him the piece of paper back so that he could write the details on the paper for me. 'He then wrote Julia Gillard on the piece of paper and handed it back to me.' Mr Hem counted the money and deposited it at the Commonwealth Bank in Carlton before returning to the office, he told the commission.","Bruce Wilson is an allegedly corrupt union official .

Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, admitted two counts of assault and received a two-year suspended sentence, 24 months probation and $800 in fines. Brewer, of Moab, Utah, assaulted his father Wesley 'Corky' Brewer, a respected local fire chief, after he allegedly found him having sex with his wife Logan in their son's bed. Seventh District Judge Lyle Anderson told Brewer at Moab's 7th District Court: 'I understand why you would have been very angry on the night of your criminal conduct. 'You understand that you can't accomplish anything with violence', reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Brewer apologized to the court, adding: 'I take full responsibility for [my actions]. 'I'm not a violent person. I wasn't before and I'm not now', the local paper reported. The assaults happened on July 11 when Brewer invited his father over for dinner. According to police details published by TPM, Brewer cooked dinner for the trio before his wife went to put one of their children. After she did not return, he went upstairs to check on and allegedly found her 'on top of his dad' on their son's bed. Brewer then fought with his father and his wife raced to her parents' house. Wesley Brewer then returned to his own home 'to find a firearm'.

Happier times: TJ Brewer allegedly found his wife Logan Brewer having sex with his father in their son's bed . However when his . distressed wife, Cindy Brewer, tried to hide the gun in the car, Wesley Brewer allegedly 'grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed himself two . times, puncturing a lung and slicing his liver'. He was rushed to Moab Regional Hospital eventually had to be flown to a Colorado hospital for surgery. The father and son were among several law enforcement officers in the extended Brewer . family, which includes multiple police officers and local sheriff’s . deputies. TPM reported the sheriff's deputy went to the hospital to 'kill' his father, and was initially confronted by his uncle, Curt Brewer, who is also a sheriff’s . deputy, in the parking lot. Family: TJ Brewer, pictured with his wife Logan and their children, managed to keep his certification on Wednesday, but only by a single vote . When police arrived, intoxicated TJ was not wearing a shirt or shoes and 'stated several . times that he wanted to kill his dad, that he wanted his gun to ‘finish . the job'.' Police wrote in their report: 'TJ . made numerous remarks to each officer and deputy that arrived, about . all of us being stupid, dumb asses, and at one point stated we needed to . call someone with a brain to come and talk with him.' He then assaulted a police officer, according to Salt Lake Tribune. Brewer was arrested and charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault, two . counts of domestic violence in front a child, assault on a police . officer, intoxication, and disorderly conduct by Grand County officers. Injured: Moab Fire Chief Wesley 'Corky' Brewer stabbed himself twice after the confrontation . Violent: Police say TJ Brewer went to Moab Regional Hospital to 'kill' his father, Wesley 'Corky' Brewer . However, because of the Brewers' law enforcement ties in Grand County, the investigation was passed onto the Utah County Sheriff’s Office who reduced the charges to two class A misdemeanors - assault and assault against a . peace officer. The Utah Attorney General prosecuted the case rather than the local . district attorney. Since his arrest, Brewer has resigned as sheriff's deputy at the Grand County Sheriff’s Department. His father also resigned from the fire department where he had been . chief since 1989.","Former sheriff's deputy Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer pleaded guilty to two counts of assault after allegedly finding his wife and father having sex .

"By . Richard Spillett . A British secret agent was at the centre of a plot to destabilise the USSR by handing out copies of Boris Pasternak's book Doctor Zhivago to ordinary Soviet citizens, it has been revealed. The writer's 1957 classic work was strictly banned in the Soviet Union because Communist censors believed it challenged the official version of events in the Russian revolution. The CIA saw the book as the perfect propaganda weapon against its enemy during the tensest years of the Cold War. It has now emerged that the US intelligence agency got a copy of the work due to a British secret agent, who photographed the text, which was then passed on to Washington by MI6. A British secret agent got hold of a manuscript of Boris Pasternak's book Doctor Zhivago ahead of a CIA plot to use the classic work to undermine the Soviet Union's Communist regime . The British link to the plot only emerged this week, in newly classified CIA documents that state an unnamed MI6 agent got hold of the original text. How the spy found the manuscript is unclear, as Russian writer Pasternak is only thought to have given it to his Italian publisher and two Oxford dons, one of which was the famous philosopher Isaiah Berlin. But a CIA memo states that in January 1958, British intelligence handed over two microfilms containing negatives of the original 433-page manuscript. The memo, published in Guardian today, states that MI6 were 'in favour of exploiting Pasternak's book and have offered to provide whatever assistance they can'. What the CIA did next is the subject of a new book, The Zhivago Affair: The Kremlin, the CIA and the Battle over a Forbidden Book by Peter Finn and Petra Couvee, which is published on July 3. Copies of the book by Boris Pasternak (left) were then handed out to visiting Russians at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels (right) in a move the CIA hoped would spread knowledge of the work behind the Iron Curtain . The new book reveals that the Americans used the . British idea and had copies of the Russian text printed in Holland . before giving them to visiting Russians at Vatican's pavilion of the . 1958 World's Fair in Brussels. The Americans hoped the secret copies would circulate behind the Iron Curtain and undermineNikita Khrushchev's Communist regime in the years before the Cuban Missile Crisis. Another CIA memo from the time states: 'We have the opportunity to make Soviet citizens wonder what is wrong with their government, when a fine literary work by the man acknowledged to be the greatest living Russian writer is not even available in his own country in his own language for his own people to read.' The novel follows the life of Yuri Zhivago, a physician and poet, as he falls in love with two women throughout decades of revolution, war and Communist oppression in Russia. Newly-classified CIA memos show MI6 sent two microfilms containing negatives of the text to US authorities . The CIA's Soviet Russia Division chief said in another declassified memo: 'Pasternak's humanistic message - that every person is entitled to a private life and deserves respect as a human being, irrespective of the extent of his political loyalty or contribution to the state - poses a fundamental challenge to the Soviet ethic of sacrifice of the individual to the Communist system.' Pasternak won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1958, but was not allowed to travel to Sweden to claim the award. He spent the rest of his life in USSR and died at the age of 70 in 1960. The 1965 film adaptation of the novel starring Julie Christie and Omar Sharif went on to win five Academy Awards, a nomination for best picture and remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time. The book's author went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature and the story was made into a hugely successful film starring Omar Sharif as Yuri Zhivago and Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya .","British secret agent photographed script of classic work banned in USSR .

"By . Chris Pleasance . She was an architect, carving out a promising career in New York in 1996, working on projects in the Hamptons and Connecticut, while living in an apartment in the affluent Park Slope area. He was a convicted murderer, a high school drop out with an interest in the occult, doing time on death row accused of killing three eight-year-old boys as part of a Satanic ritual. Within three years Lorri Davis and Damien Echols, one of the infamous West Memphis Three, would be married - touching for the first time on their wedding day. In 1996 Lorri Davis (left) began writing to Damien Echols, one of the infamous Memphis Three serving time on death row. The two fell in love and married before Damien was eventually released in August 2011 . In 1994 Damien was convicted of killing three eight-year-old boys in West Memphis, Arkansas, along with two of his friends, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley Jr. In August 2011 Echols and his co-accused would eventually be freed, but for fourteen years Lorri found herself having a romance with, and eventually marrying, a man in high security prison. Speaking to the New York Post, Lorri has told the story of that romance, starting with writing letters to Damien on a whim after seeing a documentary about his court case. Damien, who had long hair and an interest in the occult, was convicted of killing three eight-year-old schoolboys in 1993 as part of Satanic ritual . She said: 'I knew something horrible had gone wrong here on every level: the community, the case, the convictions. I thought: “There’s no way he could have committed this crime.”' A week after the screening, she decided to write to Damien, telling him she had seen the film and asking if he needed anything. A week later, she got a reply. Reading the note, Lorri recalls that 'he didn’t write like a guy who’s on death row but like a Southern gentleman.' That letter began a bizarre but touching romance that Lorri kept hidden from everyone except a few close friends. She didn't dare to tell her parents, and after a while felt like she was living a double life. A few months after their first message, Damien wrote to say he loved her. Without having to think about it, Lorri wrote back to say she loved him too. They soon began calling each other and met face-to-face for the first time in 1997. Lorri flew down to Little Rock the night before, and had to be at the prison by 8am the next day. Wearing dark blue pants, a black sweater and Doc Marten boots, she  was brought into a room where Damien was sitting on the other side of a glass partition. She said: . 'It was very upsetting. He had lost so much weight since the documentary . was filmed. His hair was really long, and he had long fingernails. 'I mean, he’s a gorgeous man, but you could tell that he was suffering greatly.' The only gap in the glass was a small window at the bottom covered in wire mesh so they couldn't touch. Instead they sat up against the partition to be as close as possible. The pair called each other every day, met once a week in order to watch TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer together, and still wrote to each other up until Damien's release . A letter Damien write to Lorri, starting 'My lovely one'. In it her calls her his 'beauteous thing', assuring her the relationship 'will work out' and ends by saying 'I am yours forever' Back in New York, Lorri's work began to . suffer as her mind wandered to Damien. They kept in constant contact, . and called each other every day. In the end, Lorri had to start budgeting for how and when they would speak, as she was running up a bill of $500 a month, according to xojane.com. In 1998, a year and a half after they first spoke, Lorri made a life-changing decision. To the shock of her friends, family and colleagues, she quit her job and moved to Little Rock to be near Damien. She took a job earning barely a quarter of her previous salary, but it didn't matter. This way she could visit him every Friday when they watched shows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer together. The pair married while he was still in jail in December 1999, touching for the first time on their wedding day . Soon they were engaged. Lorri says it . took her parents about a year to adjust to the news, before the two were . married on December 3, 1999 - the day they touched for the first time. According to prison regulations, the Buddhist ceremony was supposed to last 20 minutes and contain only a small amount of kissing, but throwing caution to the wind, Lorri and Damien kissed constantly, and the wedding lasted over an hour. While Lorri was engrossed in the moment, she realises now that the day was very hard on Damien, who nearly passed out from stress at one point. Damien had not touched another person for six years, and had barely been around more than one person at a time. That stress was just a taste of what life would be like when Damien was released from jail 12 years later, in part thanks to fundraising from Lorri, and also because of celebrities such as Johnny Depp, and musicians Eddie Vedder and Dave Navarro, campaigning for him. Damien was freed in August 2011, thanks in part to campaigning and fundraising by Lorri, after agreeing to plead guilty to the crime in return for not suing the state for wrongful imprisonment . At first the couple lived in a Manhattan apartment of Peter Jackson, who produced the documentary West of Memphis about the case, before moving to Salem, the town of the infamous witch hunts. Some members of the community shunned Damien, with one writing a blog detailing his every movement about the town, so they have now moved to an apartment in Harlem. Lorri says the couple are still adjusting to life together, including writing, giving public speeches, and campaigning to find the real killer behind the West Memphis murders.","Damien Echols put on death row in 1994 as part of infamous Memphis Three .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Lawyers for Donald Sterling have hired private investigators to dig up dirt on NBA owners and commissioners, according to a source close to the disgraced LA Clippers owner. Four investigative firms are said to have been given a six-figure budget and 30 days to look into whether any other owners have made off-color jokes, or racist or sexist remarks. The individual said detectives were looking at the league's finances, allegations of previous discrimination and compensation to commissioner Adam Silver and predecessor David Stern. Investigation: An insider claims Donald Sterling's legal team has hired four private investigation firms to dig up dirt on the NBA's former and current commissioners and owners . Current NBA commissioner Adam Silver (right) and his predecessor David Stern (left) are allegedly being targeted by the firms, as are the league's other owners . Sterling is suing the NBA for $1billion in federal court after the league tried to oust him as Clippers owner for making racist remarks to a girlfriend that were publicised. A trial will be held next month to . determine whether Sterling was properly removed as an . administrator for the family trust that owns the team. The sports franchise was due to be sold for $2billion by his estranged wife Shelly Sterling last month to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, but he is now attempting to block the deal. A . probate court judge in Los Angeles Wednesday denied Shelly Sterling's . urgent request to confirm her authority as sole administrator so that she could complete the sale. Instead, . the judge agreed to an expedited hearing because of looming sales . deadlines. The development . is the latest in a legal tug-of-war following the NBA's decision to ban . Donald Sterling for life after racist remarks to a girlfriend were . recorded and publicized. Shelly Sterling, Donald's estranged wife, had been poised to sell the team for $2billion but the sale is now on hiatus . Court filings Wednesday indicated the NBA has set a hard deadline of Sept. 15. If the sale isn't completed then, the league will undertake proceedings to seize and sell the team on its own. If that were to happen, Sterling would still receive any money from the sports franchise, but would not be able to negotiate terms. Donald Sterling's lawyer, Bobby Samini, left the courthouse without comment after a clerk announced the trial schedule. Neither Sterling was present. 'I just want to resolve this as quickly as possible,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told The Associated Press on Wednesday in Miami at an NBA Cares event.","Donald Sterling fighting NBA's efforts to force him into sale of LA Clippers .

"By . Associated Press . This is the 41-year-old father who is charged with murder for killing the registered sex offender who molested his daughter . Supporters are lining up behind an Alabama father charged with killing the man who went to prison for molesting his daughter more than a decade ago, but a man who came face-to-face with the alleged gunman said Tuesday the shooter doesn't deserve any praise. A Facebook site created to show support for the man had more than 950 members within hours of its creation, and donors gave more than $350 on another website to help fund his legal defense. Jason Lackey, a longtime friend of the alleged shooter, contributed $150. 'The guy was guilty of raping his little girl, and I guess he dealt with it for 12 years and it just built up,' said Lackey, who has a recreational vehicle business in Cullman. 'I won't say (he) had the right to go murder him, but I understand when he did.' The Associated Press doesn't identify victims of sex crimes, and it isn't naming the man charged with murder to protect his daughter's identity. The father is charged with murder in the slaying of Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, a registered sex offender who was fatally shot on Sunday outside the rural home where he lived with his parents. Brooks pleaded guilty to sexually abusing the man's daughter in 2002, and the Alabama Department of Corrections said Brooks served 27 months of a five-year prison term before being released early in February 2005. The father also is charged with opening fire on a stepdaughter's boyfriend outside a convenience store moments before the slaying. Mike Hays, who cooks and operates a small barbecue restaurant inside Berlin Plaza Quick Stop, where the shooting occurred, said he came face-to-face with the shooter after the man opened fire outside and then entered the store looking for his intended victim, who wasn't hurt. 'People here are calling him a hero for killing a child molester. I'm calling him a psychopathic lunatic for endangering peoples' lives, including mine,' Hays said. After stopping his motorcycle at an intersection outside the store, the father fired once at a man who was standing beside an ice cooler, Hays said. The bullet entered an exterior wall of the store and chipped a window but no one was injured. Hays said he retrieved his own weapon and confronted the gunman near the cash register. 'He had the gun down by his side. He was calm, as calm as you are standing there now. But he had that look in his eye,' said Hays. 'I have no problem with him shooting a child molester, just not 12 years later. If it was my daughter he would have died back in 2002.' Brooks' father, Ralph Brooks, told WBRC-TV in Birmingham that his son did not deserve to die. He said Raymond Earl Brooks turned his life around after his conviction and lived a godly life that included being active in his church. Because his son's conviction happened so long ago, he said he couldn't be sure if the shooting was a form of revenge. Shot dead: Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, who was convicted of molesting a 7-year-old girl in 2002, was gunned down at his parents' home . 'It would be unbelievable to hold animosity in your heart for 12 years,' Brooks said. A . person who answered the door at the Brooks' home Tuesday told an . Associated Press reporter the family was making funeral arrangements and . was not available to comment immediately. Lackey . said he was told by a relative that the shootings followed a family . argument over the stepdaughter's boyfriend that grew heated enough to . include a reference to the sexual abuse case from years before. 'I'm 100 per cent behind him,' Lackey said. Chief . Deputy Mac Barlett said the father did make a statement to deputies . after he was arrested Sunday night, but Barlett said he could not . comment on what the man had said. The . father and Brooks 'obviously didn't have a whole lot of good blood . between them,' but it was unknown whether the shooting was directly . linked to the sex abuse case, Bartlett said. 'It is odd. He apparently had a lot of stressors going on in his life,' Bartlett said. The suspect's father told MailOnline he has no idea why he might have waited 13 years to attack Brooks. Support: Supporters on the Facebook page for the murder suspect call him a 'hero' He said he hadn't heard his son talk about the attack since the trial in 2001 and 2002. Documents show the suspect was a witness . against Brooks in a sexual abuse case involving his daughter in 2001. Police said the girl was eight at the time, but court records show she was seven. Brooks pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in 2002 and initially was sentenced to five years in prison but later received probation, records show. He finished paying $2,946 in restitution and costs in 2009. Barlett . said Brooks was shot several times at the home of his parents, where he . had been living, shortly after the shooting at the store. The father . apparently rode his motorcycle straight to the house after the first . shooting, Bartlett said, but the reason was unclear. The suspect used a 9mm pistol that he was legally permitted to carry in both shootings. The man also was charged with attempted murder and shooting into an occupied building, Bartlett said. The suspect had been arrested twice before for domestic violence, though the charges were either dismissed or he was found not guilty. Barlett said Brooks had not violated his probation or his sex offender restrictions since his release from prison. 'As it stands right now, the defendant committed a murder. We look at it no different, no matter the history of the victim. Mr Brooks had previously been sentenced and released for his crime,' he said. 'Regardless of any past or pending crimes that he may have committed, this was murder.'","The father, 41, who is not being identified by MailOnline, shot dead Raymond Earl Brooks, 59, Sunday .

"By . Ashley Collman . A 17-year-old Oklahoma girl was accidentally killed when a gang member mistook her for a rival in a tragic incident that happened just one day after she graduated high school, cops claim. Kayla Ferrante was sitting in her boyfriend's car the night of May 26, 2012 when Edwin Jermaine Daniels, now 26, opened fired on the vehicle. Two years later, Daniels is finally facing a trial, as the circumstances of Ferrante's death have been revealed as a likely case of misidentification. Scroll down for video . Mistaken identity: Kayla Ferrante, 17 (left), was shot dead sitting in her boyfriend's car two years ago by suspect Edwin Jermaine Daniels, now 26 (right), who allegedly thought she was a rival gang member . Tragic: Ferrante had graduated from high school just one day before the deadly incident . Just the day before her death, Ferrante graduated a year early from Tulsa's Memorial High School and she dreamed of continuing her studies to become a special education teacher. The next afternoon, her grandmother held a graduation party in her honor and after that she drove over to a friend's house to watch TV. Her father Paul Ferrante last saw her leaving the party, when the two hugged and said they loved each other. That evening, her boyfriend Neikko Perez was driving her home to make her midnight curfew when she was shot. The couple were nearly home, so Ferrante's mother heard the shots ring out in the street and immediately checked to see if her daughter was involved. 'I ran to her. She was slumped in the seat. I could see her bleeding. I put my hand over her to stop the bleeding. I begged her to stay with me. I told her I loved her,' mom Roxanne Thornton told News on 6. Couple: Ferrante was being driven by her boyfriend Neikko Perez (pictured toghether) at the time of her death . Proud day: Ferrante planned to continue her education and become a special education teacher. Pictured above on graduation day with dad Paul Ferrante . Gruesome: Mom Roxanne Thornton (pictured) was at home at the time of the shooting, and ran out to find her daughter bleeding to death in the passenger seat of the boyfriend's car . Initially Daniels got away, but he was arrested a few months later and authorities recovered the murder weapon buried in his aunt's backyard. He has since been sentenced to 307 years in prison for a separate case including convictions on first-degree burglary, robbery with a firearm, attempted robbery, kidnapping and assault while wearing a mask. Before Daniels was arrested, community members raised $10,000 as a reward to capture Ferrante's killer. Since Daniels was arrested without the aide of a crime stoppers tip, the reward money now funds a charity called Kayla's Kids which benefits special needs children. Daniels trial began Monday. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of shooting with intent to kill. Family and friends have since created a charity in Ferrante's name to help benefit special needs children.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Arizona schoolgirl who had her Instagram profile taken over by an imposter has been told by police there is nothing they can do to help. Reve Osheel, 12, was horrified when she realized someone had been sending bullying messages to her school friends from an account in her name. But when her mother, Brooke Barr contacted the police she was told that although it was mean, because her daughter had not been directly harassed there was nothing they could do. Upset: Reve Osheel says she feels hurt after someone set up a fake Instagram in her name to bully her friends . Ms Barr said that her daughter had been ignored at school because of the nasty comments being posted under her name. Reve, who has Tourette's syndrome, had already been bullied at school because of her illness, but because of the fake account she has been picked on even more. 'It makes me feel kind of sad and just weird. I don’t know why someone would do this to me, and hurt me and my friends,' she told ABC News. Ms Brooke, who shares an Instagram account with her daughter, first realized that an imposter was posing as her daughter when she saw that a Reve_Osheel had 'liked' a photo. After checking with her husband if he had given their daughter permission to have her own account, she started to try to trace who had created it. 'The photos were all taken from Reve’s . account that I monitor. They took screen shots, edited them and . re-posted. They looked very believable,' Ms Barr said. No trace: Brooke and her daughter Reve have not been able to find out who set up the fake account . Bullied: Reve Osheel has been ignored at school because of the mean comments posted from a fake account set up in her name . Because the family's real account is private, Ms Barr believes that whoever set up the fake Instagram knows her daughter. The imposter has already sent 35 posts, and has 83 followers, but the account is being used to harass Reve's friends. Ms Barr said that one post read: 'You are such a brat, [explicit], . [explicit]. And, like, you think . you're popular but you're not. So stop acting like one and you will . never be one because you are a [explicit].' The mom has approached her daughter's school friends, the police and Instagram to try to stop the account, and to explain that Reve is not to blame. She believes the imposter could be a child at Reve's school, and speculated that because her daughter had spoken out after being bullied, she had been made a target. Sergeant William Sanger said the police were unable to take action, but that he wished the department could do more. 'It’s a pretty crappy thing to do, but . it's not criminal in nature. If they start making threats or something . then that’s different,' he told ABC News. When Ms Barr contacted Instagram she was told that unless she had a warrant they were unable to share private information. The social network later stated the imposter's account was currently listed as not active. 'All I want to do is find out who this is. Why can’t I trace the IP address to see who did this?' Ms Barr said.","Brooke Barr says fake account was set up in her daughter Reve's name .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A 16-year-old girl who was kidnapped as she waited for a bus has escaped her captor's clutches by wriggling her hands free from their binds and stabbing him with his knife. The girl, who has not been identified, has been treated in a Denver area hospital and released after suffering cuts to her hands during the stabbing - but her kidnapper is still at large. The incident began on Wednesday evening when the suspect pulled up beside the girl as she waited for a bus in Edgewater, Colorado and asked her for directions. After offering her a ride, she apparently willingly got into his truck, but as they neared her home in Edgewater, he pulled the vehicle into an alleyway and threatened to hurt her, police said. Scroll down for video . Scene: A teenage girl got inside a man's car on Wednesday but as he neared her neighborhood in Edgewater, Colorado (pictured), he threatened to hurt her and tied her up, police said . She told authorities that he pulled out a knife, bound her hands with rope and began to drive away. After driving for about an hour on what police say was Interstate 225 in Aurora, the girl said she was able to open the passenger door and stick out her legs in an attempt to alert another driver. When it failed to work, she freed one of hands from the ropes and found the suspect's knife on the floorboard, Fox31 reported. She grabbed it and lunged at the suspect, stabbing him in what she believes was his left shoulder and rib cage, police said. The man stopped the vehicle and the girl jumped out and ran through a gap in the sound barrier walls before running to a nearby residence. The residents called police around 10pm.

"By . Associated Press . Freed then killed: Bobby Lee Pearson was accidentally released after a jury mistakenly identified him as not-guilty and then he got into a fatal argument with his sister's boyfriend when he arrived home . A career criminal has been killed after he was mistakenly released from court when a jury accidentally signed a not-guilty verdict and then he was stabbed to death in a fight hours later. The flabbergasted judge said Wednesday that he had no choice but to order defendant Bobby Lee Pearson to be released from jail because the verdict of not guilty had been put on the record, The Fresno Bee reported. Hours later, Pearson was stabbed to death after going to a home to get some clothing and belongings, Fresno police Sgt. James Rios said. He apparently got into a fight early Thursday with his sister's boyfriend, who Rios says then stabbed him. The two reportedly had a long history of problems. The boyfriend's name has not been released. Though he had not been formally found guilty in the burglary case, The Fresno Bee referred to him as a felon and a career criminal, indicating that he had a prior history. Superior Court Judge W. Kent Hamlin said Wednesday that he couldn't change the verdict form because double jeopardy was already attached. 'This has never happened to me in more than 100 jury trials that I have done,' he said. Pearson and two co-defendants were accused of burglarizing an apartment last year and stealing a video system and a gun. The homeowner allegedly caught the intruders and wrestled with one of them. Jurors returned a guilty verdict against Pearson's co-defendant, Terrel Minniweather, and the mistaken not guilty verdict against Pearson before lunch Wednesday. Scene: Pearson was stabbed to death after going to a home in Fresno to get some clothing and belongings . Hamlin asked the jury whether that was in fact its verdict against Pearson, and all 12 jurors nodded yes, the Bee reported. The jurors were then asked to return after lunch for a potential second phase of the trial. The confusion over the verdict against came to light during lunch, when one juror told court staff that he had voted to find Pearson guilty, said Linden Lindahl, Minniweather's attorney. Jurors said they were confused by the forms, one of which was for a guilty verdict and the other for a not guilty verdict. Flabbergasted: Judge W. Kent Hamlin (pictured in 2012) said that he has never heard of such confusion among jurors in his years on the bench . One juror said there was no form they could sign that indicated the jury was deadlocked. After it was too late, jurors told the judge they were hung on the charges against Pearson. Prosecutors might have had an opportunity to retry Pearson in the case of a hung jury. 'I can't believe it,' Superior Court Judge W. Kent Hamlin said after he ordered Pearson to be set free.","A Fresno, California jury mistakenly submitted a not guilty verdict when they meant to say they were a hung jury .

"By . Associated Press . American teens are smoking less, drinking less and fighting less. But they're texting behind the wheel and spending a lot of time on video games and computers, according to the government's latest study of worrisome behavior. Generally speaking, the news is good. Most forms of drug use, weapons use and risky sex have been going down since the government started doing the survey every two years in 1991. Teens are wearing bicycle helmets and seat belts more, too. 'Overall, young people have more healthy behaviors than they did 20 years ago,' said Dr. Stephanie Zaza, who oversees the study at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scroll down for video . FILE- In this Dec. 14, 2011, file photo, a driver uses an iPhone while driving in Los Angeles. Among teen drivers, 41 percent had texted or emailed behind the wheel in the previous month according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was released on Thursday, June 12, 2014. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File) The results come from a study of 13,000 U.S. high school students last spring. Participation was voluntary and required parental permission, but responses were anonymous. Highlights of the study released Thursday: . SMOKING . Fewer than 16 percent of the teens smoked a cigarette in the previous month — the lowest level since the government started doing the survey, when the rate was more than 27 percent. Another CDC study had already put the teen smoking rate below 16 percent, but experts tend to treat this survey's result as the official number. It's ""terrific news for America's health,"" said Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Even so, there are still about 2.7 million teens smoking, he said. The survey did not ask about electronic cigarettes, which have exploded in popularity in the past few years. Meanwhile, more than 23 percent of teens said they used marijuana in the previous month — up from 15 percent in 1991. CDC officials said they could not tell whether marijuana or e-cigarettes have replaced traditional cigarettes among teens. FIGHTING . Fights at school fell by half in the past 20 years. And there was a dramatic drop in kids reporting they had been in a fight anywhere in the preceding year — about 25 percent, down from 33 percent two years earlier. The addition of more guards and other security measures may be a factor, said school violence expert Todd DeMitchell of the University of New Hampshire. TEXTING . Among teen drivers, 41 percent had texted or emailed behind the wheel in the previous month. That figure can't be compared to the 2011 survey, though, because the CDC changed the question this time. The latest survey gives texting-while-driving figures for 37 states — ranging from 32 percent in Massachusetts to 61 percent in South Dakota.

Fights at school fell by half in the past 20 years. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) DRINKING . Fewer teens said they drank alcohol. Drinking of soda was down, too. About 35 percent said they had had booze in the previous month, down from 39 percent in 2011. About 27 percent said they drank soda each day. That was only a slight change from 2011 but a sizable drop from 34 percent in 2007. SEX . The proportion of teens who had sex in the previous three months held steady at about 34 percent from 2011. Among them, condom use was unchanged at about 60 percent. SUICIDE . The percentage who attempted suicide in the previous year held steady at about 8 percent. MEDIA USE . TV viewing for three or more hours a day has stalled at around 32 percent since 2011. But in one of the largest jumps seen in the survey, there was a surge in the proportion of kids who spent three or more hours on an average school day on other kinds of recreational screen time, such as playing video or computer games or using a computer or smartphone for something other than schoolwork. That number rose to 41 percent, from 31 percent in 2011. Health experts advise that teens get no more than two hours of recreational screen time a day, and that includes all screens — including Xboxes, smartphones and televisions. Although video-gaming is up, particularly among teen boys, some researchers believe most of the screen-time increase is due to social media use. And it's probably not a good thing, they say. Through texts and social media, young people are doing more communicating and living in an online world in which it's easier to think they're the center of the universe, said Marina Krcmar, a Wake Forest University professor who studies teen screen time. That can lead to a form of extended adolescence, she said. It can also distract youngsters from schoolwork, exercise and other healthy activities, she said.","Study shows that many teenage vices have gone the way of their land line phones, but their cell phones are getting them into trouble .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A Romanian princess has decided to plead guilty next month to being involved in an Oregon cockfighting ring, court documents have revealed. Irina Walker, 61, and her husband John Walker, a former sheriff's deputy, staged at least 10 cockfighting derbies between April 2012 and April 2013 at their ranch in Irrigon — 175 miles east of Portland, she will admit. She is the third daughter of . former Romanian King Michael I. Michael, now 92, was forced to abdicate . by the communists in 1947, and grew up in Switzerland before moving to the U.S. in the 1980s. Dynamic Duo: Princess Irina (left) and former sheriff's deputy John Walker (right) will plead guilty next month . Her upbringing was a far cry from the royal lifestyle her family enjoyed prior to World War II. Blades were attached to the birds' legs, spectators were charged admission, and food and drink were sold, the indictment said. The fights allegedly brought in as much as $2,000 a day. The couple was charged with unlawful animal fighting, conspiracy to violate the animal welfare act and operating an illegal gambling business. Both have change of plea hearings scheduled for July 16 in Portland. Federal prosecutor Stephen Peifer confirmed that Irina Walker is scheduled to plead guilty, but declined comment when asked the terms of any plea agreement. Walker's lawyer, Per Ramfjord, was out of the office Thursday and didn't return a message.

Cockfighting: Roosters fight during the IV World Cockfighting Championship in Cali March 22, 2013, in a match similar to the ones held by the Walkers . Walker's daughter, Angelica Kreuger, told the AP last year that her mother moved to the U.S. from Switzerland in the early 1980s with her former husband. Kreuger said her mother never lived a lavish lifestyle. She rode horses, gardened, studied the Bible and raised two children while living in southwest Oregon. She later divorced her husband and married a man who had been a family friend and neighbor — former Coos County sheriff's deputy John Walker. The couple moved to eastern Oregon. More than a dozen other people were charged in connection with the cockfighting business. Some pleaded guilty in a companion case from Washington state and had their District of Oregon charges dismissed, court records show. One co-defendant, Apolinar Munoz-Gutierrez, also known as Polo, was scheduled to plead guilty in Portland Thursday afternoon to animal fighting and being an alien in possession of a firearm, Peifer said.","Princess Irina Walker and her former cop husband will admit to running a cockfighting ring .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A long-time Minnesota clergyman has admitted to sexually abusing nearly a dozen boys since the 1960s but says he never viewed his actions as a crime. Former priest Thomas Adamson testified recently in court during a lawsuit against the archdiocese of St Paul and Minneapolis that he first admitted to abusing children in 1964, but that no action was taken and he remained in the parish. He also told prosecutors that he saw his actions as a sin and never realized how serious his transgressions were until multiple lawsuits starting being filed against the church. The comments were made during testimony for one of those suits. 'I looked at it more as a sin than… a crime,' said the disgraced ex-priest. Admitted pedophile: Former priest Thomas Adamson, who is at the center of a lawsuit against the St. Paul-Minneapolis archdiocese, has admitted to sexually abusing several boys . Adamson’s testimony in the latest lawsuit to reach courts, from a boy alleging abuse in the 1970s, is damning. The former high school basketball coach is accused of abusing 37 boys, but previously admitted to only 10 instances. The pedophile was removed from the priesthood in 2009 – 45 years after his first admission of guilt. He conceded when asked in his most recent court appearance about how many boys he abused that he wasn’t sure. ‘I don’t know. I’d have to study that out.’ He said according to an affidavit cited by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. He has also conceded to not even remembering the names of some of his victims. Adamson began his time in the Catholic Church at the Winona Diocese in 1961. He was soon met with allegations of abuse from some of the boys he was coaching on a high school basketball team. ‘I had abused a boy there, and he reported it to another priest,’ Adamson recalled. He admitted to the abuse but was allowed to remain in his position without any warnings to parents or school officials, according to the paper . Where some of the abuse happened: The Winona church where Adamson says some of the boys were abused . Adamson also admitted abusing at least two other boys only 14-years-old during the same school year, ‘probably in the gym or school’ a couple of times. ‘I was coaching again and they [his victims] were on the team,’ he said. The only action taken was to transfer him to the bigger Archidiocese of St Paul and Minneapolis. He admits to abusing two brothers in a number of places including a car, hotel, YMCA and even a sauna. The church sent him to a therapist instead of reporting him to the police. ‘Where it was leading me or if it helped, I don’t know that,’ he admitted. When asked if anyone had ever told him what he was doing was a crime, he replied: ‘I don’t remember that, no.’ Several other allegations came in the decades that followed, and Adamson says the last boy he was abused was in the early 1980s – but court records proved he abused at least one boy until 1987. The admitted abuser stayed in his position as a priest until 2009, when he left after being asked to do so voluntarily. Adamson's pension, health and dental insurance remain in place. He faces no jail time because the state of Minnesota's statute of limitations on child sex crimes gives victims only seven years from the time of the crime to press criminal charges, . Victims also only had until the age of 24 to file a civil suit until a new child sex liability law was passed last year by the state legislature.","Former priest Thomas Adamson has admitted to abusing several young boys since 1961 .

"By . Julian Robinson . A previously unseen letter by Albert Einstein has revealed the genius was once corrected - by a 23-year-old student. Herbert Salzer was studying for a Master’s degree in physics when he wrote to Einstein to point out that an equation in one of his published papers was actually wrong. The eminent German physicist initially politely dismissed the claim, replying to the young student with a long-winded and mathematical defence of his work. In a previously unseen letter, Albert Einstein, pictured right, admitted to Herbert Salzer, pictured left, that he had made a mistake . He concluded ‘I will now show that equation is really, really not the equation you specified’ before signing off 'Yours respectfully, A. Einstein'. But two weeks later Salzer received a second letter from Einstein in which he sensationally conceded he had made a mistake. The second letter, written by Einstein on September 13, 1938, reads: 'Shortly after I wrote you, I noticed that the error was on my side... '...The transformation required is exactly that of a tensor in the Theory of Relativity. 'Therefore, your transformation equation is correct, mine wrong. I don’t have my earlier work available. But it sure seems that I have made the same mistake there. 'This will make my assertions about the shape of the first approximation inaccurate.' The correspondence related to Einstein’s work on a unified theory of Distant Parallelism - a study of gravitation and electromagnetic fields. Einstein had spent years developing the theory but had abandoned his work in 1931 because he had struggled to explain the link between the two fields. The correspondence related to Einstein's work on a unified theory of Distant Parallelism - a study of gravitation and electromagnetic fields. Einstein's two letters, in German, plus Salzer's original letter are now tipped to fetch £50,000 at auction . At the age of 23, Herbert Salzer, pictured, wrote to Albert Einstein to question him about a point regarding his first approximation equation in his relativity theory . But the revelation of his mistake, pointed out by US student Mr Salzer, made him revisit the theory. Mr Salzer went on to become an acclaimed physicist in his own right, lecturing at Columbia and Brooklyn universities and publishing more than 100 papers. He died in 2006 aged 91 and the letters passed to his family, who are now selling them. Einstein’s two letters, written in German, and Salzer’s original letter are now tipped to fetch £50,000 at auction. Joe Maddalena, auctioneer at Profiles in History in Los Angeles, said: 'These letters are remarkable because in them Einstein humbly admits to a 23-year-old physics student that he was wrong. Herbert Salzer was born in the US in 1915 and went on to become an applied mathematician. It was in 1938 that Salzer, as a 23-year-old working on his master’s degree in mathematics and applied sciences at Columbia University, wrote to Einstein with what he believed were corrections to Einstein's unified field theory equations. Salzer completed his masters and went on to become an acclaimed physicist in his own right, lecturing at Columbia and Brooklyn universities and publishing more than 100 papers. In 1957 as a 42-year-old he wrote 'Toward a Gibbsian Approach to the Problems of Growth and Cancer' outlining a theory of form development at the cellular level. He died in 2006 aged 91 and the letters passed to his family, who are now selling them. 'It goes to show that despite being one of the greatest thinkers of all time Einstein was still just human and he made mistakes from time to time. 'What is incredible is that not only did he reply to Herbert Salzer’s initial letter, he then thought about it and sent him another letter accepting his mistake. 'The tone of the second letter is not of annoyance but one of excitement that Salzer has given him a lead to pursuing his unified field theory, something he had worked on since his theory of relativity breakthrough. 'He was grateful to anything that might put him back on the right track. 'We expect there to be a huge amount of interest worldwide in the sale of these letters.' The auction will take place on Friday.","Herbert Salzer wrote to Albert Einstein telling him he had made a mistake .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A 57-year-old man has been rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard after he tried to paddle from California to Hawaii in a kayak. The unidentified man, who had turned back to California, was spotted by a helicopter 11 days into his daring trek across the Pacific after some of his equipment malfunctioned. He was found on Tuesday about 60 miles southwest of Santa Barbara's Point Conception after he sent out a distress call, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The helicopter directed a Coast Guard cutter crew to the man, who was found in good health but 'lucky to be alive', the statement said. Stranded: This 57-year-old man was rescued from the Pacific on Tuesday as he tried to paddle from California to Hawaii in a kayak. He had already turned back to California when he sent out a distress call . A friend of the man said he had left Monterey on May 30 attempting to make the voyage of nearly 2,400 miles to Honolulu in a kayak with a solar panel that charged all his electronic equipment. The solar panel malfunctioned Saturday, and the man turned back. He sent out the distress call when he couldn't find his way. The Coast Guard urged would-be mariners to file a float plan before taking long trips. 'A voyage from California to Hawaii is a long and treacherous journey for any vessel and exponentially more dangerous for a kayaker,' Petty Officer 2nd Class Timothy Hall said. 'His preparedness allowed him to call for help, but he is very lucky to be alive.' Only one kayaker has completed the journey solo before - in 1987 - although man people have tried since, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Ed Gillet, from San . Diego, took 63 days to complete the trip, and he arrived with an empty . stomach and bloody hands from paddling. Relatives were . worried that he had been lost at sea. He used the sun to determine where he was along the journey. 'I . knew exactly where I was every minute. My fear was that I was going so . slowly I wouldn’t make it to the islands before I starved,' Gillet, who is now a high school English teacher, said in an interview. Several people . have completed the stretch in a rowboat and a Great Pacific Race . between rowboats is currently underway. The Coast Guard said the kayaker . is not affiliated with the group.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Alaska biologists are once again reminding people not to touch the calves or try to take them home as pets after a string of recent incidents. The state scientists warned that even if the animals seem to have been abandoned by their mothers, people should leave them alone because, in most cases, mothers eventually return to their young. In a recent case, a calf was taken into a home in Wasilla, the Anchorage Daily News reported. 'They just had it in the living room, as if it was a puppy,' state biologist Todd Rinaldi said. Loose moose: A calf is reunited with its mother and sibling at a trailer court in Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska state biologists are now reminding people not to touch moose calves because of the danger . In Willow, another calf was put in a backyard dog run with a collar around its neck and last week, someone tackled a calf at an Anchorage mobile home park and tied it up with an electrical cord. Such encounters can lead to calves being taken to zoos or wildlife conservation centers, wildlife officials said. Taking an animal into captivity is dangerous and illegal, and it can also lead to animals being injured or worse, officials added. In the Anchorage incident, someone called authorities on Friday afternoon to report that a cow moose with two calves was running around a mobile home park. At one point, one of the calves separated from the mother. Reunited: Scientists said even if they seem to have been abandoned, the mothers eventually return . 'Evidently, some man took it upon himself to tackle it and tie it up with an electrical cord,' Anchorage area wildlife biologist Jessy Coltrane said. The calf ran off with the cord hanging from its neck and dragging behind it, Coltrane said. That night, police called Coltrane and told her the calf had been running through the mobile home park again, this time without the extension cord. Police and others corralled the calf next to the mobile home park, Coltrane said. They also found the mother moose. 'It's people with big hearts that are well-meaning. But sometimes being well-meaning and knowing what's best for the animal are two different things,' Coltrane said.","Alaska state officials said even if moose calves appear to have been abandoned, their mothers often return .

"By . Lydia Warren . A woman whose ex-boyfriend is on trial for raping and murdering a student claimed in a video shown to the court that she sat on the victim's face for up to 15 minutes during bondage play - in what has come as a shocking twist in the already sordid case. The chilling video, which was filmed by public defenders days after her then-boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia was arrested, throws doubt on claims made by the prosecutions' key witness Kathryn McDonough, who previously told the court that she had not had any sexual involvement with Lizzi Marriott. Mazzaglia's defense team just needs to convince one juror in the Dover, New Hampshire courtroom that McDonough, 20, is lying to spare him a first-degree murder conviction. In the video, which was filmed on October 17, 2012, McDonough tells public defender Joachim Barth that she sat on 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott's face during bondage sex for '10 to 15 minutes'. Scroll down for video . Twist: Kathryn McDonough can be seen speaking on a 2012 video, claiming she was involved in bondage play with Elizabeth Marriott before she died. Her ex-boyfriend, Seth Mazzaglia, is seen front . At one point in the footage, McDonough, who has portrayed herself as her ex-boyfriend's sex slave, even acts out exactly how she squatted over the young woman. She also discusses her interest in bondage and how she used a rope to restrain the young woman on the floor of Mazzaglia's apartment after luring there on the promise of watching a movie. As jurors stayed riveted to the footage, McDonough's eyes darted nervously from the video to Barth, who has repeatedly accused her of lying in court, the Boston Herald reported. Video: At one point, she shows how she squatted over the girl before her death in October 2012 . After speaking in the video, McDonough later changed her story to say Mazzaglia strangled Marriott with a bondage rope and then raped her limp body as McDonough looked on, horrified. And during . the trial, she has denied having any sexual involvement with Marriott on . the night she died and claimed she initially lied to the public . defender to protect . Mazzaglia. When . quizzed on her inconsistencies between the previous story and her . testimony in court, McDonough insisted the story on video was 'a very . big lie'. Barth asked if she was now telling the truth. She replied saying: 'It’s just me trying to tell the truth as best I can.' The . case relies heavily on McDonough's testimony, meaning that if jurors do . not find her credible, Mazzaglia could walk away from the trial without . serving time. He has pleaded not guilty. McDonough is currently serving three . years in prison for lying to cops and witness tampering. The . two-week trial has been filled with sordid testimony from McDonough, . who said she has brought Marriott, whom she worked with at a mall, to . her boyfriend's home as a sex offering. She claimed he had demanded she . bring someone over as punishment for leaving him alone while she went to . camp. On Wednesday, . Strafford County Superior Court also heard that McDonough witnessed . Mazzaglia strangle Marriot but didn't get help or call the . authorities because she was scared of her boyfriend. On trial: Defense attorney Joachim Barth stands next to defendant Seth Mazzaglia in court on Tuesday. Mazzaglia is accused of raping and murdering the 19-year-old student in his apartment . Loss: Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott was raped . and strangled in October 2012, but her body has never been found . Barth, . who is representing Mazzaglia, told the court: 'Your instincts for . survival did not prompt you to scream out the open window as you stood . in front of it ... Your instincts for survival did not prompt you to try . to get the attention of neighbors directly across the river.' Earlier . in the trial, McDonough denied she was controlled by multiple . personalities after Mr Barth said she had five . voices in her head. He . told the court McDonough was secretly recorded telling a friend that . the night Miss Marriott died one of the personas took control and . McDonough blacked out. But on cross-examination, she disputed that her reference was to the night Marriott died. Questions: Defense attorney Bartha holds up a picture of the crime scene. He quizzed McDonough yesterday about whether she had been lying in her earlier video - and she said she had been . Doubts: McDonough, pictured on the stand on Wednesday, said she had previously lied to protect her then-boyfriend - but the inconsistencies throw doubt on the prosecution's key witness . Miss Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology. She had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts. On . the night she died, Miss Marriot text messaged Miss Atwood minutes . before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a . movie. Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends. The text message was Marriott's last communication. Her . body has never been found and prosecutors believe Mazzaglia and . McDonough put it inside the victim's car then dumped it in a river.","The video filmed by a public defender in October 2012 shows Kathryn McDonough acting out how she sat on Lizzi Marriott the week before .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He might be a freshly minted 93 but the Duke of Edinburgh is showing no signs of slowing down after flying to Fallingbostel in Germany to meet soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland. Once at St Barbara's Barracks, he presented servicemen from The Highlanders, 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, also known as 4 Scots with their Afghanistan campaign medals. Speaking on the parade ground, the Duke, who is the unit’s royal colonel, told more than 400 men and their officers gathered in front of him: . Atten-shun!

'Well, as you know, this is the conclusion of the battalion’s third deployment to Afghanistan, and I believe everyone involved can look back with satisfaction at a job very well done. 'I think we should never forget that it was at the cost of three killed and nine seriously wounded.' He went on to say that everyone also recognised the invaluable contribution made by wives, families and friends, and that he hoped they enjoyed their leave together. The medals presented by Philip recognised those who had served in Afghanistan for the first time. The focal point of today’s parade was the battalion colours, which were presented to the unit in Kinloss by Philip in 2011, immediately after their return from operations in Afghanistan.

He also had an informal lunch in the officers’ mess and also visited the sergeants’ mess. The Duke has been having a busy period of late, with his 93rd birthday coming hot on the heels of the State Opening of Parliament and the state visit to France.

He also helped found the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, which encourages teenagers to participate in charity and community work, as well as getting them out into the countryside. A military man, the Duke had a long and distinguished career as a naval officer, including a stint as First Lieutenant (second-in-command) on the destroyer, Wallace, and took part in the Sicily landings in July 1943.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A New York State Trooper is being called a hero for pulling an elderly man from certain death earlier this month after his car slammed into a gas pump. John Vescio pulled the 69-year-old man from his car after he blacked out while exiting a suburban New York highway and plowed into the pump the off-duty officer was using. Dramatic video shows Vescio first running from what he thought would be a massive explosion before returning and saving the unidentified man’s life just before a massive fireball engulfed both their vehicles. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hero: New York State Trooper John Vescio saved the driver's life . Inferno: this deadly fireball engulfed both vehicles shortly after the horror crash . ‘It happened so quick,’ Vescio told the Journal News. ‘It was hard to think. I pretty much just reacted.’ Vescio, a senior investigator, was at a Hutchinson River Parkway gas station at 11.00 a.m. on June 3 in Westchester County when the man’s car careened off the highway. The footage shows the teal sedan plow into the pump with such force it hits Vescio. He immediately runs to safety, but then springs into action when he realizes the gravity of the situation after realizing the driver could not escape on his own. Moment of impact: Vescio is gassing up his car just as the blacked-out man's sedan slams into the pump . Dangerous: There is an initial explosion that Vescio steps back from . Mad dash: Vescio then sprints from the fire fearing for his life . ‘I got the door open, but you could see that the actual compartment was compressed,’ Vescio said at a Tuesday press conference in Manhattan. ‘You could see the way his legs were tucked under by the seat, his seat belt was on, he was pretty much helpless,’ the heroic cop added. Vescio remarkably runs back to the burning car and risks his own life to save that of a person he had never met before. The selfless trooper struggles at first to get the driver out of the car, but is soon able to drag him to safety before returning to his own care for a first aid kit and his firearm. A fireball engulfs the pump and both cars only seconds after the daring rescue. Instinctual: Vescio's police training then kicks in and he runs back to the burning car to save the man's life .

"By . Bianca London . Andy Murray may have suffered a surprise third-round exit at the Aegon Championships - which he won last year - but his dedicated girlfriend Kim Sears still looked chic supporting her long-term boyfriend courtside. Kim, who we are more accustomed to seeing in feminine floral dresses, shook up her style today with a more boho-inspired outfit. Miss Sears, Murray's girlfriend of eight years, grinned widely as she made her way to her seat to watch the 27-year-old play, wearing on-trend £39.99 Aztec print shorts from Zara and a floaty monochrome top. Courtside chic: Kim Sears, girlfriend of Andy Murray, looked super stylish as she arrived to watch his match against Radek Stepanek in their Men's Singles match on day four of the Aegon Championships at Queens Club - sadly, he lost . She was armed with her new favourite handbag, the £1,395 Ivory Saffiano and Mouse Python by Aspinal of London. Pippa Middleton and Millie Mackintosh are also lucky enough to own the luxurious handbag in black. Kim was seen giggling with Andy's new coach, Amelie Mauresmo, herself a former Wimbledon champion, who was in the front row at Queen's Club, London, a few seats down from Kim. She also wore her favourite £55 Sterling Silver Charm Bracelet from Pandora . charm bracelet, which could well be a good luck charm considering she's . only ever spotted wearing it at Andy's matches. Sadly, it didn't work . its magic today. Mixing high street with high-end: Kim teamed her £39.99 Zara shorts with a £1,395 Marylebone tote from Aspinal of London . Tanned and toned: Kim showcased her tanned legs as she arrived at the Queen's Club looking cheerful . Oh no! She also wore her favourite Pandora charm bracelet, which could well be a god luck charm considering she's only ever spotted wearing it at Andy's matches. Sadly, it didn't work its magic today . The manner of Andy's 7-6 (12-10) 6-2 defeat by Czech Radek Stepanek will not help bolster his confidence ahead of Wimbledon, which kicks off in just ten days. He squandered eight set points in the opening set before tamely surrendering the second. The defeat broke the world number five's 19-match winning streak on grass, a sequence that started in 2012 with his Olympic gold in London. New coach Amelie Mauresmo kept a poker face as the match headed towards a disappointing conclusion but she would have noted the challenge that lies ahead before Murray opens Centre Court proceedings at the All England Club on June 23. Rapport: Kim was seen giggling with Andy's new coach, Amelie Mauresmo, herself a former Wimbledon champion . Chatting away: Kim Sears and new coach Amelie Mauresmo had a quick catch-up prior to the match . Fancy seeing you here! Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, (left) has a laugh with his coach Amelie Mauresmo before his match against Radek Stepanek . Murray's dropshots were off target, often falling short of the net, his backhands kept misfiring and there seemed to be a never-ending stream of forehand errors flying off his racket. If such errors prove costly against a player he had beaten in five of their six previous meetings, Murray's chances of overcoming rivals such as Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer at the grasscourt major look rather perilous. A year after completing a Queen's Club-Wimbledon double, the Scot was strangely off-colour as he allowed Stepanek to steal the opening set with a delightful cross-court volley. Any hopes of a Murray revival fell flat early in the second set when he surrendered the opening game with a forehand error and Stepanek made sure he made the most of his chances. The wily Czech, who at times gave Murray the runaround, sealed an impressive victory when his opponent sliced a backhand into the net on match point, leaving the crowd stunned and the home favourite frustrated. 'When you play the best in the world you have to come up with the best ... they bring the best out of you and it was a great win for me,' Stepanek said courtside after setting up a quarter-final with South African Kevin Anderson.","Kim wore £39.99 Zara shorts with monochrome blouse .

"By . Associated Press . The Buffalo Bills' stadium video system captured a fan sliding down an upper deck railing four times before he fell on the fifth try and landed on another fan in the seating area below, a prosecutor said Thursday as the railing-riding fan went on trial on charges of reckless endangerment and assault. The video from inside Ralph Wilson Stadium will help prove that Robert Hopkins, 29, ignored the risk he could hurt other people during the November 17 game against the New York Jets, Prosecutor G Michael Drmacich told a six-person town court jury. Hopkins could face a year in jail if convicted of the misdemeanor counts. Scroll down for video . Horror: Robert Hopkins, 29, can be seen sliding . down the railing of the third deck of the Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo last November - before losing his balance and tipping backwards, plummeting to . the level below . Plunge: Hopkins is pictured falling backwards, headed to the deck beneath . Defense attorney Patrick Brown called it an accident that legally did not rise to the level of a crime. 'It's going to turn on, was this conduct reckless?' Brown said during his opening statement to jurors. 'There's a technical definition of reckless.' As other fans in the stadium's top tier told him to stop, Hopkins repeatedly slid in a seated position down the rail, climbing over empty 300-level seats to do it again, Drmacich said. The fifth time was 'when it all goes wrong,' he said, describing video, which he said is different than grainy video widely circulated online soon after the fall. 'The defendant loses his balance, his feet go up over the top of him and he flips over backwards. He hangs on. ... Now he's dangling, and he can only hold on for a second and he loses his grip and falls about 25 feet into the crowd below,' he said. Hopkins, 29, is show here being taken away from the stadium after his fall last November. He was later charged with criminal recklessness . Mark Bratcher, the 29-year-old social studies teacher Hopkins landed on, didn't immediately comprehend what had caused the 'crushing pressure' as he watched the game from the 200-level seats, Drmacich said. 'It came out of the blue, literally. It came falling out of the sky,' the prosecutor said. Bratcher will testify about spinal injuries that require regular sessions with a physical therapist and chiropractor, Drmacich said. He has filed a civil lawsuit. The trial is expected to conclude Tuesday.","Robert Hopkins, 29, is on trial for criminal recklessness for the November 17 incident .

"By . Tara Brady . Busted: Leo Sharp was a drug courier and known as 'grandad' to the Sinaloa cartel . He was the 90-year-old Second World War veteran and one of America's foremost experts of day-lily flowers. So how did Leo Sharp become the oldest drug mule in the U.S. after he was caught with 230lb of a Mexican cartel's cocaine? In a feature for the New York Times Sam Donick tells the story of Tata, or grandfather, who has gone down as a Detroit urban legend. Sharp, from Michigan City, Indiana, carried thousands of pounds of cocaine for the Sinaloa cartel over a period of 10 years. Special Agent Jeremy Fitch, one of the DEA agents who worked on the case which eventually caught Sharp, said: 'Leo is the perfect courier for the cartel. 'He has a legitimate ID, he’s an older guy, he wouldn’t be pegged as a drug runner and he has no criminal history.' Florist Sharp attended flower conventions across the country 'dressed in either an all-white leisure suit or an all-black one', Dolnick writes. 'He traveled with an entourage of Mexican farmhands to help with the hundreds of flowers he would give away, making his admirers swoon.' However, he also led another life as one of Sinaloa's most trusted couriers. In 2010 alone, the great-grandfather is thought to have made more than $1million serving as a conduit for what was believed to be the biggest cocaine operation authorities in Detroit had ever seen. He was eventually arrested in October 2011 following a routine traffic stop. When . the trooper asked Sharp if he could search the truck, Sharp refused. So . the officer requested a backup unit with a dog trained to detect bombs . and illegal drugs. As the animal walked around the rear of Sharp's truck, it alerted to the possible presence of narcotics, the complaint said. During . a subsequent search of the truck bed, troopers found 104 bricks of . cocaine stashed in five bags with a wholesale value of $2.9million. The . married father-of-three made a highly amusing appearance at the court . hearing, telling the judge he lost his hearing after a cannon fired . close to him during the 'war'. Scroll Down to Watch Video . Jailed: Leo Sharp is America's oldest drug mule after he was caught with 230lb of a Mexican cartel's cocaine . When he was told he would have to take a drug test, he said: 'I've never used a drug in my life. Ever.' Sharp was charged with conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. One question which hung over the case was whether Sharp was fully aware of what he was doing or whether he was senile. His attorney filed an 18-page . sentencing memo hoping to persuade a judge that home confinement would . be appropriate for the Michigan City, Indiana resident. 'He is a colorful, self-made, charitable man who has worked hard throughout this entire admirable, extraordinary, and long life,' Darryl Goldberg wrote. 'Mr. Sharp made a monumental mistake at a moment of perceived financial . weakness, and was exploited and threatened, but his conduct in this case . was truly an aberration from a law-abiding life.' The government said it had evidence that Sharp was transporting marijuana and cocaine from the West Coast back in 2000. Leo Sharp was found guilty of transporting cocaine across America for a notorious Mexican drug cartel . 'Mr. Sharp is dreadfully sorry,' Goldberg said. In . preparation for the sentencing hearing, Sharp told court officials that . he needed money. Couriers were normally paid $1,000 per kilo so Sharp would have made $104,000 on the trip when he was arrested in 2011. However, Sharp also said he was threatened when he tried to stop . transporting drugs. Joaquin Guzman, also known as El Chapo or Shorty, was arrested in February . He was diagnosed with dementia and other health problems and would be an . expensive burden on the government if sent to prison, Goldberg said. He is a World War II veteran who fought in Italy and was awarded the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor, for his service, Goldberg said. Despite never divulging his relationship with the cartel or how he managed to evade detection he did help investigators. A note found in his car led police to Viejo, Sharp's handler. Four months after Sharpe's arrest, police raided 10 locations making 19 charges. All but two have since pleaded guilty. The street price of cocaine per kilogram has also increased from about $30,000 to $43,000. Despite facing 20 years in prison, prosecutors recommended he serve five because of his ageSharpe's lawyer also described him as a Second World War veteran who deserved mercy saying: 'That's not how we honour our heroes.' Sharp was eventually sentenced to three years in federal prison. Chapo Guzman, the head of the entire Sinaloa cartel, was one of the most wanted fugitives in the world. He was arrested in February in an unrelated investigation. Despite his arrest and the sentencing of other members of the Sinaloa, experts believe the cartel will continue.","Leo Sharp from Michigan City, Indiana, turned 90 last month .

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . To hell with moral victories, heroic near-misses and statistical consolations. England confront the All Blacks again with twin targets — victory and history. That is all. Nothing else will do. A week on from an agonising Auckland demise, England find themselves at a seminal moment in their crusade to re-emerge as a global force. Their time has come. They are no longer hampered by fixture congestion, or the absence of several injured men. They are no longer afflicted by the age-old English curse of being beaten before they start in these parts. The crunch: Marland Yarde and Kieran . Brookes collide in training ahead of the Auckland Test . The box kick . Stuart Lancaster is ready to unleash a line-up as potent as any under his regime and his side are utterly bereft of fear in the face of the world champions. There were no excuses last Saturday following the 20-15 defeat at Eden Park, but the backdrop of disruption meant that a defeat was widely acclaimed as a triumph of sorts. Asked if another heroic defeat would suffice, flanker Tom Wood said: ‘No. While we were proud of the effort and performance last week, we will never accept losing, regardless of the opposition. We go into every game intending and fully expecting to win.’ Considering the doomsday scenario of another shattering loss, he added: ‘It will be difficult and the pressure will begin to mount. We certainly didn’t come here to lose any games, never mind two on the bounce and be staring down the barrel of three losses. It certainly focuses the mind. We’ll concentrate on levelling the score.’ England know that what matters in this crucial second Test is finishing ahead on the scoreboard, whatever it takes. The big push: England will be desperate to level the series against New Zealand . The cross-field kick . There is a bigger picture, the need to build a game-plan capable of delivering World Cup glory, but the priority for now is managing to claim rugby’s most prized scalp in hostile territory. Success would be a giant stride forward. Five times England have played the All Blacks on New Zealand’s South Island and five times they have lost — in 1963, 1985, 1998, 2004 and 2008. Twice this city has staged this fixture and the visitors have conceded a century of points, scoring a paltry 25 in response. England have a 100 per cent record at the Forsyth Barr Stadium, but their opponents there — at the last World Cup — were Argentina, Georgia and Romania. English ambition has too often amounted to merely seeking respectability in the face of Kiwi supremacy, but that inferiority complex has been shattered. Lancaster’s side do not bend the knee at the first sign of those fabled shirts. Three times they have played these opponents since Lancaster took over in 2012 and the current aggregate score is 75-71 in England’s favour. In the aftermath of the opening skirmish in Auckland, there has been ample focus on various areas of English dominance:scrum and line-out, territory, possession — the old staples — along with line-breaks, metres made, defenders beaten and so on. In a nutshell, they played well but lost. It can’t happen again if their advance is to continue apace. The All Blacks are coming into this Test with contrasting priorities. They had the result last weekend, but fell a long way below the standards they have come to expect in winning all but one Test since claiming the home World Cup in 2011. Heartbreak: Conrad Smith scores the deciding try as unfancied England fell to gallant defeat in Auckland . The counter attack . Steve Hansen, the hosts’ head coach, anticipates a reaction from his players. ‘We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact we did win the Test, but at the same time we weren’t proud of our performance,’ he said. ‘This sets up brilliantly the second instalment of what could be a rivalry that endures all the way to next year’s World Cup final.’ England must hope their contingent of Premiership finalists swiftly reintegrate to guard against the threat of a damaging loss of cohesion. Theoretically, they will be improved by Danny Care’s spark at scrum-half and the combative authority of Owen Farrell at No 10, while the glass-half-full vision involves Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell creating a platform to unleash the redeployed Manu Tuilagi out wide or on in-field forays. Up front, Chris Robshaw, Wood and Co will need to make a collective effort to smash Richie McCaw out of his poaching routine at the rucks. If they do so, Ben Morgan blasts forward with the same ball-carrying clout he did last week and the Geoff Parling-Rob Webber axis delivers another line-out masterclass, England will have a chance. More so if their defensive line-speed hurries the Kiwis into another torrent of errors. Gutted: Jonny May and Yarde look dejected following a defeat that was hard to swallow . It may come down to the impact of the replacements, which is when Lancaster will relish being able to send on the likes of Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes and Billy Vunipola. Having such pedigree and firepower to add second-half impetus could swing the contest England’s way. The majority of those in attendance under the stadium roof will expect the perfect conditions and the jolt to the system delivered seven days earlier to ensure a night of Black magic and the resumption of normal service. But maybe, just maybe, they will be condemned to watching Lancaster’s rising side seize their victory and history.","England are at a seminal moment in their crusade to re-emerge as a global force after last week's stinging 20-15 defeat to New Zealand .

"By . Mia De Graaf . This is the moment an 80-year-old widower was ambushed and dragged through his own home by masked men who stole his late wife's wedding ring. Eamonn Durcan was going to close his front gate when the thugs jumped out of a car, pushed him to the ground and hauled him into the house. The pensioner tried to fight back by kneeing one attacker in the groin - but the two men proved too strong. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attack: Two masked men set upon Eamonn Durcan, 80, and pushed him to the ground as he closed his gate . Brutal: Here, one of the attackers can be seen grabbing Mr Durcan from behind to drag him inside the house . Threatened: During the 10-minute ordeal, Mr Durcan was threatened with a knife as they stole his wife's rings . Once inside, he was pinned down by one raider who held a knife to his cheek, threatening him for 10 minutes. The robbers took cash, a Panasonic television set, a Dell laptop, two mobile phones, a tablet computer and two watches. But . they also stole wedding and engagement rings, which belonged to his dead wife Daphne, as well as an eternity . ring and a traditional Irish Claddagh ring with a shamrock on it. Mr Durcan, a grandfather of two, said: 'They were vicious thugs but I wasn’t about to be scared. 'Every chance I got, I lashed out. I hit one of them with an empty beer bottle. 'People . have asked me why I tried to fight and told me I could have been hurt. But what did they expect me to do, hold them by the hand and let them . help themselves? 'They didn’t hurt me physically, but they’ve hurt me mentally because they took things that were precious to me.' Before: Mr Durcan, a retired HGV driver, had been walking out to close his front gate shortly before 10pm after a woman knocked on his front door in Leeds, West Yorkshire, asking to use his phone . Accosted: A man appeared and started trying to break in, while Mr Durcan can be seen protesting . Gang: A second man then emerged as grandfather-of-two Mr Durcan tried to hold the front gate closed . The attackers set upon Mr Durcan, a retired HGV driver, after a woman - apparently dressed for a night out - came to his door asking to use his phone. He refused and the woman, who is thought to have been an accomplice to the robbers, left. Moments later, Mr Durcan went outside to close his gate - and the men advanced. He said: 'There was a car parked on the pavement. Suddenly the driver got out and he had a mask on and he jumped me. 'I was thinking, is someone having a laugh? But then the guy got out of the passenger seat and came for me. I realised this was the real thing. 'It was horrible. I kneed one of them in the groin, but I knew I was going to go down.' Mr Durcan was pushed over and dragged into his house. Forceful: Pulling open the gate, one attacker launches into Mr Durcan, running towards the house . Defenceless: Mr Durcan said despite trying to protect his home, he knew they would overpower him . 'They kept saying: ‘Where’s the money? Where’s the safe?"",' he said. 'I was telling them I didn’t have any but they wouldn’t believe me.' Mr Durcan, who believes he was deliberately targeted, was taken to hospital as a precaution but was not seriously injured. 'I’m extremely angry about what happened and I want them caught,' he said. Detective Constable Chris Lord, of Leeds District CID, said: 'It is appalling that people would deliberately target a vulnerable old man in this way and I would urge anyone who knows the identity of those involved to contact us immediately.' Angry: The retired HGV driver said he is infuriated by the attack and will do everything to catch the thugs . The woman was white, about 30, and about 5ft 4in. She had shoulder-length, wavy ginger or blonde hair and was wearing high heels and a light-coloured dress. Both men had handkerchiefs covering their faces and were wearing baseball caps turned backwards. One was white, about 5ft 6in and was wearing jeans. The other was about 6ft and slim. The incident happened about 9.50pm on Thursday, April 17.

"By . Emily Crane . Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australian mining magnate, Gina, discovered her close friend and minder Jerry Rouwhorst, 35, unconscious and naked on the floor of his suite at the five star Dorchester hotel on March 16 . The Australian bodyguard for mining magnate Gina Rinehart's daughter hanged himself in a suite at an exclusive London  hotel after fearing he had 'let her down' by getting drunk in front of her friends, a London coroner's court has been told. Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia's richest woman, discovered her close friend and minder Jeremiah 'Jerry' Rouwhorst, 35, unconscious and naked on the floor of his suite at the five star Dorchester hotel on March 16. Hours earlier the 'ashamed' ex-special forces soldier had sent the 27-year-old a text message saying he was going to resign because he felt he had 'disgraced' her in front of her friends by getting drunk the night before. The pair had spent three months at the Dorchester and Mr Rouwhorst had organised a farewell party for Ms Rinehart before she returned to Australia. But the normally 'professional' Mr Rouwhorst had consumed an 'uncharacteristic' amount of alcohol, Westminster Coroner's Court heard on Thursday. 'At 10.27 he sent her a text message saying they he felt he had disgraced her, let her down, embarrassed her in front of her friends and he was tendering his resignation,' Assistant Coroner Shirley Radcliffe said. 'It is possible he sent the text message as a possible cry for help and was hoping to be found. I cannot be sure he wanted to kill himself. 'One thinks that this may have been an impulsive gesture whilst under the influence of alcohol. He was devastated at having lost an element of his professionalism the night before.' Ginia, pictured here with her mother Gina Rinehart (right), had received a text message from her bodyguard saying he was going to resign because he felt he had 'disgraced' her in front of her friends by getting drunk the night before . The court heard that after the party that had been organised by Mr Rouwhorst, Ms Rinehart went on to spend the rest of the night with friends in Chelsea before calling her bodyguard at 8am on March 16 to pick her up. She went straight to bed and did not read the text until around midday when she rushed to see him in the adjoining room. Police officers and paramedics were called to the hotel in London's Park Lane - a favourite with celebrities and where rooms can cost up to $7,000 a night. Hotel security arrived at the room to find Ms Rinehart 'hysterical' and pointing to where her confidante lay, the court heard. Constable Aaron King, who attended the scene and spoke to the 27-year-old, said she was very upset. 'She was very distressed and crying on the phone to her mother,' he said. 'She said that because he didn't usually drink that much he was ashamed of how much he had had to drink the night before and he thought that he must have brought shame on her and her friends.' Mr King explained that he also spoke to Ms Rineharts's mother, Gina, on the phone. 'The mother explained that he is a very professional man and would never drink that much - it was out of character,' he said. Ms Rinehart and Mr Rouwhorst has spent three months at London's exclusive Dorchester hotel . Dr Radcliffe asked if the heiress had given any possible reason why Mr Rouwhorst drank so much. The officer replied that he didn't really have an opportunity to speak to her in detail, adding: 'She was obviously very distressed and at one point she even collapsed in the hotel corridor.' Paramedics at the scene were able to revive Mr Rouwhorst and he was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died three days later. Blood tests at the hospital revealed that he was more than one and half times over the legal drink driving limit. 'This may have been suicide, I cannot be sure. It may have been an accident, I cannot be sure,' Dr Radcliffe said, recording an open verdict. Police officers and paramedics were called to the hotel in London's Park Lane - a favourite with celebrities and where rooms can cost up to $7,000 a night . She recorded the cause of death as ligature compression and noted that he died on March 19, 2014, having been admitted to hospital on March 16. Just two days before hanging himself Mr Rouwhorst had received a commendation for bravery, having been honoured for saving a man's life during a riot in East Timor in 2007. After leaving the Australian Special Air Services in 2005, he went on to work as a private security guard for the Australian ambassador in Afghanistan and Iraq, before providing personal security to the Rinehart family, and in particular, Ginia Rinehart.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tragic: Gertrude Donaldson, 92, died after being struck by a reversing van as she navigated her way across a car park filled with potholes and 'unclear' road markings . The owners of a car park where a great grandmother was killed by a reversing van as she tried to avoid a pothole have been fined £145,000. Gertrude Donaldson, a retired nurse who served in India during the Second World War, was walking around numerous potholes and 'unclear' road markings when she was hit by the vehicle. Following an investigation, it emerged the car park firm in Kendal, Cumbria, had been warned a year earlier but failed to carry out repairs. And today the company, Jaymar Estates, was found guilty of breaching health and safety guidelines. 'There was a clear and obvious danger,' said Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting. 'The death of Mrs Donaldson was the result of the failures identified.' Mrs Donaldson, of Kendal, had been walking back from the doctors' surgery on October 28, 2009, when she was struck by the van. Carlisle Crown Court heard she had been attempting to cross Station Road car park but was waylaid by fencing, potholes and road markings. The incident came a year after Jaymar Estates was advised by a contractor to lay tarmac over the holes and repaint the markings. 'It was greatly foreseeable,' said Judge . Peter Hughes QC. 'This was an important car park in a busy town centre, . close to Kendal railway station. The state of the car park had been a . cause for concern for over a year.' Accident: Mrs Donaldson was killed in 2009 by a white van, pictured left. The potholes and road damage can be seen in this picture . Police line: Officers can be seen above at the time of the accident inspecting the site . Action against Manchester-based Jaymar Estates was brought by South Lakeland District Council. Company directors and brothers, Mordecai and Jacob Halpern, and Howard Frankel, director of another of Jaymar’s sister companies, had previously denied any responsibility for the accident. However, in court on Monday, they . pleaded guilty on behalf of the company to a charge of exposing people . to health and safety risks. They were fined £95,000, with £50,000 costs. The court was told that spaces on the car park were leased out by Jaymar Estates to other organisations, including the GP surgery, the Royal British Legion, and the Riverside Hotel. Fined: Jacob and Mordecia Halpern, Jaymar Estates directors, were warned a year earlier to fix the car park . Keith Morten QC, in mitigation for . Jaymar, said in the months before the accident, the Riverside Hotel had . installed fencing around what it perceived to be its own spaces, causing . further difficulties on the site. These were not removed until several months after Mrs Donaldson’s death. Tribute: Mrs Donaldson's family paid tribute to 'Babs' who served as a nurse in India in World War Two . However, Jaymar employed a marshall to patrol the site and this later prevented a ‘near-miss’. The necessary remedial work was carried out in 2010. 'These are men of deeply-held religious conviction,' added Mr Morten. 'In the Jewish faith, family is of utmost importance. They understand full well the heartbreak caused by the loss of a loved one.' After the hearing, Mrs Donaldson’s family said they were ‘happy’ with the message the fine sent out. 'Prior to mum’s death issues about safety in the car park had already been raised with Jaymar. 'On the day of her death, she chose to walk to the surgery because it was a nice day, a reasonable distance for her to walk, which shows how well she was. 'She was the head of a large family and to have her snatched away from us like that was a real shock that will live with us forever. 'We are just grateful now that we have this conclusion and hope this will serve as a reminder to companies about their responsibilities for the health and safety of the public.' Mrs Donaldson, known to friends and family as Babs, had eight children, 15 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.","Gertrude Donaldson, 92, was walking around potholes when she was hit .

"By . Sam Webb . When Lin Boutcher put her three-bed country home up for sale in 2004, she expected no trouble at all finding a buyer. She thought someone, perhaps a retired couple looking for some solitude, or a young family looking to escape the rat race, would soon meet the £175,000 asking price for the well-kept and charming rural retreat in the sleepy Welsh village of Gwytherin. But after 10 years on the market, Mrs Boutcher and her husband Keith, 41, are still in the home - and believe potential buyers are put off because it . is so rural that it has no mobile signal and very slow broadband speed. Idyll: But the three-bed country home in a sleepy Welsh village has had hardly any interest in the decade it's been for sale . The owners believe buyers are put off by the lack of infrastructure in the countryside - it is five miles from the nearest town . The couple, who have a nine-year-old son called Louis, believe their home, located on the edge of the Snowdonia National Park in North Wales, must hold the British record for a house that has been on the market for the longest time. They have had the old village post office repainted and decorated and it has parking and a back garden - but it also overlooks a graveyard which could also be putting people off. The mother-of-one is desperate to move closer to her relatives - more than 250 miles away in the South East of England. And she admits she might have to slash the asking price again in a bid to finally sell the house -  - which at times has been priced as low as £163,000. In 2004 the house went on the market for £175,000, falling to £163,000 in around 2007. By 2011 as the housing market recovered the price was back up to £167,500 and is now on sale for £175,000 again. A property expert said it is unheard of for a house to be on the market for a decade . The owners refitted the bathroom and kitchen, installed double glazing and enhanced the central heating in a bid to sell . Still on the market: The asking price for the Boutcher's Welsh home . Lin, a marketing executive, said: 'The property has barely generated a flicker of interest since it first went on the market. 'We believe it is a perfect country getaway. But rather than helping to generate interest, the property’s rural location is putting people off.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Student Sarah Jane Burke, 17, was on her way home from college when David Baillie ploughed into her as she crossed the road, a court heard . A teenage girl was killed by a road rage driver who was 'acting as if he owned the road' as he carried out an aggressive overtaking manoeuvre in a 30mph street, a court heard. Student Sarah Jane Burke, 17, was on her way home from college when David Baillie ploughed into her as she crossed the residential street, it was said. Newcastle Crown Court heard from witnesses who said Baillie was involved in a road rage incident at the time of the collision with the driver of a Vauxhall Corsa. The car was in front of his Volvo S60 as they travelled along a 30mph road in Sunderland, the court heard. Witnesses said Baillie, who had a young child and a woman in the car, swerved and accelerated to get past the Corsa as talented art student Sarah was crossing the road. Baillie, who afterwards described the teenager as 'like a rabbit in the headlights', crashed into her, throwing her into the air and she landed on her head 20 metres away. The teenager suffered multiple injuries and died five days later in hospital from her injuries. Baillie, who admits causing death by . careless driving, is on trial accused of causing Sarah’s death by . dangerous driving, which he denies. Witnesses claim Baillie had been . 'tailgating' the other vehicle from Barnes Park Road and had hit Sarah as he tried desperately to get in front. Prosecutors say as he overtook the other car, Baillie was focusing on the other driver alongside him, rather than the road ahead. Prosecutor Nick Dry told jurors: 'His driving was fuelled by rage and failing to get ahead of the Corsa and thereafter he was consumed by a determination to overtake at all costs. 'This culminated in a collision which cost a 17-year-old girl her life.' Sarah, described in court as a 'talented teenager', had been on her way home from college on September 17 last year. She lived with her parents and sister, in Sunderland, and was crossing the city’s Ormonde Street around 5.30pm when she was hit. Trial: David Baillie pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court. The court heard from witnesses who said Baillie was involved in a road rage incident at the time of the collision with the driver of a Vauxhall Corsa . Witnesses said Baillie, who had a young child and a woman in the car, swerved and accelerated to get past the Corsa as talented art student Sarah was crossing the road. She was flung 20 metres and landed on her head . Mr Dry said Baillie had been seen driving dangerously before the impact as he became enraged by Corsa driver Paul Potter. Mr Dry said: 'The defendant was seen by a number of witnesses to be driving dangerously in the minutes before the fatal impact with Sarah. 'Seemingly enraged by the vehicle travelling ahead of him, he was accelerating and braking heavily as he looked to overtake.' Mr Potter, who was taking his 12-year-old daughter to her grandmother’s, said Baillie pulled up alongside him at traffic lights, where one lane filters into two. Mr Potter, a bus driver, pulled away but said Baillie kept accelerating very close behind him and another witness estimated he was within a foot at times. Mr Dry said: 'Another witness put it down to road rage and noticed the defendant appeared to be very agitated. 'Throughout the episode he noticed the Corsa was driving in a steady, normal manner.' As they travelled along Ormonde Street, Baillie overtook near a zebra crossing, it was said. Mr . Dry told the court: 'She reached the middle of the road when Mr Potter . looked in his mirror to see the defendant pulling out to overtake him, . accelerating hard to get by. 'There was a violent swerve causing the suspension to dip and the car looked out of control.”' The teenager, who lived with her parents and sister, in Sunderland, was crossing the city's Ormonde Street around 5.30pm when she was hit . Mr Potter braked to let Baillie past but it was too late to prevent him hitting Sarah. Jurors were shown footage which was picked up by a passing bus and showed Sarah making her way home along Ormonde Street. A . second set of footage, picked up by a camera on another bus, showed the . aftermath of the tragedy while Sarah was lying on the road injured . after she tried to cross it.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Fear: Sharna, 15, now faces bringing up her baby, due in August, alone after her boyfriend Grant Adams died in a freak sunbed accident on Sunday . A pregnant 15-year-old has told of her fear as she faces bringing up a child alone after the father of her baby died in a freak sunbed accident. Sharna Gardner was left devastated when her boyfriend Grant Adams, 17, tripped and landed on the free-standing sunbed, piercing his jugular vein on the smashed tubes. The teenager had just got out of bed when he stumbled over a wire and onto the glass booth before falling down the stairs. Despite rushing to hospital from his home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, he died hours later. Now, Sharna, who is seven months pregnant, faces bringing up their little girl on her own. The schoolgirl, of South Shields, said: 'It’s heartbreaking to think my daughter will never get to see her dad through one accident. 'She will never get the chance to meet him even though I know he will be looking over her.' Sharna, a pupil at South Shields Community School, had just left Grant’s house before the accident happened on Sunday morning. Minutes later, paramedics from the Great North Air Ambulance Service arrived at the family home at around 9am. Grant, who had just qualified as a bricklayer, was given treatment to stem the flow of blood and he was flown to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment. But medics told his family there was nothing more that could be done and he died on Monday afternoon. Sharna said: 'I had just left him before he fell over. 'I found out when the police knocked at my door and woke me up. 'They told me he had had an accident. He had just bought his car and I thought he must have had an accident in that. 'They said he had fallen down the stairs. I didn’t think it was serious and when I found out how bad it was I still had hopes for him. 'When I found out he was brain damaged I broke my heart but I still had hopes. 'Then I found out he was dead. I would never have expected that to happen. I would never have expected Grant to have died.' The couple had been looking forward to the birth of their little girl in August and Grant had chosen the name Rhkiya Mae. 'It hasn’t hit me,' said Sharna. 'I don’t want to believe he’s gone. 'The last two months with Grant have been the best we’ve had. It’s so sad that it has come to an end. I just wish I hadn’t left him on the Sunday morning. 'I’d slept there on the Saturday night and left early on the Sunday morning. I rang him at eight and he was fine.' Tragic: Grant Adams, 17, here with Sharna, tripped on a wire and landed on the booth, cutting his throat . Devastated: Sharna had stayed over at Grant's house on Saturday night and left minutes before he fell . Grant had just bought his first car and was taking driving lessons. He was also due to celebrate his 18th birthday this month. Sharna added: 'He was the kindest boy ever. He would have done anything for anybody. 'I’m just in shock. I don’t want to accept it really. 'I’m just waiting for a text. I used to cry if he didn’t reply in an hour. It’s horrible knowing he’s never going to reply again. 'I’m just lucky to have part of him inside me.' It is believed Grant ripped the tube from the canopy sunbed, which was being stored in his third-floor bedroom for his mother Amanda Smedley, from his neck while in shock. The baby: The couple had decided to name the little girl, due in August, Rhkiya Mae, Sharna revealed . Ms Smedley, 37, said she found her son in a pool of blood following the accident. The mother-of-two said: 'I just heard a couple of thuds from his room. I shouted to him and I ran upstairs. He was just there in a pool of blood. 'He was at the bottom of the stairs, he’d fell down them. He must have tried to come and get help.' Grant was fit and healthy and was a keen boxer. His organs will now be donated to give other patients a chance of life. His older sister Natasha Smedley, 20, who has one-year-old daughter, Amelia, said: 'It would have been what Grant would have wanted,' said Natasha. 'There are people waiting for transplants and hopefully Grant’s organs will help someone else. 'We don’t want any other family to have to go through what we’ve gone through.'","Sharna Gardner, 15, left Grant Adams' house moments before he fell .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Bosses from Big Brother are facing criticism during the first week of the show, amid allegations of blasphemy, bullying, racism and swearing. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom said it had already received 209 complaints about the series in its first seven days. Most of the complaints followed the explosive row earlier this week between Helen Wood, the former prostitute who had a threesome with footballer Wayne Rooney, and lingerie model Danielle McMahon. Scroll down for video . An expletive-laden argument between Helen Wood and Danielle McMohan, . pictured above, in which Helen was accused of being blasphemous, led to . 102 complaints from viewers to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom . The expletive-laden argument - which . attracted 166 complaints - saw Helen, 27, criticise 25-year-old . Danielle, from Glasgow, for her Catholic views by making comments about . Jesus. Helen first came to the nation’s attention in August 2010 after being involved in a threesome with England footballer Wayne Rooney and her friend Jenny Thompson. The incident was said to have taken place at the Lowry Hotel in Salford in June 2009 - when his wife Coleen was pregnant with the couple's eldest son Kai. The news rocked the football star’s marriage, but the pair were able to move forward from the scandal. During the first week of Big Brother 9, which screened in 2008, Ofcom said it had received 505 complaints from viewers. Most . of the complaints - 361 - related to an alleged 'bullying' incident . when four of the contestants had a heated argument about oven chips. The . row started when Alexandra De Gale allegedly abused Rebecca Shiner a . nurse from Coventry, for burning the group's chip supper. The most . complained about event came in the 2008 Celebrity Big Brother, . in which Ofcom received 44,500 complaints about the race row between . Shilpa Shetty and Jade Goody. Last year, the June Big Brother series received a total of 965 complaints. An Ofcom spokesman said 321 of those were made during the first week of the series. In . that series, viewers were outraged by housemate Jemima Slade getting an . ‘unjustified' official warning for saying black men are not her type. Ofcom received 305 complaints in June that Slade, 41, had been 'unfairly . accused of racism'. In the . series before that, in 2012, 2,088 complaints were received as the show . became embroiled in another race and bullying row. Conor . McIntyre, an Irish fitness trainer, launched a foul-mouthed tirade at . Deana Uppal, Miss India UK, after she became the only person in the . house to fail an eating task, which prompted 1,108 complaints. Now the salon owner is creating waves again, this time among Big Brother viewers for her behaviour. The nature . of the argument, which was watched by 1.3million viewers, already forced . Channel 5 to pull the daytime repeat from the schedules - for the first . time in the show's history. The . furious argument, which was aired on Tuesday, involved Helen telling . Danielle - who says she lives by strong Catholic principles - to ‘stop . s******g Jesus’. Now Ofcom is assessing the complaints and deciding whether or not to open a formal investigation into the comments made. After . the row was shown, viewers accused Helen, 27, of blasphemy, with . several Twitter users calling for her to receive an official warning . from the show over her comments. After the . argument was aired, @laurxx123 tweeted: 'Oh my god if Helen Wood gets . left on the big brother house after calling Danielle a fat b**** and . bullying Chris I give up'. Another . user, ‏@JimmyPara1 said: 'If #bigbrother don't take action against what . Helen said about Jesus, that would be a major error on their part'. @xTigz tweeted: 'Helen on big brother is actually such a massive bully, why have they not removed her? Vile human #bbuk'. And @julianhilaire tweeted: 'What Helen,said about Jesus was quite offensive she should apologise to Danielle and Catholics in general #BBBits'. There has also been concern raised about Danielle making allegedly homophobic comments. When talking about same-sex marriage, she told fellow housemates: 'The Catholic church don't believe in it and I go by what the Pope says.' Helen's comments have angered viewers, who have expressed concern about some of the content in the first week of the series . Many have called for Helen, the former lover of Wayne Rooney, to be given a formal warning from show producers over her comments . There has also been concern about the . racy content of the show, while other viewers have accused some . contestants of ‘bullying’ fellow housemate Jale Karaturp. It's not the first time Big Brother has landed in hot water over some of its controversial content. The most . complained about event after the notorious race row between . Shilpa Shetty and Jade Goody, which was filmed as part of the 2008 series. The comments were made during a row which was aired on Tuesday, less than one week after the 15th series of the show began . In total, there have been 209 official complaints about this year's series to Ofcom, while many have taken to Twitter to share their concerns . During the first week of Big Brother 9, which also screened in 2008, Ofcom said it had received 505 complaints from viewers. The Ofcom spokesman added that the remaining 43 of the 209 complaints made so far this year had been surrounding other issues in the programme. A . spokesman for Channel 5 declined to comment on the complaints. A . spokesman for Endemol, the show's producers, has yet to respond to a . request for a comment.

"By . Lucy Crossley . The bodyguard of a billionaire Australian heiress was found hanged at an exclusive London hotel after he feared he had 'let her down' by getting drunk in front of her friends, an inquest heard. Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia’s richest woman Gina Rinehart, discovered her close friend and minder Jeremiah 'Jerry' Rouwhorst, 35, unconscious and naked on the floor of his suite at the world-famous Dorchester Hotel. Hours earlier the 'ashamed' Australian ex-special forces soldier had sent the 27-year-old a text message saying he was going to resign because he felt he had 'disgraced' her in front of her friends by getting drunk the night before. Heiress: Ginia Rinehart (pictured right) discovered her minder Jeremiah 'Jerry' Rouwhorst, 35, unconscious and naked on the floor of his suite at the world-famous Dorchester Hotel (left) The pair had spent three months at the Dorchester and Mr Rouwhorst had organised a farewell party for his client, the heiress to an £11billion fortune, before she returned to Australia. But normally 'professional' Mr Rouwhorst had consumed an 'uncharacteristic' amount of alcohol, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard. Assistant Coroner Shirley Radcliffe said: 'At 10.27 he sent her a text message saying they he felt he had disgraced her, let her down, embarrassed her in front of her friends and he was tendering his resignation. 'It is possible he sent the text message as a possible cry for help and was hoping to be found. I cannot be sure he wanted to kill himself. 'One . thinks that this may have been an impulsive gesture whilst under the . influence of alcohol. He was devastated at having lost an element of his . professionalism the night before.' The . court heard that after the party organised by Mr Rouwhorst, Ms Rinehart . went on to spend the rest of the night with friends in Chelsea, before . calling her bodyguard at 8am on March 16 to pick her up. She then went straight to bed and did not read the text until around midday when she rushed to see him in the adjoining room. Scene: Miss Rinehart and her minder Mr Rouwhorst had been staying at the famous Dorchester Hotel in central London for three months before his death . Emergency: Police officers and paramedics were called to the five-star hotel in London¿s Park Lane - a favourite with celebrities where rooms can cost up to £4,000 a night . Police . officers and paramedics were called to the five-star hotel in London’s . Park Lane - a favourite with celebrities where rooms can cost up to . £4,000 a night. Hotel security arrived at the room to find Ms Rinehart 'hysterical' and pointing to where her confidante lay, the court heard. Police officer Aaron King, who attended the scene and spoke to the 27-year-old who will inherit the billions amassed by her mining magnate family, said she was very upset. 'She was very distressed and crying on the phone to her mother,' he said. 'She said that because he didn’t usually drink that much he was ashamed of how much he had had to drink the night before and he thought that he must have brought shame on her and her friends.' PC King explained that he also spoke to Ms Rineharts’s mother, Gina, on the phone. 'The mother explained that he is a very professional man and would never drink that much - it was out of character,' he said. Family: Ginia Rinehart (right) is the daughter of Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart (left), and heir to family's £11billion mining fortune . Professional: A police officer told the inquest that he had spoken to Gina Rinehart on the telephone, and was told that Mr Rouwhorst 'would never drink that much' Dr Radcliffe asked if the heiress had given any possible reason for the Australian ex-elite forces soldier having drank so much. The officer replied that he didn’t really have an opportunity to speak to her in detail, adding: 'She was obviously very distressed and at one point she even collapsed in the hotel corridor.' Paramedics at the scene were able to revive Mr Rouwhorst and he was taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died three days later on March 19. Blood tests at he hospital revealed that he was more than one and half times over the legal drink driving limit at 113mg/100ml. Just two . days before his death, Mr Rouwhorst had received a commendation for . bravery, having been honoured for saving a man’s life during a riot in . East Timor in 2007. After leaving the Australian Special . Air Services in 2005, he went on to work as a private security guard for . the Australian ambassador in Afghanistan and Iraq, before providing . personal security to the Rinehart family, and in particular, Ginia . Rinehart. Recording an open verdict, Dr Radcliffe said: 'This may have been suicide, I cannot be sure. It may have been an accident, I cannot be sure.'","Ginia Rinehart found Jeremiah Rouwhorst at the Dorchester Hotel .

"By . Tara Brady . A teenager has become the only apprentice wheelwright in Britain working at one of only two firms appointed to take care of the Queen’s historic royal carriages. George Richards, 17, has been learning his trade at Mike Rowland Wheelwrights and Coachbuilders since September. As part of his three-year training scheme at the smoke and steam-filled workshop in Colyton, Devon, he has now produced an unusual wooden bicycle for a special visit from the Master of the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights. Skills: George Richards (left) has become an apprentice wheelwright at one of only two firms appointed to take care of the Queen's historic royal carriages. He has been learning the trade at Mike Rowland Wheelwrights . The youngster, who also studies joinery at Exeter College, has impressed the old hands at the business - which was formed in 1964 but can be traced back through the family as far as 1360. Greg Rowland, 44, who has now taken over the business from his 77-year-old father Mike said George’s ability was clear as a work experience boy aged 15. 'He seemed to have a little bit more about him than the typical kid who plays computer games so I tossed him an 11-inch piece of elm for a wagon wheel hub and he nailed first time on the lathe,' said Mr Rowland. 'The next thing I had Exeter College wanting me to complete a pre-apprentice report - it seems he had told them he already had a place. Working for Royalty: George Richards aged 17 has a unique job - he is the only wheelwright apprentice in the country working for the Queen . 'I like that attitude. If you want something go for it. We needed somebody and he timed it just right. 'I like his enthusiasm, the way he did it all himself, not getting his mum to do it but just sorted it out.' A wheelwright is a person who builds or repairs wooden wheels and wheeled vehicles. The occupational name eventually became the surname Wheelwright. The firm, which is allowed to display the royal coat of arms along with the sought-after credit 'by appointment to Her Majesty the Queen' is thriving as it marks its 50th anniversary this year with enough work to last 18 months on the books. George Richards built this bike for a special visit from the Master of the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights . George Richards has impressed Mike Rowland Wheelwrights and Coachbuilders where he is doing an apprentice. The firm can be traced back through the family as far as 1360 . It specialises in military equipment often for museums such as the giant cannon wheels which weigh one third of a tonne and stand five-and-a-half feet tall on their wooden rims. Greg is not allowed to talk in detail about the royal work but says a job for the Queen has to take preference despite the long order book. A job involving a working vehicle, such as a wedding carriage, would also jump the queue. The company where George is carrying out his apprenticeship is one of two firms in the country that makes carriages for the Queen like the one pictured . George’s family have lived in the small Colyton community for generations - his grandfather was an undertaker and carpenter. Aside from his joinery apprenticeship at Exeter he is also working towards becoming a wheelwright thanks to a separate scheme by the Livery Companies Apprentice Scheme which pays his wages. This will give him a City and Guilds and then see him being confirmed as a journeyman wheelwright at a ceremony in the City of London. Mr Rowland said: 'He is doing really well - he designed and made the bike completely by himself.'","George Richards, 17, has been learning his trade since September .

"By . Wills Robinson . A barber has been charged after allegedly slashing a man's neck with a cut-throat razor in his city centre shop. Lloyd Dobrodumow, 44, appeared at North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court after the suspected attack on Robert Charles Smith, 31, at Jack’s barber in Newcastle, which was allegedly sparked by a row over a discarded beer can. The father-of-three, whose tongue-in-cheek Twitter name is Demon Barber, appeared at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court charged wounding with intent to cause grevious bodily harm. Allegations: Lloyd Dobrodumow, 44, (pictured right leaving North Tyneside Crown Court today) has been charged after allegedly slashing a man's neck in Newcastle city centre . Wearing a smart jacket, the father from Bedford Place, Bensham, spoke only to confirm his name and address. He was remanded in custody and will appear at Newcastle Crown Court on June 26. The alleged victim was left with a 6-7ins wound to his neck as well as damage to nerves, muscle and a gland, Ms Jordan told the court. District Judge Stephen Earl declined jurisdiction of the case and said the allegations were too serious to be dealt with by the magistrates' courts. Judge Earl said: 'I'm left with a bizarre set of circumstances but there is a man that has a very serious injury as a result of those circumstances.' The shop reopned yesterday following the terrifying incident, which left a man in hospital on Tuesday night. The drama unfolded during rush hour while hundreds of commuters made their way home. Emergency services were called just after 5pm on to the shop near Newcastle’s Central Station to reports of a stabbing. A man was seen coming out of the barber’s allegedly clutching his neck, and blood stained the pavement outside the shop. Police said that a man was taken to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary with neck injuries and remains in hospital in a stable condition. Investigation: Forensic teams examine the outside of Jack's Barbers on Grainger Street near Newcastle's Central Station . The incident shocked workers and residents in the area, with many expressing their horror in the aftermath of the attack. Some shops in the area were forced to close while a police cordon was put up around the barber shop and surrounding businesses. One . business owner, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I had to close . from 5pm to 6pm because of it - the police cordon was around. 'I opened up again but there was no one about so I just had to close again. 'I don’t know what happened though, as I was in the back.' Horrifying: An officer stands outside the shop in the aftermath of the incident, which terrified shoppers and forced businesses nearby to close . A woman who works nearby said: 'I got a call from my duty manager about it. I couldn’t believe it.' Another man who was due in the barber’s today said he called up to cancel his appointment. Dobrodumow's nickname stems from a similar business, The Demon Barber Shop, he used to run nearby. He also used it as his Twitter name, and was reasonably well known with more than 100 followers. A number of other male hairdressers around the country operate their business under the satirical name. A Northumbria Police spokesman has confirmed the barber has been charged following an investigation which was launched on Tuesday. He said: 'Police were called to Grainger Street, in Newcastle city centre, at 5.09pm on Tuesday, June 10, following reports of an assault. 'Lloyd Anthony Dobrodumow, has been charged with wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Charges against an Illinois man who confessed to a 2008 hit-and-run accident that took the life of a 20-year-old college student were dropped on Thursday after prosecutors determined that his dramatic confession to the victim's family several years after the tragic crash was false. Defense experts working on the case found that 29-year-old David McCarthy, the man who confessed to hitting University of Illinois sophomore Melissa Lech with his car is suffering from a mental illness that caused him to confess to the crime. Last week, a state psychologist working on behalf of the Will County State's Attorney's Office agreed with the defense expert that McCarthy suffers from delusional disorder and has a history of bipolar . disorder and alcohol dependence. Innocent: Psychiatric experts determined that 29-year-old David McCarthy's confession about killing a 20-year-old college student was false . The state psychologist also concluded that his confession was a product of his . mental disorder, court records obtained by the Chicago Tribune. Lech was walking in the 2800 block of McDonough Street in Joliet after spending the day drinking at a Chicago White Sox baseball game. After the game, Lech was denied admittance to a local bar because she was underage. When she left the bar, she was hit while walking back towards her house. The case went unsolved until 2012, when McCarthy showed up at the doorstep of Lech's sister Melissa and confessed to being the driver who hit her sister. 'He sat across from me,' Melissa Lech said at the time. 'He was calm and said, ""I was the one who hit your sister.' Victim: 20-year-old Melissa Lech was hit by a car while walking home after a day of drinking at a baseball game . 'Toward . the end, I was saying, ""Well, are you going to come to the police now? Are you going to come forward?'"" she recalled. 'And he was like, ""I . have to think about it.' And I said, ""OK."" And he said, ""I think I . should go.'"" According to Michelle Lech, McCarthy explained that he got lost trying to get on Interstate 55. He claims he didn't see Melissa Lech walking on the road and he hit her accidentally before driving off. She says he told her that he saw her head hit the windshield before he drove over her body. Michelle Lech says McCarthy never once asked for forgiveness. McCarthy was arrested at his family's home a few hours later. He's been sitting in jail awaiting trial ever since. The victim's mother, Maria Lech, says she still believes McCarthy is the person who hit her daughter. She says he knew details of the crash that only the person who hit her could possibly know. Lech says that McCarthy talked about her daughter's injuries when he confessed to Michelle Lech, and that he talked about how he held her shoulder to try and limit the bleeding. According to Lech, McCarthy also said her daughter asked him to tell her mother than she loved her. Crime scene: This is the stretch of road in Joliet, Illinois, where Lech was hit while walking home . During his confession to the family, McCarthy talked about injuries to . her daughter’s head and that he held her shoulder to limit the bleeding. He also said Melissa Lech told him to tell her mother she loved her. Prosecutors, however, say there is no physical evidence linking McCarthy to the hit-and-run. Investigators found a paint chip on the victim that was similar to paint used on a vehicle owned by McCarthy's family at the time of Lech's death. Forensic testing, however, found that the paint was not a match to the car.","29-year-old David McCarthy showed up at the victim's sister's doorstep and confessed two years after the victim was killed .

"By . Wills Robinson . A 'monster' sergeant major has been jailed for two-and-a-half yearsafter sexually assaulting a lesbian soldier following a drunken barbecue. Father-of-two Timothy Jones, 40, attacked the victim after a party at Buckley Barracks in RAF Hullavington, Wiltshire, in May last year. The former Warrant Officer, who served in the Army for 23 years, was found guilty at Bulford Military Court last month following the incident which left the female soldier contemplating suicide. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been drinking with Jones, her partner, and several other soldiers from 9 Theatre Logistic Regiment during the party. Jailed: Father-of-two Timothy Jones, 40, was found guilty of the attack following a trial at Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire last Month . The revelry then moved into the bedroom of the victim, where she was seen to kiss her partner, before the couple were left alone with the defendant. Jones then sent a text message to a friend saying: 'LOL I’m lying between two lesbians, what should I do?' The victim later woke up in her bed to find Jones had undressed her from the waist down and was between her legs, sexually assaulting her. Sentencing Jones, Assistant Judge Advocate General Alan Large said: 'At the time of the offence you were the squadron sergeant major with an important role in discipline and setting of standards and junior soldiers looked up to you and respected you and your rank. 'You were an important part of their lives and they were entitled to have you treat them with respect and to keep them safe.' He added: 'The impact that excessive alcohol can have on people’s lives and careers is well-known to this court, the British Army and society in general. 'The Army expects soldiers to drink alcohol appropriately and you failed to uphold those standards on the night of the offence.' He continued: 'We do not think you had sex on your mind when you went back to the room but as the sexual temperature rose that night and as you consumed more alcohol, to put it bluntly, you decided to try your luck. 'You persuaded the two remaining male soldiers to leave but you remained and some form of sexual activity was on your mind.' Military base: The assault took place in the victim's room following a drunken barbecue at Buckley Barracks in RAF Hullavington last May . Judge Large added that he and the panel of senior officers judging the case had reduced the sentence by six months because of the defendant’s good service record. Lieutenant Colonel David Phillips, prosecuting, read a statement written by the victim describing how she had been left suicidal by the incident. She said in the statement: 'Since the incident it has affected me badly, I have been suffering nightmares nearly every night, I have been attacking my partner during my sleep. Devastated: After the guilty verdict was passed, his distraught wife Stacy, 36, (right) broke down, screaming: 'You promised me you didn¿t do it.' 'When the incident initially happened I thought about killing myself because I couldn’t cope - I was angry, upset, depressed, I couldn’t deal with it.' She continued to say she had difficulty with coping with busy places including public functions and added: 'I am less confident, I am on anti-depressants and I suffer from anxiety.' She said that she had problems simply entering the corridor of her barracks if she could hear others there and said that her trust in others and the military hierarchy had gone. The court heard that Jones joined the Army in October 1990 and was married to a charity fundraiser and they had two children, a 14-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter. After the guilty verdict was passed, his distraught wife Stacy, 36, broke down, . screaming: ‘You promised me you didn’t do it.’ Lt Col Phillips said that the offence was a breach of trust by Jones, who was of previous good character and had served in Northern Ireland, Rwanda and Yugoslavia. He had also received the long service medal, good conduct medal as well as medals for service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Jonathan Simpson, defending, said that Jones, who he described as an 'old dinosaur', had begun to admit his guilt for what happened having denied the offence throughout the trial.

"By . Dave Galley . If you can’t stand the heat get out of the World Cup, to misquote Harry S Truman. Climate will have its say in Brazil in terms of preparation, tactics and the football, especially for European nations. Salvador, Fortaleza, Natal and Recife are baked by fierce tropical heat and have seven lunchtime kick-offs, while Manaus steams in the relentless equatorial climate of the Amazon rainforest. England play their opener against Italy there. They could be in Recife for the last 16 and Salvador or Fortaleza for a quarter-final, so much of Roy Hodgson’s early work in training has been done in fear of the mercury rising. The link between hot and humid conditions and athletic performance is clinically proven. Hot and humid: A member of the ground staff looks after the pitch in the Arena Amazonia stadium in Manaus . HEAT AND PERFORMANCE . Fitness can be measured by the volume of oxygen your body can consume while exercising. When you see athletes on the treadmill wearing something that looks like a gas-mask, that’s what they’re measuring. The masks link to computers which display a VO2 Max reading. Most footballers will be aware of their reading, which should be around 50, which represents 50 millilitres of oxygen per minute per kilo of bodyweight. You increase it by exercising at 65-85 per cent of your maximum for at least 20 minutes, three or four times a week. Premier League clubs will usually test players three times a year: at the start of pre-season, midway through the season and at the end. In April sports scientists found that at 35C the VO2 Max dropped by four per cent and physical work capacity by eight per cent. Unfamiliar surroundings: England will be out of their comfort zone in sweltering Brazil . PLAYING IT COOL . Players will regularly clock up 12-14km during 90 minutes in the Premier League but it will be very difficult to cover this ground in extreme conditions and be ready to play again four days later. In the north of Brazil, especially in the seven games kicking off at 1pm, the pace of the game is expected to be slow and cautious. Coaches will preach about patience, possession and conserving energy. England’s passers, like captain Steven Gerrard, will be vital in Manaus, dictating tempo and  protecting the ball. They will be up against Andrea Pirlo, Italy’s  master of the art. Even with a kick-off at 6pm local time, it is expected to be hot and sticky. Master at work: Andrea Pirlo will protect the ball in the savage heat . DEHYDRATION . It does not take much to push the body over the line in extreme heat and humidity. It is like a car when it overheats. In the worst cases, it can affect the central nervous  system and that in turn affects your decision-making. You only need to be half-a-second out with your timing and you’re making tackles which will expose yourself and others to a greater likelihood of injuries. On a Liverpool pre-season tour, in Thailand, one of the players came in at half-time in a real mess. The water was draining from him. We laid him out on a towel and he left a soaking wet perfect imprint of his body. He had taken on the correct amount of fluids but he was  suffering from heatstroke and dehydration and it had started to affect his central nervous system. We were close to putting him on a drip but managed to cool his core temperature with cold towels in key areas of his body. SIPPING FLUIDS . In extreme heat dehydration can strike fast. They have to keep sipping fluids all the time before the problems start. If you drink only water it will dilute everything in your system and wash out minerals and vitamins you want to keep in. You have to keep putting the right  carbohydrates and electrolytes in. Sometimes you see players sucking gel sachets beside the pitch. They offer a short burst of carbs with a little bit of sodium. Ideally you’d take them with water. Keeping hydrated: Raheem Sterling has the right idea in Rio . WRAPPING UP . Roy Hodgson ordered his players to wrap up warm for training in Portugal, and England’s trip to Miami was based around gradually becoming accustomed to increased heat and humidity. The idea of training in woolly hats, gloves and thermals might seem simplistic and old-fashioned, but it makes sense and it does work. I know elite athletes who  compete in these hot places  without trying to acclimatise. They stay away and go in, race and get out as quickly as possible, so the body doesn’t even begin to adjust, but England are at the World Cup over four weeks. SHADING IT . Managing time off becomes important in the heat because recovery is as important as training. Years ago we’d have to stop players from sunbathing. Not only were they dehydrating but they were burning the skin as well. That’s not good preparation. England players will be in Rio but Roy won’t want them heading for the beach. You want them to keep out of the sun. Interview by MATT BARLOW .","Climate will have its say in Brazil in terms of preparation, tactics and the football, especially for European nation .

England settled into their paradise city World Cup base, under the protection of the robocops deployed to ensure Brazil’s carnival of football unfolds in a safe environment. The contrast could not have been clearer as Roy Hodgson and his team cruised by Rio de Janeiro’s golden sands in a team bus guarded by two police cars, a police motorcycle outrider, an army jeep and a truck-load of troops armed to the teeth. A protection force of 15,000 will police the stadiums, hotels, airports and training camps, according to the media in a country long accustomed to violent crime and, in more recent months, civil unrest. Check out the moves: Daniel Sturridge watches Danny Welbeck perform a handstand . Competition: The England strikers paid a visit to one of Rio's favelas along with some team-mates . Excursion: Sturridge and Welbeck were joined by Jack Wilshere, Adam Lallana and Fraser Forster . In the swing: Liverpool striker Sturridge shows off his dancing moves . Adding to the mood, England have selected the Urca military centre as their base at the foot of Sugar Loaf Mountain and a submarine slunk silently beneath the waves by the  training pitch just as the players emerged yesterday. Hodgson has been looking for an impact sub and he had one. The submarine was  followed by a gunship and helicopters  buzzing overhead on the first day’s training in Rio. Here was a stunning backdrop with armour plating. It promises to be the theme of the tournament; the thrilling prospect of a World Cup in Brazil entwined with the ever-present threat. Here is modern Brazil; parties and pacification units, hand in hand. Hodgson’s first session, however, was a friendly affair, starting with a welcome rendition of Queen’s We Are the Champions by samba band Bola Pra Frente, as the England players carried out a banner thanking Brazil for their ‘warm welcome’. This was somewhat nicer than the phrase selected by coach Gary Neville to get rid of the TV crews who accosted him and others on a seafront stroll on Sunday.

England stars will be banking on support from their Twitter followers after FIFA confirmed that the official Man of the Match at World Cup games will be voted for on the social media site. Football’s governing body and official World Cup sponsor Budweiser are hoping that taking the process to Twitter will increase the number of fans who vote during each game. In 2010, the vote was only accessible on the FIFA website. At this year’s tournament, the voting will open on Twitter at the start of the second half of each game, with fans able to click on a picture of their chosen player and register their vote via hashtag #ManoftheMatch. Jack Wilshere and Adam Lallana made England’s presence felt in the favelas, the shanty towns clinging to the rocks which tower above the city, with a visit to a sports complex in Rochina, which overlooks the team hotel in Sao Conrado. The England players, who always give their match fees to charities, have made a five-figure donation to renovate the dressing rooms in the sports complex, used by many youngsters from Rochina, Brazil’s biggest favela. ‘It is an eye-opener,’ said Wilshere. ‘In Brazil, like England, they love their football. Growing up I know all I wanted to do was play football. This will be nice for them.’ England players laboured in the heat of their one-hour session at Urca. Wayne Rooney looked exhausted from the start of his ball exercises and the fitness coaches and sports science experts sprayed the players with cold water during their drinks breaks. Both Steven Gerrard and Wilshere slipped out of the main group to work alone with the fitness coaches. The manager looked on, wearing his white baseball cap and retro shades. Assistant manager Ray Lewington hobbled around the perimeter with his left knee heavily bandaged after a minor operation on Friday. Gerrard is nursing slight discomfort in his groin and Wilshere went to work on the spinning bikes in a shady marquee but he was quick to quash any concerns. Visiting: Jack Wilshere, Welbeck and  Lallana visit the Complexo Esportivo da Rocinha . Caution: England captain Steven Gerrard is nursing a slight groin complaint . ‘It was just really to get the flight out my legs,’ said the Arsenal midfielder. ‘I feel I’m getting stronger every game. Ideally, I’d prefer a few more games. ‘We know what we’re going to face. This is the biggest competition in the world. Teams want to win and they are not going to let you walk past them. They are going to put their foot in and we have to get ready for that. ‘I’ve had a few kicks and when I first came back I was worried but I can’t stop it. I’ve been kicked many times and carried on.’ Ross Barkley was simply delighted to be involved after he turned up late. The bus had already left the team hotel when they noticed Barkley was missing and they caused chaos in the street turning the coach around. When he finally climbed aboard he was greeted with a sarcastic cheer and the team made the journey in 39 minutes with the help of their military convoy. Red-faced: Ross Barkley nearly missed the bus to England training . On the return: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is working his way back to full fitness . Better signs for Hodgson came in the shape of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had further treatment on his injured knee before going through a light running and jogging session, carefully monitored by physios Gary Lewin and Steve Kemp. The Ox, wearing a heavy knee brace as he worked, started with some short dashes, not at full throttle, and finished with a few laps of the pitch. Hodgson has until Friday to make up his mind on whether to keep him in the squad but the progress appears to be encouraging. Some of the players, including Frank Lampard, Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw and Barkley were still out doing shooting practice when Hodgson came out and ordered them off. The first training session beneath Sugar Loaf Mountain lasted just over an hour, which was more than enough in the midday sun.","England arrive in Rio under protection of police to ensure safety .

"By . Michael Wade . Follow @@MichaelWade_ . Liverpool have submitted plans to expand Anfield by almost 15,000 after having proposals to renovate the stadium approved by local residents, businesses and fans. If the plans are accepted by Liverpool City Council the Reds will add an extra 8,500 seats to the Main Stand and a further 4,800 to the Anfield Road stand and have tentatively scheduled a completion date for the 2016-17 season. With an answer due later this year, Liverpool have also proposed incorporating the club's crest into the elevation of the Main Stand and a carefully designed cloister which would house the Hillsborough Memorial. The future: Liverpool's plans for Anfield will see the capacity grow to almost 60,000 . Expansion: The main stand will house an extra 8,500 seats and the Anfield Road stand will take another 4,800 . Tom Doyle, an experienced project director who worked on the London 2012 Olympic programme and the SSE Hydro Arena in Glasgow, has been appointed to oversee the proposed expansion. Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre underlined the central role that local residents and businesses had played in the club's thinking. He said: 'When we set out on the journey to explore the feasibility of expanding the stadium, we said the process would be determined by certainty. 'Certainty that we have the support from local residents and businesses for our proposed plans, that we can acquire the land required and that we can navigate the planning landscape. 'Over the past 18 months and as part of this approach, we have worked closely with the community, local residents, Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group and we are delighted to be able to bring forward a planning application at this stage. 'A lot of good work has been done and we still have more work to achieve certainty; however, the planning application is another step in the right direction.' Moving on up: Liverpool finished second in the Premier League and will hope to continue that success . The Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, revealed that the redevelopment would see £260 million invested with hundreds of jobs created as a result. He said: 'The proposed redevelopment of the stadium is a hugely important part of our vision for Anfield - to create a thriving community in which people want to live, work and visit. 'The overall regeneration of the area will see £260m invested and will deliver hundreds of jobs.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . For Andrea Pirlo this is a swansong. After this World Cup, he will retire from international football. ‘I’ll be hanging up my heart,’ he said, when he unveiled this plan. It is a final chance to savour his effortless poise on this stage. For England, it is  perhaps the last time they will be forced to dance to his tune. Pirlo was 35 in May; a year older than Steven Gerrard, a year younger than Frank Lampard. He has signed a two-year deal at Juventus, where he has added three Serie A titles in as many years to two won in a decade at AC Milan. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Italy star Pirlo doing tricks in training ahead of England clash . Last hurrah: Andrea Pirlo will quit international football after the World Cup . Talking tactics: Pirlo chats with Mario Balotelli and Italy's head coach Cesare Prandelli . The deal was confirmed on Wednesday and those who watched him in Turin last season will tell you the maestro just gets better with age. He breezed into Casa Azzurri, Italy’s World Cup nerve centre, on Wednesday like Captain Jack Sparrow dressed by Puma, albeit somewhat more carefully groomed. Heavily bearded with a flowing mane, he was tanned and weathered, with trinkets and jewels tied to his right wrist and a footballer’s watch perched on his left. Unhurried . and utterly at ease, as in possession of the football, he shrugged and . tugged at his beard, refused to deny Tottenham had tried to lure him to . London and promised he would do his utmost to summon a performance like . the one against England in Euro 2012. ‘This is one of my targets, to play like I played in Kiev,’ he smiled. Danger man: Pirlo was a thorn in England's side at Euro 2012 . ‘To control the game and help my team win.’ Even at 35? Even in the suffocating humidity predicted for Manaus? Even on a pitch that looks like a terrible quilted blanket? ‘The temperature will be a problem for everyone. We have been preparing in Italy, before we came to Brazil. The pitch will be a problem for everyone. It is important to make the ball roll. ‘England is a great team who is much better now. They have young players, who run a lot, very physical, but we know how to face them. We are studying them. Italy always does well against England.’ Since winning the World Cup in 2006, Pirlo has become one of the team’s spiritual leaders as well as being recognised as one of his generation’s finest playmakers. Practice makes perfect: Pirlo has modelled his free-kick technique on Brazilian Juninho Pernambucano . At the Italian training camp on Wednesday he was met by Juninho Pernambucano, the Brazilian free-kick expert who played for eight years at Lyon. Pirlo studied his dead-ball technique until he had unlocked the secret and presented Juninho with a No 21 Italy shirt signed ‘with respect and gratitude’. In return he took  possession of two No 8 shirts, Juninho’s number, in the colours of Brazil and Vasco da Gama. Italy manager Cesare Prandelli has compared Pirlo’s calm authority to that of Gaetano Scirea, an Italy and Juventus legend who was killed in a car crash in 1989. Prandelli’s predecessor Marcelo Lippi called Pirlo his ‘silent leader’. Yet the midfielder is not expected to be allowed to perform in his preferred position, sitting on the toes of the centre halves. Italy are too concerned with their defensive frailties and Prandelli will ask Daniele De Rossi to protect the back four. Limbering up: Balotelli, Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi prepare to face England . Pirlo and Marco Verratti, the 21-year-old heir apparent to Pirlo’s crown, will sit either side of De Rossi, with Claudio Marchisio and Antonio Candreva ahead of them in a five-man midfield. They trained this way on Wednesday, with Mario Balotelli the lone striker, with only one goal since March and at the centre of a ‘should he start’ debate in the Italian media, similar to the one that has swirled around Wayne Rooney. ‘We are trying new solutions,’ said Pirlo. ‘We like to have one in front of the defence and two closer to the opposing goal free to invent. The most important thing is not the position but your interpretation of the position.’ When the English reporters pursued details of his new role, he flashed his teeth again. ‘I am not going to make it easy for you,’ he said. ‘We have 23 players, all good choices. Italy do not depend only on me. If every player can shine for 10 minutes it will be enough.’ All smiles: Pirlo jokes around with Balotelli in training on Wednesday . Italian newspaper La Stampa wrote of ‘England’s obsession’ with Pirlo, since that date in Kiev, when they danced to his tune. ‘The important thing is to play as a group, as we did in 1982 and 2006,’ he said. ‘We are here to win, of course. We always play to win. I am never happy just to pass the group stage. We are competitive. We want to go to the end.’ Twenty years after Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu threw him into the Brescia team at the age of 15 and offended the rest of the squad by ordering them to ‘give the ball to Pirlo, he knows how to look after it’, he will bow out of international football. Well, probably. He will find it hard. In his book, he wrote emotionally about playing for his country and how he stood over his penalty during the 2006 World Cup final at one with every Italian. Chasing shadows: England players couldn't get near Pirlo in Kiev . ‘Being part of a team that belongs to everyone makes me feel good and at peace with myself,’ he wrote in I Think Therefore I Play. ‘It relaxes me. A lot of the time, it’s better than sex: it lasts longer and if it all falls flat, it can’t just be your fault. ‘Take someone like Antonio Cassano. He says he’s slept with 700 women in his time but he doesn’t get picked for Italy any more. Deep down, can he really be happy? I certainly wouldn’t be. It makes you better, takes you to a higher level. Much better to be a soldier on the pitch than in the bedroom.’ When asked again if international retirement is still his intention, he replied: ‘Yes. I am going to give space to the youngsters but if they need me I will be at their disposal, and if I come I will want to play. Otherwise I will be nervous.’","Veteran midfielder plans to quit international football after World Cup .

There was no holding back, which is just the way we like it from the man who can turn a game with a swivel of his hips or a ping off that Nike boot. Rooney warmed up by putting away Paul Scholes with a feisty attack, hinting at jealousy after he signed a new five-year contract worth £250,000 a week at Old Trafford. By the end, Rooney was at full throttle. 'He's been a great player at Manchester United, but I've never had his phone number and he's never had mine,' revealed Rooney. Tasty stuff. Fighting fit: Rooney looks in good shape at England training as he jogs alongside his team-mates . 'I'm sure he has upset a lot of  people at Man United because they see me worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so obviously they have got a different opinion to what Paul has. The criticism was a bit strange, but he has his opinions and he's entitled to them. It was very, very strange, but I'm sure he has his reasons. 'I don't agree with them, but he's probably the best player I've ever played with so I'm not going to knock him as a player.' Next up were the Italians. Rooney has played against the great  catenaccio defences in the past for club and country, and is convinced that there is nothing to fear from Juventus pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini. 'If I'm being honest, when you play a high tempo they have  struggled,' he added. 'The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with Nesta and Maldini as centre halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that we can give them problems.' Rooney has convinced himself that this England team is better than the 'golden generation' who reached the quarter-final in 2006  or the decrepit 2010 team beaten  4-1 by Germany in Bloemfontein. 'The Italian players should be looking at us and how they can  control our team,' he added. 'We're not really too focused on Pirlo. 'He has been a fantastic player and Italy have some great players, but so have we. Water break: England players have been taking on plenty of fluids in the heat of Rio . 'They should be more worried about our team. It is exciting and the young players bring a lot of energy and excitement. You can see with Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling that there's no fear with them. They'll be good players, big players for us. 'This is probably the best squad of players I've been involved with since I've been with England.' That was an extraordinary claim, particularly with so little expectation around this group of players, but at least Rooney believed what he was saying. He was giving the world what they wanted to hear ahead of Saturday's Group D clash. When the subject of 2010 and the mouthful he gave England fans as he walked off the field at the Green Point Stadium in Cape Town after a 0-0 draw with Algeria came up, he sounded genuinely remorseful. 'Of course I regret it,' he added. 'It was in the heat of the moment. It was stupid of me, I understand that, but it was a frustrating time. 'I'll do my best for England and I'm sure the fans see that. I'm sure the Manchester United fans who are England fans like me.' The World Cup in South Africa was a traumatic experience for Rooney. He admitted he struggled to cope without his family. On the ball: Rooney says he is sharp and eager to prove the doubters wrong in Brazil . On my head: The players look in good spirits as they go through their training routine . 'The hardest thing about last time was that I missed my family and this time I've learned to deal with that,' he added. This time they will travel to Brazil to watch Rooney in tournament conditions. Last month his son Kai was in Portugal with Rooney's father-in-law, Tony, to watch him undergo a rigorous fitness schedule before  the England team met up in the prestigious Vale do Lobo resort. 'He's not a massive football fan to be honest, he's not really into it at the minute,' revealed Rooney. 'At the end of last season, when I walked out at Old Trafford the fans were shouting my name and he was asking why.' Young Kai, who is only four, will discover in time that his dad remains one of the biggest talents in English football. Rooney's edge is back, the element of aggression that set him apart when he emerged at Everton and embedded himself in the English game. 'David Moyes didn't call me - I went to see him,' Rooney explained. 'He gave me his honest  opinion and he felt I had lost a bit of aggression, which I was asked to do (by Sir Alex Ferguson). Down in the dumps: Danny Welbeck looked upset as he missed England training with a thigh strain . Tick tock: Roy Hodgson knows time is running out for him to finalise his team and tactics for the game against Italy . In doubt: Rooney's place in England's starting line-up at the World Cup has been questioned . 'I thought about it and it wasn't really me. I've always responded well in the dressing room if I'm not doing well. If someone shouts at me I have no problem with that.' Rooney has done so much in his career, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United. Incredibly, he has yet to score at a World Cup. 'If you look at my record in the World Cup qualifiers I had a pretty good record (seven goals). 'That's what I have to do at the World Cup. I want to score goals and help England be successful, but I honestly feel better than I have done for years. 'I'm ready for this tournament and I know if I play my game I will do well.' Doing well here means supplying goals and scoring them as England negotiate a tricky group involving Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Although Rooney is yet to get off the mark at a World Cup, he is one goal behind equalling Michael Owen (40 goals) and 10 behind the great Sir Bobby Charlton in an England shirt. 'At my age I should break the record, but I just want to keep  playing and trying to score. If I can get to Sir Bobby's record it would be a massive achievement and I would be absolutely delighted.' When he gets there, everyone will have a view on it.","England striker takes swipe at former Manchester United team-mate .

"By . Andy Sims, Press Association . Sami Hyypia spent 10 years as a player in the Premier League and is now itching to get back there as a manager. The former Liverpool defender has signed a three-year contract to take over at Brighton following Oscar Garcia's departure at the end of last season. The Seagulls have reached the Championship play-offs in each of the last two campaigns, but both times tumbled out in the semi-finals. Eyes on the prize: Sami Hyypia is aiming for a Premier League return with Brighton . In charge: Hyypia was manager of Bayer Leverkusen until he was sacked in April . So they have turned to 40-year-old Hyypia, a Champions League winner during a successful decade at Anfield, to ensure they do not fall short again. 'The ambition of the club attracted me,' said the Finn. 'Hopefully I can take the club forward in the next three years. 'I'm always confident. Confidence is no bad thing but we need to be realistic. 'The club has had a few good campaigns in the last few years but my job is to make it better. 'Hopefully the progress will continue and I will be a happy man if I can take the club forward. 'I have heard only good things about the club. 'I rang people who know the club and they said only positive things. Everything is perfect - now we have to make it perfect on the field.' Up and down: Brighton crashed out of the Championship play-off semi-final to Derby . Yet again: It was the second consecutive year that Brighton failed to escape the second tier . Result: Oscar Garcia lost his job as Brighton manager in April was Hyypia took over . Hyypia cut his managerial teeth in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen, the club where he finished his illustrious playing career three years ago. He was sacked in April following a run of one win in 12 matches, but insists the experience will stand him in good stead for life in the Championship with the Seagulls. 'It's great to be back in England, where I spent most of playing career,' he added. 'My opportunity was unusual in that 10 months after I stopped playing I was managing a Bundesliga club. 'That was a good school for me. In practice you learn more than when you are at school and I have learned a lot. Hopefully I can bring those things to this club.' Following their convincing play-off defeat by Derby, Brighton chairman Tony Bloom found himself searching for a new manager for the third summer running. But despite turning to a relative rookie in Hyypia, Bloom believes he has unearthed a potential gem. 'When we went through the process we were very open-minded,' he said. 'We were just looking for the best manager and, regardless of age, we think we have him.' Return: Hyypia played in the Premier League with Liverpool for a decade and is aiming for a return .","Sami Hyypia signs three-year contract to become new Brighton boss after Oscar Garcia's departure .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . World Cup stars will have to go the extra mile for their countries in the heat of Brazil – the United States, however, have taken that all too literally. For the Americans will travel a staggering 10,188 miles during their group campaign, the equivalent of flying from London to Rio and almost back again. That is nearly 9,000 miles more than the distance which will be covered by Belgium, who hit lucky when they were drawn in Group H, meaning their longest journey will be a 35-minute flight to Belo Horizonte for the opening game with Algeria. Air miles: World Cup teams will be forced to fly between matches given the vast size of host nation Brazil . Get used to it, boys: As USA arrive in Brazil, they face another 10,188 air miles during the group stages . Relaxed: US coach Jurgen Klinsmann chose not to relocate from Sao Paulo following the difficult draw . USA coach Jurgen Kilnsmann had the option to switch base camps when the group draw handed his side three northern matches, but the German opted to remain in Sao Paulo. That will see them embark on a 3,596-mile round trip for their opener against Ghana in Natal, with journeys to and from Manaus (3.342 miles) and Recife (3,250 miles) to follow. All in all, Klinsmann and his boys will spend 20 hours in the air and, amid the heat and humidity of what promises to be a trashing tournament, you can’t help but suspect such adventure is an unnecessary exertion. Group rivals Germany have based themselves in Porto Seguro halfway up the Brazilian east coast, reducing their air miles to 4,560 as a result. Rio-based England, meanwhile, will cover 4,424 miles during their first round of matches, and 3,548 of those will be journeyed this weekend before and after the curtain raiser against Italy in Manaus. Taking flight: England prepare to leave Luton Airport ahead of the World Cup . Long haul: Steven Gerrard (right) and co will travel 4,424 miles during the group stage . Plane sailing: Argentina and Lionel Messi have it relatively easy during the group stage . Of the big boys, Argentina perhaps have it the easiest – both on the pitch and in the air. A group of Bosnia, Nigeria and Iran should present few problems – likewise a probable second-round tie against one of Switzerland, Ecuador or Honduras – and their Belo Horizonte base sees them travel just 2,240 miles between fixtures. However, with staff at Rio's two airports threatening strike action on the eve of the tournament, the prospect of road miles as opposed to air miles would make for a different slant entirely on our distance table below...

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . On the hungover morning after the World Cup-winning night before, Argentina’s chief of police reported: ‘There were 12 million people rejoicing in the centre of Buenos Aires last night - and not a glass was broken.’ In the pregnant hours before Brazil set the ball rolling for their Copa do Mundo the people of Sao Paulo, never mind the odd cracked beer bottle, are fearful of half their city being smashed to smithereens. Argentina 1978 provided the most intense, passionate and atmospheric finals in the history of the greatest sporting show on earth. So far. Party time: Argentina fans shower their team in ticker tape following their first World Cup win in 1978 . Avalanche: Supporters show their pleasure . When FIFA finally elected to bring football back to the spiritual home of the beautiful game for the first time since 1950, it did so in expectation of Brazil staging an even more captivating and colourful spectacle than their fiercest and closest of nationalistic rivals. Not protesters and riot police on the streets. Not anti-World Cup strikes crippling public transport.Surely the hypnotic rhythms of the samba would drown out those haunting echoes of the melancholy tango from 36 long years ago. Perhaps they still will. Argentina started their home cup of dreams against the nightmare background of that country’s Dirty War, in which thousands of opponents of the ruling military junta disappeared. Mothers and wives were gathering daily outside Eva Peron’s old pink palace, the Casa Rosada, wailing for information about their lost loved ones. At the opening match of the World Cup those political prisoners who had not been buried in mass graves or pushed out of aeroplanes over the South Atlantic could hear the roars of the crowd from their concentration camp, a mile from the River Plate Stadium. Yet from this grim beginning – more ghastly even than the poverty afflicting swathes of the Brazilian people - arose a vast ground-swell of euphoric, patriotic support of their football heroes. The wait is over: Daniel Passarella raises the World Cup in Buenos Aires after a 3-1 win over Holland . As a consequence the World Cup became a powerful tool for international exposure of those atrocities. One man, perhaps more than any other, made that possible. Not a politician. Not a civil rights campaigner. Not even Mario Kempes with the goals which gave Argentina their first World Cup. Cesar Luis Menotti – that charismatic, chain-smoking manager of the team – was to become the visible proof that you could defy the Generals. And live. The incurable romantic that he is, Menotti had no intention of selecting players from the most successful club in his country – because their achievements relied more on foul means than fair. Boca Juniors, under cynical coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo, had kicked their way to everything from the Argentine championship to the fore-runner of the World Club Cup and been branded the Butchers of Buenos Aires. With the exception of Alberto Tarantini, the odd-man-out as a stylish full back whose temporary transfer to Birmingham he helped expedite before naming his squad, Menotti rejected all Lorenzo’s players. Defiant: Cesar Luis Menotti only picked Alberto Tarantini from Boca Juniors and won the World Cup . Cavalier: Ossie Ardiles . The Generals, in their hope of a sporting triumph to distract attention from their crimes against humanity, were outraged. When Menotti refused to compromise, he was threatened with execution if he failed to win the World Cup. Cesar Luis shrugged, lit another cigarette and carried on about his business. Thus he became the standard bearer not only for the World Cup fantasy but also the resistance to Argentina’s dictators.From the metropolis to the mountains, from the sea-shore to the Pampas, the country wrapped itself in flags of blue and white. The entire nation rallied behind Menotti and his team. They did not disappoint. Stars like Ossie Ardiles were Menotti’s lieutenants in what was now a multi-dimensional crusade. They strove to play cavalier football in the idiom of their Bohemian manager, coupled with a dynamism which galvanised their fellow countrymen. Football fever raged and not only at their own games . Roaring crowds waved a fond farewell to a Scotland of split personality – drew with Iran, lost to Peru yet beat Holland too late – kissed goodbye to France (Platini et al) and said a relieved goodbye to West Germany. Unbelievable: Scottish keeper Alan Rough lies beaten on the ground after Iran's Iradj Danaie-Fard hit what proved to be the equaliser . For Argentina, if they were to deny arch-enemy Brazil, the door to the final had to be unlocked by at least four goals against Peru in what was then the second group stage. After they scored six the accusations of bribery and corruption came thick and fast. Those suspicions were never substantiated and did Argentina less than justice. If Peru were selling the game then they were incredibly deceptive and accurate in the way they went about doing so. They hit the inside of a post twice before Argentina scored and came scorchingly close again before the hosts reached their optimum score. From that day to this every Peruvian who took part has vehemently denied the allegations. Nor are those slurs consistent with Menotti’s idealism, the sense of honour with which Ardiles is imbued, the heroic leadership of captain Daniel Passarella. The people believed not a word of it, focusing instead on the challenged about to be presented by the Dutch on the banks of the River Plate. Johan Cruyff had refused to travel to South America following death and kidnap threats to himself and his family. But Total Football  was still alive, well and in the final, for the second time running following defeat by Germany four years earlier. The kick-off was delayed as Argentina questioned the legality of a the plaster cast which Holland forward Rene van de Kerkhof came out wearing to protect his damaged wrist. It did appear to present a risk to opponents but was allowed. High tempo: Johnny Rep in action for Holland as Jorge Olguin (left) and Alberto Tarantini (right) watch in the World Cup final . The Dutch protested that the lengthy dispute had raised the tension and volume of a crowd obviously hostile to them. For certain this World Cup was about to come to a cacophonous crescendo and the response to the opening goal from Kempes was ear-bursting. There was an animal howl of anguish as Dick Naninga equalised eight minutes from normal team and the closest we came to silence was when Rob Rensenbrink struck an Argentine post in the dying seconds. The jubilations began when Kempes scored his sixth of the tournament, in extra time, and raised the roof when a clincher from Daniel Bertoni followed. As hundreds of thousands hurried to reach the downtown, the eight lanes of the highway from the stadium as well as the sidewalks and the grass verges came to a bumper-to-bumper standstill. Most of us walked in the last couple of miles over the backs of trucks and the roofs and bonnets of cars and buses, without our feet touching the ground. The Falkland Islands were to move to the forefront of the military’s agenda thereafter, provoking a war with Thatcher’s Britain. And those specks of land remain an issue between us, as we have been reminded this week by the latest Argentine team posing behind a Las Malvinas banner on arrival in Brazil. Support: Argentina players hold a banner saying: ""The Falkland Islands are Argentine"" before their World Cup warm-up against Slovenia . But on that night in July 1978 a people who had been made to feel unclean by their sinister Generals were given back their pride by the courageous idealism of a football manager and his players. Two evenings later Menotti invited me to join them at a private celebration in a small hotel. Weeks earlier, as the public responded to his defiance of the dictators, he had promised that if Argentina won the World Cup he would run with his people through the streets. Menotti asked all we who were present to remove our jackets and shirts (mercifully I was a lot younger then) and Passarella handed out blue and white scarves for us to tie as bandanas around our foreheads. The word was out on the streets and thousands were waiting. Out we went to run in a huge phalanx along the main boulevard of Buenos Aires, the Avenida de 9 Julio, around the monument to the Argentine Republic, the Obelisk, and back to the bar. There was not a hint of trouble, not a swear word out of place... and not a glass broken. The experience was exhilarating and the time it took for the heart to stop beating sends a message down the years to the samba drummers and dancers of Brazil 2014. No, don’t stop the carnival.","Argentina 1978 provided the most intense, passionate and atmospheric finals in the history of the greatest sporting show on earth .

Following a successful meeting between Tony Abbott and Barack Obama at the White House yesterday, the prime minister has recanted the negative opinion he expressed of the president a few years ago, instead describing Mr Obama as 'charismatic' and 'inspirational'. Mr Abbott, who is currently in the U.S. meeting with various leaders, previously described Mr Obama as leading one of the most left-wing US administrations in 50 years. 'Look, it was a bit of ill-judged commentary which I hope I've grown beyond,' he said of the remark. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott met Barack Obama for a one-hour talk at the White House today . He denied there was any conflict between the pair and said he now sees Mr Obama as 'a charismatic and at times inspirational president'. 'Sure, lots of people will have lots of disagreements because we live in a party-political system,' he said. 'But this is a person who did not get to be the president of the United States readily. He got there because he is a man of very considerable leadership abilities.' Mr Obama seemed to return the high opinion, saying after the meeting that Australia was one of the U.S.'s closest allies, and a valued military partner. Mr Abbott expressed his admiration for Mr Obama, calling him 'charismatic and at times . Mr Abbott previously expressed doubt about Mr Obama's leadership, saying he led one of the most left-wing U.S. administrations in the last 50 years . 'Aussies know how to fight, and I like having them in a foxhole if we're in trouble,' said Mr Obama. 'There are a handful of countries in the world that we always know we can count on, not just because they share our values, but we know we can count on them because they've got real capacity,' he said. 'Australia is one of those countries. We share foundational values about liberal democracies and human rights, and a world view that's governed by international law and norms. 'So I can't think of a better partner.' The remarks came as it seems likely that the U.S. will intervene in Iraq once more as the crisis in the country has escalated, with insurgents storming Baghdad. The pair discussed defence, China, and climate change - an issue on which they disagree . The hour-long meeting was also attended by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Vice President Joe Biden, ambassador Kim Beazley and Mr Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin . The president seemed to indicate his willingness to deploy more troops, saying: 'What we've seen over the last couple of days indicates the degree to which Iraq is going to need more help.' Mr Abbott reassured his U.S. counterpart of Australia's willingness to do its part to 'secure the freedom and the safety of the world and its citizens'. 'I want to assure the president that Australia will be an utterly dependable ally of the United States. The United States has had to bear many burdens, many burdens. 'The United States has paid a very high price to secure freedom and prosperity for many countries, not just itself. And the United States should never have to do all that work on its own.' President Obama also commended Tony Abbott for increasing Australia's defence budget in 'tough times' and the pair discussed commercial ties and their commitment to the trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr Abbott met with the president this morning, also present in the meeting were the Australian ambassador to the U.S. Kim Beazley and the PM's chief of staff Peta Credlin, as well as Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry.

A group of children hanging around the boy start abusing the cameraman and his friend. But another attempt to grab the can off the nine-year-old is successful. The boy then slumps against the wall and slides to a seated position on the ground. A girl, who appears to be friends with him, is then asked by the cameraman: 'Who gave him the Cody's?'. She replied her aunt gave him the booze, but refused to give him the name of alleged supplier. The cameraman then asks the boy who is now standing and swaying: 'Are you alright?' But the boy who appears to be heavily intoxicated does not answer the question. While Kali Tiloi pleaded guilty and fined $750 and Lucy Snowden's fate will be handed down on Friday . The man then asks the nine-year-old boy, who looks like he was having trouble staying on his feet while mounting his scooter, the name of the person who gave him the alcohol. In slurred speech, the boy gives him the name before taking off. 'You can't ride a scooter when you're drunk and you're nine years old,' the cameraman calls after him. The trio were charged over the January incident when video showing the nine-year-old drunk surfaced and went viral. The skate park where the incident occurred in January was located in Fairfield, a suburb in the city of Hamilton on New Zealand's North Island .","In the video, the boy is seen clutching and sipping from a bourbon mixer .

"By . Lillian Radulova . A police chase turned into a dramatic rescue operation when officers were forced to smash the windows of a car they were pursuing to free the four people inside after the vehicle burst into flames. Adding to the danger, the fire which erupted at the side of a motorway north of Brisbane, then spread to the officers' marked van, which was also gutted. Police began chasing the gang in a dog squad van after they failed to pull over on the Bruce Highway at Brighton about 8.30pm on Thursday. Scroll down for video . A 4WD being pursued by police in Brisbane's north, burst into flames after it became stuck in a grassy field with an overheated engine . The flames soon spread to the police's dog squad van, which was also completely destroyed in the blaze . The four-wheel-drive ran off the Gateway Motorway and police moved in to arrest the car's passengers. But before they could get them out of the vehicle the heat from the car's engine sparked a grass fire, engulfing it in flames. The officers were forced to smash the 4WD's windows and pulled the three men and one woman to safety. However the flames spread to the police van, which also caught alight. The dog squad van was completely destroyed in the blaze however the sole dog in the van escaped without harm. One woman and two men were arrested  at the scene after suffering only minor injuries . 'The police did a tremendous job. They were placed in a very dangerous situation by the occupants of the vehicle,' Acting Senior Sergeant Allan Cook told the ABC. 'The occupants were wanted by police in regards to some serious offences that have been committed in recent weeks.' Small fireball explosions were also seen during the car fires, believed to have come from munitions being blown up within the blaze, however police are still investigating the incident. The woman and two men have been arrested while the third man remains at the Royal Brisbane Hospital in a stable condition and under police guard.","Police were chasing a 4WD with four passengers after it failed to stop .

"By . Emily Crane . An 11-year-old boy who wrote a letter to Tony Abbott calling his stance on gay marriage 'pathetic' has revealed he was disappointed by the 'poor response' he received from the Australian Prime Minister. Orlando Burcham, from Cessnock north of Sydney, wrote to Tony Abbott last month expressing his passion for gay marriage after his mother Cordelia Troy married her girlfriend last year. He also pointed out that Mr Abbott's own sister, Christine Forster, was in a same-sex relationship and asked why the Prime Minister was stopping gay men and women from getting married in 'this beautiful country'. Orlando Burcham's letter to Tony Abbott has since gone viral after it was posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook last week. The 11-year-old, pictured here reading the comments on his letter, said he felt 'good' about the positive social media response . In his passionate letter, Orlando detailed that his mum Cordelia Troy (left) had to travel to New York last year to marry her partner Marissa Burrier (right) Mr Abbott responded to Orlando's letter last Friday but the 11-year-old was less than impressed. 'When I got it back I was very disappointed because there wasn't any reasons,' Orlando told MailOnline on Thursday. 'It was just a poor response.' Copies of Mr Abbott and Orlando's letters have now gone viral after they were posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook last week. In his passionate letter, Orlando detailed that his mum – a member of the Liberal Party and a local Cessnock councillor – had to travel to New York last year to marry her partner Marissa Burrier. 'My mother is gay and even worse your own sister is gay! And thousands more are as well,' his letter read. 'You have actually met my mum (Councillor Cordelia Troy) who is a member of the Liberal Party and she was deputy mayor at the time. It is so pathetic that you aren't letting the gay people of Australia and other countries get married here. 'You were elected to represent our country, not yourself. Just because you think it's wrong, does not give you the right to make it illegal. Doesn't our opinions matter to you? Just because you're the Prime Minister, which by the way does not give you all the power.' The Cessnock schoolboy pointed out that Mr Abbott's own sister, Christine Forster, was in a same sex relationship and asked why the prime minister was stopping gay men and women from getting married in 'this beautiful country' Mr Abbott responded to Orlando's letter last Friday but the 11-year-old was less than impressed . Orlando's mum said she had nothing to do with the letter but she had encouraged him to be heard. 'His twin sister was actually writing about how nice the bus driver was and I was going to take it to the local bus company,' Ms Troy told MailOnline. 'I was telling them it was important to be heard so he decided he would write to Tony Abbott and I said ""go for it"". 'He came in and asked me how to spell ""beautiful"" and then he came back and asked how to say ""pathetic"". I thought where is this going?' Ms Troy said she was rapt with Orlando's letter and the response it has garnered. 'I was pretty emotionally touched. To have one of your kids express something so well and the way he has expressed it is beautiful,' she said. 'It makes me feel really proud as a mum.' The prime minister has made his strong stance on marriage clear, despite his sister Christine Forster being in a same sex relationship . Ms Forster, a City of Sydney Liberal Party councillor, is engaged to her partner of six years Virginia Edwards . Despite being disappointed with Tony Abbott's letter, which he opened up at his school on Friday, Orlando said he felt 'good' about the social media response to the letters. In his response, Mr Abbott said he respected Orlando's views. 'The Government supports the current definition of marriage contained in the Marriage Act 1961. Any change to this policy would be a matter for the Coalition Party Room,' his letter read. 'My personal opinion is to support the existing definition of marriage. 'Though we disagree on this issue, I respect the views you have put forward. Ongoing dialogue between government and citizens keeps our democracy strong.'

"By . Louise Cheer . About 250 Ford Australia workers will lose their jobs at the car manufacturer's Broadmeadows and Geelong factories, it has been revealed. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia these redundancies were a long time coming, with Ford flagging jobs were at risk earlier this year as car sales decline. It comes just over a year after Ford announced the two factories would close its doors in 2016. Scroll down for video . Ford Australia is set to axe about 250 jobs from its two Victorian factories that employs more than 1000 people by June 20 . The Victorian factories employ more than 1000 workers and about 250 of them will be gone by June 20. The job losses come after Holden and Toyota announced in December and February respectively they would both cease Australian operations by 2017. It follows six years of struggle for the auto industry since Mitsubishi closed its Adelaide plant in 2008. Regional secretary of the AMWU vehicle division Paul Difelice said they had been in talks with Ford since March. 'They have been pretty transparent. Obviously it’s a sad day,' he told MailOnline on Thursday. 'The employees they have are highly skilled and dedicated employees. 'I’ve had a couple of discussions with Ford management and they’re upset too, but it’s a fact of life and there’s nothing we can do about it.' Mr Difelice said the car manufacturer cited declines in sales of its Ford Territory and Falcon ranges as the reason for the job losses. 'The Falcon is the one that has taken the most hits on the marketplace,' he said. 'There would have been around roughly 1,000 Ford Falcons sold this time last year and now it would be around the 690 figure.' Ford announced last year it close its doors at Geelong and Broadmeadows on Australian shores by 2016 . Mr Difelice said Ford had helped employees look for other jobs by holding career fairs to help those who were made redundant. 'Some have taken the opportunity to pick up a job with a new employer,' he said. 'If there are opportunities rising out of the jobs fair that will suit individual then they will take it instead of Ford having to tap (people on the shoulder) and forcibly make them redundant.' So far about 50 people have put their hand up for a redundancy package as the June 20 deadline looms. Declines in sales of the Territory and Falcon are to blame for the forced redundancies . The Productivity Commission, who were tasked with looking into the auto industry, tabled its preliminary findings report and found car manufacturers in Australia were not meeting the annual production of 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles to make them financially viable. The 2013 report said Australia's new car market was 'small by global standards'. 'It is highly competitive, to the benefit of Australian consumers, but is fragmented,' the report said. 'Top selling models enjoy sales of only a little over 40,000 vehicles a year.' The commission also said jobs in the industry decreased by 40 per cent between 2006 and 2013, with only 44,000 employed in 2013. The job losses at Ford follows announced closures of Australian manufacturing operations by Toyota and Holden .","The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union confirmed the redundancies .

"By . Emily Crane . A woman whose husband filmed a viral video to beg her to come home after she cheated on him two years ago has revealed they have since had another child and renewed their vows. John Cook from Casino in northern NSW posted a video online in 2012 holding up handwritten cards urging his wife Rebecca to 'please come home'. The video was viewed more than 700,000 times and convinced Mr Cook's 'soul mate for eternity' to give their marriage a second chance after the affair. Scroll down for video . John and Rebecca Cook from Casino in northern NSW reunited after an online video begged Rebecca to 'please come home' after she had an affair two years ago . The couple married in 2002 after he proposed over a McDonald's meal and they now have four children together . Two years on, the couple are now busy rebuilding their marriage and raising their four young children after Mrs Cook fell pregnant following the ordeal in November 2012, ninemsn reported. 'The kids are young, aged between 10 months and eight, so they don't understand what's happened,' Mrs Cook told MailOnline. 'I reckon when they're older they would be influenced by how far we've come and how we stuck it out. (The video) will teach them how we still love each other despite the trauma.' But not everyone has been as accepting of the couple's decision to reunite their marriage. 'I've had a couple of friends that disagreed with my actions and they've tried to make my life hell. My family calls me and also carries on about it,' Mrs Cook said. 'It just proves that they didn't really care about what was going on.' When the couple reunited they went to marriage counselling and then renewed their vows . Mr Cook's video was viewed more than 700,000 times on YouTube but has since been taken down . Mrs Cook fell pregnant after the video took off in November 2012 . Mrs Cook said the video was a positive turning point in their lives but it was challenging to get where they are now. 'It was a very difficult journey. We went to marriage counselling and then renewed our vows. It was something we knew we had to do,' she said. 'When it happened I thought I'd stuffed up my entire family and life. So (the vows) were renewing our trust with each other.' While Mrs Cook credits the viral video as the reason they are still together, the couple rarely look back on what happened. 'We just don't talk about it. We've come to terms with what's happened and now we've moved on,' she said. The video, which has since been taken off YouTube, showed photos of the couple with Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On as the backing music. When she was watching the video Mrs Cook remembers thinking 'What have I done?' It convinced his wife to give their marriage a second chance after her affair . He posted the video online in 2012 holding up handwritten cards confessing his love for Rebecca . 'When I first watched it, it was really hard. I felt betrayed because the other guy was there at the time,' she said. 'Then I watched it on my own, I could see he was proving to me that he loved me and I was thinking ""what have I done""?' Mrs Cook joked her husband was now working hard to be romantic and 'keep their marriage alive' considering he proposed over a McDonald's meal in 2002.

"By . Daniel Mills . Australian and UK health campaigners are being targeted with abusive, four letter emails and Twitter rants from a 'bizarre' online cult who oppose their stance on electronic smoking. It has emerged an online group of e-cigarette smokers, known as 'vapers', have been attacking Perth professor and anti-smoking campaigner Mike Daube over his opposition to the battery-powered version which smokers use to help them kick their bad habits. The Professor of Health Policy at Curtin University told MailOnline most e-cigarette dealers in Australia are 'dodgy' and are 'out to make a quick buck.' And like other substitution cigarettes before them, he said there is little to no empirical evidence which suggest they work. His stance on the subject has received a severe lashing from their users who have sent a trail of nasty emails to him. Attacked: an online e-smoking lobby known as 'vapours' have attacked health campaigners for their opposition e-cigarettes . 'Four letter emails starting with C and F,' Dr Daube told MailOnline on Thursday. 'Really vile, vicious and nasty stuff. 'I couldn't tell you who they are, all I know is that there is this quite bizarre group called 'vapers' writing them.' Dr Daube, who is also the president of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health, said he had never before experienced such vitriol in his 40 years of research in tobacco. Those responsible for the emails stem from an online e-cigarette forums known as vaping chatrooms. Users post and comment on reviews of different e-smoking devices, share thoughts on their uses and discuss what products are on the market. How e-cigarettes work and what they are made from vary, but most release a vapour that contains far less harmful carcinogens than a normal cigarette. Some do contain nicotine, while some do not - but a large percentage come in a range of flavours including mint, strawberry and chocolate. The are not approved for use by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Association, and until they are, Dr Daube said, they will not have a place as a 'safe and healthy' alternative to smoking in Australia.

Cowell’s guide to beating . bad breath: How drinking black coffee and forgetting mouthwash can stop halitosis . Professor Daube and another researcher from Sydney University, professor Simon Chapman, recently hosed down a study by London academics which concluded smokers were about 60 per cent more likely to succeed if they used e-cigarettes, than if they used willpower or over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies such as patches or gum. Dr Mike Daube has been sent a string of nasty emails from e-smoking lobbyists known as vapours . They said such studies are often drawn from skewed sample groups, such as those who frequent online vaping chatrooms. Dr Chapman wrote in a peice for The Conversation: 'Data from such research tend to show sometimes stratospheric success levels,' going on to say the studies are 'almost worthless for smokers at large because they're drawn from non-representative populations, such as vaping chatrooms.' Supporters say they are safe and are saving the lives of countless smokers who no longer inhale carcinogenic smoke. Their detractors say the health benefits and risks are still unclear. In the UK,  Professor of Public Health Martin Mckee wrote a skeptical piece in the British Medical Journal on e-cigarette smoking, and straight after its publication received a trail of hate tweets from vapers. 'I have been overwhelmed by the response to my paper' he said. 'Within a few hours of it being posted on the BMJ website I was attracting hundreds of messages on twitter, almost all personally abusive ... 'vile cretin' was one of them.' He said he 'had no idea that the e-cigarette lobby was so well organised.' Dr Daube said if you can't quit smoking by going cold turkey, then there is a vast array of other tried and tested products that have been proven to help, like nicotine patches. Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices which simulates smoking . The design was patented in 1963, and uses a heating element known as an atomiser that vaporises a liquid solution . Some e-cigarettes contain a mixture of nicotine and flavourings, while others release a flavoured nicotine-free vapour . They are sold in flavours like chocolate and strawberry that are banned in conventional cigarettes because of their appeal to young people . But their opponents claim they do little do little help people quit and actually encourage young people to smoke .","UK and Australian anti-smoking campaigners trolled on email and Twitter .

A spokesperson for MMR Research Worldwide who conducted the research, said: 'Plenty of women are excited about the impending blanket of all things football and even if they aren't that interested, they are still benefiting from the World Cup buzz. 'This festival extends beyond the sport into the cultural side of things, including trying Brazilian food and socialising.

According to the study, 16 to 34-year-olds are more likely to watch live games on their smartphone, tablet, computer or via connected TV than any other age bracket, but even the majority of this age group say they will still mainly watch matches on TV. 'Watching matches on terrestrial television from the comfort of their sofa in the living room remains by far the most popular way football fans will enjoy the World Cup,' says the spokesperson. 'Despite the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, and huge investment by Sky and other broadcasters in on the go services, the data clearly shows that the viewing habits of football fans have hardly changed since England last won the World Cup in 1966.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . One scientist has revealed the psychology of Tetris (pictured) on its 30th birthday - or World Tetris Day . Many of us have been guilty of wasting time playing Tetris and finding ourselves unable to stop. And now one scientist has revealed the psychology of the popular game on its 30th birthday, 6 June -also known as World Tetris Day. Dr Tom Stafford said the game of tessellating bricks takes advantage of the mind’s basic pleasure in tidying up by feeding it with a ‘world of perpetual uncompleted tasks’. Over the last 30 years, people across the world have spent millions of hours fitting falling shapes into rows playing one of the biggest-selling computer games of all time. Dr Stafford, of the University of Sheffield’s Department of Psychology explained that the chain of partial-solutions and the prospect of solving more mini tasks is as satisfying as scratching an itch. Previous research has indicated that there are two ways of working out the puzzle – either by mentally rotating the brick in your mind’s eye and imagining how it might fit into the line of blocks on the bottom, or by clicking to rotate the block quickly, so you can do a visual comparison. The study found that most people prefer to use the keys to rotate the blocks in order to work out where best to fit them, instead of imaging them turning. Dr Stafford thinks that one of the attractions of the game is that it is easier to think with it than about it, in what scientists call an epistemic action. He believes Tetris proves that games can be addictive and immersive without having amazing graphics and realism. Dr Stafford, of the University of Sheffield's Department of Psychology explained the chain of partial-solutions and the prospect of solving more mini tasks in the game (pictured) is as satisfying as scratching an itch . Tetris also plays on the 'Zeigarnik effect', which shows that people more easily remember uncompleted tasks than those that they have finished. ‘Tetris does this wonderfully…it presents a world of perpetual uncompleted tasks,’ Dr Stafford said. ‘It shows how our minds are organised around goals and that our memory is not just a filing system where information is passively stored, but it adjusts dynamically according to our purposes.’ Dr Stafford thinks that the genius of Tetris is that it takes advantage of this memory hook for uncompleted tasks. ‘It involves us in a compulsive loop of completing and generating new tasks and that keeps us endlessly playing.’ Dr Stafford said that Tetris is the granddaddy of addictive puzzle games like Candy Crush saga. ‘Tetris is pure game: there is no benefit to it, nothing to learn, no social or physical consequence. It is almost completely pointless, but keeps us coming back for more.’","A psychologist from the University of Sheffield has revealed Tetris appeals to our brain's desire to solve and tidy up mini tasks .

"Amazon's much rumoured 'holophone' is set to be announced by Jeff Bezos on June 18th, the shopping giant has confirmed. It today released a teaser video showing people's reaction to the phone. It is believed the the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.' Scroll down for Video . The best pictures yet of Amazon's smartphone show off its slim design . The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen. These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses. Previously images of the handset have leaked online. The latest images also reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone. 'Multiple trusted sources have verified the authenticity of the image, which was created for internal use by graphic designers at Amazon,' web site BGR said. The handset appears to take design cues from Apple's iPhone 5 and Google's Nexus handset. 'As can be seen in this new image published exclusively by BGR, Amazon’s phone will feature an overall look that is similar to many full touch smartphones currently on the market,' said BGR. 'In fact, it appears to take design cues from several existing smartphones including Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup and even the HTC One, which has a polished, chamfered bezel much like the one seen on Amazon’s phone.' The handset is believed to have a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work. It will run a highly customized version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets. The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, the report claims. This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September. The Amazon handset has a beveled edge similar to apple's iPhone 5 . Apple's patented system is slightly different to the 3D display Amazon is rumoured to be working on. The first pictures of Amazon's 3D handset were revealed last week, pictured, and appeared to feature four cameras and retina-tracking technology that are used to create a 'floating screen' effect . Previously the site has obtained images of the handset sheathed in a protective case. 'Finally, we have obtained exclusive photos of a prototype of the unreleased device, giving the world its first look at Amazon’s hotly anticipated phone, web site has previously BGR said. 'As can be seen in the images, the device is covered by a protective shell intended to prevent people without authorization from seeing the physical design of the phone.' KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the firm will launch a phone. 'We predict Amazon (US) will launch its own brand smartphone in 3-6 months, using the same hardware strategy as used for its e-reader and tablet,' he recently wrote. 'The supply chain will start stocking up materials in Q2 2014 for production.' It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console. The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. The handset is shown in a special protective case to shield its final design. However, the four cameras are clearly visible in each corner . The handset look almost like Nokia's Windows Phone with its large, rounded shell - although that is believed to be simply to hide the final design . Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box. 'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said. The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September . 'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO. The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus. The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast. Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen . The firm said it plans to add more services in the future. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US. Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.","Phone rumoured to show images that 'float above the screen like holograms'

"By . Jane Asher . As I posed for photographers on the Royal Albert Hall’s red carpet last week, my show-stopping, sequinned frock made me feel a million dollars. And I’m certain that as I took to the rostrum to conduct a full orchestra and choir of 280 in Handel’s Zadok  The Priest at Symfunny — a musical event held in aid of the wonderful charity Parkinson’s UK, of which I am president — no one guessed my secret. For while my elegantly cut dress could easily have passed for a designer number worth thousands of pounds, it was in fact from High Street favourite Phase Eight — with a much more modest (although, admittedly, still significant) price tag of £295. It is just one of a new wave of glamorous yet affordable red-carpet-worthy evening gowns hitting the shops in the nick of time for summer events. These full-length frocks are brilliant for older women like me because, as is the case with chunky jewellery, I find that in my 60s I can wear things that would overwhelm a younger woman. Here’s my verdict on the High Street’s limelight-stealing dresses . . . Scroll down for video . £295, phase-eight.co.uk . This is what I wore to the Royal Albert Hall and I adore it — it could easily be ten times the price. I associate Phase Eight more with reliable day wear than with evening sophistication, so this was a real find. It’s extremely comfortable, beautifully graded in colour, and the V-neck gives a flattering flash of decolletage. £99, Debut at debenhams.com . A bargain, although that’s somewhat . reflected in the quality — it looks far more elegant than it feels. The . draping is kind to the figure, though, and I love the classic, subtly . sexy design. Ideally the bodice would be boned and fitted, and the sheer . top extended into sleeves, Grace Kelly-style, to make it perfect for . all shapes and sizes. Gold collar, £34.99, hm.com . I couldn’t believe this dress cost just . £34.99, but when I put it on  I realised it looked  like something a . footballer’s wife might wear. It looks and feels flimsy and absolutely . necessitates a strapless bra. On someone 20 and tanned it might just . work, but on me it looks as cheap as it is. Navy sequin, £69.99, quizclothing.co.uk . The best value of the lot. Eye-catching without being tacky, it can be stepped into so you can do your make-up and hair before getting dressed. If my budget was under £100 this is what I’d choose. Blue high neck, £275, Reiss at harrods.com . This seemed like a real winner at first. It’s well-made in a rich, silky fabric and fully lined, but to get it . on, you have to pull it over your head, so I had to redo my hair and . make-up. Worst of all, the shape is unflattering. Gold bead embellished, £184, debenhams.com . When I saw this I immediately thought . ‘mumsy’, but once I had it on, I loved it. An evening dress with sleeves . is a fantastic find — perfect if you don’t feel confident about baring . your arms. It’s also fully lined and easy to step into, and feels far . more luxurious than I expected. Good price for the quality. Burgundy multiway, £80, bhs.co.uk . This isn’t really a dress at all — it’s an elasticated skirt with two very long pieces of fabric attached at the waist. The claim is that these can be used to create 15 different styles, but you’d have to be pretty clever to do it and  feel secure enough to  venture out. Although it comes in a lovely range of colours and the  fabric is good, tying it is so fiddly I bet you’d wear it  once — before leaving it hanging reproachfully in the wardrobe.","The High Street dress Jane wore on the red carpet made her feel fantastic .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Smartphones and tablets have meant people can watch porn wherever and whenever they like. Of the 38 million people who visit online site Pornhub each day, nearly half are now using mobile devices to view pornography. And according to figures released by the Montreal-based site, Safari on the iPhone and iPad is used more than any other mobile browser to watch adult content. Google Chrome is by far the most popular browser used by nearly 45 per cent of Pornhub viewers. Internet Explorer comes in second at 23 per cent, just slightly ahead of Firefox . Apple’s iPad was the most used tablet by quite some margin, the group said, with Safari claiming 73 per cent of the porn site’s tablet visitors. Google’s Chrome, which is available on the iPad and Android tablets, came a distant second used by 13.6 per cent of visitors. Despite this rise in mobile-viewing, the Montreal-based site has found that 51 per cent of people prefer using their old-fashioned desktop for adult content. The least popular device for viewing porn on was the Blackberry tablet, which made up exactly 0.69 per cent of all tablet Pornhub consumers. Of the 38 million people who visit online site Pornhub each day, nearly half are now using mobile devices to view pornography. But despite this rise in mobile-viewing, the Montreal-based site has found that the old-fashioned desktop is still the device of choice for adult content . Mobile users spend less time on the site on average. Internet Explorer takes the longest at 8 minutes 57 seconds, and Chrome the least at only 8 minutes 17 seconds . America . is in the grip of a pornography pandemic that has become so serious it . should be treated the same way as teenage smoking or drink driving, . activists have warned.

Hawkins, executive director of Morality in Media said porn must be tackled no differently . than any major public health crisis. Speaking . ahead of a two-day conference on sexual exploitation earlier this . month, she said, if left untreated, addiction to pornography can leave . users with psychological damage. 'There’s . a lot of science now proving that pornography is harmful,' Hawkins said . at the National Press Club in Washington. Gizmodo asked Pornhub to dig a bit further into its data, and see what desktop web browsers are the most popular for watching porn. The group found Google Chrome is the most favoured with nearly 45 per cent of . viewers using the browser. Internet Explorer comes in second . at 23 per cent, just slightly ahead of Firefox. ‘Unbelievably we do still have daily visitors from Internet Explorer 5 looking for a porn fix,’ the website said. Internet Explorer users spent the longest amount of time on the website, clocking in at a 10 minutes and 30 seconds for desktop users. Mobile users spend less time on the site on average. Internet Explorer again takes the longest at 8 minutes 57 seconds, and Chrome the least at only 8 minutes 17 seconds. On tablet computers, Amazon Silk users take an 12 minutes 33 seconds each time they visit Pornhub - two minutes longer than iPad users with Safari. Those using Android browser are fastest at 9 minutes 45 seconds. A search for 'Kim Kardashian' pops up on all browsers but Safari, while fellow sex-tape alumni 'Farrah Abraham' is only loved by Internet Explorer users. A separate study, conducted last month by the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, found that men who watch pornography may be shrinking their brains and dulling their responses to sexual stimulation. It is the first time researchers have found a possible link between regular viewing of pornography and physical harm. However, an alternative explanation is that people who spend more time looking at pornography are born with a certain type of brain.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Pesticides are widely blamed for wiping out of bee colonies, but a new hive-friendly crop spray from an unexpected source is in development. Scientists have discovered that the venom of the world’s deadliest spider will kill of pests but won't  harm bees. They combined poison from the Australian funnel web spider - whose venom is strong enough to kill a man - with a protein called lectin from the snowdrop plant, to produce an pesticide that is almost harmless to the pollinating insects. Scientists have combined the poison of the Australian funnel web spider (pictured), whose venom is strong enough to kill a man, with the snowdrop plant protein lectin to produce an insecticide is fairly harmless to honeybees . Hv1a/GNA is a pesticide made from the venom of the Australian funnel spider and the snowdrop plant protein lectin. It is fairly harmless to honeybees as when they were fed it in a lab, it had next to no effect on survival rates. The pesticide does not affect honeybees' learning and memories which they rely on to find food, unlike some current pesticides. Scientists think that the chemical cocktail has enormous potential as a 'bee safe' pesticide and could be alternative to neonicotinoids which are thought to be responsible for decimating colonies. Biologists at the University of Newcastle fed large doses of the pesticide to bees in a lab - far beyond what they would be exposed to in the wild – and found that it had a very slight effect on survival rates. Unlike some current pesticides, Hv1a/GNA, has no effect on their learning and memory, which is key to their foraging for food. Researchers said that the chemical cocktail has enormous potential as an environmentally friendly ‘bee safe’ pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies. ‘Our findings suggest Hv1a/GNA is unlikely to cause any detrimental effects on honeybees,’ said Professor Angharad Gatehouse of the university. ‘Previous studies have already shown it is safe for higher animals which means it has real potential as a pesticide and offers us a safe alternative to some of those currently on the market.’ The researchers told MailOnline that while humans have not ingested the pesticide, 'all scientific evidence suggests that there is absolutely no danger to humans if this did indeed occur.' The toxins in spider venom target the central nervous systems of insects, but not mammals and the scientists selected those that are in the pesticide because of the insecticidal activity and lack of toxicity towards higher. 'Even if the toxin did affect mammals it would need to be directly injected rather than ingested by the person because the toxin in combination with the snowdrop protein would not reach it’s site of action if ingested by a human,' they said. The new pesticide, Hv1a/GNA, has no effect on bees' learning, which is key to their foraging for food. Researchers said that the chemical cocktail has potential as an environmentally friendly 'bee safe' pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies. A stock image of crop spraying is pictured . There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim. Destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are vital for food production. Professor Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project, said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’ The research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops. Bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides. Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years. Scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination. In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal B, the bees were exposed to varying amounts of the spider and snowdrop mixture for a week. Lab member Erich Nakasu said: ‘This is an oral pesticide so unlike some that get absorbed through the exoskeleton, the spider and snowdrop recombinant protein has to be ingested by the insects.’ The new pesticide offers hope of more species-specific pesticides by targeting calcium channels that are linked to memory and learning in bees. Dr Nakasu explained: ‘Although Hv1a/GNA was carried to the brain of the honeybee, it had no effect on the insect which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee.’ The larvae were also unaffected by the pesticide, which they were able to break down in their gut. Lab head Dr Geraldine Wright led a recent study highlighting the damaging effect of a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids on bees’ ability to learn and remember and subsequently communicate to their hive mates. She said: . ‘About 90 per cent of the world’s plants are directly reliant on . pollinators to survive. 'If we destroy the biodiversity of pollinators . then it will be irrelevant how effective our pesticides are because we . will not have any crops to protect.’ ‘There . is now substantial evidence linking neonicotinoid pesticides to poor . performance and survival in bees and what we need now is a clear . directive from government to develop and introduce bee safe . alternatives.’ Professor . Gatehouse added: ‘There is not going to be one silver bullet. What we . need is an integrated pest management strategy and insect specific . pesticides will be just a part of that.’ Although Hv1a/GNA was carried to the brain of the honeybee (stock image), it had no effect on the insect, which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee . One group of experts has proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter, particularly when temperatures drop. Research revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives. The study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, strengthens the scientists’ findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder (CCD) where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die. It found that bees in the hives exhibiting CCD had almost identical levels of pathogen infestation as a group of control hives, most of which survived the winter. This finding suggests that the neonicotinoids are causing some other kind of biological mechanism in bees that in turn leads to CCD. The researchers separated six colonies into three groups -one treated with imidacloprid, one with clothianidin and one untreated. There was a steady decline in the size of all the bee colonies at the beginning of winter, which is typical among hives during the colder months in New England. Beginning in January 2013, honeybee populations in the control colonies began to increase as expected, but populations in the neonicotinoid-treated hives continued to decline. By April 2013, half of the neonicotinoid-treated colonies were lost with abandoned hives that are typical of CCD.","Biologists at the University of Newcastle combined the venom of the Australian funnel spider with snowdrop plant protein to make the pesticide .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Twenty one years ago this week, James Dyson launched his iconic vacuum cleaner in the UK. Today, millions of these vacuums are helping clean dirt in households across the world – but despite global success, it seems there is one design the engineer may be kicking himself for not pursuing. According to recently revealed documents, Britain’s most famous modern inventor may have been better known for his own version of Google Glass, had he not shelved the idea in 2001. According to recently revealed documents, Britain’s most famous modern inventor may have been better known for his own version of Google Glass, had he not shelved the idea in 2001. Pictured is an early prototype . The documents show how thirteen years ago, the Wiltshire–based company developed an augmented reality headset that it intended to call Dyson Halo. Early designs of the Halo prototype suggest it would have been a cross between Google Glass and a Walkman, with thin metal band surrounding by wires. The system, referred to under the secret project name N066, could be carried in the user's pocket, working both as a communications device and computer. Google Glass, pictured here worn by founder Sergey Brin, is now becoming increasingly popular gadget. However, many people have voiced concerns over intrusions into privacy using the technology . Early designs of the Halo prototype suggest it would have been a cross between Google Glass and a Walkman, with thin metal band surrounding by wires. Given the secret project name N066, the device could be carried in the user's pocket, working both as a communications device and computer . On the headset, two plane mirrors reflected the display of two tiny monitors which were mounted close to the wearer’s temples, onto a prism. Pictured is an early sketch of the system . The headset. which may be folded, could be used in audio only mode using voice commands and text-to-speech. This design sketch shows the headset folded together . Dyson had other inventions that never made the cut. Among them, was a fuel cell, which would have allowed Dyson’s digital motor in its vacuums to run on hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy from hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. Fuel cells require a large, constant source of both hydrogen and oxygen to run, but produce electricity continuously. For three years, 10 Dyson engineers worked to adapt a Dyson digital motor so it could sit at the heart of a fuel cell. The aim was to increase performance whilst reducing size. The eventually designed a compact, lightweight and highly efficient digital motor V4HF resulted in a 20 per cent increase in power density and improved efficiency. The start-up time became almost three times faster. On the headset, two plane mirrors reflected the display of two tiny monitors which were mounted close to the wearer’s temples, onto a prism. This created an illusion of a projected, translucent, 10inch (25cm) display around three feet (one metre) in front of the user. A virtual personal assistant, similar to Siri, could read out emails and interpret basic voice commands. Dyson also intended a keyboard to be projected in front of the user so that one could type and write emails on any surface. The headset. which could be folded, had the option of being used in audio only mode with voice commands and text-to-speech. The idea was that users could drive while using the computer, or use it on the go without the display, giving the effect of having a personal assistant whispering in your ear. The headset could be detached from the wearable computer, and the mobile device could be docked into a monitor to become a desktop computer, giving the same effect as plugging a laptop into a TV. The headset could be detached from the wearable computer, and the mobile device could be docked into a monitor to become a desktop computer, giving the same effect as plugging a laptop into a TV, as shown in this sketch from 2003 . A wrist-worn device could then serve as a mouse, allowing the user to control the virtual cursor on the display. Dyson engineers spent three years working on Halo, only to put it aside with plans to focus on getting more market-ready goods on to the market. The group had other inventions that never made the cut. Among them, was diesel trap for vehicle that used Dyson’s cyclone technology to capture and filter particles coming from car engines.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . There have been plenty of songs written about spiders and their webs, and now scientists have found the creatures are musical in their own right. Using lasers, researchers found spiders pluck their complex constructions like guitar strings to gather information about their surroundings. Spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that when a thread is plucked, the sound created carries information about prey, mates, and even the structural integrity of a web. Scroll down for video . Musical maestros? Scientists have found that spiders pluck their webs like a guitar string to find meals. The silk (pictured) transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that, when plucked, its sound carries information about prey, mates, and even the structural integrity of a web . Spiders pluck the threads of their webs like a guitar string to glean information about their surroundings. Spiders silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that, when plucked, the sound that is made carries information about prey, mates, and even the structural integrity of a web. Spiders have poor eyesight so they rely on the vibration of the silk in their web for sensory information. They can glean information such as exactly what their next meal is and the quality of a prospective mate. They receive the information using organs on each of their legs called slit sensillae. Spiders can ‘tune’ the silk by adjusting the tension and connections to build a better web. The discovery was made by researchers from the universities of Oxford, Strathclyde, and Sheffield who fired bullets and lasers at spider silk to study how it vibrates. They found that spider silk can be tuned to a wide range of harmonics. The findings, published in the journal Advanced Materials, not only reveal more about spiders but could also inspire a wide range of new technologies, such as tiny light-weight sensors. ‘Most spiders have poor eyesight and rely almost exclusively on the vibration of the silk in their web for sensory information,’ said Beth Mortimer of the Oxford Silk Group who led the research at Oxford University. ‘The sound of silk can tell them what type of meal is entangled in their net and about the intentions and quality of a prospective mate. By plucking the silk like a guitar string and listening to the ""echoes"" the spider can also assess the condition of its web.’ This technique is used by the spider in its web by ‘tuning’ the silk - controlling and adjusting both the inherent properties of the silk and the tensions and interconnectivities of the silk threads that make up the web. To study the sonic properties of the spider’s threads, the researchers used ultra-high-speed cameras to film the threads as they responded to the impact of bullets. Lasers were used to make detailed measurements of even the smallest vibration. The discovery was made by researchers from the universities of Oxford, Strathclyde, and Sheffield who fired bullets and lasers at spider silk to study how it vibrates. They found that spider silk can be tuned to a wide range of harmonics. Images of silk during high-rate ballistic impact are pictured . Dr Shira Gordon of the University of Strathclyde said: ‘The fact that spiders can receive these nanometre vibrations with organs on each of their legs, called slit sensillae, really exemplifies the impact of our research about silk properties found in our study.’ Professor Fritz Vollrath of the Oxford Silk Group at Oxford University added: ‘These findings further demonstrate the outstanding properties of many spider silks that are able to combine exceptional toughness with the ability to transfer delicate information. ‘These are traits that would be very useful in light-weight engineering and might lead to novel, built-in “intelligent” sensors and actuators.’ Dr Chris Holland of the University of Sheffield explained that spider silks are well known for their impressive mechanical properties, but the vibrational properties have been relatively overlooked. ‘Now we find that they are also an awesome communication tool. Yet again spiders continue to impress us in more ways than we can imagine.’ Dr Mortimer thinks that spiders may even set out to spin a web that ‘sounds right’ as its sonic properties are related to factors such as strength and flexibility.","Study led by Oxford University found that spider silk transmits vibrations across a range of frequencies .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Over two million people brave rain and midges to visit the Scottish Highlands each year. But one father and son team have got a unique view of the beautiful landscape that tourists can't see - by taking photos from space. Barry Fraser, 38, and his son Cameron, 12, designed and built a weather balloon that carried an array of cameras and devices into the space to capture photos showing the curvature of Earth.

Barry Fraser, 38, and son Cameron, 12, designed and built a weather balloon which carried an array of cameras and devices 19 miles (31km) above the Earth to capture photos showing the curvature of Earth (pictured) The helium balloon rose 19 miles (31km) above the Earth in just an hour and 48 minutes before it burst, having expanded too much. The equipment was secured to a parachute and floated back, landing in a thick forest west of Brora, in the Highlands. The excited pair tracked it down and were amazed to see the spectacular footage of Scotland from the stratosphere - complete with mountains, fields, cities and the coastline.

The sun is pictured at the top of this image . Barry Fraser, 38, and his son Cameron, . 12, (pictured left and right) designed and built a weather balloon that carried an array of . cameras and devices into the space to capture photos showing the . curvature of Earth . Plans for a multimillion pound ‘space port’ in Britain were announced in November last year. It could be used to launch space tourists and satellites into orbit within five years. Possible locations are being considered in the West Country, Wales and Scotland. The portal, which would cost hundreds of millions of pounds, would be entirely privately funded - but the government would be required to change existing regulations because of the dangers of space travel. Possible locations include a former RAF base in Moray, Scotland. Fraser, from Westercraigs, Inverness, was delighted with the mission's success, which was supported by a recruitment agency called Orion Group, based in the city. ‘Cameron and I can't thank Orion Group enough for their financial support, as it enabled us to film the curvature of earth from the edge of space,’ he said. ‘All the time spent planning the mission, pouring over different prototypes and researching the construction of the payload and balloon was more than worth it.’ Alan Savage, chairman of Orion Group, added: ‘Locally, we have Kinloss airbase in Moray as a strong contender to become the UK's first space port. ‘You never know, in the future we might need to be asked to find engineers working on space travel projects so we thought it would be exciting to get involved. ‘I believe we are also the first recruitment agency in the world to launch into the stratosphere - an accolade the team are very proud of.’ The helium balloon rose above the Earth in just one hour and 48 minutes while taking footage of Scotland (a stock image of Loch Torridon in the Highlands is pictured) before the balloon burst, having expanded too much .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Bad news, Instagramers: The selfie is officially played out thanks to an entrepreneur in San Francisco who has just raised the bar for ego-inflating, self-photography. Behold: The 'dronie' is upon us. Amit Gupta, the founder of the photography accessory store Photojojo, has been experimenting with taking the ultimate aerial self-portraits for months - and it appears he's successfully snapped the first 'dronie.' 'Dronie': Internet entrepreneur Amit Gupta (left) has officially raised the bar for selfies . Gupta and New York Times reporter Nick Bilton (left) took the drone to Bernal Heights Hill in San Francisco to take the world's first 'dronie' Selfie: The queen of selfies, Kim Kardashian, has become somewhat infamous for her shameless use of selfies she shares on social media . Gupta and New York Times technology business columnist Nick Bilton last week took a DJI Phantom drone with a remote controlled camera attached to it to Bernal Heights Hill in San Francisco to attempt the first documented 'dronie.' Apparently, it is tougher than it looks. 'The first thing I learned during my flight lesson is that Mr. Gupta has a . lot more patience than I do,' Bilton wrote in his Times column on Wednesday. 'Instead of starting the drone and just . taking off immediately, we started it, set it on the ground, and waited. Nice view: The drone is able to capture panoramic views from a fairly high altitude - in addition to snapping dronies, of course . 'The . trick with the drones that have GPS built-in is to ensure that it has . activated before flying — in the case of the DJI Phantom drones, a . series of lights under the propellers flash green when it is ready to . go. Once this is done, the drone knows where you are, where it is, and . if it’s windy, it will stay in place rather than float away. If it gets . lost, it will now know where it started its trip and return. 'When . it was finally time to take off I had to tell my inner 12-year-old to . slow down and not attempt to go as far away as I possibly could.' Ultimate dronie: That speck in the middle of the shot is Gupta and Bilton as they take the world's first 'dronie' According to Bilton, once the drone was ready for flight, it hovered in front of the group for about 10 seconds, at which point Gupta told everyone to smile.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This is the moment a family of swans was seen waddling into town on the eve of the World Cup - to pop into their local bookmakers. The cob and pen led their six cygnets on a 500-yard trek from their home on a boating lake to a nearby Betfred. Amazed regulars watched as the birds waddled up the door and started pecking on the glass - as if they were desperate to have a flutter on the competition before the opening game. The cob and pen with six cygnets waddle their way through Perranporth, Cornwall on their trip through town . The parents stand alert as the six cygnets are safely shepherded across the main street when the magic scenes were captured on camera by locals enjoying the fine weather . One of the parents bangs on the door of the bookmaker just hours before the opening match of the World Cup . Before long they gave up and retraced their steps through the centre of Perranporth, Cornwall. Local say the adult swans - nicknamed Lord and Lady Swan - are regularly seen waddling around the pretty seaside resort. Their antics can cause headaches for local motorists because the family have a tendency to walk in the middle of the road rather than using the pavement. Despite their sudden interest in the bookies, the swans' favourite haunt is Floral Fancies, where Lord Swan often tries to follow florist Sharon Grant inside. Ms Grant, who took photos of their latest stroll, said: 'The swans were outside the betting shop at 7am banging on the door to get in. 'It looked like they wanted to go to place a bet on England - it was hilarious . 'Unfortunately they didn't seem to realise that Betfred wasn't even open for another two hours.' After being turned away from the bookmaker, the family of swans continue their journey through the town . According to locals, the parents, dubbed Lord and Lady Swan are regular visitors to the town . Chelsea Johnson, who took some more pictures, added: 'They're a real favourite with everyone in the village and the holidaymakers love them too. 'Lord Swan is quite vain. He is always getting distracted by the sight of his own reflection in cars and shop windows, puffing up his feathers and leaving Lady Swan and the kids to admire himself.' Denise Udry, owner of nearby Duchy Holidays, said: ""The swans are real characters around the village. 'Everyone looks forward to seeing them bring their cygnets round each year, even the holidaymakers who stay with us ask after them. 'They're a real feature of the village in spring.' A Betfred spokesman said: 'They obviously ruffled a few feathers and must have wanted a bet on the World Cup.'","The family of swans enjoyed a 500-yard stroll through the Cornish town .

California firefighters wearing hazmat suits had to climb over vegetation and trash piled 5 feet high to get to a yard where a woman died in a chair amid debris with a kitten resting in a carrier on her lap. First responders arrived Tuesday night at the Santa Ana home of Rita Corpin, 72, who was pronounced dead in her yard. No foul play is suspected. Corpin owned two other properties where animal control officials attempted Wednesday to capture more than 60 feral cats. The retired high school history teacher owned two dogs and fed area cats regularly, Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told OC Register. Her home was so choked with refuse and debris that Corpin could no longer enter it; instead, the retiree lived alone in an old yellow Toyota truck parked in her driveway, Bertagna said. It took firefighters three hours to remove Corpin's body from the property in the 1400 block of South Rosewood Avenue because of the trash and overgrown plants. Scroll down for videos . Overwhelming clutter: Trash and vehicles fill the front yard of a house in Santa Ana, California, where a gardener discover the owner, 72-year-old Rita Corpin, dead in a chair . Horrific living conditions: The home in Santa Ana was so choked with debris that the owner moved into her pickup truck; firefighters in hazmat suits had to make their way through five feet of garbage . Final chapter: Ms Corpin's body is seen being wheeled out on a gurney Tuesday night . The elderly hoarder was discovered at around 10.30pm Tuesday by her gardener after he got a call from a neighbor asking to check up on Corpin because she had stopped feeding cats. Over the past decade, the hoarding and neglect at Corpin's properties prompted 26 contacts by Santa Ana city officials, city spokeswoman Tanya Lyon said. The city levied fines totaling $900 and warned Corpin about her properties' poor condition, but she eventually refused to allow city officials on her properties, Lyon said. By doing some minor cleaning, Ms Corpin prevented the city from seeking a search warrant to perform inspections. A member of the Orange County Task Force on Hoarding's executive committee, Fire Inspector Darren Johnson, said the group had not worked with Corpin. Eyesore: Corpin's neighbors filed multiple complaints with the city about her cluttered yard and the woman had been fined a total of $900 over the years . Menagerie: Officials rescued two pit bulls (left) and 60 feral cats (right) from Rita Corpin's three homes . Hoarder: Corpin had refused to throw anything out, stockpiling wrappers and plastic bags . Green thumb: Corpin's neighbors described her as an expert gardener who knew a lot about different kinds of plants . Out of sight: After getting in trouble with city officials over the mess on her property, the woman cleaned up her yard just enough to create the illusion of tidiness . 'I wish we would have known about this,' Johnson said. 'We probably could have salvaged her.' According to Corpin's brother, David, Rita spent 48 years teaching world history at La Quinta High School where she was known for being eccentric and solitary. ‘She may have had a “pack-rat” problem, but other than that, she was great,’ a devastated David Corpin said. ‘She was a good person, she cared about people and animals.’ At one time, Corpin served on Santa Ana’s Planning Commission and was active in the town’s historical society. A former colleague said things took a turn for the worse when Corpin’s boyfriend died from an apparent heart attack 15 years ago.

Messy enough to see from space: A Google satellite captured Rita Corpin's yard overflowing with garbage . OC Weekly pointed out that Corpin left her teaching job sometime in 2010, retiring with a $120,000 pension, according to the site Transparent California. She owned three homes in Santa Ana, which she used as havens for feral cats. In 2012, Rita Corpin was interviewed by KABC during a communal Thanksgiving dinner held at the Honda Center. Looking disheveled in a knit cap, the woman told a reporter that holidays were tough for her because she was living all alone.","Rita Corpin, 72, was found dead from natural causes sitting in her debris-clogged yard in Santa Ana, California .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Students at a Tucson, Arizona high school were shocked when they opened their yearbooks to find they'd been censored with black tape stuck hastily over students' messages. Administrators undertook the massive, and some say misguided, task of covering up with tape the messages left by ten Sabino High seniors in every yearbook sold to the school of 1,300 students because they were deemed 'racist or unacceptable.' But were they, really? Some schoolboard members are now demanding answers to why innocuous comments like 'Come getcha some,' which merely referenced a reality series on Animal Planet, are among the comments covered with damaging, sticky tape in every single $75 keepsake. Censored: Students at Sabino High School in Tucson, Arizona were shocked when the received their yearbooks and found they'd been censored by administrators using hastily stuck on duct tape . 'We don’t know what the school administration was thinking but this does not seem fair to the seniors of Sabino High School,' boardmember Michael Hicks told the Arizona Daily Independent. People like Hicks are questioning the censoring of seemingly innocuous, if unintelligible messages, such as: . 'Come getcha some –Turtleman.' Too late: By the time administrators taped over the messages and the $75 yearbooks were finally doled out to students, the school year had ended and they were unable to write each goodbye messages . Others were more understandable, though far from shocking in their racial content. 'Every Mexican needs a white best friend,' said one Latina student before her words were obscured. 'They paid $75 for a book and they put tape all over it. Nothing I have read warrants what they have done. I think the district should apologize or give the kids.' The tape could also be damaging to the . yearbooks if removed. And by the time students received the yearbooks, . which were withheld after printing in order for them to be censored, . school as out and they couldn't sign each others' pages. 'The . students got less than what they paid for, and they got it very late and . missed the opportunity for inscriptions that is a big part of what . makes the yearbook meaningful,' complained Mark Stegeman, another . boardmember. Perhaps . most importantly, if the comments in question were deemed . inappropriate, both Stegeman and Hicks agree that administrators should . have dealt with them prior to printing. 'The . principal should have reviewed this before it went to the printer. If . it offends his sensibilities for whatever reason, those reasons should . be articulated to the students, and adults should have talked to them . about their objections beforehand,' said Hicks. Culprits? Administrators said the censored comments were 'racist and unacceptable' but would not elaborate. One Latina student wrote 'Every Mexican needs a white best friend,' and was censored. Less understandable was the boy at right's comment, 'Come getcha some! --Turtle Man,' which is an innocuous reference to the Animal Planet reality series Call of the Wildman .","Administrators at Sabino High in Tucson, Arizona taped over 10 comments in every $75 yearbook sold at the school of 1,300 students .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . President Obama reflected on his own struggles as he delivered the commencement address to the graduating class at Worcester Technical High School in Worcester, Mass., on Wednesday. Saluting graduates as they left the safety of high school behind, the President talked about the obstacles he had had to overcome as a youngster growing up in Hawaii, adding . that his family at times ‘had to scrape to get by.’ He held up the revitalized technical school as a model for the United States in an increasingly competitive global workforce. Scroll down for video .

Obama praised students and teachers alike for giving more than just ‘lip service’ to the idea of skills-based education. He said the graduates were finishing senior year knowing how to run a restaurant, fix a computer or manage a household - skills that he said would let them begin their careers right away. ‘I want the entire nation to learn from Worcester Tech,’ the president said. Sixteen years ago, the Worcester campus was so outdated it was nearly shut down. Obama praised the school's remarkable transformation into a school with a demographic and educational profile that makes it a model of achievement. President Obama holds up a fleece jacket that was give to him a gift from the class of 2014 after delivering the commencement address at Worcester Technical High School in Worcester, Mass., on Wednesday . ‘If it can happen in Worcester, it can happen in any place,’ Obama said. Obama has been putting a spotlight on his education policies this week, drawing attention to efforts to lower student debt. But he also has been eager to showcase programs that break from the traditional classroom format or that are designed to improve the nation's science and technology workforce. The Worcester school stands as an example of a triumph against the odds. Six out of 10 students at the high school are underprivileged and qualify for free or reduced meals; two out of 10 have special needs. Yet, two years ago it was one of five schools nationally to win an award for student growth in high poverty areas. President Barack Obama embraces student Abigaele Mann during the graduation ceremony . Last year, it was one of the Education . Department's 286 national blue ribbon schools. And this year, its . principal was named the Principal of the Year by the National . Association of Secondary School Principals. Reflecting on his own youth, Obama said the support of his teachers, family and community enabled him to finance a good education through grants and student loans. ‘All of this happened because people saw in me something that I didn't always see in myself,’ Obama said during a commencement ceremony whose festive spirit wasn't dampened by rain that sent family members reaching for their umbrellas. The school's rebirth came after this city halfway between Boston and Springfield decided, with the help of state and federal grants, to build a new, $90 million school that opened in 2006. The school has built relationships with businesses and universities, including a partnership with the Tufts School of Veterinary Medicine, that provide students with real-life experiences through internships and cooperative education jobs - an idea that Obama himself has promoted. President Barack Obama carries an umbrella as he steps off Air Force One on Wednesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Obama returned to Washington after visiting Worcester and Weston in Massachusetts . Following his address at the school, . Obama was to attend a fundraiser for the campaign committee working to . elect Democrats to the Senate. Obama drew attention to the hands-on education methods and the private and academic relationships that have given its students experiences from robot-building to veterinary care. ‘Remember that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, invested in our success - somebody invested in us,’ Obama told the 300 graduates, urging them to pay their communities back. Yet even as he decried a culture of conflict, Obama still engaged in his own political tussle, chiding Republicans for defeating a Democratic student loan bill on Wednesday. ‘There are too many politicians in Washington who don't have the right priorities,’ he said. ‘We need to straighten them out.

"By . Becky Barrow . One in seven Britons works from home, official figures revealed yesterday. The first analysis of ‘home workers’ reveals how the number has surged over the past 16 years, jumping by nearly 45 per cent. It found that there are now more than four million people who work from home. The number of home workers has increased by 45 per cent in 16 years, ONS statistics suggest (library image) The study by the Office for National Statistics said the proportion had increased significantly since 1998, when only one in ten people did so – and the number is expected to rise even further when new rules come in this month. Technological advances have driven the rise, allowing employees to keep in touch by email and web entrepreneurs to start businesses from their home computers. But experts said the trend was also being fuelled by a rise in the number of over-65s who need to carry on working but do not want to have to commute. To classify as a home worker, you must ‘usually spend at least half of your work time using your home’. For example, a full-time worker who does one day a week from home would be excluded. Technological advances have driven the rise, allowing employees to keep in touch by email and web entrepreneurs to start businesses from their home computers, the study found . And the number is certain to rise further after new rules come into force making it easier for people to work from home. From June 30, all workers will be able to request the right to work flexibly, which could mean anything from a three-day week to only working during school term time – as well as working from home. At present, the right to work flexibly is restricted to carers and parents. But under the new rules any employee who has been with a company for just six months will be able to ask to work flexibly, with their boss legally bound to agree unless there is ‘a good business reason’. Many home workers are in rural areas, a sign that they opted for it as a lifestyle choice. West Somerset is the home working capital of the UK, where one in four people who have a job work at home. Of the 4.2million home workers, around half are people between the ages of 25 and 49, many being parents with young children. It is also extremely common among the over-65s. Of the people in this age group who have a job, almost four in ten work from home. John Philpott, director of consultants The Jobs Economist, said Britain’s ageing population was fuelling the trend, with more older people needing to work but preferring to do it from home. ‘More older people are seeking to avoid the daily commute and the stresses of office life,’ he said.","ONS study suggests four million people - or 45 per cent - are homeworkers .

"By . Steph Cockroft . With the media storm that's surrounded Vanessa Stiviano over the past few months, it's no wonder she fancied letting her hair down for a night out on the town. So just days after charges were dropped against a man who allegedly assaulted her, V.Stiviano stepped out in another unique outfit, ready to let her hair down in her home town of Los Angeles. The fashionista, who has become renowned for her unusual sense of style, stepped out in a barely-there tight black dress and a gilet with faux-fur fringing - just three days after police appealed for more information about an alleged hate crime against the self-styled philanthropist. V. Stiviano goes out in Los Angeles sporting a barely-there black dress and a faux-fur fringed gilet . The self-styled model completed the look by painting black paw prints down the side of her face, in another sign of her unique style . The model had earlier posted a photo on Instagram which showed . her hand with a Lakers championship ring - sparking rumours she might . have traded sides in the ongoing drama involving Clippers owner Donald Sterling . But instead of sporting her now-trademark visor - an item she has barely been seen without since the row erupted over reviled Clippers owner Donald Sterling - V.Stiviano completed the look with a unique set of paw prints which were painted down the right-side of her face. Just hours earlier, the 31-year-old had posted a photo of her hand on Instagram, which showed her wearing a Los Angeles Lakers championship ring - something not included in her evening outfit. In a move which could be seen as a direct slur on her former lover Mr Sterling, she also praised the late owner of Lakers, Dr. Jerry Buss, calling him a philanthropist and an American hero. Her public appearance came three days after charges were dropped against a man who she claims assaulted her while shouting racial slurs . Clippers - which has an historic rivalry with Lakers - was propelled into the media spotlight after the NBA millionaire owner was allegedly recorded berating V.Stiviano for hanging around with black players. Since then, the model, who was formerly the mistress of Mr Sterling, has hardly been out of the public eye. She has garnered herself a loyal following for her unique sense of style but is also criticised for alleged attention-seeking. The latest set of photos come just days after V. Stiviano's latest scandal, which involved hate-crime charges being brought against Dominick Diorio, who was accused of assaulting her while yelling racial slurs. Charges were dropped against Mr Diorio earlier this year, although the New York Police Department enlisted the public's help in gathering new information about the alleged assault. The renewed effort to acquire new leads in the case comes a week after NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton was quoted as saying 'we would have hoped that she would stay on the West Coast,' noting that at that time she was yet to make a police report of the alleged assault, but had already told her story to the media. Now, however, the NYPD is peppering the the city with flyers asking for witnesses to come forward with information about the alleged assault.

Dominick Diorio, the 40-year-old man accused of attacking V.Stiviano in the alleged racist assault, has denied the charges. Diorio made a brief court appearance last week and was released without bail. He went on to accuse Stiviano of inventing the attack in order to gain publicity or to 'keep her name in the spotlight'. 'Simply put, a credible victim of a crime does not have her attorney call the press before she calls the police,' said Diorio's attorney, David Scott Smith. 'Miss Stiviano seems intent on keeping her name in the spotlight. But I can assure you if this case goes to trial, my cross-examination will last longer than her 15 minutes of fame.'

Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible. Diorio, of Old Bethpage, Long Island, appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court for his arraignment. He was initially changed with assault and a hate crime but these charges were reduced to assault in the hearing. Smith, told The New York Post that he is pleased the hate crime charges have been dropped. 'I’d like to commend the District Attorney’s Office for deciding not to prosecute my client for a hate crime and to consent to his release without bail,' said Smith. 'I’m confident that as this case goes forward and the investigation continues, that Miss Stiviano’s allegations will likewise begin to fail and at the end of the day, the assault charge will be dismissed as well.' Diorio, who was reportedly celebrating his 40th birthday before the alleged run-in with Stiviano, appeared to have a small amount of bruising on his face. He allegedly told investigators he just 'slipped and fell' after a woman threw a phone at him. However, Stiviano offers an alternative explanation for his injuries. She claims he and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse at her during a random attack on Sunday evening. She claims their slurs included the N-word. Watch Video Here: .

Knoefel finally suggested that Zunich stab his wife, she said. Defense attorney Michael Connick said that Zunich was mentally ill and acted alone. He said she was upset because the Knoefels had told her she would need to move out before her high school graduation. Zunich said she reached an agreement to testify against Knoefel in exchange for a sentence of life in prison with the chance for parole in 30 years. Zunich was arrested the night of the slaying.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Number of terminally ill people choosing to die Assisted suicides deaths have soared by 43 per cent in a U.S. state in the last year alone, latest figures revealed yesterday. The number of people who died in Washington state after they ingested lethal drugs climbed dramatically from 116 in 2012 to 159 last year. The 2013 figure is also three times the number who committed assisted suicide in 2009, the first year of the operation of the Death With Dignity Act. Assisted suicide was legalised in Washington state in 2008 and the Act came into force at the beginning of March the following year (pictured is Mount St Helens in Washington state) Ninety-seven per cent of the people who died last year were classed as ‘white non-Hispanic’, about half were married and three quarters of them had at least a college education. More than 90 per cent of those who died had either cancer or a degenerative disease. A total of 61 per cent said they wanted to die because they feared becoming a ‘burden on family, friends or caregivers’. Others said they no longer wanted to live because they were afraid of ‘losing autonomy’ or ‘being less able to engage in activities making life enjoyable’. Just 36 per cent voiced concerns about the ability of doctors to control their pain. Assisted suicide was legalised in Washington in 2008 and the Act came into force at the beginning of March the following year. It applied to people judged to have about six months or less to live and whose decision to end their lives had the support of two doctors. In the first 10 months of 2009, a total of 64 people took their own lives, and in the following years the numbers increased each time, rising from 85 in 2010 to 101 in 2011. Former Labour Minister Lord Falconer (above) has introduced an Assisted Dying Bill into Parliament to legalise assisted suicide . Elspeth Chowdharay-Best, the honorary secretary of Alert, the UK anti-euthanasia group, described the latest surge was ‘absolutely horrifying’. ‘People are wilfully ignoring the evidence of what happens when assisted suicide is legalised,’ she said. ‘Time and again we incremental increases in the numbers of people dying and in some places we see the categories of people who qualify for death widening repeatedly.’ The Washington State Department of Health Death With Dignity Act report comes just weeks after figures from Belgium revealed that doctors there are killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia. The statistics from Brussels also show a huge 27 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia cases in the last year alone in a country which in February became the first in the world to extend euthanasia to children. In Britain, the former Labour Minister Lord Falconer has introduced an Assisted Dying Bill into Parliament to legalise assisted suicide. It will have its Second Reading in the House of Lords on July 18 when peers will have the opportunity to vote on the proposed legislation for the first time.","61% said they wanted to die because they feared becoming a ‘burden'

"By . Louise Cheer . and Lillian Radulova . and Aap . The former cellmate of Tracy Lee Brannigan - who died of a heroin overdose in a Sydney prison - has broken down while giving an account of how she found the convicted drug dealer dead and slumped against a wall. Brannigan died of an overdose while she was confined in a 'high needs' cell at Dillwynia Women's Correctional Centre after she had a 'drug party' with former prisoner Lauren Ironside - one of the women she had a lesbian relationship with in exchange for drugs. It was found the 41-year-old died between the afternoon of February 24, 2013 and the next morning while she was in lockdown for 17 hours where prison officers and inmates had no contact. Tracy Lee Brannigan, 41, was found dead in her prison cell last year, after overdosing on heroin during a 'drug party' in her cell, an inquiry has heard . Lauren Ironside told an inquest into Brannigan's death that she had witnessed her cellmate injecting heroin when the pair shared the high-risk cell for three weeks. Ironside said she even joined in one time. The inquest is looking into whether Corrective Services NSW and Justice Health breached its duty of care by leaving Brannigan unsupervised . It is also looking into whether the long-term addict - who had overdosed at least three times while in custody - was given adequate treatment. Brannigan was moved to the cell after she returned a positive reading for drugs in her system in a 'dirty urine' sample to authorities. On the morning before her death, Ironside told Downing Centre Local Court she saw the Woollongong mother-of-three take three Rivotril pills usually used to treat epilepsy. She said Brannigan was clearly 'off her face' for the entire day even when she returned to the cell for lockdown at 3.30pm. Dillwynia Women's Correctional Centre where Brannigan was being held when she died. The court heard drugs flowed at Dillwynia and were often thrown over the fence inside tennis balls . Ironside also admitted she took two Rivotril pills given to her by Brannigan, but they only made her drowsy and she slept through the afternoon and evening. But Ironside insisted she had not injected any heroin despite the fact it was found in her system the next day. She cried as she told the court that when she awoke about 4am she saw Brannigan slumped against the wall, her head between her legs. 'I tried to give her mouth to mouth, but she was cold and stiff,' Ironside said on Wednesday. An autopsy found fresh track marks on Brannigan's left hand and prison officers discovered syringes concealed in a shampoo bottle inside her cell. The inquiry, held at the Downing Centre Local court, is investigating whether Ms Brannigan was given adequate care and treatment during her time at the Dillwynia Women's Correctional Centre . Women in Prisoner Advocacy Network director Kat Armstrong said Brannigan was 'obviously intoxicated' on an opiate and possibly prescription medication when she visited the afternoon before her death. Ms Armstrong said she begged Brannigan to stop and was so concerned she 'alluded' to two prison officers that the 41-year-old was using. But officers on duty described Brannigan's behaviour as bubbly and responsive. It was also heard Brannigan had repeatedly refused treatment from Justice Health staff since 2010, and quit a methadone program against advice. Tracy Brannigan's mother Sandra Kelly (left) with former cellmate Melissa Edwards (right) who told the court on Tuesday her friend was 'absolutely flying' On Tuesday, family members and friends watched CCTV footage of Brannigan's final custodial visit the day before she died for the first time. Ms Brannigan was seen dressed in white overalls and was closely flanked by two prison officers when she sat down and talked to a friend. As she spoke, she could be seen gesticulating with her hands, grabbing her crotch and swinging on her chair. 'She's stoned,' muttered one family member in court. Former cell mate Melissa Edwards fought back tears as she described her friend as 'absolutely flying'. The court also heard drugs were exchanged at Dillwynia by throwing them over the fence inside tennis balls. Detective Inspector James said he thought Brannigan overdosed by accident. Leanne O'Toole, who was Acting General Manager of Dillwynia at the time of Brannigan's death, said an increase in security at the all-female centre would be draconian and inappropriate. '(But) I would never be able to confidently say I would ever be able to stop every drug coming into that centre,' she said. The inquest continues.","Tracy Lee Brannigan was found dead by a cellmate after their 'drug party'

"By . Tamara Cohen . Repercussions: Researchers believe eating an unhealthy diet can permanently alter the cells of an unborn baby . Pregnant women who gorge on fatty foods may increase the chances of their daughters and even grand-daughters developing breast cancer in later life. Researchers believe eating an unhealthy diet can permanently alter the cells of an unborn baby – and future generations. It suggests eating well in pregnancy could reduce levels of breast cancer, the most common cancer in the UK affecting one in eight women during their lives. Scientists at Georgetown University in Washington DC fed pregnant rats either a normal diet or one much higher in fat. For those on the fatty diet, their daughters and grand-daughters which were fed normally, were found to have a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer tumours. A fatty diet is linked to higher levels of the female sex hormone oestrogen.  Another group of rat on the high fat diet who were also given oestrogen supplements, affected the next three generations. While the findings have not been confirmed in humans, lead author, Dr  Sonia de Assis said: ‘What a mother eats or is exposed to during pregnancy can increase her daughter’s breast cancer risk. ‘What we found for the first time is that increased breast risk of those daughters can be passed down to grand-daughters and even great-grand daughters and that is without any further exposures. ‘This study is important because it may help our understanding of the origins of some breast cancers.’ The  researchers, writing in Nature Communications (KEEP), believe it could explain why breast cancer tends to run in families yet most cases are not genetic - they are not linked to any known mutations. Instead, they believe diet and . chemical exposures in the womb can ‘switch on or off’ certain genes . permanently for generations, a process called epigenetics. Female . rats were mated with males in the same diet group, and the research . suggests a father’s diet can also increase the risk of breast cancer - . but it is transmitted through the mother. All . offspring all appeared normal, but those exposed to high fat diets had . more terminal end buds – structures in the breast tissue linked to . cancer which both rats and humans have. Epigenetics: Scientists believe diet and chemical exposures in the womb can 'switch on or off' certain genes permanently for generations . When exposed to a cancer-causing agent, they developed more tumours than those whose mothers ate healthily. Co-author Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, a professor of oncology, said: ‘The challenge has been to understand how something in foetal development can affect breast cancer risk more than 50 years later. ‘These epigenetic events occur in all cells in the foetus including in germ cells which carry the code for the next generation. ‘Changes in the code may be inherited from generation to generation, so perhaps breast cancer risk is also inherited from generation to generation.’ The NHS recommends pregnant women do not ‘eat for two’ and avoid junk food high in fat, instead going for five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plenty of wholegrain rice, pasta and bread, and protein from lean meat, chicken and fish, eggs and pulses, . Sarah Williams, health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This study was carried out in rats, so we can’t say whether similar effects could be seen in people. But studies like this can give us hints about what’s going on behind the scenes when cancer develops. ‘For now, we don’t know whether a woman’s diet during pregnancy can affect her daughters’ risk of breast cancer, but women can take steps to reduce their risk of the disease by keeping a healthy weight, cutting back on alcohol and having a more active lifestyle.’","Eating an unhealthy diet can 'permanently alter the cells of an unborn baby - and future generations'

"By . Damien Gayle . Arrested: Fugitive Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar . Ablyazov, who was held in France after special forces backed by armoured vehicles . swooped on his rented home . French police special forces called in airpower and armoured vehicles for an operation to seize a wealthy fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted in three countries over a $5billion bank fraud. Mukhtar Ablyazov was held after paramilitary police swooped on a rental home in the town of Mouans Sartoux, near Nice in south-east France, said Solange Legras, chief prosecutor at an appeals court in Aix-en-Provence. The police used 'powerful means'  - . including armoured vehicles and a plane - because Ablyazov was known to . have a 'private militia' at his disposal, said Ms Legras, whose office . focuses on international cases. In the event, no shots were fired during the operation. The 50-year-old is wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan over a string of allegations of fraud and organised crime. He disappeared from the UK in February 2012 just before a British court sentenced him to 22-months in jail for contempt of court in a financial fraud trial. He was subsequently stripped of assets worth more than £150million in British assets, including an £18million mansion in one of London's most exclusive streets. Ablyazov, who has been wanted by Interpol since 2009, was held on allegations of 'large-scale fraud in an organised group', Ms Legras said by phone, shortly after meeting with Ablyazov to explain the possible extradition process. A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the energy-rich Central Asian nation since before the Soviet collapse. Shortly after setting up a pro-reform party in 2001, Ablyazov was sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of public office. However, he was pardoned by Mr Nazarbayev and released in 2003, vowing to stay out of politics - a promise he broke by funnelling money to the opposition. Kazakhstan's prosecutors have . described Ablyazov as the head of an extremist, criminal conspiracy bent . on 'seizing power by inciting civil strife and hatred.' He is wanted . there on charges of siphoning off at least $5billion from BTA Bank, . which based in the central Asian country's business capital, Almaty. The . prosecutor in Astana, the Kazakh capital, said Interpol had informed . the government of Ablyazov's arrest, which was carried out at the . request of Ukraine, where he is wanted on charges of alleged . embezzlement of funds from a local branch of the BTA bank. He is also . sought by Russia in connection with embezzlement charges involving BTA . bank and a Russian company. Dissident: A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country since before the Soviet collapse . There was no extradition request from the UK, where Ablyazov was in February 2012 convicted of contempt of court after attempting to hide the extent of his wealth from a legal action taken by the now state-owned BTA bank in the hope of recovering some of the allegedly embezzled funds. Mr Justice Teare, sitting in the High Court, said Ablyazov was accused of 'fraud on an epic scale' and had committed 'deliberate and substantial' contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation concluded. The conviction was upheld at the Court of Appeal last November, where senior judge Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov had shown 'rare cynicism and deviousness' as he fought the claims against him and ordered him stripped of assets worth more than £150million. Mr Ablyazov’s property portfolio in Britain is alone worth more than £63million. His Bishops Avenue property — Carlton House — is worth £17million and is in a street nicknamed Billionaires' Row. The mansion has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, and is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts. He also has a £1m apartment in Albert Court, closet to Lord's cricket ground; and Oaklands Park - a 100-acre estate on the edge of Windsor Great Park with tennis courts and helicopter pad. In a statement on his Facebook page, . Madiyar Ablyazov, the former banker's son, said he feared what would . happen if his father were deported to Kazakhstan. 'We . beg the French authorities not to grant Kazakhstan our father. He is a . man of honour, who has been fighting all his life, and sacrificed so . much, for freedom and democracy in Kazakhstan,' the younger Ablyazov . wrote. 'We are afraid for his life.' Taken: Ablyazov's mansion in Hampstead, which has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts . Ablyazov's arrest came after the deportation of his wife and young daughter from Italy to Kazakhstan caused a political crisis in Rome last month. Because France has no extradition agreement with Kazakhstan, Ms Legras, the Aix-en-Provence prosecutor, said she is focusing on the extradition request from Ukraine for now. Under the extradition process, the requesting country has 40 days to send its legal dossier to French authorities. Once that is received, French prosecutors will have five days to present Ablyazov to investigating magistrates. 'In my opinion, this isn't going to happen before the autumn,' she said. The managing director of BTA Bank today told MailOnline the company welcomed Ablyazov's arrest. Pavel Prosyankin said: 'This arrest is a result of the Bank’s diligent efforts through the British justice system to recover the billions of dollars he stole while Chairman. 'We have sought his arrest to prevent him from further dissipating assets which the English High Court ordered to be put in receivership. 'He has flouted many court orders and fled the UK after we secured another High Court judgment sentencing him to prison in England. 'He is now in custody and we are optimistic that we will be better positioned to recover more of the assets which the court has authorised us to seize.' Ablyazov denies wrongdoing and says the allegations are politically motivated.","Mukhtar Ablyazov was held after paramilitary police yesterday swooped on his rented home in the south of France .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The secret to giving a daughter lots of ambition might be to simply do more housework. That's according to a study that claims fathers who help with household chores are more likely to raise daughters who aspire to less traditional, and potentially higher paying, careers. The researchers suggest how parents share dishes, laundry and other domestic duties plays a key role in shaping the gender attitudes and aspirations of their children, especially daughters. Scroll down for video explanation . A new study suggests that fathers doing housework could inspire their children, particularly daughters, to be more ambitious. The researchers claim that simply doing more housework will encourage them to pursue less traditional career paths . While mothers' gender and work equality beliefs were key factors in predicting a child's attitude toward gender, the strongest predictor of a daughters' own professional ambitions was their fathers' approach to household chores. Although researchers do not agree on a specific definition, previous studies have found four defining properties of being 'cool'. The . first, according to a recent study by researchers in Chicago, is that coolness is socially constructed . and is not an inherent feature of an object or person meaning objects . and people are cool only to the extent that others consider them cool. Secondly, coolness is subjective and dynamic and change over time, and thirdly, coolness is perceived to be a positive quality. Finally, research found coolness requires more than the mere perception that something is positive or desirable. In conclusion, researchers said 'coolness is a subjective, positive trait perceived in people, brands, . products, and trends that are autonomous in an appropriate way.' 'This suggests girls grow up with broader career goals in households where domestic duties are shared more equitably by parents,' said lead author Alyssa Croft, a PhD Candidate in the University of British Columbia's Department of Psychology. 'How fathers treat their domestic duties appears to play a unique gatekeeper role.' The study, which took place at the University of British Columbia's Living Laboratory in Science World in Vancouver and appears in Psychological Science, suggests parents' domestic actions may speak louder than words. Even when fathers publicly endorsed gender equality, if they retained a traditional division of labour at home, their daughters were more likely to envision themselves in traditionally female-dominant jobs such as a nurse, teacher, librarian or stay-at-home-mum. 'Despite our best efforts to create workplace equality, women remain severely under-represented in leadership and management positions,' said Croft. 'This study is important because it suggests that achieving gender equality at home may be one way to inspire young women to set their sights on careers from which they have traditionally been excluded.' According to the study, even when fathers publicly endorsed gender equality, if they retained a traditional division of labour at home, their daughters were more likely to envision themselves in traditionally female-dominant jobs such as a nurse, teacher, librarian or stay-at-home-mum . The study involved 326 children aged seven to 13, and at least one of their parents. For each household, researchers calculated the division of chores and paid labour. They also determined the career stereotypes that participants identified with, their gender and work attitudes and children's career aspirations. The study found mothers shouldered more of the burden of housework than men, which echoes previous findings. Parents and children associated women, more than men, with childcare and domestic work, and girls were significantly more likely than boys to say they want to be like adults who take care of kids rather than someone who has a career, the study claims. '""Talking the talk"" about equality is important, but our findings suggest that it is crucial that dads ""walk the walk"" as well - because their daughters clearly are watching,' continued Croft, noting that girls might be learning from an early age to take on additional roles, rather than different roles, compared to boys.","Doing more chores may be the key to bolstering daughters' ambition .

"By . David Gardner . Updated: . 05:04 EST, 7 October 2011 . Michael Jackson had a child-sized porcelain doll in bed with him on the day he died, it emerged today in the trial of the star's personal doctor. The doll, with rouged cheeks and blonde curly hair and dressed in green dungarees, was discovered on top of the covers after the King of Pop collapsed in the bedroom of his Los Angeles mansion. A photo of the toy lying next to a CD player was shown to the jury in the Conrad Murray trial. It was taken by coroner's officers who searched the house hours after Jackson died on June 25 2009. Scroll down for audio of Jackson slurring . Bizarre: Jurors in the Conrad Murray trial were show this picture of a life-sized baby doll which was found on Jackson's deathbed . Photos of the doll and drugs with Jackson were seen during testimony from Los Angeles County coroner investigator Elissa Fleak, seen here on Thursday . The court also saw a police photograph . of ornate dinner plates with babies faces - thought to be Jackson's . children - displayed on a chest of drawers along with family snaps of . Prince, Paris and Blanket. Jurors also saw plates with babies' faces on them, believed to be Jackson's children, in the room where he died . The unprecedented glimpse into the singer's bedroom came during testimony by coroner's investigator Elissa Fleak. A photo was also shown of Jackson's black bomber jacket and a pair of trousers left on the floor of the en suite bathroom. Later on Thursday toxicologist Dan Anderson told the court that Jackson had six different drugs in his system when he died. They included Propofol and another milder anaesthetic, lidocaine, sedatives Ativan, Versed and Valium as well as a small trace of ephedrine, a drug used to treat hypertension. The drugs showed positive in tests in Jackson's blood, liver, urine and stomach contents. Michael Jackson's private suffering was revealed in the Conrad Murray trial on Wednesday as jurors were shown the incredible array of drugs stashed at the singer's home and listened to audio of his slurred voice explaining how he felt the pain of abandoned children because he never had a childhood himself. The quantity of drugs, displayed by the Deputy District Attorney, David Walgren, was almost as shocking as the eerie recording from beyond the grave, in which the King of Pop told how important it was to him that his planned comeback concerts at London's O2 Arena were a triumph. 'Elvis didn't do it. Beatles didn't do it. We have to be phenomenal. When people leave the show, when people leave my show, I want them to say, ""I've never seen nothing like this in my life"",' he said. He said he wanted his fans to hail him as 'the greatest entertainer in the world.' The shocking amount of drugs found in the King of Pop's home, presented to the jury by the prosecution . On trial: Dr. Conrad Murray, seen here in court on Wednesday, recorded Jackson rambling about his life and career using an iPhone weeks before the singer's death . The recording was made by Jackson's personal doctor, Conrad Murray, on his iPhone using an iTalk application and prosecutors claim it was taped while the star was under the influence of the hospital anaesthetic Propofol. 'My performances will be up there helping my children. I love them I love them because I didn't have a childhood. I had no childhood. 'I feel their pain. I feel their hurt. I can deal with it,' Jackson said in a slow, faltering tone much different to the star's famously high voice. 'Heal the World, We Are the World, Will You Be There, The Lost Children. These are the songs I have written because I hurt, you know, I hurt,' he added. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren holds a bottle of propofol, found by Los Angeles County coroner investigator Elissa Fleak during her testimony at Dr Conrad Murray's trial in pop star Michael Jackson's death in Los Angeles . A bottle of propofol lies under a side table found in Jackson's bedroom in this photo projected on a screen and entered as evidence (left), and a close-up of the bottle . FOR HIS CHILDREN: In the recordings Jackson says he loves his kids, pictured here this week, as he did not have a childhood and that he wants to be remembered as the greatest entertainer of all time . The recording was played during the . testimony of Drug Enforcement Agency forensic computer expert Stephen . Marx, who analysed data on Murray's iPhone. It was recorded on May 10, . 2009 - just six weeks before Jackson's death. Jackson told how he planned to take the millions he would make with his 'This Is It' tour to build the 'biggest children's hospital in the world' with a game room and a move theatre. Prosecutors claim Murray taped Jackson after sedating him with Propofol, but defense lawyers claim it would have put him to sleep immediately and he'd been given a milder sedative . 'Children are depressed in those hospitals because there is no game room, no movie theatre. They're sick because they're depressed. 'Their mind is depressing them. I care about them, them angels. God wants me to do it. I'm going to do it, Conrad,' he adds. The lights were dimmed in the courtroom while the recording - a snippet of which was heard during the prosecution's opening statement - was played in full. 'Don't have enough hope, no more hope,' he said. 'That's the real generation that's going to save our planet, starting with, we'll talk about it - United States, Europe, Prague. 'My babies. They walk around with no mother. They drop them off, they leave - a psychological degradation of that. They reach out to me - please take me with you. 'I want to do it for them. That will be remembered more than my performances. My performances will be up there helping my children and always be my dream.' Asked by Murray if he was okay, Jackson says: 'I am asleep.' Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to causing Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, by administering him with a fatal dose of powerful Propofol, which is only supposed to be used in a hospital setting. If he is convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could be jailed for up to four years. Prosecutors claim Murray taped Jackson's voice after sedating him with Propofol to help him sleep, but defense lawyers claim the drug would have put the star to sleep immediately and say the doctor had given him a milder sedative. Later on Wednesday coroner's investigator Fleak told the court how she discovered bottles of Propofol - the powerful anaesthetic that killed Michael Jackson - hidden away in bags she found in a cupboard in the star's bedroom. She also found an empty vial of the drug on the floor by the bed and an array of different sedatives and prescription painkillers in medicine bottles bearing the name of the star and an alias he is know to have used. The drugs were found in two searches of the singer's Los Angeles mansion within days of the tragedy. Miss Fleak, who works for the Los Angeles County Coroner, said she examined Jackson's body after he was taken to hospital to see if she could determine any obvious cause of death. She took a number of photos of the star - including one shown on the opening day of the trial - but said she was unable to see what caused Jackson's collapse. She testified that she also found medical equipment, including oxygen bottles, IV containers, syringes and a jug or urine in Jackson's bedroom. The case continues.","Toxicologist: Jackson had six drugs in his system when he died .

"By . Paul Bentley . Whistleblower: David Ore said that hospital security guards were told to lock up elderly patients and children for up to 12 hours with no food or drink . Police are investigating claims that unreasonable force is being used to restrain vulnerable patients on NHS wards, it emerged last night. The allegations surfaced after whistleblower David Ore told the Mail that hospital security guards were ordered to lock up elderly patients and children for up to 12 hours with no food or drink. Now more claims have arisen, prompting a criminal investigation into the actions of staff at Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, which runs three hospitals. Mr Ore, a security manager at the trust, learned last week that he has lost his job – despite repeated assurances from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that whistleblowers will be protected at all costs. Last night, Mr Ore said he feared he had been blacklisted and could no longer work in the NHS. He added: ‘I have no faith that whistleblowers will be protected. The investigation against me can only be described as a witch hunt. ‘I doubt very much the culture of NHS trusts will ever be radically changed so those willing to stand up and be counted when things are wrong will be better protected. ‘If staff who raise concerns will not be penalised, why am I looking for another job?’ Mr Ore, 58, worked at the failing Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, the largest Dudley Group hospital. He claimed elderly patients and young children were locked up simply for complaining. Almost every day, guards were told to hold patients on the floor, force them into rooms and hold the doors shut, trapping them for up to 12 hours with no food or drink, he said. Pensioners were restrained in this way simply for wanting to walk around a ward, he claimed. In May 2011, guards said they refused orders to restrain a child. They feared it would be illegal because the young patient posed no risk. The following year, a girl of 14 who was in care and alone was allegedly illegally detained. Guards said that although she was deeply upset, she was not violent. She was allegedly held against her will for 72 hours. Mr Ore repeatedly raised his concerns with bosses from 2010, saying he felt hospital practices breached human rights. He said patients had been restrained with no proper checks on the risk they posed, while  elderly people were held for up to 12 hours as often as 80 times in 12 weeks. In November 2012, Mr Ore was suspended, then sacked five months later. He won an appeal but was ordered out again on ‘special leave’ in January. Bosses wrote to say this was because speaking out about the ‘alleged illegal restraint of patients’ put him in ‘a very difficult position’. The Care Quality Commission watchdog started a probe of the abuse claims this year. 'Witch hunt': Mr Ore, 58, worked at the failing Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, the largest Dudley Group hospital. He claimed elderly patients and young children were locked up simply for complaining . But despite Mr Ore’s actions, patients continue to complain of being violently manhandled. West . Midlands police began an investigation in April 2013. Some of the . historic allegations were dismissed this month, but two new incidents . from the past few months form part of an ongoing criminal investigation. David Cameron, Prime Minister . April 2013: ‘We should support whistleblowers and what they do to help improve the provision of public services.’ Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary . March 2013: ‘The era of gagging NHS staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end. Mid Staffs happened because there was a culture of covering up problems.’ Sir David Nicholson, NHS chief executive . July 2013: ‘Everyone who works for the NHS has a right to be supported in raising issues.’ December 2013: ‘Managers should begin with a presumption of truth about whistleblowing.’ Detective . chief inspector Jenny Skyrme said: ‘A further investigation continues . in relation to two separate complaints made against staff at the . hospital using unnecessary force.’ Mr Ore was made redundant last week ahead of an employment tribunal. The . hospital, which was also being investigated over high death rates, is . believed to have spent more than £100,000 of  taxpayers’ money on the . case. Mr Ore, who previously . worked as a policeman, says his sacking ‘has everything to do with . whistleblowing’. He added: ‘If you speak out, you end up with nothing or . are made to feel so uncomfortable and marginalised you have to leave.’ The Health Secretary has said a culture of ‘openness and  transparency’ must be created to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly. He banned the use of  gagging clauses, which stop staff raising their concerns openly. Mr Hunt has also made urgent changes to the NHS constitution as a result of the Mail’s coverage of whistleblower suppression. He enshrined the ‘right’ for staff to raise care concerns and set up a patient safety helpline. Jeremy Hunt has given repeated reassurances that whistleblowers will be protected . A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘NHS staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out in the interests of patient safety must be protected and listened to.’ The Dudley Group denies Mr Ore’s claims, insisting he was accused of gross misconduct for ‘aggressive behaviour’ and parking in the wrong hospital bays. Chief executive Paula Clark said the police probe relates to new allegations. She said: ‘Cases raised by David Ore have been closed as unfounded. Two more recent complaints of unnecessary force are being reviewed as a precaution. David Ore was not removed for blowing the whistle.’","David Ore claimed Dudley hospital was locking up patients for 12 hours .

"By . James Rush . Guantanamo Bay inmates are being given reclining chairs and video games as they are force fed after military officials brought in changes to the heavily criticised practice, condemned as torture by the UN. Some of the long-term hunger strikers are now reportedly being given hundreds of films and video games to choose from and a comfy chair to sit in while they are tube fed at the detention centre, Vice News has reported. Military officials have claimed the new procedures can help detainees 'improve their eating habits and thus their overall health', but critics have described force-feeding as torturous and said 'a comfy chair doesn't change that.' 'Compliant' inmates on hunger strikes at Guantanamo Bay are being given comfy chairs and video games to play while being force fed, rather than the restraint chair . The changes were brought in by the military to improve the practice of force-feeding after the UN described it as torture (pictured, some Playstation 3 games the inmates can chose from) The new procedures were reportedly brought in by officials in October at the same time as hunger strikes were rebranded as 'long-term non-religious fasts'. According to the report, inmates are given films including Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland to watch and video games such as Portal 2 to play while being force fed. The new policy only applies to detainees who are 'compliant' while being force-fed, Vice News reported after obtaining declarations in a lawsuit filed by a detainee challenging the methods used to force-feed him as abusive. Detainees who are force-fed and are . not considered to be compliant are forced to sit in a restraint chair during . the procedure, which has been described as a 'painful, degrading and . humiliating process' by a federal court judge. Zeke . Johnson, director of Amnesty International USA's work on national . security and counterterrorism, said: 'Force feeding can amount to cruel . treatment and even torture. A comfy chair doesn't change that. 'The administration should immediately stop force feeding mentally competent detainees on hunger strike. Among films detainees can chose from are Time Burton's Alice in Wonderland and games such as Portal 2 . Military officials have said the new procedures at Guantanamo Bay can help detainees 'improve their eating habits and thus their overall health', but critics have described force-feeding as torturous and said 'a comfy chair doesn't change that' (file picture) 'There should be a detailed review of all policies implemented in response to the hunger strike, including force-feeding, and the administration must ensure that it complies with international human rights law and medical ethics.' The United Nations has described the practice of force feeding as a form of torture, while President Barack Obama also previously condemned it, saying in his national security address: ‘Is this who we are? Is this something that our Founders foresaw?’ Three doctors writing last . year in the New England Journal of Medicine meanwhile called Guantanamo a . ‘medical ethics-free zone’ and urged doctors there to speak out. ‘Force-feeding a competent person is not the practice of medicine; it is . aggravated assault,’ they said. Detainees who are force fed and are not deemed to be compliant are forced to sit in a restraint chair during the procedure, which has been described as a 'painful, degrading and humiliating process' by a federal court judge . In April last year, the American Medical Association said force-feeding detainees violated the profession’s ‘core ethical values’. US Marine General John Kelly, who oversees Guantanamo, sparked criticism when he denied detainees were being force-fed, calling it ‘Hunger Strike Lite’. Last month it was reported that a federal . judge had lifted a temporary restraining order that had stopped the . U.S. military from force feeding a hunger-striking prisoner at . Guantanamo Bay naval base, saying the man's life hangs in the balance. Portal 2 is one of the computer games detainees at Guantanamo Bay are being given to play while being force fed . U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said the military must be allowed to carry out force feeding in the case of Abu Wa'el Dhiab because of the 'very real probability that Mr. Dhiab will die.' Dhiab was rapidly deteriorating and she would not reissue a temporary order from the previous week that stopped the military from force-feeding him. Lawyers for Dhiab are challenging force feeding during the hunger strike as abusive. Dhiab's lawyers have argued that the practice of forcibly extracting him and other prisoners from their cells, restraining them and feeding them through a tube inserted into their noses, was also illegal. The Defense Department has said the military only feeds prisoners against their will to keep them alive, and follows all laws when it does so. Kessler says the detainee is willing to be fed at a hospital at Guantanamo Bay if he can be spared what the judge calls the agony of having feeding tubes inserted and removed for each feeding. The judge said the Defense Department refused to make any compromise from current procedure. On Wednesday, May 21, the judge brushed aside the Justice Department's objections and ordered the government to produce 34 videotapes that show Dhiab being forcibly removed from his cell, followed by force feeding the hunger-striking prisoner. Earlier that week, Kessler said she urged . the government and Dhiab's lawyers to reach a compromise on the . procedure used to feed Dhiab, but that the Defense Department has . 'refused to make these compromises.' According to the report, inmates are given films including Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland to watch and video games such as Portal 2 to play while being force fed . In her order on Thursday, May 22, she said the court will move quickly in the case to consider the merits. Kessler issued the temporary restraining order a week earlier. 'The court is now faced with an anguishing Hobson's choice,' Kessler said, in lifting the temporary restraining order. If she issues another temporary order to stop the forced feeding, Dhiab probably will die, the judge said. Alternatively, allowing the force feeding possibly will result in great pain and suffering, she added.","'Compliant' detainees on hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay given reclining chair and films to watch while being force-fed .

"By . Julian Robinson . An extremist friend of the man who hacked soldier Lee Rigby to death with a meat cleaver has been jailed for three years - after calling for holy war against Britain. Ibrahim Hassan, 28, and his co-accused Shah Hussain, 31, published hate-filled speeches online two days after Fusilier Rigby was killed by Michael Adebolajo on May 22 last year. British Muslim Hassan, also known as Abu Nusaybah, was arrested moments after filming an interview with BBC Newsnight claiming to be a friend of Adebolajo. An extremist friend of Michael Adebolajo, Ibrahim Hassan, pictured left, and his co-accused Shah Hussain, right, have both been jailed for three years for calling for holy war against Britain and America . Michael Adebolajo shows a bloodied hand and knives following the murder of soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich in May last year . On the show he claimed Adebolajo had been tortured in Kenya, and had been offered a job by MI5.Hussain was arrested days later as part of the same investigation. Both men have previous convictions for encouraging terrorism at a 2008 rally, and are heavily linked to Adebolajo through banned terror extremist group, al-Muhajiroun. Judge Nicholas Hilliard, the Common Sergeant of London, told them: 'This is the second time that each of you has been before a court for an offence contrary to the Terrorism Act. That increases the gravity of the offences and I am sure both of you knew that you were playing with fire. 'Only time will tell whether your beliefs have really changed.' Both men showed no reaction as they walked down to the cells. Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said: 'Police became aware that Hassan was providing a pre-recorded interview to BBC Newsnight on Friday, 24 May and they duly attended and arrested him. 'The . interview shows him endeavouring to mitigate for the actions of Michael . Adebolajo, the murderer of Lee Rigby, due to his having been tortured in . Kenya six months before and allegedly harassed by the secret services. 'However . Hassan also makes it plain that if he had known of the planned attack . he would have sought to dissuade Adebolajo from it, and that he was . horrified by it.' Drummer Lee Rigby, pictured, of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was attacked and killed by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. Now extremist friends of Adebolajo have been jailed for calling for a holy war against Britain . The two men met in 2004 at meetings of the banned fundamentalist terror group founded by hate preachers Omar Bakri Muhammed and Anjem Choudary. In 2008, they were each jailed for two years after being filmed encouraging terrorism at a rally outside the Regents Park Mosque. In his speech, Hassan said: 'My dear Muslim brothers, I urge you right now, Sheikh Osama Bin Laden has already told us that these kafirs will never be pleased with us. 'We should be preparing, all of you should be training for jihad.' He threatened to kill Tony Blair and called him a 'coward'. 'By Allah, myself I'll go for Tony Blair when his cover is broken,' he said. 'Tony Blair is the enemy to me. By Allah if I get the opportunity I will assassinate, put him in a grave. 'Tony Blair's a pig, he's a kafir, he's a kafir. George Bush the same message to him. 'I'll cut your neck off.' Hussain said in his speech that he would 'slaughter' George Bush if he were to see him and had a knife. Both admitted disseminating a terrorist publication relating to an audio file of a speech by the deceased radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki which called for the execution of anyone who insulted the prophet Mohammed. Michael Adebolajo, left, was given a whole-life jail term after murdering Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year while  Michael Adebowale, right, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 45 years . Hassan also admitted encouraging terrorism related to video lectures entitled In Pursuit of Allah's Governance on the Earth. Hussain admitted encouraging terrorism in a video lecture entitled 'Signs of a Good Death in Islam'. One of the signs he mentioned was 'death on the battlefield' by fighting against British and American forces to earn martyrdom and a place in paradise. Others included death by plague, fire, pleurisy, drowning, abdominal illness and under a collapsed building. Hussain ran a website hosting his own lectures, links to videos features preachers including Abu Hamza, Abu Qatada, and Khalid al-Husainan, and a text called 'Reality of the Rulers' by Abu Zubair Adil al-Adab. He also hosted a video of a speech given by Khalid al-Husainan and a text called 'Reality of the Rulers' written by Abu Zubair Adil al-Adab. The court heard Hassan came to the UK from Somalia in 1995 with his sister and converted to Islam in around 2004. He has two children with one partner and two-step children with another. Pall bearers carry the coffin of Lee Rigby into Bury Parish Church for an overnight vigil following his brutal murder. Now extremist friends of one of his killers have been jailed for calling for holy war against Britain . Mozammel Hossain, representing Hassan, said Hassan had left Al-Muhajiroun in 2010 and had made the 'utterly stupid' lectures to please his audience of former colleagues. Hassan wrote a letter claiming he did not excuse or condone the Lee Rigby murder and was 'shocked' by Adebolajo's actions. Lawrence McNulty, for Hussain, said that his client had also left Al Muhajiroun before it was proscribed by the Government and had changed his views. Hussain, of Cannon Street Road, Whitechapel, east London, and Abdullah-Hassan, of Carr Road, Walthamstow, east London, both admitted disseminating terrorist material and encouraging or inciting terrorism on or before May 24 last year. Hussain was jailed for three years concurrent on each count while Hussain was jailed for three years for dissemination and 28 months concurrent for encouraging terrorism. Michael Adebolajo, 29, was found guilty of murdering Fusilier Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks and is currently serving a whole-life sentence. Michael Adebowale, 22, is serving a life sentence for the murder, with a minimum term of 45 years.","Irbahim Hassan and Shah Hussain jailed for three years over hate speeches .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A six-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother have been abandoned at a kindergarten centre in China after their parents said they cannot afford to take them home. Lin and her brother Yan were left at the playgroup in Luoyang city, Henan province by mother He Tuan, 32, and father He Liu, 37, with enough money for two weeks of teaching and board. But two months later the couple have not been back to collect the children, and police say they are powerless to act after the parents disappeared recently. Lin, six (right) and her brother Yan, three (left), have been abandoned by their parents at a kindergarten centre in Henan province, China, for the last two months . Workers at the centre say mother He Tuan, 32, and father He Liu, 37, dropped the children off with enough money for two weeks teaching and board, but have not been back since . Repeated calls to the parents have produced no results, with authorities saying the duo always come up with a reason why they cannot take their children back. A police spokesman added: 'They say they cannot afford to take them back.' In the meantime staff at the kindergarten group are taking it in turns to look after the children at their homes at the weekends, a leaving them at the centre during the week. Lee Zhang, the owner and operator of the nursery, said: 'The two parents owe the kindergarten thousands. I don’t anticipate they will pay it back, I just hope that they can take their kids home.' Police have spoken to the parents, but they say they are too poor to take the children back and officers say they are powerless to act . Nursery workers have been taking it in turns to let the children stay at their houses on the weekends when the centre is closed, but leaving them there during the week . One day Zhang bumped into the two parents in the street and asked them . to take their children home. The parents promised that they would go to . pick them up that day -  but disappeared again. Zhang . reported the case to police. According to police’s investigation, the . two parents once sent their daughter to a kindergarten and owed that . kindergarten about 2,000 RMB (£190). The two parents live in a rented . flat and are known to be behind with the rent. Under China's draconian one-child policy parents must pay for their children's schooling if they have more than one baby, which can amount to many times the average salary . 'We have . great financial problems,' the mother told Zhang. 'We do not intend to abandon . our children forever, but we cannot afford to look after them by . ourselves now. 'They are in  the best place. I promise we will pay all . the debts in the future.'

"A Virgin Australia plane flew 13 times with structural damage after a turbulence event on approach to Sydney, a preliminary report has found. An initial investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) found damage 'consistent with an overstress condition' was likely to have occurred on February 20. While the 68 passenger ATR72 turbo-prop was initially removed from service and an inspection carried out, it was back in the air the next day. A report has found a Virgin Australia plane flew 13 times with structural damage after the aircraft suffered during turbulence . It was not until five days later, following a suspected bird strike as the plane descended into Albury, that the damage linked to the February 20 event was discovered. In the five-day period, the plane had already flown 13 more times. According to the ATSB report, it was about 4.40pm on February 20 when, as the aircraft made its approach to Sydney at an altitude of 8500 feet, that 'the crew noticed the air speed going up quickly and the speed trend excessively high'. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch-control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the nose to control the speed. But the captain was unsure if the first officer's control inputs were sufficient to avoid an 'overspeed' and put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further. The aircraft was approaching Sydney in February when the damage was suffered . 'The captain believed he indicated his intention to take over control, and while the first officer could not recall it being verbalised, he was aware of the captain's actions,' the report says. 'The first officer recalled that he took his hands off the controls, releasing touch-control steering in the process. Shortly after, concerned about a high nose-up attitude, the first officer put his hands back on the controls. To both crew members, what happened next was unexpected and unclear.' 'Suddenly, the crew felt high positive (G-force), the controls felt different and spongy, and cockpit warnings activated.' 'At some point, the cabin crew called the cockpit and advised that the senior cabin crew member had injured her leg and that it might be broken.' The inspection on February 25 'found broken carbon plies, cracked joint sealant, and deformation in and around the area where the horizontal stabiliser attaches to the vertical stabiliser'. 'There was also some minor damage to the rudder,' the report says. The ATSB says its initial examination showed that 'differential force on the control column that resulted from the captain and first officer applying an opposing force exceeded the differential force required to generate a pitch disconnect'. 'Each pilot was then controlling the elevator on their side of the aircraft in opposite directions for a brief period before the first officer released his control column.' The ATSB investigation is ongoing. In a brief statement, Virgin Australia said the safety of guests, crew and aircraft was its No.1 priority. 'While this is an isolated issue, we are working with the ATSB, the aircraft manufacturer and our maintenance provider to identify what has occurred,' the airline said.","A Virgin Australia plane flew 13 times with structural damage .

"By . Richard Spillett . Contestants on MasterChef can expect a change of tone after 'gentleman' judge Michel Roux Jr was replaced by Marcus Wareing. Michelin-starred chef Wareing has been announced as the successor to Roux Jr on BBC2 series MasterChef: The Professionals. He has a reputation as a difficult man to please, causing one Great British Menu contestant to swear and quit after he was given two out of ten for a fish dish, and leading another would-be chef to cry during a previous guest appearance on Masterchef. Marcus Wareing is to become a judge on BBC2 cooking show MasterChef: The Professionals . Wareing cut his teeth cooking alongside Gordon Ramsay and the rambunctious pair almost came to blows on several occasions. Wareing once said: 'I never did hit him. He was always a big, strong lad. If you did throw a punch at Gordon, you’d have to be sure to knock him out – otherwise he’d come back and swallow you. 'One time, about six months before he and I finished, he came into the kitchen on a Saturday night. We had a conversation. Things got so heavy that we had to go outside.' Roux Jr stepped down earlier this year as a result of a dispute with the BBC about his endorsement of a brand of potatoes. It is thought Wareing will have a different attitude towards hopefuls than outgoing judge Michel Roux Jr . Dale Williams - who was brought to tears when Wareing said he needed a fire extinguisher after eating his food on the amateur version of the show - said the two men had very different styles. He told the Telegraph: 'Everybody who ever met Michel Roux Jnr talked about him being the nicest gentleman they ever met. [The BBC] are probably looking to shake it up a bit.' Wareing - who has two Michelin stars and is currently Chef Patron of a restaurant in Knightsbridge, west London - joins Monica Galetti and Gregg Wallace on the judging panel for the seventh series which returns in the autumn. He said: 'I have been watching MasterChef since I was a young kid at catering college and in more recent years I have enjoyed an established relationship with the programme. 'To now become part of the show is hugely exciting for me; to be asked is a true honour. Michel has left big shoes to fill and I am delighted to be working with Monica and Gregg on a new journey of discovery to find the next generation of Michelin-starred chefs.' Wareing began his career at 18 working at The Savoy and went on to be awarded his first star seven years later. Karen Ross, the creative director of the production company behind the show Shine Soho, said: 'We are delighted that he is taking up the baton of judge with us - his experience of coming from humble beginnings in the North of England and making his way into the country's best kitchens, to then rise to be awarded two Michelin stars is extremely inspiring and will speak to the young chefs who hope to follow in his footsteps.' A MasterChef spokesperson added: 'Avid viewers of MasterChef will have seen Marcus appear previously and he is fair, honest and insightful. 'MasterChef: The Professionals is about empowering and encouraging the next generation of Michelin-starred chefs – precisely what Marcus does on a daily basis in his restaurants and we're delighted that he will be translating his considerable experience and sharing his advice with our contestants.'

After she was clipped, she slid a few metres along the pavement and landed in a crumpled heap by the side of the road. As the two people with her, believed to be her half-brother and sister, ran to help the car came to a halt - before driving off. Flying a few metres from the hood of the car, the girl luckily escaped without any serious injuries . Flung to the footpath, the girl remains down for a little while while the vehicle stops . It was also confirmed on the page by police that 'the girl required hospital treatment but her injuries weren't serious.' Tasman District Communications Manager Barbara Dunn told the MailOnline the girl is now doing fine. The schoogirl's mum, Leana Hoeta said she was upset that the driver did not stop to see if her daughter was OK. 'I think they might have been a bit shocked and they didn't react as quick as other people would have,' she said. CCTV footage shows the schoolgirl running across the road with her siblings . She is then clipped by the front of the blue sedan . The Marlborough region has been experiencing heavy downpours, and Ms Dunn said 'there had been a lot of issues with rain' in the area. On Tuesday Marlborough Police issued a warning via social media for motorists in the area to take care in the wet weather conditions. 'Marlborough Police are asking motorists travelling between Blenheim and Kaikoura to take care and drive to the conditions as heavy rain has caused some surface flooding. 'If rain continues its likely that cars and motor cycles will not be able to get through between these towns soon.'","Deisha Graham, 12, was struck by a car in Blenheim, New Zealand .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A black man has been accused of being an illegal cab driver after city investigators spotted him dropping of his white wife to work, their lawsuit has revealed. Dan Keys Jr., 66, and his wife Symone Palermo, 53, have accused the Taxi and Limousine Commission of racially profiling them and serving them with false summonses - even though they repeatedly insisted they were husband and wife. They are suing the TLC for $3 million. Mr Keys, a car salesman, was driving his wife's black Town Car to take her to work in Flushing Queens last year. She sat in the backseat because rain had made the front passenger seat wet the night before, their lawsuit said. Stopped: Dan Keys, who is black, was shocked when authorities pulled over his black Town Car and accused him of being an illegal taxi cab driver after he took his wife, who is white to work (file picture) After . dropping her off at her job at Bob's Discount Furniture, Mr Keys was . pulled over by investigators and accused of using his black Town Car as . an illegal cab, the lawsuit claimed. They had mistaken Palermo, who is actually biracial, as being white and assumed she was a customer, the suit claimed, DNAinfo reported. 'Upon information and belief, when attempting to identify illegally operated taxis, it is the official policy or custom of [the city and the TLC] to instruct its employees to target and single out vehicles operated by minorities with white passengers,' the lawsuit said. The lawsuit claims that investigators lied and claimed that a 'white female' passenger had told them that he was indeed an unlicensed driver. Even when Palermo joined them in an attempt to clear up the misunderstanding, the investigators refused to believe them and they were served with summonses with false allegations, the suit said.

'Once they pulled over my clients, [the investigators] had many opportunities to let them go - to realize they pulled over the wrong people,' the couple's lawyer, David Haber, told DNAinfo. 'Instead they doubled down on their mistake. I believe that they flat-out lied in their summonses.' A city administrative judge ruled in the couple's favor and dismissed the summonses - but investigators kept hold of the couple's car for a week until the case was over.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Introducing Dave Brat, the complete unknown who shocked Democrats and Republicans alike who won a decisive victory against GOP heavyweight Eric Cantor in Virginia's 7th Congressional District on Tuesday. The 49-year-old husband and father of two ran on a staunchly conservative immigration platform and used his credentials as a free market-loving college professor of economics to clench the nomination. To learn more about the dark horse candidate, one need do no more than read the ratings left by his students on teacher review site RateMyProfessors.com. 'He's so charming': David Brat came out of virtually nowhere to win the GOP primary against the No. 2 most powerful House leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday. The 49-year-old professor clearly has fans in Virginia's 7th Congressional District, but his students who call him a 'charming...hottie' like him a lot, too . Family man: Brat is a married father of two. His wife's name is Laura (in yellow beside conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham . 'He's so charming and really knows how to incorporate real world examples to keep the class exciting and relateable,' wrote one enamored student. 'Plus he's total eye candy!!' The underfunded political novice is a professor at Randolph-Macon College. Brat accused Cantor of embracing 'amnesty' and open borders, signed an anti-immigration pledge, and got assists in recent weeks from conservative figures popular with tea party voters such as radio host Laura Ingraham and columnist Ann Coulter, who labeled Cantor 'amnesty-addled.' 'He really just didn’t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,' Ingraham told The New York Times. 'I think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the Republican Party.' Brat's students appreciate how he looks in a cardigan more . than his approach to teaching and politics. Glowing! Pictured is Brat's Rate My Professor scores. His average is an A-, but his hotness score is an enviable glowing pepper . 'I'm just running on the founding principles (of) Adam Smith': Brat, right, cruised to victory Tuesday by playing to the right of conservative Republican Eric Cantor . 'Plus he's total eye candy!': Brat's students gave him a hotness rating of glowing red chili pepper on RateMyProfessors.com . His hotness rating on the site is a glowing red chili pepper . - just a notch down from the site's best rating of burning chili pepper. Another rater wrote: 'Brat changes assignments all the time, but he is so charming, you forget to be mad at him'. Brat grew up in the Michigan before moving to Henrico, Virginia in 1996 to teach economics and ethics at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts school in Ashland, Virginia. Politico reports that Brat has also spent time working as an economist in the Army. Brat got his masters from Princeton Theological Seminary, an institution whose mission statement reads, 'prepares women and men to serve Jesus Christ in ministries marked by faith, integrity, scholarship, competence, compassion, and joy,' notes Politico. His wife's name is Laura. They live with their two children in the comfortable town of Glen Allen outside Richmond where the median home sells for around $230,000. Comfortable: Brat and his wife Laura live with their two children in the comfortable town of Glen Allen outside Richmond where the median home sells for around $230,000 . He has chaired the Randolph-Macon College's Economics and Business department for the past six years and used the same principles he touts as a teacher to secure the GOP nomination. ‘I’m just running on the founding principles that Adam Smith and free markets – they made us the greatest nation on the Earth. All right?’ he said in May. ‘It’s no mystery. Our rights, tradition, along with free markets and the Judeo-Christian tradition all together made us the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. I think we’re veering off course a little bit there and I want to get us back on that course that brought us to greatness.’ However, it's his stance on immigration that most experts point to as the major source of the conservative's support. Cantor fought back, boasting in strongly worded mailers of shutting down plans to grant 'amnesty' to 'illegal aliens' - a changed tone for a lawmaker who'd spoken out in favor of citizenship for immigrants brought illegally to this country as youths. Stunned: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor delivers a concession speech in Richmond. Cantor lost in the GOP primary to tea party candidate Dave Brat, who ran on a staunchly anti-immigration platform . He hardened his stance on the policy, moving to block House action last month on a GOP-authored measure offering citizenship to certain immigrants here illegally who serve in the military. It wasn't enough. After a primary election season in which immigration had barely registered, the outcome suggested that it can still be a potent political issue for Republican primary voters. And Cantor's loss almost certainly ended whatever slim hopes remained for a deal on immigration in the House this year, likely putting the issue on ice until after the 2016 presidential election. As gave his victory speech, however, Brat credited his supporters and not his support of any controversial issue, for his win. 'This is the happiest moment, obviously, of my life,' he said at an event in Glen Allen. 'The reason we won this campaign, there is just one reason, and that's because dollars do not vote -- you do.'","Brat shocked the GOP establishment Tuesday when he defeated their No. 2 House leader in Virginia's 7th Congressional district primary .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Justin Bieber has been 'non-stop crying' as he battles the fallout over two damaging video clips that show him making racist comments. The troubled teen idol was plunged into a new racism row after a video clip emerged of him changing the lyrics of a song to joke about killing a ‘n*****’ and joining the Ku Klux Klan. And today, a source close to the 20-year-old singer told MailOnline 'Justin's been in tears. But he knows he needs to take responsibility for his actions, he's confronting his past and he's hanging out with his real friends and his parents. Scroll down for video (warning: explicit content) Making an escape: Justin Bieber jetted out of Mexico on Tuesday as a second video of him using racist terms emerged on TMZ . The popstar was caught on camera at the age of 14, in a video which has just now been released by TMZ, . changing the words of his song One Less Lonely Girl to sing 'one less . lonely n*****' - and joking about joining white supremacist group the Ku . Klux Klan. He apologised, saying: 'Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with. 'But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger. 'At the end of the day, I just need to step up and own what I did.' Justin's team consider bad influence pals to include rappers Lil Za and Lil Twist, both of whom used his LA home as a bolthole and were seen behind the wheel of his sportscars. This latest . controversy comes after Justin apologised 'for offending or hurting . anyone with my childish and inexcusable behaviour' after . another video clip was revealed of him using the n-word five times. The source said it was 'almost a relief' that the video clips had been made public as Bieber's camp first knew they had been leaked three years ago. The clips were bought by TMZ, who never released them before this week. This fresh clip is believed to have been stolen while Bieber was filming his first movie, Never Say Never. And the source added: 'Justin seems to have ditched the problem people around him and he's trying to pull himself together. He's cleaning himself up.' Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. It apparently came about when Justin saw a comedian parodying his song online and he then copied the comedian. However, . TMZ reports he knew  'almost immediately it was a stupid thing to do' and confessed to mentor Usher and close pal Will Smith. Usher showed him old racist videos to educate him and Justin is said to have seen the error of his ways. What's more, TMZ . reports that the Young Money Entertainment clan, which features the . likes of 'Lil Wayne and Birdman – who Justin regularly hangs out with – . are supporting the Never Say Never hitmaker. Mack . Maine, President of Young Money, is quoted by the website as saying: . 'Bieber does not have a slave mentality.  He treats his people with . respect.'Meanwhile, . Justin has claimed that people have tried to extort him over the two . videos which have recently leaked but he 'says he will not be shaken . down anymore. He says he wants people to see the video and he wants to . accept responsibility.' The footage of Bieber telling a racist joke was made public on Sunday . after he refused to pay $1million to the person who had obtained it. The singer was held to ransom over the clip, TMZ has said, by a man who had copied it from a computer hard drive belonging to the singer. Sources . told the website that the star's reps were contacted two months . ago by a lawyer, who represented a client who had worked on the his . videos. TMZ states that the lawyer said he'd sell the video to . the media unless Bieber forked out $1million, which was quickly refused. The price was allegedly later dropped to $800,000 and then $500,000. But the seller was 'sent packing' by Bieber's representatives as they felt the video of him telling a racist joke 'was not that harmful' because he was only 15 when it was recorded. The news emerged on the same day that the hitmaker was spotted boarding a private jet, after a brief stay stay at a swanky villa in Mexico. Causing a stir: The news emerged as the hitmaker was spotted leaving a swanky villa in Mexico . 'I thought it was OK to repeat hurtful words and jokes': The 20-year-old, pictured in the clip, blamed his actions on ignorance, but he insisted he's learned his lesson . On Tuesday,  The Sun . shared the new clip which shows the Canadian singer, wearing a dog tag . and a dark blue shirt, changing the words to his 2009 song One Less . Lonely Girl in order to use the n-word. A . source told the newspaper: ‘Unfortunately this is the devastating . reality of how Justin has behaved and reveals his attitude toward such a . deeply emotive subject. ‘People . need to see this. Normal kids in society do not make these kind of . jokes. He is protected by a network of staff, but the camera doesn’t . lie.’ On Monday, the Mail reported how Bieber faced a backlash from his fans after the clip of him saying the n-word leaked on TMZ. Showing him the way: Usher took Justin aside and showed him some racist videos to help him understand why his behaviour was so terrible . In hiding: Bieber has holed up at this luxury Mexican villa while he waited for the race row to blow over, it has was revealed . Company: Pals including the R & B singer Khalil were with Bieber at the stunning poolside hideaway . It is . believed that both clips dating back to 2009 are from the same video. They will be seen as likely to prove particularly damaging to his career because of the help . he has received from African-American artists. The Canadian star is signed to RBMG . Records, the label owned by black singer-songwriter Usher Raymond, while . he has performed with a string of black singers and rappers including . Will.i.am, Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne. Bieber apologised for the clip this week, saying that when he was a child he did not realise how certain words could hurt, adding that he had learned from his mistakes. Apologised: The first video showed Bieber in 2009 telling a racist joke but he has apologised . He said: ‘As a kid, I didn't . understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought . it was okay to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realise at the . time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing . the ignorance. ‘Thanks to . friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologised . for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become . public I need to apologise again to all those I have offended. I'm very . sorry. ‘I take my . friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologise . for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable . mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility . to the world and to not make that mistake again. ‘Ignorance has no place in our society . and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the . same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted . to say but telling the truth is always what's right. ‘Five . years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and I'm grateful to . those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man.

Kim Min-seok, South Korean defence ministry spokesman, said military officials will closely monitor the drills. Both North Korea and South Korea regularly conduct artillery drills in the Yellow Sea. Scroll down for video . North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (centre) inspecting a shelling drill of a long-range artillery sub-unit this week . North Korea has angered the south after announcing it plans a more live-fire drills . 'Our military is fully prepared,' said. Kim Min-Seok said after Pyongyang notified Seoul of its proposed drill. 'If any shell lands on our side of the border, South Korea will respond strongly.' North Korea disputes the so-called Northern Limit Line drawn close to its shores at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea says it should run further south. Tensions between the two nations have been mounting after North Korea carried out a similar drill on March 31 during which a number of shells dropped into South Korean waters. The drill prompted the two rivals to trade hundreds of rounds of live artillery fire.

Tensions between the two nations has been rising after North Korea carried out a similar drill on March 31 . Meanwhile, South Korea has expressed outrage over an attack on its president by the North Korean government that likened her to a prostitute. The tirade against Park Geun-hye far exceeded even the North's often strident standards. The statement issued by the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea expressed anger over U.S. president Barack Obama's visit to Seoul last week. It said Ms Park was like a 'despicable prostitute' with Mr Obama as her pimp. The North's officials and state-run media frequently use inflammatory rhetoric. They have called past South Korean presidents dogs, but have shown a particular penchant for insulting Ms Park with slurs. South Korea's president Park Geun-hye was likened to a 'prostitute' by the North Korean government . 'She thus laid bare her despicable true colours as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the U.S. and despicable prostitute selling off the nation,' the statement said. It was carried by the North's state-run media on Sunday and broadcast on nationwide television today. In a statement of its own, South Korea's Unification Ministry strongly criticised the comments, saying  they were immoral and contained words that were unacceptable. It also noted North Korea just two months ago called for both Koreas to stop slandering each other. At a joint news conference with Ms Park, Mr Obama said it may be time to consider further sanctions against North Korea 'that have even more bite'. South Korean officials have warned the North could be preparing for its fourth nuclear test. Ms Park said the North is 'fully ready now' to conduct another nuclear test. 'Obama's visit to South Korea sends a strong message to North Korea that its provocative acts cannot be tolerated,' she said. The North's barrage against Ms Park was particularly ill-timed as it comes as her government is dealing with the tragedy of a ferry sinking that has left hundreds dead or missing. The statement slammed Mr Obama for going to Seoul at such a time saying he should have postponed or shelved his trip.","Both countries regularly conduct drills in the Yellow Sea .

The design . team created some concept images . using existing pictures of a selection of Hollywood celebrities showing . what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world. The design team focused on features on . the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally . worked on, such as Tom Cruise and his pearly Hollywood smile and Kim and her . perfectly shaped eyebrows. Not such a bad gal now: Rihanna looks fresh-faced and innocent in the design team's 'non famous' version of the singer . Sharon, is that you? Mrs O, who has admitted to having plastic surgery, looks much older with her grey hair and winkles in the images . The best makeunder of the bunch is undoubtedly 33-year-old Kim Kardashian. With her dark rimmed spectacles, blotchy skin and bushy brows, the star is virtually unrecognisable. Rihanna too has been treated to a believable transformation. Images of Nicholas Cage, Tom Cruise and Sharon Osbourne, meanwhile, are slightly more ridiculous. Tom Cruise and his crooked teeth resemble a hillbilly, while 50-year-old Nicholas Cage looks almost double his age with a bald head and wrinkled skin. Taking it too far: The design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on, such as Tom Cruise and his perfect teeth . Haggered: Nicholas Cage, 50, looks old beyond his years in the virtually adapted image .

"By . Associated Press . Ignition switches once again are causing problems for General Motors. This time the company is recalling nearly 512,000 Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars from the 2010 to 2014 model years because a driver's knee can bump the key and knock the switch out of the 'run' position, causing an engine stall. That disables the power steering and brakes and could cause drivers to lose control. Recall: General Motors is recalling all current generation Chevrolet Camaros because a driver's knee can bump the key FOB and cause the key to inadvertently move out of the 'run' position . GM said Friday that it knows of three crashes and four minor injuries from the problem. A spokesman said the air bags did not go off in the crashes, but GM hasn't determined if the nondeployment was caused by the switches. GM said the Camaro switches met its specifications — unlike those at the center of a recall of 2.6 million small cars. That problem has caused more than 50 crashes and at least 13 deaths. Spokesman Alan Adler said the Camaro switches are completely different from those in the Chevy Cobalt and other small cars. Never-ending: General Motors announced more car recalls on as the total number of recalls of problematic vehicles this year neared 16.5 million . The Camaro key is concealed in the Fob like a switchblade. GM will replace it with a standard key, and a separate Fob. Adler said with the change, if the driver's knee hits the Fob, it doesn't come in contact with the key and the ignition can't be turned. GM said in a statement Friday that drivers who sit close to the steering column are most affected by the problem. The problem was discovered during internal testing of ignition switches after the company recalled the switches in small cars such as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion earlier this year, GM said. Troubling time: The issue, which has caused three crashes with four minor injuries, is not the same as the faulty ignition switch in Chevrolet Cobalts and other models that has caused dozens of accidents and at least 13 deaths, GM said . GM knew for more than a decade that the small-car switches were faulty, yet didn't recall them until early this year. The problem has brought federal investigations, lawsuits and a $35 million fine from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. GM also announced three other recalls on Friday, bringing the total number of vehicles recalled by the company to about 14.4 million in the U.S. and 16.5 million in North America. Earlier this year GM passed its old U.S. full-year recall record of 10.75 million vehicles set in 2004. Also recalled were: . — 29,000 Saab 9-3 convertibles from the 2004-2011. A cable in the driver's seat belt tension system can break and the belt won't retract. Convertible seat belt parts are different from sedan parts, the company said. GM took action after finding out about customer complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the statement said. Passenger belts on the 2004 models will get a lifetime warranty. GM says it knows of no crashes or injuries from the problem. — 22,000 Chevy Sonic subcompact cars from 2012. A transmission turbine shaft can fracture, GM said. If it happens in the first two gears, the transmission won't be able to shift into higher gears. If it occurs in a higher gear, the car would coast until it slows to the point that it can downshift into first or second. The transmissions can fail if driven for a long time with the problem, GM said. Dealers will replace the shaft. The company says it knows of no crashes or injuries from the problem. — 14,800 2014 Buick LaCrosse sedans. A wiring splice in the driver's door can rust and break, messing up circuits that control the door chime and control the electric windows and sunroof. Dealers will inspect the wires and replace the splice if needed. No injuries have been reported from the problem.","GM said a driver's knee can bump the key fob and move the ignition switch out of the 'run' position, causing the engine to shut off .

"By . Maggie Harbour . Kris Jenner has someone she’d like her daughter Kourtney Kardashian's partner Scott Disick to call: Her pastor! The momager was all smiles in the premiere episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians on Sunday night when Kourtney, 35, confirmed that she is indeed pregnant with her third child with Scott, 31. They are already the parents of four-year-old son Mason and daughter Penelope, 23 months. Scroll down for video . Not married, three children: And then there were five. Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have been together for eight years and have two children, soon to be three. But the numbers don't add up for Kris Jenner. She thinks they ought to commit to each other by getting married . Calling the shots: Kris Jenner brings a smile to LAX this afternoon as she gets ready to fly out of town. She's delighted to be a grandma again, but want Kourtney and Scott to seal the deal . But although momager Kris is thrilled she’s going to be a grandma again in December; behind the scenes she’s not so thrilled that her daughter and her boyfriend of the past eight years have still not made it down the aisle. ‘Committing to parent three kids, when you haven’t even committed to each other doesn’t cut it in Kris’s book,’ says a family friend. ‘She comes from a time when, if a girl got pregnant and was still single, she got married as soon as possible. 'And although she understands times have changed, she still has religious values and feels it’s only right that Scott make an ""honest woman"" out of her little girl.’ In fact, 58-year-old Kris regularly attends church services at the California Community Church in Agoura Hills, California - a church founded by… her. She used to attend a Baptist Church in Westlake where she listened to sermons by Rev. Brad Johnson. Married, no children: They've split now, but Khloe Kardashian married Lamar Odem even though they didn't have kids. The ceremony was presided over by pastor Brad Johnson, the man Kris would like to perform Kourtney's ceremony . Married, one child: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West waited only a year after baby North was born before they walked down an Italian aisle last month . But when the pastor resigned in disgrace over his affair with a mistress – who he has since married – Kris tracked him down at his new job serving up coffee at Starbucks, and made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. Now they are partners in a church that boasts giving people second chances. But besides that, he can marry people. In fact, he performed the September 2009 marriage ceremony between Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom, making him only a phone call away should Scott and Kourtney decide to tie the knot. Kourtney and Scott have been together since 2006. And although he bought her a ring in 2011 he says she is the one who didn’t want to get married. ‘Up until now Kourtney hasn’t been interested in getting married, but at 35, she’s beginning to feel it’s time. She’s expecting the couple’s third child and if Scott would agree to a small, quiet ceremony – nothing like the one Kim just had – I think she’d be up for it.' Pressure: If Kris has anything to say about it, Kourtney and Scott will be married by the time the new baby is born. Says a family friend: 'Maybe there's still a part of Kourtney that wants to make sure that at 31, Scott has outgrown his bad behavior before she agrees to make it legal' But suddenly Scott is saying, ‘Why fix it if it’s not broken?’ so the subject of marriage once again seems at a standstill. Kris on the other hand fears the old adage still rings true; why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?’ And she says if Kourtney doesn’t stand up to Scott and insist on a wedding, she’ll end up a lonely 40-year-old woman with three kids and no husband. ‘It’s no secret that Scott and Kourtney have had their share of ups and downs,’ adds the source. ‘All you have to do is watch their reality show to know that. He’s been arrested for DUI, he’s been in and out of rehab, and he’s had anger issues where he’s put his fist through a mirror while arguing with Kourtney. ‘So maybe there’s still a part of Kourtney that wants to make sure that at 31, Scott has outgrown his bad behavior and is ready to be a proper husband, before she agrees to make it legal.’ Not a great holiday? Meanwhile, Scott was seen leaving his Hamptons house with a Louis Vuitton duffel bag Monday .","Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have been together for eight years and they are about to have their third child.

"By . James Gordon . Guardrails at the side of the nation's road which are supposed to offer protection in the event of a car crash could be making things worse according to an industry whistleblower. A guardrail meant to save you in a crash could instead end up slicing through a car. According to Josh Harman a 'design change' may be the cause of the problem on some 600,000 guardrails around the country. Lawsuit: Joshua Harman is suing Trinity Highway Products LLC and its Dallas-based owner, Trinity Industries, Inc., alleging that it made a quiet design change that transformed guardrail systems across the U.S. into potentially deadly hazards . Whistleblower: Josh Harman says one particular model of guardrail is failing at an alarming rate . Harman, a guardrail engineer from Virginia.  He is the plaintiff in a federal 'False Claims Act' lawsuit against Texas-based Trinity Industries, maker of a popular model of guardrail end terminals . The guardrail end terminals ¿ or ¿heads¿ as they¿re called by engineers ¿ are designed to absorb the energy of a crash . If you look closely at guardrails you may have seen rectangles that are called 'guardrail end terminals' or 'heads'. In a collision, the the force of the crash feeds the W-shaped guardrail into the head, where it gets flattened into a ribbon of steel, curling off to the side. The process absorbs the energy of the crash and slows down the vehicle. But Harman who is a manufacturer of guardrails and owns a company that installs and repairs the terminals says one of the biggest competitors has modified its end terminals without telling the government -- shrinking the length, the height and the width -- to save money. One of many examples: Firefighters in Gurnee, Illinois, extricate a 22-year-old man who was impaled by a guardrail on June 9, 2013 . Crashed out: Harman has gone around the country taking photos of accidents where the guardrails failed . On-message: Harman¿s lawsuit alleges that Trinity changed the dimensions of the ET-Plus guardrail some time between 2002 and 2005 without telling federal authorities. He says that he will not stop spreading his message until the designs are altered . Another example: Joshua Harman points to Darius Williams' Nissan Sentra in the junkyard. A length of guardrail pierced his door, according to the police report, driving the 24-year-old¿s body into the opposite back seat . In his whistleblower lawsuit, Harman says the new model 'causes the guardrail to double over on itself or protrude through the crashing vehicle.' In a rather gruesome description, Harman says that during a crash the vehicle can flip around thje W shaped beam can cut through the metal of a car and slice of legs - even cut people in half. Harman says he found this information while defending himself against a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Trinity HIghway Products; it ended with a confidential settlement. Trinity claims that Harman is simply a sore loser and that he was forced to stop producing an end-terminal to the guardrail that was similar to theirs. Harman told Bloomberg, 'That is something that is per se, a red herring, they're trying to distract from it. Whether I'm trying to sell the company or whether I'm trying to stay in business has no bearing on the fact that they're failing, people are getting injured, killed.' Slight change: The guardrails have not been altered substantially but the suit alleges the end terminal piece has been reduced in width to four inches from five . On a mission: Josh Harman (right) goes from state to state and city to city telling anyone who will listen about the supposedly deadly guardrails . Harman claims to have identified more than 100 accidents in which the head of the guardrail failed to function properly. In 2008, a crash in Tennessee killed a 38-year-old paramedic died when a guardrail entered the passenger compartment of her Honda. Trinity has filed defamation lawsuits against Harman in several states. The company claims that Harman 'has published false and malicious statements about its highway safety products, falsely claiming that ET-Plus heads are killing people ... and are failing completely.' The suit claims 'Harman hopes to financially benefit from ... a class action lawsuit against the plaintiffs.' The Federal Highway Administration approved the guardrail head design by Trinity, however Harman points out that changes were made after a crash test in May 2005. He alleges that the federal government were not notified about the changes. Harman has made his position clear that he will not withdraw his whistleblower lawsuit, unless the deal includes a recall of the redesigned guardrail heads.","Joshua Harman claims a redesign of guardrails have made then unsafe should drivers crash into them .
Harman worked for a guardrail design company, but the ones he says are at fault are made by a competitor .
The company, Trinity Highway Products states its designs were approved by the government .
Harman points out the redesign, although only minor, can do serious damage to the occupants of a vehicle ."

It’s usually books or entertainment materials you check out from the local library so locals were surprised when police arrested a woman soliciting sex at the Tewksbury Public Library in Massachusetts. On Tuesday the police were called and told that a woman was offering sex among the hardbacks. They dispatched a plainclothes detective and he claimed that Brittany Macintyre of Nashua, New Hampshire, approached him almost immediately, giving him a pen and a piece of paper. They communicated via notes until she allegedly asked him for $60 and offered to perform a sex act on him. ‘She handed him a pen and a piece of paper, and they conversed back and forth,’ saidTewksbury Deputy Chief of Police John Voto. ‘Ultimately she requested $60 for a sexual act.’ Macintyre, 20, was arrested and charged with prostitution. She was also wanted on a charge of possession of drugs. ‘I didn’t think Tewksbury was that big on prostitution,’ one local woman told a local TV station. ‘I’m quite shocked because a lot of kids come here and I’m a teacher, so it’s pretty scary.’ ‘That’s something that you don’t normally see every single day, especially around here in Tewksbury,’ said a man. She is due back in court on July 30. This is the second time within the last year that someone has been arrested for soliciting sex at the Tewksbury Public Library.

"By . Associated Press . At least 68 elephants have been slaughtered by poachers in Africa's oldest national park by poachers over the last two months, the non-profit group managing the park has warned. The dead elephants make up four per cent of the total population in the 1,900 square mile Garamba National Park in Congo, which was established in 1938. The poachers are using helicopters and chainsaws to kill the animals, the Johannesburg-based African Parks group said. At least 68 elephants have been slaughtered at Garamba National Park by poachers in the last two months. Pictured are four elephants living at Africa's oldest national park - which was established in 1938 . One particular sophisticated group is shooting the elephants with high powered rifles from a helicopter and then taking off their tusks with a chain saw. They are removing the elephants' brains and genitals as well. African Parks, which runs seven parks in six countries in cooperation with local authorities, said the poachers also include renegade elements of the Congolese army, gunmen from South Sudan, and members of the Lord's Resistance Army, a militant rebel group whose fugitive leader Joseph Kony is an alleged war criminal. 'The situation is extremely serious,' Garamba park manger Jean-Marc Froment said in the statement. 'The park is under attack on all fronts.'  A 2012 census found just 2,000 elephants in Garamba Park, down from 20,000 in the 1960s. In one skirmish with poachers, park guards had to try to protect themselves against hand grenades thrown by Southern Sudanese poachers, some wearing military uniforms. One sophisticated group of poachers are thought to be shooting elephants with high powered rifles from a helicopter and then taking off their tusks (one example pictured) with a chain saw . Froment singled out in particular elements of the LRA, which is notorious for its kidnapping children and using them as soldiers, and has been active in the park. In recent years, the U.N. has warned that armed groups in Africa have been turning to ivory poaching to fund their struggles. Many are also using the more sophisticated weapons that flowed from Libya after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Conservationists say a thriving ivory trade market in Asia is helping fuel the worst poaching epidemic of African elephants in decades. The Geneva-based Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora said Friday that 20,000 elephants were killed in 2013, but the overall poaching was on the decline due to better law enforcement.

"By . Associated Press . and Meghan Keneally . An architecture critic has set the spark to Donald Trump’s latest feud after criticizing a large sign with the real estate developer’s name that has been installed on his building in Chicago. Trump has gotten into a war of words with Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel over the issue, and Emanuel has since announced that he's looking for a way to undo the 'architecturally tasteless' sign. The billionaire reality star shows no signs of backing down, however, saying that the sign was ‘done by one of the great sign designers’ and the ‘third-rate architectural critic’ is on the wrong side of public opinion. Sign of the times: Newly installed 20-foot-tall letters spelling out T-R-U-M-P are seen on the side real estate billionaire Donald trump's skyscraper in Chicago, pictured Thursday . Clear sign: Trump stressed that he got city permission to put up exactly the sign that ultimately has been emblazoned on the building . ‘This was fully approved, everybody . knew about it, (Emanuel's) administration knew about it, the previous . administration approved it and this has been approved for a long period . of time,’ Trump said in a phone interview with The Today Show this . morning. ‘The brand is very hot, we're probably the hottest brand there is. We're building all over the world and cities love the brand.’ The . sign in question spells out his last name with 20-foot-tall letters on . the side of his gleaming Chicago skyscraper and the controversy began . when Blair Kamin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the . Chicago Tribune, wrote an article blasting the addition. 'If . this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care — but it . is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from . the 1920s to the 1960s and onward,’ he wrote. Trump . wasted no time disparaging the columnist, telling Today’s Matt Lauer . that Mr Kamin was someone ‘who I thought got fired, he was gone for a . long period of time’. ‘All of the sudden he reemerges and to get a little publicity he started this campaign,’ Trump said Friday. ‘The fact is... that people love it.’ Branding: Trump regularly has his name emblazoned on his buildings across the country (pictured last week) Standing tall: Trump has been vocal in his support of the sign and claims to have received 'thousands' of emails and letters from fans telling him to keep the sign . Many . of the city's tallest buildings have large signs near or at ground . level, but not even landmarks like the John Hancock Center and the . Willis Tower have the kind of banner — high above street level — that . the Trump International Hotel & Tower does. Trump . also stressed that he got city permission to put up exactly the sign . that ultimately was emblazoned on the building. Not only did the city . zoning administrator sign off on it, he said, but the City Council did . as well. Trump pointed out . that the city had actually approved an even-larger sign when Mayor . Richard Daley was still in office, then last year the City Council . endorsed a smaller version of it. A spokesman for Emanuel, Bill . McCaffrey, said the council approved it, as it routinely approves signs . at its meetings, and the mayor was not aware of it. But . perhaps more important than any legal argument he might make, Trump . said he's baffled that anyone would object to the sight of his name on . the side of the building, going so far as to suggest that they should be . thanking him. For starters, he said, his skyscraper replaced an 'ugly' Chicago Sun-Times building and its equally unattractive sign. Hold up: The signage was approve by Chicago's previous mayor and now Rahm Emanuel (pictured in October) is trying to have the decision reversed . Not . only that, he said, but he expects the insignia to someday be as . revered in Chicago as the iconic Hollywood sign is in Los Angeles. 'I have the hottest brand in the world right now and there are those who are saying I'm doing Chicago a favor,' he said. 'I've got thousands of people saying, “Don't do anything with the sign.”’ Emanuel, clearly, disagrees. 'Mayor . Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred . by an architecturally tasteless sign,' his spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said . in a statement, a day after Kamin reported that McCaffrey used the word . 'awful' to describe Emanuel's opinion of the sign. What . the mayor may not disagree with is Trump's contention that the city may . not have much choice but to get used to his name in big bold letters. 'The . sign — which was already reduced in size and scope — does comply with . the provisions of the planned development ordinance and the City Council . sign order, but he has asked his staff to determine if there are any . options available for further changes,' Quinn said.","Billionaire real estate developer had plans approved to put up 20-foot-tall letters spelling out his name on his Chicago building .

Smalls pleaded guilty via phone to two charges of importing border-controlled drugs with a lack of commercial intent in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday. Justine Bieber's former assistant Terrence Reche Smalls is on a year long good behaviour bond for the possession of 13 grams of cannabis at Brisbane Airport last year . The drugs were found in 24-year-old Smalls's bag when Bieber and his entourage landed in Brisbane on November 24 last year, on the first stop in the star's Australian tour. A court heard Smalls initially denied the drugs were his but defence lawyer Jeff Hunter said his client accepted responsibility for packing the bag. If he breaches the year long bond he will be forced to pay a $1000 fine. Justin Bieber also got himself in trouble while in Queensland last year for spray painting a hotel .

"By . Darren Boyle . Judge David Goodin, pictured, told Frederick Smith that his court was 'not in the business of passing cruel, degrading and inhumane sentences' at Ipswich Crown Court . A ‘vile’ 94 year-old who sexually abused a schoolgirl in a bus driver’s shack is believed to be the oldest sex offender ever to be jailed in the UK. Frederick Smith used a Zimmer frame as he was escorted to the cells after a judge sent him to prison for a year. The retired travel agent admitted four offences of indecent assault between 1972-1982 and one offence of indecency with a child between 1972-76. Sentence had been adjourned to see if the prison service could accommodate his ‘extensive personal needs’. Smith, of Haverhill, Suffolk, was described as ‘vile’ by Judge David Goodin. He told him: 'As frail as you are, bent over your Zimmer frame, justice cries out that you be sent to prison for your crimes. 'This court is not in the business of passing cruel, degrading and inhumane sentences but to prison you must go. 'I’m told you have become depressed and withdrawn and I’m inclined to the view that at the age of 94 your remorse for what you have done is real. 'This court is not in the business of passing cruel, degrading and inhumane sentences but to prison you must go. 'I’m told you have become depressed and withdrawn and I’m inclined to the view that at the age of 94 your remorse for what you have done is real. 'You will carry the shame of your offending to your grave.' Ipswich Crown Court heard that medical reports showed that Smith ‘wasn’t in bad shape’ for his age. Smith's solicitor, Joanne Eley, asked Judge David Goodin at Ipswich Crown Court, pictured to consider an alternative to prison to 'allow him to end his life with some dignity' The judge added: 'You need help with stairs, bathing and dressing but otherwise your memory is not bad and you can communicate clearly.' He was taken to Norwich prison following the sentencing hearing. Hugh Vass, prosecuting, said Smith’s crimes had a devastating and lasting effect on his victim. She finally made a statement to police in July 2013 and described being abused some 40 years earlier in a shack used by bus drivers for refreshment breaks. Smith got the schoolgirl to sit next to him and then touched her between the legs when one of his colleagues left the room. She said Smith had sexually assaulted her on a number of occasions over a period of years and she had feared he would kill her if she said anything. On one occasion she saw him in his garden and when she threatened to reveal what he had done he threw a pair of garden shears at her, narrowly missing her. Smith had also sexually abused her while giving her a lift in his car and had got her to perform sex acts on him. Joanne Eley, for Smith, said he was deeply remorseful and regretted what he had done, adding: 'He feels dirty and ashamed.' She said that Smith had asked her to tell the court he knew he had done 'bad things' and was 'very, very sorry'. She urged the judge to 'allow him to end his life with some dignity in a care home and not in the care of one of Her Majesty’s prisons'. Smith was taken to Norwich Prison, pictured, after his sentencing hearing at Ipswich Crown Court making him one of the oldest prisoners in Britain .","Frederick Smith abused the girl over the course of a decade until 1982 .

"By . Nola Ojomu . and Shyam Dodge . Justin Bieber is set to settle his Miami DUI case with a plea bargain deal that will allegedly see most of the charges against the troubled singer dropped. The 20-year-old will reportedly plead guilty to the reckless driving charge made during his arrest in January while the rest of his charges with be dismissed according to TMZ. Justin was originally charged with driving under the influence, resisting arrest, reckless driving and driving without a valid license when police officers claimed to have caught him and pal Khalil drag racing on Miami streets in the early hours of the morning. Scroll down for video . New deal: Justin Bieber is set to settle his Miami DUI case with a plea bargain deal that will allegedly see most of the charges against the troubled singer dropped . While it has since been reported that the hitmaker was neither drag racing or drunk on the night, he did test positive for marijuana. TMZ reports that the reason the plea deal has taken so long to be sorted is due to the fact the judge allegedly wanted Bieber to star in and pay for an anti-drug PSA.However, Bieber’s lawyers resisted because they felt that the idea was inappropriate. The singer’s camp also felt it was unnecessary for the star with attend a drug and alcohol education curse because he does not have a substance abuse problem and attending classes would indicate that he does. A source told the site: ‘Bieber will plead guilty to reckless driving and the other charges will be dismissed.  He'll pay a fine and attend anger management classes.  He will NOT be placed on probation. Meanwhile, his rapper friend Khalil will use the same plea but will not have to attend any classes.Once Bieber and Khalil complete the requirements of the settlement, the reckless driving conviction will then be wiped from their record. The deal is expected to be entered in court in coming weeks. In trouble with the law again: The 20-year-old - seen in LA in May -  was under investigation for attempted robbery . The news comes after the singer's robbery case was rejected by the Los Angeles District Attorney. Justin . was hit by claims earlier this month that he had allegedly stolen a . woman's phone in Sherman Oaks, California, after she photographed him. But . the prosecutor's office has rejected the case after Los Angeles Police . found no evidence to support the woman's allegations, TMZ reports. Police . interviewed nine eyewitnesses at the scene of the alleged crime, . Sherman Oaks Castle Park, and not a single one could confirm the woman's . claims. Another confrontation: Justin Bieber reportedly called a woman a 'b***h' for filming him at a stable . The District Attorney rejected the case, however they did send it to the City Attorney, which could result in a misdemeanor. Earlier this month The LA Times spoke to Officer Rosario Herrera of the Los Angeles Police Department, who confirmed: 'He has been accused of attempted robbery.' The pop singer, who wore jeans, a black T-shirt and a maroon coloured beanie, was alleged to have 'wrestled' with the mother to try and obtain her cell phone, to stop her from taking pictures, and eventually 'ripped' it from her hands. She was with her 13-year-old daughter at the time. Before the drama: On Monday, Justin posted this Instagram video of himself enjoying the miniature golf course . TMZ reported that the woman claimed . Justin was unable to delete the pictures when he finally got hold of the . phone, as it was locked. Meanwhile, . Justin is currently scheduled to go on trial for charges of driving . under the influence in Florida following his arrest in January. He is also expected to have a hearing regarding his now infamous egg throwing incident in California.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Casey Kasem's wife ignored medical advice and disconnected her husband's feeding tube when she removed him from a California nursing home, staff have claimed. The allegations are made in a statement Kasem's doctor made after Jean Kasem took her 82-year-old husband from the care home at 2.30am last month. He highlighted in the letter that the feeding tube was the only way the American Top 40 host could be fed or hydrated, and claimed Ms Kasem was warned of the risks. Health concerns: Hospital staff caring for Casey Kasem claim they warned his wife of the dangers of moving him . Nursing staff at the home also gave statements claiming they had refused to agree to releasing their patient, and alleged that Ms Kasem left without signing a form showing she was removing him 'against medical advice'. The details were revealed in the Daily News in documents handed to elder abuse investigators at Santa Monica Police. According to Dr Paul Leitner, who cared for Kasem before he was removed from the facility, Ms Kasem 'disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration'. The doctor added: 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr  Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.' Registered nurse Jennifer Kusiappiah also made a statement claiming Kasem's wife removed him 'even though I have clearly explained that it was dangerous and could be fatal'. She added that Ms Kasem was concerned about the radio host's privacy after he was visited by his two daughters. Dispute: Kasem's care has been the center of a fight between his daughter, Kerri, left, and wife, Jean, right . Critical condition: Radio host Kasem, center, has developed sepsis from an infected bedsore . Private investigator Logan Clarke claimed that Ms Kasem should be charged with elder abuse, and told the Daily News she had allegedly removed hospital equipment used to keep her husband alive. After a protracted family battle between Kasem's wife and his adult children from a previous marriage, the radio host was removed from life support machines on Wednesday. His daughters had been frantically searching for him since Ms Kasem removed him from the care home. He was later found in a Seattle property belonging to friends of his wife. At this point, Kasem had developed sepsis from infected bedsores, and was taken to a Washington hospital, where doctors and a lawyer for his daughter, Kerri, say he is dying. After Kerri Kasem was given a court order that allowed her to return her father to hospital, he was taken off life support. As well as the sepsis infection, he has dementia and Parkinson's. A judge ruled Wednesday that Kasem's doctors should stop force-feeding the dying broadcast legend and allow him to slip away - despite the legal and emotional objections of his wife, who declared 'You have blood on your hands!' Kerri Kasem has filed a police report alleging that her step-mother's decision to . remove Casey from the nursing home last month . were criminal,  TMZ.com reported. Update: In a Facebook post Kerri Kasem announced that her father had been removed from life support . TMZ reported that Kerri Kasem claimed to have medical documents that showed the bed sore would likely contribute to Kasem's death. She posted on her Facebook page that her father was dying in hospital. 'Transitioning our father’s treatment to comfort-oriented care was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make,' she wrote. 'For the last 11 days, our father has been surrounded day and night by love and care by his daughters Kerri and Julie, his son Mike, his brother Mouner and sister-in-law Mary, and his dear friend Gonzalo Venecia,' she added.","Doctor caring for star says Jean Kasem was warned moving him was risky .

"By . Alisdair Glennie . Nearly half a million people avoided buying a television licence last year because of a loophole created by the BBC iPlayer. Viewers who use the service to watch catch-up programmes online for free can escape the £145.50 annual charge by declaring they do not own a television set or see live shows. Last year, 463,846 opted out in this way, a rise of more than 35,000 in 12 months. Last year, 463,846 opted out of paying the licence fee by saying they only use iPlayer to watch television. The figure was up 35,000 in just 12 months . It means the BBC has 1.9million residential and business addresses registered on a database of those who are exempt from paying the licence fee. The figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, have sparked fears that the Corporation is struggling to adapt to the internet age. It has led to calls for an overhaul in the way it is funded. Last night, Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said the growth of the iPlayer and rising numbers of people avoiding the annual fee prove the TV licence system is ‘increasingly unenforceable’. Viewers who feel they are not obliged to pay the BBC fee can fill out a ‘no licence needed’ form. It means they are added to the database of exempt households and will stop receiving threatening letters from TV Licensing inspectors for two years. The number of people filling out the form has risen steadily, from 425,590 in 2011 to 428,359 in 2012, and 463,846 last year. It is believed many of them are younger . viewers who no longer feel the need to buy television sets or watch TV . as it is broadcast. Instead, they can legally avoid paying by catching . up with their favourite shows on their computers, tablets or . smartphones. The BBC now has 1.9million residential and business addresses registered on a database of those who are exempt from paying the £145.50 licence fee . Last night, Tory MP Rob  Wilson told the Daily Mail: ‘These figures demonstrate exactly why the current licence fee model is out of date. 'It operates a 20th century model and it won’t last long with the rapid technological advances of the 21st century. ‘The BBC needs to come to the table with radical ideas about how to structure the Corporation for the many challenges it now faces.’ The BBC itself has encouraged the migration of younger viewers to online viewing. Director general Tony Hall recently announced plans to scrap its youth channel BBC3 and put all of its content on iPlayer only. A TV Licensing spokesman said: ‘There have only been small fluctuations in the number of residential addresses that don’t need a licence in the last four years. ‘The number of households only watching catch-up TV is well under 2 per cent.’ The TV licence fee could be scrapped and replaced with an increase in council tax or utility bills under a radical plan to be looked at by MPs. John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said there is a ‘strong case’ for updating the charge. ‘One simple way is to maintain it as a charge to every household but attach it to an existing bill, be it council tax or some other. ‘It’s something that we would consider as a potential alternative,’ he told  the Times. Possible changes to the fee are being floated as the committee conducts an inquiry into the future of the corporation. Ministers are coming under pressure to reassure poor families who struggle to pay the fee that they will not face large fines for non-payment, despite a four-fold increase in the maximum penalty, which now stands at £4,000. The licence fee was introduced in 1946 and cost £2 per year for the single-channel black and white BBC service. Households now pay annual fees of £145.50 for colour and £49 for black and white licences – raising £3.6billion a year for the corporation. The Government is also committed to holding a review of whether licence fee evasion should become a civil, rather than criminal, offence. MPs have argued that high fines and even jail  are ‘disproportionate’.","Viewers escape annual charge by saying they do not watch live shows .

"By . Wills Robinson . Tragedy: Former Royal Marine Gary Sims, 55, during a pickled egg competition at his local pub in Berekeley, Gloucestershire . A former Royal Marine choked to death after he took part in a pickled egg swallowing competition, it emerged yesterday. Father-of-two Gary Sims put three eggs in his mouth while playing the game at the Boar's Head Inn in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, as he drank with friends. The 55-year-old had gone to the bar and ordered six of the eggs - which cost around £1 each. But he quickly began to choke, prompting friends and staff to attempt the Heimlich manoeuvre, before ringing 999. Despite their best efforts last Saturday the former marine - known as Joe to his mates - suffered a cardiac arrest and died. An inquest heard that he choked when trying to perform a party trick in front of friends. Gloucestershire . Coroner's office opened the hearing and said the initial cause of death . discovered from a post mortem examination was asphyxia. Landlady Samantha Hall said: 'He was in here with his friends when it happened. 'It was very busy so staff didn't think anything of it when someone came over and ordered six or so pickled eggs. 'Everyone around here likes pickled eggs that's why we sell them - to us it's just like selling a packet of crisps. 'He . wasn't even drunk. It was just an awful accident. I think the next . thing anyone knew he had collapsed. It all happened so quickly. 'I think Joe stuffed three in his mouth and that is when it happened. 'The thing was he didn't even struggle or anything, he just collapsed and that was it and his eyes rolled back. 'The . ambulance was called and my doorman was trying to perform the Heimlich . manoeuvre but it didn't work. Then they were doing CPR. 'The paramedics got him in an ambulance and I was following them to the hospital, he was then pronounced dead on the way.' Party trick: The father-of-two tried to eat three of the eggs at once during the game at the Boar's Head in in the village . A woman, who asked not to be named, said she know people had been taking part in the competition to swallow the pickled eggs. She . said: 'It's sad isn't it? Terrible. We were all very shocked. People . shouldn't be playing these games, especially if they've been drinking.' Landlady Samantha said Mr Sims was a regular who always looked out for staff. She . said: 'He was such a lovely and sweet man. What has happened is tragic. The word 'tragic' has never been so fitting as it is now. Stuffed: Paul Newman with a pickled egg in his mouth in Cool Hand Luke (1967) It is one of the most renowned yet bizarre scenes in Hollywood history. When Lucas 'Cool Hand Luke' Johnson is told he can't eat 50 eggs, he rises to the task. During the 1967 film, which is set in a 1940s American prison, one of the inmates challenges Luke, played by Paul Newman. He responds and and goes on to put them in his mouth, one by one. The spectators give him one rule - no throwing up - and he has an hour to completely consume them all. When questioned why he chose 50, he said: 'It seemed like a nice round number.' One bystander gives him advice, suggesting: 'If he eats one egg an hour, he has 10 minutes to swallow.' After finishing the 36th egg, he gingerly stands up and walks away to lean on a wall. Someone then taps his belly and says: 'Just like a ripe watermelon ready to burst.' He carries on, with two inmates carrying him on their shoulders, feeding the eggs into his mouth. As the clock counts down, the group encourage him by saying: 'Only nine more to go.' For the last few eggs, he lies on a table with his eyes closed as the last of the eggs are shoved into his mouth. Then as the time runs out, he stops chewing and an inmate checks to see if his mouth his empty. 'He was a regular here and he would look out for everyone. I remember once there was a member of staff who he thought wasn't eating properly so he would bring her in proper home cooked meals. ...'He was such a lovely and sweet man. What has happened is tragic. The word ""tragic"" has never been so fitting as it is now' Samantha Hall, pub landlady . 'Most of the staff that worked here were female so if they were working alone he'd make sure he stayed until close to keep away any trouble makers. 'What has happened is so unfair. His two daughters are in total shock. He was an ex- marine. For him to go like this is so unfair. 'He was kind, funny, he looked out for everyone.' She added that staff did everything they could to help Mr Sims. She said: ""If there is anything else they could have done - they would have done it. I just can't believe what has happened, you but on a brave face but deep down I just want to sell up now. 'You expect the odd scuffle but not someone dying on your premises. The girls are trying to come to terms with their loss at the moment. The wake will be held here next week.' Mr Sims was also as a former employee of the decommissioned Berkeley power station, managed by Magnox. He was a contractor who had worked on site for around five years. An obituary posted in a local paper read: 'Gary Sims Formerly of Berkeley, loving Dad to Emma and Joanne, passed away suddenly on 7th June 2014 aged 55.' A spokesman for South West Ambulance said: 'We received an emergency call at 9.46pm and two rapid response cars and one double crewed ambulance attended the incident where there was one casualty. 'Although he was conscious at the scene, he suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of choking. 'CPR (cardio pulmonary resuscitation) was carried out, but he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.' A Gloucestershire Police spokesman added their officers were called to the death of a man at the pub at 11.15pm. He said: 'It is believed that the man choked on a piece of food. The coroner and the man's next of kin have been informed. Police are not treating the man's death as suspicious.'","Gary Sims, 55, put three eggs in his mouth at the Boar's Head Inn .

"By . Wills Robinson . A 91-year-old graduate who built up a £4,500 fine after returning a library book 61 years late has been left off. Ron Webster borrowed Professor AR Radcliffe-Brown's Structure and Function in Primitive Society in 1953 from the University of Liverpool. The sciences postgraduate student was then warned by his friends he would have built up a hefty fee, so decided to return the book. But when he arrived at the university's campus, librarian Phil Sykes waived the fee because he said Mr Webster had lived an 'exemplary life'. Long overdue: Ron Webster, 91, (left) clocked up a £4,500 fine after failing to return a library book for 61 years. But kind-hearted University of Liverpool librarian Phil Sykes (right) waived the fee . The total was calculated on the basis of the current charge of 20p per day for late return of books. He borrowed the book because it contained a section on the anthropology of joking relationship - a convention where two tribes are allowed to make fun of each other. The premise underpinned interviews and fieldwork Mr Webster carried out with Liverpudlian and Salford Dockers. When he was sorting through his personal library retired Mr Webster discovered the oversight and realised he may be facing a hefty fine. But rather than pop it back on the shelf, Ron decided a trip back to his old Liverpool haunts was in order and a return to the red brick institution on Brownlow Hill. Mr Webster who worked for Ford after finishing his studies, and son-in-law Rick Walker called in to the university's Sydney Jones Library to drop off the long overdue book. Campus: Mr Webster borrowed Professor AR Radcliffe-Brown's Structure and Function in Primitive Society in 1953 from the Sydney Jones Library . Mr Walker, who was worried that an enormous fine would be handed to Ron and possible legal action, said: 'They didn't expect to see him again.' 'Ron had been warned very firmly by the friends he plays cards with at the local pub that he would be landed with an enormous fine and feel the full force of the law.' Kind-hearted librarian Phil Sykes kindly waived the £4,510 fine, providing Mr Webster goes on to live an 'exemplary life' and return library books on time in the future.","Ron Webster, 91, borrowed book from University of Liverpool library in 1953 .

"By . Daniel Martin . Thousands of NHS patients are being forced to wait weeks for vital cancer tests – potentially putting their lives at risk. The NHS recommends that no one should wait longer than six weeks after being referred by their GP for a diagnostic test. But the latest official figures show that in April, almost 17,000 patients waited longer than the limit – more than double the total in the same month last year and almost five times the figure at the time of the last election in 2010. The number is also the highest for six years, suggesting that progress made in recent years to tackle the problem has stalled. 17,000 patients waited over six weeks after their referral from a GP for a  diagnostic test (library image) It comes just two weeks after official figures revealed that the target of 85 per cent of cancer patients starting treatment within two months of a GP referral has not been met for the first time since 2009. The latest total of 16,981 patients includes 3,427 waiting more than six weeks for endoscopy tests that detect bowel and stomach cancers – up from 2,037 last April, and 976 in 2010. There were 6,117 patients waiting for ultrasound tests, up from 1,326 last year, and 291 at the election. Some 2,439 waited too long for MRI scans, compared with 374 at the election, and 859 were kept waiting for CT scans, compared with 215 in 2010. Charities blamed short staffing and a lack of MRI and CT machines for the problems. Sara Osborne, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘These latest figures are extremely worrying and urgent action must be taken to make sure patients don’t have to wait too long to get their cancer diagnosed. ‘The six-week waiting time target is in place as we know a quick diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment is vital to improving survival from the disease. 'Patients need assurance that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the NHS.’ Ciaran Devane, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Only two weeks ago we heard that more people are waiting longer to start treatment and now more people are waiting longer just to get diagnosed. Charities blamed short staffing and a lack of MRI (pictured) and CT machines for the long waiting times. Some 2,439 waited too long for MRI scans last year . 'Once again we see that cancer care in this country isn’t fixed. The NHS is under strain and cancer risks being overlooked and not given the focus it needs.’ Last night the Department of Health announced that an extra £250million was being given to hospitals and GP-led organisations to keep waiting times down. It follows figures showing that an extra 250,000 patients are waiting for planned surgery or treatment compared to this time last year. The department said the increase was partly due to the ageing population, which means more patients are being referred by GPs.","NHS say no one should wait longer than six weeks for diagnostic test .

"By . Dan Bloom . A top fashion designer has been slammed by a broadcasting watchdog after he praised young Irishmen for 'damaging English virgins'. Paul Costelloe - whose designs are sold in House of Fraser and John Lewis - provoked outrage with the remarks about Irish emigrants in London, where he lives. 'The English, they love us and they hate us, you know, you just have to put up with that,' he told a live radio show in his native Ireland. Anger: Irish-born Paul Costelloe, pictured on the catwalk at London Fashion Week with two models, told a radio show young Irish emigrants to England 'are doing great and damaging a lot of young English virgins' Challenged: The RTÉ presenter asked Mr Costelloe (pictured with former Miss World Rosanna Davison) if he was a chauvinist, which he denied. But the Irish radio watchdog said the broadcaster could have done more . 'Certainly . the Irish are never short of chatting up and, you know, we have that . skill and I’m sure these young guys are doing great and damaging a lot . of young English virgins, so there you are, and good luck to them.' Presenter George Lee questioned whether the designer was a 'chauvinist' - which he denied. It was then alleged a text message to the show complaining about Mr Costelloe was 'laughed off'. Born in Limerick, the designer built his empire from wealthy Knightsbridge in west London . The comments on RTÉ's The Business show in February drew two official complaints to the broadcaster, one of which was elevated to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. The upset listener, Barbara Smith, branded the remarks repugnant and dangerous to women. RTÉ agreed a number of listeners were . offended by the comments, but said they could be . construed as a flamboyant and heavy-handed description of young Irish . men living in London. The broadcaster insisted it was a throwaway remark during a 'fast-moving' live programme . on a side issue to the main thrust of the interview. But the watchdog disagreed, saying the show could have used a delay button or used the presenter to deal with on-air risks. The watchdog's ruling said: 'It . was the opinion of the committee, following its review of the material, . that the manner in which sexual relationships were described by the . guest would cause undue offence and that the programme makers had not . taken due care in the way in which the comments were handled during the . programme. 'In . particular, it was the view of the committee that the presenter’s tone . and his answer to his own question in respect of whether his guest had . displayed chauvinism did not display due care in respect of the . sensitivity of listeners who, in the opinion of the committee, might . reasonably view the comment as offensive.' Born in Limerick, the designer has been at the helm . of British high street fashion for decades and established his brand at . a flagship store in Knightsbridge, west London. In 2010 he was picked as one of six Irish fashion designers to be honoured on a postage stamp. An . RTÉ spokesman told MailOnline: 'To the best of our knowledge there were . two complaints sent in relating to the Paul Costello interview. 'We have no further comment to make in relation to the BAI decision which we accept. 'The full statement of the BAI decision will be broadcast shortly before The Business programme starts tomorrow morning.'","Top designer made the remarks on live radio show in Ireland in February .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Labour's shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell called for a change in workplace culture so fathers feel able to take more time off with their children . Young fathers have the 'worst of all worlds' because they are expected to help with childcare but their bosses won't let them have time off, Labour’s childcare guru has claimed. Shadow minister Lucy Powell revealed even her own husband refused to take more than two weeks’ paternity leave, fearing the reaction from his colleagues in the NHS. In an interview with MailOnline, Miss Powell suggests paternity pay could have to rise unless there is a culture change for it to become more acceptable to men - and their employers - to share the burden of raising their children. New rules come into force in April next year allowing new parents to share the 52 weeks of leave previously only available to mothers. But a Labour government forerunner which let dads enjoy some ‘additional paternity leave’ was taken up by just 1 per cent of new fathers. In an interview ahead of Fathers’ Day on Sunday, Miss Powell warned passing laws was not enough to ensure new dads took time off work when a child is born. She claimed young fathers had the ‘worst of all worlds’ because they are expected to share childcare responsibilities at home, without the support at work. Fathers must get ‘angry’ with political and business leaders to demand fairer treatment, she adds. Miss Powell was elected in 2010, and gave birth to Tom in May last year. She has a daughter, Katie, and a step-son, Joe. She took maternity leave from the Commons, and tried to persuade husband James Williamson, a doctor, to make use of the Additional Paternity Leave rules, which allow fathers to use up some unused maternity leave once the baby is 20 weeks old. Miss Powell told MailOnline: ‘When I was off this time last year I said to my husband “I’ll be going back after four or five months, why don’t you take a couple of months off?” because he would have been able to do that under this scheme. ‘But he said “well how do you think that’s going to go down at work"". ‘He’s a doctor, so he works in the NHS which you’d think would be more open-minded about such things.’ Miss Powell wants to put childcare at the centre of a big policy offer in Ed Miliband's general election manifesto . Maternity leave was first introduced in 1975, but was only extended to all working women in 1993. New dads got paternity leave in 2003, and are entitled to two weeks  at £138.18 per week. The last Labour government introduced Additional Paternity Leave, which offered between 2 and 26 weeks depending on how much unused maternity leave their partner had left once they returned to work once the baby was 20 weeks old. It was supposed to allow both parents to share the time spent with their new baby in their first year. But ministers have admitted that in 2012-13 just 3,867 fathers took the option of extra leave, just 1.4 per cent of those thought to be eligible. When shared parental leave is introduced by the coalition from  April next year, parents will be able to split the full 52 weeks leave - paid for 39 weeks. Lucy Powell said: 'Where something like additional paternity leave is designed to help that transition, it's obviously not being taken up. 'The reality is shared parental leave probably won't be much more than this. It's not the panacea that people might think it is.' If Labour’s childcare champion cannot persuade her own husband, what hope is there for the rest of the country? ‘It’s definitely cultural,’ she says. ‘The example of my husband, I think that’s often how dads feel themselves but also how they are made to feel in the workplace.’ In addition to the woeful take up of extra paternity leave, official figures show fathers are half as likely as mothers to ask for flexible leave, and half as likely again to have the request granted. ‘There’s a real perception in the workplace that dads won’t share the caring responsibilities, don’t need those allowances being made. ‘So there’s reluctance for them to ask.’ The answer, for now, is to tackle the cultural barriers, more high profile successful dads working flexibly, politicians taking a lead. But if that does not work, fathers might need a more blatant inducement: hard cash. ‘All the evidence we have heard about shared parental leave is there is that extra barrier about pay and status because dads are the ghee earner in the couple’, Miss Powell says. ‘So the statutory pay for this additional maternity leave, it’s three months of statutory paternity which is often not significant enough. ‘And it will be the same with shared parental leave.’ Increasing paternity pay is ‘definitely’ something that Labour will look at. She says paternity pay could ‘potentially’ be paid as a proportion of a new father’s salary, so high earners do not see their income slump so dramatically. ‘Obviously offering additional pay isn’t cheap,’ she cautions. ‘I haven’t got money in my back pocket to be able to do this. ‘But what I would personally endeavour to do is really champion the cause of dads and try and get some of this cultural shift into the system first of all. ‘And then see if, later on, further changes are needed, we will have to look at where we might be able to fund that from.’ Even with the economy now growing, and employment rising at record levels, many working men would be reluctant to demand extra rights when being in a job at all is the priority. But Miss Powell insists that dads themselves have to make the case for more rights in the workplace. She likens it to the struggle two decades by women to get enhances maternity rights. ‘I would call on dads to get a little bit more angry about what provisions they have and be a bit more demanding about that’ she adds. Young fathers are the ‘most frustrated, dissatisfied members of the workforce’, Lucy Powell said (file picture) She points to a recent study which showed young dad were the ‘most frustrated, dissatisfied members of the workforce’. ‘For the new generation of dads there is a feeling that the caring responsibilities will be more evenly shared within the couple - and dads want to play that role at home - while also being successful at work. ‘In a sense dads are that new group who have got the kind of worst of all words really. That’s why I say they need to start being demanding themselves, but we as politicians and business leaders need to rise to that challenge as well otherwise it’s going to be dads demanding it, maybe in not a very nice way. ‘All the evidence shows that if there is time taken off by dads when the baby is first born that that bonding is really critical and can then lead to much more secure relationships throughout that child’s life. ‘So it’s really good for children to do that. But also if we want a society where some of the gender inequalities are reduced, where caring responsibilities are seen as more fairly shared, then we have to enable dads to play the part they often want to play in doing that. ‘So it’s good for children and I think it’s good for society as a whole.’","Lucy Powell warns 'cultural barriers' mean workplaces are not dad-friendly .

"By . Martin Robinson . On the run: Dangerous armed robber David Blood has walked out of Ford Open Prison  - the second time he has gone on the run in two years . An open prison has a staggering  90 inmates on the run, it emerged last night. They include at least one murderer, burglars, firearms criminals and  fraudsters – some of whom absconded from jail years ago. The revelations about HMP Ford in West Sussex will intensify the row over whether the wrong convicts are being sent to open conditions to ease pressure on Britain’s packed jails. Local Tory MP Nick Gibb and the Prison Officers Association said mistakes were being made because of ‘constraints’ in the prison service. Mr Gibb warned: ‘The risk assessment of prisoners who are being sent to Ford open prison is clearly not vigorous enough. ‘I sense that because of the constraints on capacity in the prison service that mistakes are being made in that assessment process.’ Steve Gillan, general secretary of the POA, said his members were noticing ‘time and time again’ that the wrong sorts of prisoners are being placed in open conditions. He added: ‘There aren’t enough prison officers because of budget cuts, we’re too overcrowded, mistakes are being made, and I think people are being rushed through the system incorrectly.’ In a sign of a worsening overcrowding crisis, 40 prisons across England and Wales were instructed to raise their ‘operational capacity’. This is a tactic used by prison bosses to create more space in the system by, for example, re-opening disused cells. Hot spot: Several men, including Blood, have been able to walk out of Ford Open Prison, pictured, in recent weeks . Earlier this week, the Daily Mail . revealed how Sussex Police, which released the latest figures about HMP . Ford, had taken four years to tell the public a savage murderer had gone . missing from the prison. Robert . Donovan – whose fatal stabbing of a West End theatre manager shocked . the country in the 1970s – walked out in June 2010, less than a year . after being moved to open conditions. But, . despite police considering the killer too dangerous to approach, not a . single appeal was made for help in catching the  57-year-old until this . week. Officers said they had decided to act only after deciding he was probably no longer hiding in Sussex. Violent armed robber David Blood is the latest inmate to  go on the run from Ford  open prison after he absconded on Thursday. The 48-year-old was serving a life sentence for a robbery on a post office in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, in 2000. He is the 23rd convict to abscond from the prison since November last year. Last month violent robber Simon Rhodes-Butler also absconded from Ford, but  was arrested in London yesterday morning. Blood is 6ft1in, of small build with brown eyes and cropped black hair, and is thought to have links to Staffordshire  and Warwickshire. PC Stephen Reed said: ‘Because of Blood’s record, we have to consider that he could pose a threat to  the public. I would urge  anyone that sees him to contact us on 999 rather than approaching him.’ Responding to the latest figures, they denied being too slow to act in identifying and tracing absconders. Supt Lawrence Hobbs said the force made ‘some very quick and positive steps’ and had arrested 23 absconders in recent months. Around . 23 people disappear from the prison each year. He said police did not . routinely make media appeals to the public when prisoners went missing . but considered each case individually, taking into account the risk. He . added the vast majority were serving jail terms for offences such as . fraud, dishonesty and theft, telling the BBC: ‘We are absolutely . confident the risk to the public remains low.’ In . November, the force found there was a number of people who had . absconded whose cases had not been regularly reviewed, and a dedicated . team was set up to review each case. A . spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘The Justice Secretary has . been clear that keeping the public safe is our priority and has ordered . immediate and major changes to tighten up temporary release processes . and open  prison eligibility.’ He . added that abscondments had reached record lows under this Government . and were down 80 per cent over the past ten years, and insisted every . incident was taken seriously, with police contacted as a matter of . urgency. Controversy has . been raging for two months over convicts absconding from open jails. It . was sparked by the disappearance of an armed robber known as the Skull . Cracker. Michael Wheatley, 55, walked out of a Kent jail last month, holding up a building society in Surrey before being caught. Killers and other violent criminals have been able to walk out of jail in recent months. In almost every case police warned the public these men should not be approached. Murderer David Richards, 53, walked out of prison and went on the run for nine years – even claiming benefits, obtaining a passport and going abroad on holiday. The disappearance of the Hell’s Angel should have triggered a  manhunt after he absconded from a Derbyshire open prison in 2005. But local police refused to look for him, leaving him free to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society. Murder victim: Michael Groves, left, with his younger brother Marcus. David Richards and his girlfriend attacked Michael with a wrench, hammer and knife before writing 'Hell's Angels' on the wall with his blood . The habitual armed robber dubbed the Skull Cracker robbed a building society of almost £20,000 while on the run from open prison. Michael Wheatley, 55, was handed his 14th life sentence last month- but could be out again in ten years. He admitted holding up the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, four days after absconding from an open prison in Kent. He was already serving 13 life sentences at the time, and failed to return from day release on May 3. Violent: Skull Cracker Michael Wheatley as he pointed a gun at staff while robbing a building society while on the run from an open prison . Police also took four years to warn the public that a dangerous murderer was on . the run from an open prison. Police have no idea where he is: Murderer Robert Donovan (above) has been on the run since fleeing an open prison four years ago . Robert Donovan, who was convicted of stabbing a West End theatre manager to death, walked out of Ford prison in June 2010. Police . considered him so dangerous that he should not be approached by the . public, but not a single appeal was made for help catching him until . yesterday. Donovan, 57, had . been in open conditions for less than a year when he absconded from the . prison near Arundel, West Sussex. Officers said they had decided to act . only after concluding he was probably no longer in the county. Tory . MP Philip Davies, who has campaigned for tighter rules on open prisons, . said: ‘It is quite extraordinary that this is only just coming to light . now. The public should have been informed straight away. ‘People . need to know for their own safety. If the authorities had to make an . announcement every time somebody absconded, I suspect a much more robust . system would soon be put in place.’ Donovan . was jailed indefinitely at the Old Bailey in December 1974 for a crime . that shocked the nation. The sentence – in this case, the juvenile . equivalent of a life term – meant he would be detained until the prison . authorities decided it was safe to release him.","Gang leader and lifer David Blood walked out of Ford Open Prison yesterday .

"By . Andrew Levy . 'A generation is growing up in conditions of anxiety and deprivation': Rowan Williams said support for needy people had been 'dismantled' Rowan Williams reignited the debate over food banks yesterday by claiming a generation of children is growing up with ‘anxiety and deprivation’. The former Archbishop of Canterbury attacked the Government’s benefits policy saying support for needy people had been ‘dismantled’. And he dismissed the benefits of the economic upturn, saying it was doing nothing to prevent ‘day-to-day hardship’. Lord Williams spoke out after Cambridge Food Bank, of which he has patron, released figures claiming the number of people fed by its five centres had doubled in a year to more than 4,600. He said: ‘The facts on the ground are indisputable. Whatever may be said about economic recovery at national level, the day-to-day hardship experienced by so many people in this country is not getting less and is not going to get less in the near future. ‘Structures of support have been dismantled, resources for dealing with people in crisis situations have been reduced. ‘And meanwhile, a generation is growing up in conditions of anxiety and deprivation. The psychological as well as practical effects of this are long-term for those who are children now. ‘Once again, we have to challenge those who deny this to come and see for themselves.’ Dr Williams is the latest senior church figure to attack the Government over poverty. His successor, Justin Welby, used his Easter message to bemoan the plight of struggling families ‘left broken and weeping’ by hunger and debt. A letter signed by 600 church leaders including 36 Anglican bishops earlier this year called on the Government to deal with what it described as a ‘national crisis’ of poverty and people living below the bread line. But their concerns contradict findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which show food poverty in Britain has reduced dramatically. Only 8.1 per cent reported struggling to afford food in 2012 – down from 9.8 per cent in 2007, before the economic crisis. Critics including former Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit have also pointed out there is a ‘near infinite demand’ for free food and warned of the ease with which people can claim the food parcels without providing evidence of financial hardship. Piety: Dr Williams is the latest senior church figure to attack the Government over poverty. His successor, Justin Welby, used his Easter message describe the plight of families 'left broken' by hunger and debt . In April the Trussell Trust - a charity run by Labour Party member Chris Mould which has more than 400 food banks including those in Cambridge - was accused of being ‘misleading and emotionally manipulative’ after claiming more than 913,000 people had received three days’ emergency food in the past year – almost a threefold increase on the previous 12 months. Publicity campaigns are widely accepted to have increased awareness of the service. Applicant numbers have also swelled as a result of the Coalition overturning a Labour ban on job centres advising people about food banks. Tory MP Stewart Jackson, a practising Christian, said he was ‘appalled’ at Lord Williams’ ‘partisan attack’ and defended the benefits system as ‘one of the most generous in the world.' ‘It’s interesting that Rowan Williams sat back under the Labour government when they abolished the 10p tax rate for poorer working people and presided over a huge rise in inequality between the richest and poorest. There wasn’t much moral indignation from him then,’ he said. ‘He is completely undermining his credibility with this partisan attack.’ Poverty: A sign outside St. Paul's Church in Brixton, South London directs to a Food Bank depot . Some 4,684 people, including 1,650 children, were recorded as having used Cambridge’s food banks last year. This included 1,405 because of ‘low incomes’, 682 due to ‘benefit changes’, 364 who were in debt and 139 whose reason was listed as ‘other’. The trust admits it does not carry out checks into applicants’ suitability to receive food parcels. Instead, it relies on referrals from ‘front-line professionals’ such as GPs and social workers who fill out a tick box form. A spokesman said: ‘Front-line care professionals make a judgement whether someone is actually in crisis and will ask questions about whether they need to be referred to a food bank.’ A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said Government reforms were ‘improving the lives of some of the poorest people in our communities’. He added: ‘The truth is that employment is going up, benefits are being paid to claimants more quickly and independent experts tell us that there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago. ‘The Trussell Trust and other food banks agree that increased awareness has helped to explain their recent growth.’","Lord Williams spoke after food bank said its clients had doubled in a year .

"By . Martin Robinson . An incredibly-rare eyewitness account by one of the British heroes of the Zulu War battle immortalised in the celebrated Michael Caine film has been unearthed 135 years later. Walter Dunne's letter on January 24, 1879 describes how he and a brave band of soldiers successfully defended an outpost in South Africa against 4,000 Zulu warriors. The assistant commissary officer was recommended for the Victoria Cross for his role in the heroic stand, which was celebrated in the 1964 film Zulu. The letter - written on the back of a large delivery note - reveals how with a comrade he fortified the mission station by organising a makeshift barricade from 200lbs mealie bags that were stacked 5ft high. He wrote about being attacked by a thousand Zulus - but in fact it was probably four times that number. Remarkable: 135 years after Rorke's Drift this letter, left, by Walter Dunne, right, written on the day after the great battle has emerged and will be sold at auction . Brave: At Rorke's Drift 150 British soldiers successfully defended the outpost against 4,000 Zulu warriors . High price: The high price is expected because of how rare it is and not least because the piece of paper was actually at the Battle of Rorke's Drift . When the marauding Zulus eventually breached that in the battle, Dunne built a 9ft high redoubt of more mealie bags where the wounded were brought for protection. Rorke's Drift/ 24 Jan.r '79/ . My dear Warneford, Sad news about the 1/24th. (1st Battalion, 24th Foot) 5Cd commanded by Col. Pulleine were cut to pieces and the camp sacked. 20 Officers are missing. About 1000 of the Kafirs came in here and attacked us on the same day (22nd). We had got about 2 hours notice and fortified the place with trap of grain biscuit boxes &c. They came on most determinedly on all sides. They drove our fellows out of the Hospital, killed the patients and burned the place. They made several attempts to storm us but the soldiers (B Co of 24th under Bromhead) kept up such a steady killing fire that they were driven back each time. We had only 80 men, the contingent having bolted before a shot was fired. The fight was kept up all night & in the morning the Kafirs retreated leaving 351 dead bodies. Dalton was wounded in the shoulder and temp clerk Byrne killed & 12 of the men... W A Dunne (over) Some of the missing are Pulleine, Col. Dunford, Capt. Russell, Hodson (killed), Anstey, Daly, Mostyn, Dyer, Griffith, Pope, Austin, Pulleine (2 Mr.) Shepherd (S... major) Wardell (killed), Younghusband, Degacher, Porteous, Carage Dyson, Atkinson - Coghill is believed to have escaped & also Melvill; . The British overcame massive odds to defeat the native warriors. The following day, Dunne picked up a delivery note for the mealie bags and used it to write the letter to an army friend in Cape Colony in South Africa. The simple document has now come to light after being made available for sale at auction. It has been given a pre-sale estimate of £30,000, not least because the piece of paper was actually at the Battle of Rorke's Drift. Dunne's letter was written on January 24, 1879, the day after the battle. In it he told of how the Zulu-Kafirs slaughtered 1,500 British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot at nearby Isandlwana two days before. Later that same day, 4,000 Zulus headed for Rorke's Drift. Dunne described how the Zulus surrounded the outpost and praised Major Gonville Bromhead, who was awarded the VC for his part in the battle and who was played by Michael Caine in Zulu. Dunne wrote: 'About 1,000 of them came in here and attacked us on the same day. 'We had got about two hours notice and fortified the place with bags of grain and biscuit boxes. 'They came on most determinedly (sic) on all sides. They drove our fellows out of the hospital, killed the patients and burned the place. 'They made several attempts to storm us but the soldiers (B Co of 24th under Bromhead) kept up such a steady killing fire that they were driven back each time. 'We had only 80 men the contingent having bolted begore a shot was fired. The fight was kept up all night and in the morning the kafirs retreated leaving 351 dead bodies. 'Dalton was wounded in the shoulder and temp clerk Byrne killed.' The 1964 film Zulu, starring Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, dramatised the heroism shown by soldiers at the battle in 1879 . Finest hour: Painting commemorating the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift in 1879 - a victory by the British against the odds . In actual fact, the British numbers were nearly double the amount Dunne stated and the number of Zulus were four times his estimate. Dunne, an Irishman, was turned down for a VC but was mentioned in dispatches. He sent the letter to pal Capt Gonville Warneford. The letter was retained by the Warneford family and has now emerged for sale at Bonhams in London. After 35 years of service, he retired to Gibralter in 1908, but died the same year at a nursing home in 1908. Matthew Haley, head of books and manuscripts at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Letters describing the battle are extremely rare and hardly ever come up for sale. 'There is a vivid and appealing immediacy to this letter, scribbled down on a receipt for the makeshift fortifications that would save the day. 'Politically the victory restored some credibility to the British Army but Walter Dunne isn't concerned with that. 'His thoughts are about the companions he has lost and the courage and resourcefulness of the men he fought alongside. A fantastic insight into history as it was being made.' The letter is being sold by Bonhams on June 18. Conflict: Rorke's Drift was part of the wider Anglo - Zulu war in 1879, starting with an invasion by the British in January and ending with a British victory and Zulu independence five months later . It was on January 22 1879, on the Natal border with Zululand, in South Africa, that the tiny British garrison of 140 men - many of them sick and wounded - fought for at least 12 hours to repel repeated attacks by up to 4,000 Zulu warriors. The defence was rewarded by Queen Victoria's government with no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses. The name of Rorke’s Drift led to the much-loved film starring Stanley Baker and Michael Caine. The movie, which is still celebrated more than 50 years after it was made, saw  Baker play Lieutenant John Chard, while Caine played his right-hand man, Lieutenant Goville Bromhead. After fighting day and night the Zulus eventually retreated after 351 of the men died and 500 were wounded. It was part of the wider Anglo - Zulu war took place during 1879. The conflict began because the Zulu kingdom presented an obstacle to British imperial ambitions in southern Africa. The British invasion of Zululand began on January 11 1879, with the British objective being an eventual federation in Africa. The battle of Isandlwana erupted on the 22nd of January 1879, 11 days after the British started their invasion. 20,000 Zulu warriors attacked 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and 400 civilians. The Zulus, who had more numbers, overwhelmed the British, killing over 1,300 troops, while around 1,000 Zulu soldiers were killed. The battle of Rorke's Drift started almost immediately after, ending on the 23rd. The Battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July 1879 effectively ended the Zulu-Anglo war, with the defeat of the Zulu forces by the British when over 5,200 British and African soldiers razed the capital of Zululand after defeating the main Zulu army. The war ultimately ended with a British victory, and Zulu independence.","Despatch by Walter Dunne on January 24, 1879, found 135 years later .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was wrong to think British troops could be sent to 'sort' the problems in Iraq . Britain will not repeat the ‘mistake’ of the 2003 Iraq war by sending troops to deal with the uprising by Al Qaeda-inspired militants, Nick Clegg warned today. The Deputy Prime Minister rejected the idea of the UK becoming involved in tackling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group which has already seized Iraq's second biggest city Mosul and Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. Today the group boasted it had full control of Kirkuk while its leaders boasted it step up their drive towards the capital Baghdad. More than a decade after Tony Blair’s decision to join George W. Bush’s invasion, leaders on both sides of the Atalantic are reluctant to become embroiled in a new conflict in Iraq. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has appealed for help from the international community. But Mr Clegg insisted this would not involve British troops returning to Iraqi soil. Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘We provide help to the Iraqi government. We provide training and equipment and so on. ‘I have no idea what the Iraqi government will be asking of others in terms of the material support they need or the training they need. ‘If in one way or another the invasion of Iraq in the first place has contributed to the instability in Iraq more widely, should we be going back in to try and sort it? ‘I don’t think having made one mistake you repeat it by making another one. ‘That doesn’t mean that I have a perfectly packaged solution for this.’ The ruthless rebel al Qaida splinter group this week took control of second city Mosul and Saddam’s home city of Tikrit as part of an effort to set up a Sunni militant enclave across the Iraq/Syria border. Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday dismissed suggestions that the UK had a duty to intervene because of its previous role in the Iraq war. 'You can't say the crisis was created by invading it and then we should invade it again,' he said. 'I don't think that's part of the solution. It is a democratic country with democratically elected leaders and that is something it never had before. 'It also faces the challenges of extremism and that is something we have to support them in dealing with but ask them and expect them to take leadership in their own country.' Militants have taken 48 hostages from the Turkish consulate in Mosul and United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged the international community to 'unite in showing solidarity with Iraq as it confronts this serious security challenge.' 'Terrorism must not be allowed to succeed in undoing the path towards democracy in Iraq,' he said. Iraqi displaced families queue at a checkpoint in Erbil, Kurdistan region after fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) captured key cities from government troops . Foreign Secretary William Hague has ruled out sending in British forces, in a repeat of Tony Blair's 2003 invasion . However, Iraq-born Nadhim Zahawi claimed the 'divisive sectarian' rule of Mr al-Maliki had fanned the flames. Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Today that the US might consider providing air support to Iraqi troops in efforts to retake territory. 'This really goes back to the US policy in Iraq when Paul Bremer was administering the country. He took a decision, backed by the American government, to disband the Iraqi Army - the ‘de-Ba’athification’ process,' he said. 'He sent home 700,000 men with weapons, no jobs, no job prospects, predominantly Sunni, to their families. 'Some of those people organised and this chap Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who is the emir of Isis, is one of those men. 'It is compounded by Maliki’s divisive, sectarian policies. Maliki is the commander in chief and the minister of defence - because he hasn’t appointed anyone - so he decides who gets promoted within the army.' Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi blamed the 'divisive sectarian' rule of Iraqi PM al-Maliki for fanning the flames of tensions in his country . The premier had also withheld funds from Kurds amid ongoing efforts to create a 'true coalition' government bringing together all sides after inconclusive elections which gave no party a clear majority. 'The Americans have sold Maliki some fighter jets. I don’t know whether they would go further and heed his call for further intervention with some air cover for the Iraqi military to be able to retake some of these cities,' Mr Zahawi said. The MP - who was among those who supported strikes on the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad last summer which were effectively voted down by the Commons - said failure to act there had opened the door to groups such as Isis. 'I argued for very limited intervention to take the chemical weapons out of the game in Syria to protect the silent majority of innocent people,' he said. 'Early intervention in Syria, supporting people who were working towards replacing Bashar al Assad with a moderate democracy which is inclusive would have been the right move because otherwise the message you send to the silent majority is actually you don’t care about them and that is where these groups thrive because they go in and they are brutal and they take over and fill that vacuum.'","Deputy PM admits he does not have a 'perfectly packaged solution'

This is the moment a buzzard was hit and killed by a US Air Force B-2 stealth bomber as it quietly landed at RAF Fairford in Swindon, Wiltshire. Photographer Matt Morris was taking pictures of the aircraft with friends but did not realise the bird strike happened until he examined his pictures the next day. Clear of danger: The bird seemed to be a safe distance from the B-2 Spirit as it flew away from its wing . Final moments: But quickly the bird was in trouble and can be seen here on the left hand side of the picture already under its fuselage . Pictured: The moment a buzzard was hit by a USAF Stealth Bomber at RAF Fairford near Swindon and disappeared in a puff of feathers . 'I couldn’t believe it at first' he said. 'The B-2 hasn’t been in the UK for five years and to get a glimpse of it landing is a sight itself for plane-spotters, but to actually witness the moment a bird hits it is truly extraordinary' he added. The bird, believed to be a buzzard based on the pattern on its wings, is seen in the distance at first. The next image shows how it glides the the right of the $737million aircraft. But the bomber is quickly behind it and then the buzzard was sucked into the engines followed by a puff of feathers. Graceful: Photographer Matt Morris did not notice the bird strike until he inspected the pictures the following day . Graceful: The bomber continued its landing and touched down at a RAF base in Wiltshire undamaged . Expensive: The B2 cost $737million each but with engine3rring and testing they cost well in excess of $1billion . Mr Morris, of Bristol, said:'Military aircraft cannot sustain birds in their engines as well as conventional ones. 'They usually have less engines, one or two and can have a serious effect when the plane loses one” he said . 'It didn’t seem to have suffered any damage, as it took off again later on in the day' he added.

"By . Rob Shepherd . Follow @@robshepherd5 . England should not fear Italy, but apparently the big issue from those in the World Cup ‘bubble’ is how to stop Azzurri midfield play-maker Andrea Pirlo pulling the strings. Former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, now of Napoli, knows a thing or two about such things and has a solution. No 1 is not to fear Pirlo. No fear:  England must stop Andrea Pirlo if they are to have a chance of beating Italy . Rafa then argues against getting a forward like Danny Welbeck to do a man-marking job on the ageing Italian quarterback (Pirlo is 35) is NOT a good idea. Benitez says England should instead attack him on either side, pushing Pirlo firmly on the back foot, compressing his space and stopping him dictating the play. That’s why Ross Barkley should start for England in the ‘No 10’ position - an argument endorsed by Paul Scholes. Unknown: Ross Barkley could be the man to win the game for England . Mario Balotelli has been told by Italy boss Cesare Prandelli to concentrate on the World Cup and not get embroiled in talks about his club future. So unlike Chelsea, who secured Cesc Fabregas two days ago in a £27million whirlwind deal, Arsenal will have to wait to pursue their interest in the former Manchester City striker. Stay focused: Italy coach Cesare Prandelli wants Mario Balotelli to only think about the World Cup . England have only won two of their last 11 internationals against Italy (D3 L6), losing to them on penalties in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012. The one previous World Cup came in the third place play-off in 1990; Italy won 2-1 . A 0-0 draw between England . and Italy is 5-1. If there are goals they could well come from a set . piece - Gary Cahill is 28-1 to be first scorer. England have only lost two of their last 16 World Cup games (W7, D7, including two penalty shootout defeats). Excluding shootouts, England have scored all eight World Cup penalties they have been awarded. England boss Roy Hodgson has said all his players should sing their hearts out when the national anthem is played, the idea being that it will somehow enhance their display. But my source in the camp suggests coach Gary Neville – who as a player kept a stiff upper lip on the anthem front - is not convinced that singing God Save the Queen will make the team play well. And unless there is last-minute change, attempts to divert TV cameras away from focusing on ‘Red Nev’ have fallen on deaf ears. Sing up: Roy Hodgson wants his England players to sing the National Anthem . Owing to the hot weather in some parts of Brazil, FIFA have agreed that the referee may call a halt to play two to three times per match to allow the players time to re-hydrate. This could happened for the first time in England’s game on Saturday night, where the kick-off time was brought forward to satisfy European TV schedules rather than consider players’ well being. It could be a long night. Some well know soft drinks firms have bought advertising space in anticipation. Take a break: The England and Italy players may take a drinks break during their game due to the heat . After Brazil, Italy are the most . successful team in World Cup history. Italy have won the title four . times — in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006 — and also finished as runner-up . twice, in 1970 and 1994. England’s group rivals Uruguay kick off their campaign ahead against Costa Rica in the 8pm match.

In the opening game of the 1982 finals Bryan Robson scored after 27 seconds against France a game England went on to win 3-1.

Roy Hodgson has urged the country to believe in his England team as they prepare to face Italyon Saturday in their World Cup opener inside the Arena Amazonia. England’s manager is convinced that the country will be proud of his team as they begin the tournament in Brazil against Cesare Prandelli’s ageing Italian side and he called for support. Hodgson said: ‘What we really want from people back home is support, we want encouragement. We want them to believe, we want to give them something to cheer about. Nothing would please us morethan to give a performance on Saturday night that has everyone at home thinking “This is terrific, what a good England team, didn’t they play well”. No fear: Roy Hodgson has called on England fans to support his young team against Italy on Saturday night . Team spirit: The England players have prepared well for their game, which will be hot and humid in Manaus . ‘That’s our only goal and we can only hope they give us the support we need and that they go to bed on Saturday night as happy as we will be if we get a good result from the game. I was proud and excited in 1994 when I took Switzerland to a World Cup and very proud to represent the nation. But England is the country of my birth, it’s even greater this time to be able to take England to a World Cup.’ Hodgson’s rallying cry was backed up by captain Steven Gerrard, who said: ‘I will be proud leading this group of players out. I trust them and I believe in my team-mates. I will be even prouder if we come home from this tournament with our heads held high and we have gone out on the pitch and given everything we’ve got for the public back home. ‘What was the dream growing up? For me, the dream was to play for Liverpool and England. So to play for England and be the captain at a World Cup in Brazil is the pinnacle. Looking at the lads and being in and around them, I get the impression they’re ready to give everything they’ve got.’ Hodgson, who inspected the stadium’s playing surface last night, also challenged some of his younger players to make an impact at the world’s biggest tournament. Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana all had outstanding seasons. Pride: Captain Steven Gerrard says he will be immensely proud when he leads out his side against Italy . Talking tactics: Roy Hodgson and Gerrard investigate the pitch in Manaus ahead of the game . Hodgson, who will stick with his 4-2-3-1 formation against Italy, added: ‘When you are young you need people telling you that you’re good. It’s not by chance you are doing all these things. If you’re so good you can do them for Liverpool in the Premier League, there is nothing to stop you doing them at the World Cup. ‘We’ve only to think back to 1958 and Pele bursting on to the scene as a 17-year-old.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Pensions minister Steve Webb said the older generation of workers are a 'vast untapped talent' Millions of over-50s must be encouraged to stay in the job market with offers of flexible hours and careers advice, ministers say. The impact of an ageing population and falling birth rate, mean over the next decade there will be 700,000 fewer people aged 16 to 49 -  but another 3.7milllion people between 50 and pension age . Pensions minister Steve Webb said the older generation of workers are a ‘vast untapped talent’ and must be encouraged to stay in employment for longer, or lured back if they have retired early. He will appoint an older workers’ champion to ‘challenge misconceptions’ about giving jobs to older staff who ministers say could provide a huge boost to the economy. The ‘Fuller Working Lives’ programme announced today will extend flexible working to all employees straight away so older workers can combine employment with caring for relatives. In addition, job centres will pilot courses aimed at retraining older workers, and employers given advice on how to accommodate staff with certain health problems. A recent survey of 400 McDonald’s restaurants across Britain showed customer satisfaction was on average 20 percent higher when they employed staff aged 60 and over. Academics found older staff at the chain were more likely to empathise with customers, go to extra mile in serving them, and could use their life experience to help mentor younger staff. Around 60 percent of people in the UK aged 55 to 64 are in work and the number is growing. Older workers saw far fewer job losses during the recession in Britain than younger workers did, which experts say is a vote of confidence in their skills and hard work. But Mr Webb said in some other countries the employment rate for this age group is around 70pc or higher, and believes Britain should aim to raise its game. Incentive: The 'Fuller Working Lives' programme announced today will extend flexible working to all employees straight away so older workers can combine employment with caring for relatives . ‘Older workers have a huge amount to bring to any workforce and are a vast untapped talent’, he said. ‘We . are living longer and can expect many more years of healthy life. It’s . great news – but it’s something that as a society and as an economy we . need to respond to. ‘I am . determined that we boost our support for older workers and help . employers challenge outdated perceptions to see the real strengths of . this important section of the workforce.’ Mr . Webb is the minister behind the decision in this year’s budget to allow . people to cash in their pension pot from the age of 55. Currently they can take a small lump sum when they retire but the rest must be invested in an annuity -  a product which gives pensioners a guaranteed annual income for the rest of their life. He said having the flexibility to cash in part of their pension while continuing to earn money would also help people have a ‘gradual retirement’. Two groups of pensioners are at the heart of the government’s drive to get older people back to work. One is women in their 50s who have taken time out of work to help with caring responsibilities, for their elderly parents or grandchildren, and have found it difficult to return. Mr Webb said they could benefit from more flexible hours. The second is men in their 50s who have taken sick leave or incapacity benefit from work, who can no longer do their previous job for health reasons but could be retrained to do something else. Caroline Abrahams of the charity Age UK said the measures were ‘essential’ to stop an older generation, who are living longer, being excluded from work and struggling for money. She said: ‘Too many older people still find themselves locked out of the workplace despite overwhelming evidence showing they are at least as productive as their younger counterparts and make an invaluable  contribution in terms of their experience, knowledge and skill. ‘Nearly half of all unemployed people aged 50 and over have been out of work for more than a year, with many in this age group finding it incredibly hard to get another job.’ It is already illegal to sack a person for turning 65. The state pension age will rise to 66 from 2018 and to 67 from 2026.","In next decade there will be 3.7m more people between 50 and pension age .

Roy Hodgson and his players have every reason to fear Liverpool’s Luis Suarez when the teams meet in their second match in Group D. Certainly Suarez’s recovery from recent knee surgery is fundamental to the South Americans’ chances here. However, playing up front when Uruguay begin their World Cup in Fortaleza against Costa Rica on Saturday afternoon will be Paris Saint-Germain’s formidable goalscorer Edinson Cavani - and the 27-year-old has admitted that he is driven on by his rivalry with Suarez. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fired up Cavani nets for Uruguay in 2-1 win over Slovenia . Menace: Uruguay frontman Edinson Cavani admits he is driven by his rivalry with team-mate Luis Suarez . ‘We certainly have our own little rivalry to spur each other on and help our country perform at its best,’ said Cavani. ‘We want to be in the best condition possible to help our country. It’s a dream we both share.‘In the past four years we’ve improved and matured as a partnership. We’ve both done very good things this season. We’ve been working hard for a long time to achieve our objectives for Uruguay. Connection: Cavani and Suarez's fathers played in the same local leagye in the north-west of Uruguay . ‘We . hope that can continue this summer because we want to do well for our . country, for our people, and to keep our position as one of the highest . ranked teams in the world. Luis has been phenomenal this season.’ Born . in the same month in the north-western town of Salto, Suarez and Cavani . never knew each other as children, even though their fathers played in . the same local league. Over the next month, though, it’s hard to escape . the sense that they must present the best side of their partnership if . they are to progress from a group that also contains Italy. ‘No, we didn’t know each other as children, but our fathers did,’ explained Cavani. ‘They actually played football together in Salto’s local leagues when they were younger, before me and Luis were born. Luis left for the capital, Montevideo, to play football when he was very small, so our paths didn’t cross on the pitch until we were playing in Uruguay’s youth teams. ‘We’re both boys from Salto, though, and we know every nook and cranny of the place. We’ve grown up with those customs and habits and it’s a big part of who we are.’ Cavani first came to Europe’s attention as a buccaneering striker for Napoli in Serie A. Manchester City tracked him closely before he moved to France with PSG last summer. More recently, Manchester United considered a bid for him, though that interest has cooled a little under new Old Trafford manager Louis van Gaal. With England’s central defensive partnership of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka arguably the weakest  part of their line-up, it is possible Uruguay may leave Suarez out of Saturday night’s game to protect his knee ahead of next week’s second Group D match. ‘This is a tough group, absolutely,’ said Cavani, who has scored  21 times in 62 international appearances. ‘But you’d expect that from a World Cup. It will be both difficult and beautiful at the same time, because if you can compete with the best in the world and challenge them for the Golden Boot — not necessarily even winning it - then that’s a very attractive proposition. ‘To win a World Cup you have to maintain a level of concentration whereby you face the best teams in the world by playing to your maximum. ‘We know our first three games are going to be elite, top. The  competition is going to be fierce from the beginning, but that only makes it more beautiful to play in this tournament, because you have to bring your best face as early as possible.’ On your marks: Uruguay warm up in Fortaleza ahead of their Group D clash with Costa Rica .","Edinson Cavani will look to lead the line in place of Luis Suarez .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Breach: Ruby Cooper, 52, has been found guilty of breaching her restraining order for the second time in a 21-year campaign against NatWest and its parent company RBS . A former bank manager who warned the RBS chairman 'not to go home this weekend' unless she was paid £750,000 has been remanded in a mental hospital. Ruby Cooper, 52, bombarded Sir Philip Hampton with emails and phone calls and threatened to stab a member of staff if she didn't receive her money. It came just months after the former NatWest worker was found guilty of harassing RBS chief executive Stephen Hester and sending him a vial of liquid she claimed to be poison. Cooper, who has led a 20-year campaign against NatWest and its parent group RBS, initially escaped prison last October with a restraining order banning her from contacting any RBS workers. But a week later she turned to Sir Philip with her demands, and in February she was remanded in custody where she has stayed until now. Today, a jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London found Cooper guilty of breaching her restraining order. Adjourning sentencing until July 18, Judge Martin Zeidman ordered for Cooper to undergo a psychiatric examination and remain in a hospital until sentencing. Mr Zeidman said: ‘The sad thing is that . this defendant has been in custody for some six months and that is . because having made a restraining order, we need to know she won't do it . again. ‘All I want to hear is that she won’t do it again but you can see by the previous convictions that she is likely to. ‘I must order a formal psychiatric report while you are in custody though you will remain at the hospital.’ As . she was led away from the dock, Cooper turned to the judge and . exclaimed: ‘Thanks for putting me in a mental hospital which I will not . get out of for the rest of my life. ‘This is not justice.’ She also expressed concern for her two dogs, claiming: ‘I need to get out for my dogs, I have two bulldogs.’ Cooper's campaign against the bank began in 1993 when a member of NatWest's call centre staff allegedly took her home address from the bank's computers and paid her repeated visits even after she moved home. 'Freaked out', she repeatedly contacted the bank about her concerns until she was convicted of harassing former chairman Sir David Rowland in 2000. She was then banned from contacting any employees of NatWest or RBS, or any police officers involved in her case. Undeterred, Cooper sent two emails to chief executive Stephen Hester threatening to . ‘flush him out’ and release the address of his children days after . sending him a vial of liquid purporting to be poison. Last October, the restraining order was renewed. Targeted: Cooper warned RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton 'not to go home' and that a member of staff would be stabbed. Her threats came a year after she sent chief executive Stephen Hester a vial of so-called poison . But she then began bombarding chairman Sir Philip Hampton with emails and phone calls before getting RBS chief executive officer Ross McEwan and police chief Bernard Hogan-Howe involved. On January 17, when the messages became abusive, staff called the police. She told Sir Philip’s personal assistants that a member of staff was going to be stabbed if she didn’t get her money, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Warning banking bosses to stop being ‘low-life, thieving scum’, she  and just to give her the money she believed she was owed. She also told Mr McEwan that the company could have a ‘corporate manslaughter’ on their hands if she decided to ‘flip.’ RBS staff told Cooper she . was in breach of her restraining order but things came to a head in . January when the messages became abusive. 'Stop acting like low-life thieving scum - if . you pay yourself such big bonuses then you can pay mine by next week' - One of Ruby Cooper's emails to Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive officer . Cooper also sent an email to police . commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe claiming she was told to email Mr . McEwan. She said: ‘I have been asked now to send all my emails to Ross . McEwan by RBS themselves just in case they try and stitch me up.’ In . a second email sent to Mr McEwan and Mr Hogan-Howe later on 15 January . she said: ‘Your secretaries both tell me that Mr McEwan has taken over . my case and to speak to me on the telephone. ‘Please . ensure my cheque arrives by 17 January and please do not put me through . any more stress as you have destroyed 19 years of my life. ‘You have cost me £2 million but I am willing to accept just £750,000 by next week. ‘If . you continue to harass me and I flip and you end up with a corporate . manslaughter situation then you will have only Natwest and RBS to . blame.’ On January 16 she emailed the bank . asking for her cheque to be sent by courier before informing Mr McEwan . personally that all the proof he needed to clear the cheque could be . found on her website natweststalker.com. She . continued in her email: ‘Stop acting like low-life thieving scum - if . you pay yourself such big bonuses then you can pay mine by next week. Campaign: Cooper, who worked for NatWest - now owned by RBS - from 1977-78, has run a 21-year campaign against the banks claiming a worker took her home address from the firm's database and visited her house . Further targets: She also emailed RBS chief executive officer Ross McEwan (left) after her conviction last October, and then emailed Metropolitan Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) to say she had been told to . ‘Do not hold me responsible for retaliation.’ Privately-educated . Cooper, who has a degree in psychology and social anthropology from the . University of Stirling, worked for NatWest from 1977-78. Prosecutor Warwick Tatford said: ‘She was prohibited from contacting any member of staff at RBS. ‘The . trouble is she did it again and again and again and suggests she didn’t . contact anyone at RBS because she had emailed people from Natwest. ‘But her own emails and phone calls show this is rubbish. ‘In . one call to Fiona Macdonald, she will tell you Cooper said “We have . been warned and she was going to stab a member of staff if they did not . send her the cheque.” ‘In a . second call, which may have been hot air, she said “Sir Philip Hampton . should not stay in his house this weekend as things will be happening to . him.” ‘That is a pretty unpleasant thing to say.’","Ruby Cooper, 52, sent threatening emails to chairman Sir Philip Hampton .

"By . Rafael Benitez . MATCH CONDITIONS . In Manaus there could be thunderstorms, the temperature will be around 30°C and the humidity will be very high. The other concern is the grass. In Brazil, it is thicker and longer which changes the speed of the ball. The side that dictates the tempo of the game can gain the upper hand. If you play a lot of short passes it can  tire you out, so you need to be  able to move the ball firmly, quickly and most importantly accurately. We know Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi have those qualities but Steven Gerrard will be key. He can hit 40 to 50-metre passes with accuracy and they could prove decisive if England capitalise on the pace they have up front. Whoever gains the best control here can be the winner. Hot and humid: Temparatures will be over 30°C in Manaus, so whoever gains control of the game will be key . Shaping up: Steven Gerrard can be that main man for England against Italy in the World Cup Group D clash . HOW THEY SHAPE UP . England have been looking at 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3, sometimes even shaping as a 4-4-2. The key components remain the same — Gerrard anchors the midfield, whoever is alongside him covers when he steps forward and they keep  a fluidity in the movement of the front four. The problem is Italy are not easy to predict. They are really good at adapting themselves to suit their opponents’ shape. They have looked most comfortable with a line of five in defence, as in with a midfielder sitting deep, yet they played 4-3-3 in the friendly against Fluminense and scored five. They have players who are attuned to different systems and tactically very good. Cesare Prandelli has kept the roots of Italian football in that they are strong in defence but they have such quality in front of them that they put greater emphasis on attack now than maybe  previous Italian sides. Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne, who plays for me at Napoli, were up front together in Italy’s training session on Wednesday and Marco  Verratti returned from injury. That may give an indication of how a 4-3-3 may start against England with Antonio Candreva supporting the attack. Tactical nous: Italy have the ability to change their tactics to suit the game under Cesare Prandelli . PERPLEXING PIRLO . Stop Pirlo and you win the game. That’s what you hear but I’m afraid it’s not that easy. In Italy teams go man to man on Pirlo when they play Juventus. Yet Juventus have other good players who can develop the game. Even then Pirlo has such experience and intelligence that you normally see him, little by little, finding more space as the game goes on. Juventus showed statistics this week that he has passed the ball 11,551 times in 11,344 minutes. Italy have De Rossi too who is able to move teams around. It helps if your forwards stifle  the supply but England have enough quality to make Italy worry about them rather than all focus on Pirlo. Gerrard can dominate, Frank Lampard is clever at finding pockets of space if he plays and the others in front must use intelligent movement. Key player: If England stop Andrea Pirlo, they can win the game on Saturday night . SET-PIECES . Potentially, with two fairly equal sides, this could be the determining part of the game. Gerrard and Lampard, two players I know well, have great accuracy and success rate whether with crosses or  goals. The pace and delivery  on a moist surface is  absolutely key. Pirlo scored seven goals from free-kicks last season if you include his final one against Cagliari so is an obvious danger but Mario Balotelli is very strong too. Strong: Mario Balotelli could be a danger from set-pieces should he feature . and THE PITCH? The images of the Manaus pitch don’t look good. The patches of sand, interspersed with the long grass, it means the ball will not run true and will bobble. The dryness slows the ball so it puts more emphasis on accuracy of pass and speed. Doesn't look good: Quick passing will be key on a poor Manaus pitch which is sure to see the ball bobble .","Control of the Group D game in the heat of Manaus will be key .
Italy are capable of mixing up their tactics to suit the opposition .
If England stop Pirlo they could win their opener in Brazil .
The pitch may be an issue, so the speed of the passing is key ."
"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . On the flip chart outside England’s dressing room in Miami last week, Roy Hodgson had made it clear that the players were not to discuss the strengths of individual Italians. Gianluigi Buffon, one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game, was off limits. So, too, was former Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli. The same rule applied to Andrea Pirlo. During routine interviews after England’s 0-0 draw with Honduras in the Sun Life Stadium, Jordan Henderson, Phil Jagielka, Joe Hart, Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson were all on message. On Saturday, in the Arena Amazonia, Henderson will be obliged to carry out a different set of instructions on behalf of the England team. He must keep Pirlo quiet. Getting stuck in: The combative style of Jordan Henderson (left) will be a key element of England's game plan . Sitting deep in midfield alongside captain Steven Gerrard, the plan is for Henderson to pounce on Pirlo the moment the Italian maestro is in possession of the ball. England’s opening match of the 2014 World Cup has become the biggest game of Henderson’s short international career. Pirlo is a human carousel, constantly dictating speed and tempo for his team as he attempts to finish his career with the Azzurri by winning his second World Cup. When the ball arrives at his feet, he is capable of switching the emphasis of Italy’s attack in a flash or fizzing the ball into a team-mate. With that in mind, Hodgson will attempt to cut off the supply line by detailing Wayne Rooney to drop into a deeper position the moment England lose possession. The human carousel: Andrea Pirlo (second right) mesmorises England's players during Euro 2012 . Hodgson wants to reduce the temptation for Italy’s defenders - Matteo Darmian, Giorgio Chiellini, Gabriel Paletta and Andrea Baragli - to keep feeding Pirlo. Full of running: Henderson's energy will be key to stopping Pirlo . When they can find the Italian maestro, it will be Henderson’s job to stop him twisting in the centre of the pitch and distributing those penetrating through balls. Earlier this week it is believed that Jack Wilshere was asked to play the ‘Pirlo role’ in training a number of times to test Henderson’s flexibility and suitability to the role of keeping the Italian quiet. If Henderson can do a number on Pirlo, then England’s chances of winning their opening group game will be dramatically enhanced. It is a big night for the Liverpool midfielder, but he will have the security blanket of Gerrard alongside him. Together they are a formidable presence. ‘I can only do my best when I am called upon and make sure that I train hard,’ said Henderson. ‘I have been preparing myself well and if I do play I will make sure I give everything I have got. ‘We are a very close group and we want to do well.’ In the build-up, Hodgson’s training sessions at England’s military training base in Rio de Janeiro have been short but intense. He has taken many of the sessions himself because his assistant manager Ray Lewington has had a knee operation. It is there that Hodgson has worked on attacking and defensive duties with his team as the countdown continues to this testing opener. Dynamic duo: Together Henderson and Steven Gerrard (right) are a formidable presence . ‘It benefits me to have been playing different roles for Liverpool and England,’ added Henderson. ‘I have gone through some different experiences but it has been nice to be playing in the middle for a lot of the season. ‘Steven Gerrard has been a big influence. He leads on the pitch, or sets an example to all of us on or off the pitch by talking to players and encouraging them. ‘He is a top player and he is a top person as well.’ On Saturday, Henderson will have the chance to come out on top.","Henderson must keep Pirlo quiet in England's World Cup clash with Italy .

"By . Ian Drury . and James Slack . Minister James Brokenshire insisted 97 per cent of standard passports were being processed on time . The passport crisis has thrown the spotlight on little-known immigration minister James Brokenshire after he spectacularly misjudged the gravity of the situation. Despite backlogs of 500,000 applications and travellers being forced to cancel holidays and business trips because of delayed documents, Mr Brokenshire blithely insisted HM Passport Office was on top of the issue. Even yesterday the crisis showed no sign of easing with queues snaking out of Passport Offices up and down the country. In a Commons adjournment debate on Tuesday, followed by an interview with Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, the Tory minister insisted that 97 per cent of standard passports were being processed on time within three weeks. In fact, he maintained, the ‘significant surge’ of applications was good news – ‘an indication that as the economy is improving, more people are understandably planning to travel’. And there was definitely no crisis. In his radio interview, he said: ‘It is certainly fair to say the Passport Office has seen a significant increase in demand for its service during the months of this year between January and now. ‘But the Passport Office’s figures for performance are showing that for those straightforward cases of renewals, child applications, that they’re turning those around at around 97 per cent in three weeks, 99 per cent in four weeks.’ But a day later, David Cameron said ‘sorry’ for the fiasco as emergency measures were brought in to tackle the backlog – three weeks after it was first highlighted by the Daily Mail. Home Secretary Theresa May also initially rejected claims the passport service was in chaos but said ‘very, very high’ demand for passports had caused some delays. A day later, the Mail revealed that families hit by the passport crisis were being asked to pay £55.50 extra per person to save their summer holidays by fast-tracking their documents.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Manaus, the city England didn’t fancy. ‘The place to avoid,’ said Roy Hodgson sagely, before the draw, while FA chairman and mime-artist Greg Dyke performed his now-infamous throat slice when the balls conspired to bring them together with Italy in this jungle city. At midday on Thursday, temperatures were pushing through 30°C and the air was thick with oppressive humidity of around 70 percent, which is what you might expect in the heart of the world’s largest equatorial rainforest. With its howler monkeys, pink dolphins and mosquitoes it is a long way from Croydon for the England manager and his players. VIDEO Scroll down to see England arrive in Manaus ahead of their game against Italy . Arrived: Wayne Rooney makes his way from the team coach towards the hotel in front of the fans . Camp: Frank Lampard arrives in Manaus with the rest of the England squad ahead of Saturday's Italy clash . To cope with the heat at the Arena da Amazonia, guards shifted their seats to keep in the shade, volunteers shuffled around using brollies for parasols and deliverymen dripped with sweat as they  carried in cases of refreshments. From the outside the stadium gleamed, designed as it is to resemble the straw baskets produced in the Amazon region, with 44,500 seats which are the colours of tropical fruits. But in the bowels of the stadium, cleaning staff — many wearing masks — were starting a deep clean of England’s dressing room. The FA’s head of media Mark Whittle claims only one member of England’s support staff will visit the stadium ahead of kick-off to inspect the facilities. They are in for a busy afternoon. Surprised: England goalkeeper Joe Hart looks stunned that so many fans turned out to see the team into their hotel . Home: Rickie Lambert and Chris Smalling look on as the England team arrive at their Manaus hotel on Thursday . As well as the race against time  to make sure the dressing-room areas are fully ready and operational, the baths are understood to still be filthy. There is also builders’ dust covering many of the areas including shower rooms, toilets, coaches’ suite and massage room. There are also piles of rubble outside the dressing-room areas and a broken fence by the players’ entrance. Two of the workers, who were supposed to be part of the clean-up operation, were lying down and playing with their iPads outside on a grass verge. What happens to the stadium after the World Cup is unclear. It is one of those new-builds with the look of a white elephant, in what is not a football hotbed, but this problem has been shoved aside. There is a party about to start. England versus Italy is the first of four group games here and there were sponsors’ stalls to be erected and car parks to organise. There are also air-conditioned marquees, including one set up for the media at one end of the city’s Sambadrome, where the annual carnival procession ends. On the roof, television cameras were fixed in place, cables were being connected and a small buggy, the sort which might bring drinks on to the cricket field, buzzed around the dusty concrete passages beneath the stands. The big screen was working well as it ran through an England team featuring Frank Lampard and Jack Wilshere. Take your pick: England stars Rooney, Gerrard and Lampard grab their luggage as they get off the coach in Manaus . New kid: Luke Shaw arrives alongside England manager Roy Hodgson ahead of their World Cup start . Not bad: Glen Johnson tweeted the view from his room in Manaus upon his arrival . Newly laid grass verges gasped for a drop of water, fresh tarmac  glistened in the heat and signs affixed to the perimeter fence  forbade all manner of items to be brought in on match-day. These included guns, quite understandably, and flour, less so, and musical instruments and the ear-piercing vuvuzelas which provided the soundtrack to South Africa’s World Cup four years ago. Not good news  for the England  supporters’ band, but Hodgson and his players have more pressing concerns, most notably the quality of the pitch. It was very dry and uneven and bare in patches, despite a torrential downpour on Wednesday which left water standing in the streets, and is unlikely to ease the fears raised by Hodgson before the squad left Rio. Both teams are due to train at the stadium later today. Hopefully it plays better than it looks. A sluggish surface will not help Italy with their passing style any more than it does England, but there will be a furious reaction from all sides if anyone suffers a pitch-related injury at the start of a tournament which is beamed around the world. From afar, the Institute of Groundsmanship issued a statement to say: ‘With such technology now available there really is no excuse for any stadium — wherever it is in the world — to not have a first-class pitch. Therefore you have to question at a local level the  decision-making processes leading up to the tournament.’ Feel the heat: Adam Lallana gets sprayed during England's training in Rio . How it looks to the global TV audience may worry FIFA more. There was little visible work being done yesterday, apart from one man pulling a garden rake and another who appeared to be spraying green paint or powder onto the barest patches to enhance appearances. However, the FA have been encouraged by reports from pitch experts STRI who are responsible for England’s training pitch in Rio that, although it looks bad, they think it will not play too poorly. FIFA are also playing down the pitch concerns. ‘The pitch in Manaus has been undergoing treatment in preparation for the World Cup,’ said a FIFA spokesman. ‘Over the last three months, mitigation procedures have been put in place and there continues to be significant improvement. Pitch experts from FIFA and the Local Organising Committee are satisfied that the pitch will be ready for training and the matches, and have been based in Manaus to ensure that all proper procedures are in place.’ It will be a shame if the pitch lets Manaus down, since this city built on rubber is positively bouncing at the prospect of hosting the World Cup, with streets decked out with green-and-yellow bunting. The tensions between Mayor Arthur Virgilio Neto and Hodgson were eased by England’s diplomatic mission in February and the 1.8million people who inhabit Manaus cannot wait for it all to begin.","England arrive at their hotel in Manaus with temperatures pushing through 30°C and the air was thick with oppressive humidity of around 70 percent .

As if losing 3-1 with some controversial refereeing decisions playing a key part wasn't harsh enough on Croatia, they could be set to lose star playmaker Luka Modric for their must-win game against Cameroon. Real Madrid midfielder Modric is a doubt for Croatia's second game after picking up a foot injury in his side's loss to Brazil in the tournament opener. Croatia team officials said that Modric was taken to a hospital in Salvador, near the squad's training base, to check the extent of his injury after feeling pain. Marked man: Modric is Croatia's key man in midfield but is likely to be missing when they face Cameroon . Modric's absence in the June 18 match against Cameroon would be a major blow for Croatia, who sit joint bottom of Group A with the African outfit, who lost 1-0 against Mexico on Friday. The skillful Real Madrid midfielder is the backbone of the powerful Croatian midfield and could prove difficult to replace, although his absence could allow Barcelona-bound Ivan Rakitic to move into a more familiar advanced role.

A backline of Tom Boyd, Christian Dailly and the two Colins, Hendry and Calderwood, were handed the unenviable task of keeping Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Bebeto quiet. And for more than 300 seconds they did, before centre-back Cesar Sampaio nodded a Rivaldo corner past Hibernian goalkeeper Jim Leighton. Colourful setting: Stade de France hosted the the opening ceremony of the 1998 France World Cup . The goal stirred Craig Brown’s side into life, and rather than a resounding Brazil win like many predicted, the Scots were able to force their South American opponents back. Seven minutes before half-time they were level, through John Collins, who swept a penalty beyond the dive of Taffarel after a Sampaio foul on Kevin Gallacher. All square: John Collins (centre) drew Scotland level in their 1998 World Cup opener against Brazil via a penalty . Scotland repelled wave after wave of Brazil attacks in the second half before disaster struck in the 78th minute. A hopeful chipped pass towards the overlapping Cafu was flicked at goal, and Leighton could only push the ball into the chest of the recovering Boyd. With Leighton out of position time appeared to stop as the ball slowly bounced off Boyd and into the bottom corner, to hand Brazil a 2-1 win. Heartbreaker: Scotland defender Tom Boyd (centre) scored a late own goal to give Brazil a 2-1 win . 2002: May 31, Seoul World Cup Stadium, Seoul . France 0-1 Senegal . Even without Zinedine Zidane, who was ruled out of the opening match through injury, France were expected to roll over a Senegal side making their first appearance at a World Cup. El-Hadji Diouf and Papa Bouba Diop, who had just finished a season in Ligue 1 with Lens at the time, had other ideas. They, along with their nine tireless team-mates, produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history to stun the defending champions and captivate a global audience, very few of whom would have given them a chance before kick-off. Huge shock: Papa Bouba Diop (right) scored the only goal in Senegal's World Cup win against France in 2002 . In midfield, Diop dominated Patrick Vieira, of Senegalese origin, and Emmanuel Petit. The Senegal star, nicknamed ‘The Cupboard’ on account of his considerable frame, scored the only goal of the game in the 30th minute, scooping the ball home following fine play from Diouf, who terrorised the French defence throughout. France’s coach Roger Lemerre threw on Christophe Dugarry and Djibril Cisse in an attempt to turn the tide, but as the reigning champions pushed on Senegal looked the more likely to score, and Khalilou Fadiga glancing a header off the crossbar late on. Threat: El-Hadji Diouf (right) proved a constant menace to then World Cup holder France in their 1-0 victory . 2006: June 9, Allianz Arena, Munich . Germany 4-2 Costa Rica . Barclays Premier League fans will have enjoyed seeing former Derby County favourite Paulo Wanchope strike twice against the hosts in Munich on the opening day of the 2006 World Cup, although his brace was not enough to stop Germany marching to the top of Group A. The Allianz Arena was the stage for some fabulous long-range strikes, as Jurgen Klinsmann’s side started their campaign with a 4-2 win. Philipp Lahm got things started in the sixth minute, cutting in from his station on the left and curling an unstoppable shot into the top right corner. Thunderbolt: Germany's Philipp Lahm (left) scored the 2006 World Cup opening goal vs Costa Rica . But six minutes later Costa Rica were level, Wanchope sweeping the ball past Jens Lehmann for his first of the afternoon. Before the mid-point of the first half Germany were back in front, when Miroslav Klose poked home Bastian Schweinsteiger’s off-target effort. For 44 minutes, quite amazingly considering the thunderous opening to the match, there were no goals, until Klose added his second from close range after his initial header was saved by Jose Porras. Party pooper: Striker Paulo Wanchope (centre) scored twice for Costa Rica against hosts Germany in 2006 . Not long after Wanchope reminded English fans of his pedigree, clipping the ball over Lehmann to draw the hosts back to 3-2 and set up an anxious finale. Cue, Torsten Frings. The scraggly-haired midfielder, who had threatened from long-range throughout the game, lashed the ball into the top corner from 35 yards to settle German nerves and ensure the hosts started the World Cup with a win. Predator: Miroslav Klose scored Germany's second and third goals in their 4-2 win vs Costa Rica in Munich . 2010: June 11, Soccer City, Johannesburg . South Africa 1-1 Mexico . As the South Africa team emerged on to the pitch at Soccer City after dancing their way down the tunnel they were given a thunderous reception from their vibrant fans in the stands. And despite a fairly low-key first half, which saw Mexico go close through Guillerme Franco and have a Carlos Vela goal chalked off when he was quite clearly onside, the game burst to life in the 55th minute courtesy of Siphiwe Tshabalala’s left foot. Goal: Siphiwe Tshabalala (centre) levelled for South Africa's in their 1-1 draw vs Mexico in the 2010 World Cup . Crystal Palace favourite Kagisho Dikgacoi was the architect, scything the Mexico defence open with a perfect pass into the left-hand channel. Tshabalala hooked the ball into his stride, powered past Ricardo Osorio and then unleashed a rocket into the far corner hit with such venom it left Oscar Perez in the Mexico goal helpless. Giovani Dos Santos tried to replicate Tshabalala’s strike up the other end, but somehow Itumeleng Khune deflected his effort over. Mexico’s pressure eventually paid off when Rafael Marquez showed great composure to control the ball and curl a shot past Khune in the penalty area, though Katlego Mphela nearly restored South Africa’s lead when he struck the base of the post late on. A night that will always be remembered for Tshabalala and his thunderous left boot. Dancing for joy: South Africa players celebrate Tshabalala's (second left) goal at the Soccer City Stadium .","Sportsmail looks back at the last four World Cup opening matches .

"By . Oliver Todd . Mexico coach Miguel Herrera fancies his sides chances of causing the tournament's biggest upsets so far - by beating host nation Brazil. The Mexicans only just made it to the World Cup, narrowly edging out Panama on the final day of qualifying to reach the Intercontinental play-off where they beat New Zealand. But after seeing off Cameroon, courtesy of Oribe Peralta's goal just after the hour in rainy conditions at the Arena das Dunas in Natal, Herrera says they will now be looking to win against the competition favourites. Winners: Peralta celebrates Mexico's only goal and now their manager says they want to beat Brazil . The 1-0 win was the very least the Mexicans deserved for an enterprising display in which Giovani dos Santos controversially had two first-half goals ruled out for offside. Mexico face their biggest challenge next as they travel to Fortaleza to face the hosts in their second Group A game next Tuesday. After the win Herrera said: 'The team did great work. Team spirit: Mexico struggled through qualifying but are now 'excited' about their next game against the hosts . Masked men: The Mexicans were helped by their raucous support who were out in force in Natal . 'We need to work, now we are at the top with three points. We will go out to win the next game, we are more excited than ever. 'We will concentrate on what we have to do.' Herrera was pleased with the way his side dealt with their two early setbacks, when former Tottenham forward Dos Santos was twice, incorrectly, denied by the linesman's flag. Bring on Brazil: The Mexicans have had their confidence boosted after starting their campaign with three points . He said: 'They disallowed two goals that were valid, but we knew it could be like that. 'The important thing is that we picked ourselves up, we looked for the result and we got it.' Cameroon, who have won just one match at the World Cup finals since 1990, were underwhelming after a week of turmoil following a row between players and the national federation over bonuses. Outspoken: Herrera has a word with referee Wilmar Roldan after growing frustrated with his decisions . Close: Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez came off the bench and was unlucky not to double the lead . Coach Volker Finke, however, remained optimistic. The German said: 'We're very disappointed with the result - I think we deserved a draw. 'There's still all to play for, though, and we're going to head into the Croatia match with the intention of winning.'

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . Louis van Gaal had been asked to organise a tennis tournament. It was on a pre-season tour of America, and the then captain of Sparta Rotterdam, someone who fancied himself a bit with a racket, was happy to oblige. Only by the time Sparta’s manager Barry Hughes returned from a game of golf for what he hoped would be the latter stages of the competition, war had broken out among his players, with a raging Van Gaal at the centre of the argument. ‘It was all kicking off,’ remembers Hughes, whose Sparta side were preparing for a season in Europe back in 1983. VIDEO Scroll down to see fiery Van Gaal lose his temper in Holland training and live on TV . Brooding: Louis van Gaal does not look to happy at Holland training before their match with Spain . ‘The umpire kept calling Louis’s serves “out”. He was doing it deliberately to wind up Louis but Louis couldn’t see the funny side. 'He was like John McEnroe. But then he’s someone who wants to win that much, at whatever he’s doing. I see it as a quality but he can be a bit of a b*****d as well sometimes.’ Hughes is telling this story over a coffee in Haarlem, near Amsterdam. He’s 76 now, and retains a soft Welsh accent despite living in Holland for the past 53 years. He arrived here after serious injury denied him the chance to build a first-class career with West Bromwich Albion. He played senior first-team football in Holland instead before moving into coaching. But the man who became known as ‘The Entertrainer’ remains a respected figure. Not least for discovering a teenage Ruud Gullit and mentoring him at HFC Haarlem. Laying down the law: Van Gaal gives instructions to Wesley Sneider and (right) Robin van Persie shows strain . His eye for a player and the success he enjoyed as a manager is why Hughes is worth listening to when it comes to the new boss of Manchester United and a man about to embark on a World Cup adventure with Holland, who play Spain in Salvador on Friday. ‘I first met Louis at Sparta,’ says Hughes. ‘He was there already; the captain when I arrived. He was a midfielder. A good player. He wasn’t the quickest but he could see the situations. ‘I’d heard stories about how he used to go into the manager’s office as captain and talk about the team. When I took over he phoned me to say he wanted to talk about the team. I told him I wasn’t interested in his opinion; that I needed to form my own view of the players. And I took the captaincy off him. ‘I don’t think he liked me because of that. Even though I made him captain again in my third season, because by then we had a good team and he was playing well.’ Great Entertrainer: Barry Hughes coached Van Gaal at Sparta Rotterdam in the 1980s . They had some good players. Danny Blind, Van Gaal’s assistant with Holland in Brazil this summer, was one. Dick Advocaat was another. Born into a staunchly Roman Catholic family on August 8, 1951, Aloysius Paulus Maria van Gaal was the youngest of nine children. The family lived in the middle-class Watergraafsmeer district of Amsterdam, at No 64 Galileiplantsoen, a street divided by a canal with large areas of grass perfect for organising football matches. As John Haen, a neighbour, one-time team-mate and now the historian at RKSV De Meer FC, where they played together in the youth side, recalls, it was Van Gaal who organised the street matches and would ‘mostly make himself captain’. Van Gaal’s father worked at an oil company, so the family were more affluent than most in their neighbourhood. ‘We had the biggest car in the street,’ Van Gaal once said. ‘In the war my dad was the only one who had a car. He used to fetch potatoes 100 miles away in the south of the country for the people on our estate, who were starving.’ Louis was only 11 when his father died. ‘I hardly knew my dad,’ he said. ‘I was six when he got sick. He died of a heart attack. A hard time.’ Early leader: Van Gaal captained Sparta Rotterdam in the mid-1980s under Hughes . Van Gaal lived at home with his mother until he was 21. ‘I never wanted to leave home as a student,’ he recalled. ‘I was happy with my mum. My older brothers and sisters had left the house early.’ You cannot be serious: John McEnroe explodes at Wimbledon in 1981 . He was a decent  footballer. But his ability on the ball was not enough to make up for a lack of pace that  limited him to one non-competitive first-team appearance for Ajax, who then boasted a certain Johan Cruyff. Even now a degree of resentment exists between the two. Aware that he couldn’t make a  living from football, Van Gaal trained as a teacher. For 11 years he worked for the Don Bosco school for children with learning difficulties. ‘One thing you could never accuse Louis of is laziness,’ says Hughes. ‘He was a very successful PE teacher. Great with the kids. And he’d be up at six to go to work in Amsterdam and then drive to Rotterdam for training with us at 2pm every day. ‘If I’m honest, I never thought he would make a manager. Dick Advocaat would come in and ask questions, but Louis would never say anything. I thought he’d go back into teaching and maybe run an amateur team. I obviously didn’t imagine him coaching Barcelona, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Holland and Manchester United!’ The discipline instilled in Van Gaal by his family was something he continues to ask of his players. He can be combustible. He can be outrageous, as when he famously dropped his trousers in the dressing room to demonstrate to his Bayern Munich players that he had the balls to make tough decisions. But he was also the Dutch Jimmy Hill, leading the players’ union in the battle for higher wages. And until he took the United job he was the ambassador for a national children’s charity; a role that often reduced him to tears, even on live television. The Dutch Jimmy Hill: Van Gaal (centre) led the players' union in the battle for higher wages . Van Gaal has never lacked confidence. The way he introduced himself to the Bayern players stands out. King of Europe: Van Gaal celebrates European Cup success as manager of Ajax in 1995 . ‘I am what I am: self-confident, arrogant, dominant, honest, industrious, innovative,’ he declared.  Not everyone responds well to that. He clashed with some at Barcelona because of his authoritarian style, Rivaldo chief among them. Franck Ribery was hardly enamoured with him at Bayern, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a similar experience at Ajax. In his first spell at Ajax, during which the Amsterdam club won the European Cup in 1995, Van Gaal lost his wife Fernanda, mother of his two daughters, to cancer. He sees the private lives of his players as his business. Wayne Rooney should certainly expect his new manager to show an interest. ‘Van Gaal has a method of working with all his players; not just on the training pitch,’ the Holland winger Jean-Paul Boetius has said. ‘At club and international level he will invite players in. He wants to know all about your family, the way you grew up and what you do in your private life. But it is nothing to be scared of.’ Then Van Gaal will ask members of the United squad how they see themselves as players. ‘After a meal he will always have a talk or a chat,’ says Ajax centre back Joel Veltman. ‘I now have a different picture of him. He had been portrayed to me as a right bully. And that he was way above the squad. ‘But once I was training and playing under him, I found out he was a brilliant guy to talk to. He makes jokes and respects every player.’ Veltman says he has a great sense of humour. In the same address to the Bayern players, he said: ‘The man speaking to you now is the most irritating and arrogant football manager of Holland.’ That got a laugh. Contrary to what Hughes says, Van Gaal believes he was always destined to manage. Refuelling: Wayne Rooney on holiday in Las Vegas two years ago - Van Gaal will take an interest in his private life . In one biography he recalled growing up in Amsterdam. ‘When we were 13 or 14 my classmates and I used to hop over to the Ajax training grounds near our school,’ he said. ‘All the other boys went for the signatures of players. I went to look at the manager. I wanted to know what he was doing in training sessions with the players. It was the first season of the new manager, Rinus Michels. ‘There must have been a manager inside me, when I think of it now.’ The little boy who used to climb over the Ajax fence wants to show the world how good he is . . . before moving to Manchester United to see if he can help the club move on from the Fergie era. His history says he has the self-belief to succeed. Dutch football television presenter Wilfred Genee sums him up like this: ‘Louis van Gaal is a crazy man but I have to say he is capable of a lot. ‘It is just a pity that he knows so very well that he has such great qualities as a coach.’","Van Gaal will manage Holland against Spain at World Cup on Friday .

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . This, as Thursday demonstrated, is going to be a World Cup of wild contrasts. A tournament played out against the backdrop of rubber bullets and civil unrest. A chaotic, carnival of football inside every stadium and a growing sense of resentment among those who could not even begin to entertain paying the price of a ticket. While 11 million Brazilians continue to live in abject poverty, the team whose job it is to remind them that this is not just about FIFA suits and excess — but also about something as simple, as beautiful as a game of football — embarked on their journey. An encounter with Croatia was the first of what Luiz Felipe Scolari regards as the seven steps Brazil must climb to win what he regards as their World Cup. Ugly scenes: Protestors clash with police on Thursday afternoon before Brazil's opening game . Firing line: Police fire non-lethal rounds at protestors as tensions flare in Sao Paulo . But it remained more than a little surreal given that it was only a few miles away that riot police employed extreme measures to deal with a group of protesters numbering no more than 50. It sounded as unnecessary as enlisting the services of Sao Paulo’s Shock Battalion to escort Sepp Blatter from his car to a hotel lobby earlier this week. The difference yesterday was that people got hurt, and that is sure to have saddened Scolari and his players however much they would have been lifted by a staggering rendition of the national anthem by the Brazilian supporters who kept singing even after the music had stopped. The atmosphere was electric, the sense of excitement nerve-tingling. The night was not without its problems for the hosts. In one section of the stadium the lights appeared to fail, highlighting the fact that it takes more than a few thousand sacks of potatoes placed on seats — apparently each one was supposed to represent the weight of a small person — to establish whether it was ready for occupation. Not in the script: Marcelo (second right) scores an own goal as Brazil fall behind to Croatia . In shock: Brazil fans can't believe it as their side fall 1-0 behind to Croatia after a Marcelo own goal . But Croatia, labelled ‘the Brazilians of Europe’, also put a bit of a spanner in the works, at least until Brazil gained some composure and began to play with the finesse that propelled them to victory in last year’s Confederations Cup. That they failed to make their possession count as much as they would have liked was of little consequence in the end, the softest of penalties enabling Neymar to send this place potty. It was not the only incident that will leave Croatia aggrieved. Fortune favoured the hosts last night, as did the decisions of a Japanese referee who should wince when he watches the replays of this clash. Level best: Neymar (left) scores for Brazil to make it 1-1 and (below) celebrates . Pure relief: Brazil are ecstatic after Neymar scores to make it 1-1 against Croatia . But that will do nothing to dampen the belief that the dream can become a reality and, as Scolari  said on the eve of this game, that their time has indeed arrived. That Neymar’s time appears to have arrived too might just alter the atmosphere beyond the walls of the Arena de Sao Paulo. After this there might just be more desire to embrace the team if not the tournament as a whole. That said, even after this victory, the ITV studio in Rio was attacked by protesters who pelted it with missiles and cracked the glass. Going to ground: Fred goes down after seemingly minimal contact from Croatia defender Dejan Lovren . Come back here! Furious Croatia players charge after the referee after he awards Brazil a penalty . It will also help that, having beaten the second best team in their group, steps two and three against Cameroon and Mexico should not hold many problems. Whether it leads to a shift in the polls and the number of Brazilians in favour of hosting the World Cup rises above 50 per cent again remains to be seen. But every tournament needs the hosts to do well and this World Cup is no exception. It also needs its star players, and in Neymar Brazil certainly have one.","Riot police used extreme measures against protestors prior to the game .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Everybody has their memories of the World Cup final of 2010 and not all of them are good. English referee Howard Webb has since described it as one of the worst nights of his career and just this week Holland’s Wesley Sneijder described that sapping night in Johannesburg as the time he hit rock bottom. It was that kind of game. Ugly, boring, disappointing. Circle of life: Spain's players train before their match with Holland and they will hope to show tiki-taka isn't dead . For Spain, though, it signalled the scaling of the ultimate summit, as well as a vindication of a style of football born on the fields of Barcelona’s La Masia training ground and then moved forward by national team coach Vicente del Bosque. Four years on and Spain arrived on Brazil’s north-east coast on Thursday banging the drum for the same principles. For the world champions there really is only one way to play. On Friday they face Holland again in the opening fixture of Group B hoping only to enhance their legacy. Speaking at the pre-match press conference at the Arena Fonte Nova, Barcelona playmaker Xavi said: ‘Our philosophy is very clear. We want to dominate games by keeping possession. ‘We have had this philosophy for years and had great success. We are going to win or die with this style. We want to make  history again playing this way.’ We have lift-off: Gerard Pique (centre) jumps during a Spain training drill . One of the most attractive games of the opening stages — along with England against Italy and Germany versus Portugal — it is perhaps a shame that it has been cast as Group B’s opener. Avoiding defeat will be uppermost in the minds of Del Bosque and Holland’s Louis van Gaal but the Spanish begin this World Cup knowing  that to everybody else at least they have a little something to prove. Spain’s tiki-taka style often brings derision from those around the world incapable of playing it. Once again, many will be willing Spain to fail, perhaps taking heart from Barcelona’s struggles this season. To Del Bosque, though, his team and their style is all that matters. The rest is just noise. ‘Barcelona is a football club in Spain,’ he said, when asked if Barca’s problems would have damaging consequences in Brazil. ‘The national squad is totally separate. Anyway, we have seen this year how Spanish club football is dominant. ‘There were two Spanish clubs in the Champions League final and another won the Europa League. We draw our players from these clubs but that’s where the relationship ends.’ Talking a good game: Xavi (left) said Spain will play the only way they know how - keeping possession . While the Dutch squad has changed vastly from four years ago, Del Bosque still relies on Barcelona’s Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets. Are we approaching the end of an era for Spanish football? ‘We hope that won’t happen,’ added Del Bosque. ‘We have an Under 21 squad that won the European Championship. We have 30 per cent new players in the squad compared to last time. I am not afraid of the future.’ Spain’s qualifying record was excellent, even if goals were at times hard to find, and he knows he won’t face a Dutch team with the same brutal approach as Bert van Marwijk’s players in 2010. ‘I can’t criticise them for that now,’ Del Bosque said. ‘Louis van Gaal has worked in Spain and I hold him in high regard. ‘He is a great manager and he has retained the essence of true Dutch football in this squad.’ Ugly, boring, disappointing: Let's hope this match is better than the 2010 World Cup final . Van Gaal has more history in Spain than some may realise. As well as managing Barcelona from 1997-2000 and 2002-2003, he was also responsible for the creation of La Masia and gave players such as Xavi their first experience of top-level football. ‘I have an extraordinary memory of him,’ recalled Xavi. ‘He was basically the first coach I ever had. I owe him and I am very fond of him. ‘He was just marvellous with me and he believed in me 100 per cent.’ On Friday night on the Brazilian coast, master meets pupils once again. Many believe they may be past their best. He certainly will not. I’ve been waiting to see a top international team play with three at the back and I’m not surprised it’s the Dutch who are experimenting. It’s not an easy system but the squad has had time to work on it. It only works if the two wider men play like full backs. It’s up to Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij to move across and cover the shaded area (right) behind their flying wing backs. Arjen Robben will almost play like a striker. Free of any defensive responsibility, he can terrorise the Spanish defence. This game could  dictate the shape of the draw. The loser here is likely to face Brazil in the last 16. That might make for a short tournament.","World champions play Holland in their opening match of this tournament .

"By . Oliver Todd . Robin van Persie praised how Holland played out Louis van Gaal's elaborate masterplan to see off Spain - and the new Manchester United boss knew they would thrash the world champions, according to Robin van Persie. The Dutch striker grabbed two goals, including a stunning diving header, as 2010's losing finalists ran riot over the Spaniards. Few could see beyond Spain before kick off with their brilliant defensive record and back-to-back tournament wins providing formidable opposition, but Van Gaal's Holland ripped them apart in a stunning 5-1 win. Best buddies: Van Persie praised Van Gaal's tactics and ran over to the manager after netting his first goal . And Van Persie, set to continue under Van Gaal when he takes over at Old Trafford after the World Cup, was eager to share in some mutual back-slapping with Van Gaal, giving him the lionâ€™s share of the credit for the result. 'This is incredible and inexplicable,' Van Persie told Voetbal International. 'For us, this is a dream come true and we have to enjoy it - everyone in Holland must too. 'This is because of the coach. He has prepared us great and he predicted how the game would go. Itâ€™s incredible, because it was exactly as he and the staff predicted for us.' Precise: According to Van Persie, Van Gaal knew exactly how the game would play out against the champions . That's how it's done: Van Gaal greets Van Persie as he is subbed off in the Salvador slaughter . Van Gaal will take over the Old Trafford hotseat at the conclusion of the tournament, and United fans have been delighted with how he seems to got the best out of Van Persie after a difficult season for the former champions. In winning 5-1, Holland inflicted Spain's worst defeat in 51 years and Van Gaal's side produced a result that nobody could have expected, with some bookmakers pricing a 5-1 win at 500/1 pre-match. 'In the end, it could have been six, seven or eight,' Van Persie said. 'But, really, it couldnâ€™t be better.'
