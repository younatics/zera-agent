"A 20-year-old brown bear in Alaska's Katami National Park has been christened a 'supermom' after she adopted a year-old cub abandoned by its mother. Holly, who is officially known as 'brown bear 435', has already been observed saving the life of a cub with a broken leg in 2007. The bear with the supercharged maternal instincts, took in the abandoned grizzly when its real mother dumped him at a waterfall this summer after a male bear took more than a passing interest in her. Supermom: Holly walks through Katami with her adopted cub, (far right) and her own biological cub . Holly, who already was nurturing one cub stepped into the breach and soon her bear-sized altruism was rubbing off on her adopted son, who was seen sharing his own food with his adopted brother. According to experts this behavior is unusual and almost non-existent between two male bear cubs who are not related. The abandoned cub is thought to be around 21 months old and was dumped by his mother at Brooks Falls in Alaska in July. Distraught, the yearling would wait around for his mother to come and collect him, but one day she simply left him for her new mate. Fishing lessons: The adopted cub (right) faced certain death if Holly had not adopted him after his mother left him . Relaxing: This is the second time in seven years that Holly has adopted a cub left to die by its mother . Park officials who had watched the whole emotionally fraught episode unfold could not intervene and save the bear because of official policy to let nature take its course. However, when they returned they discovered Holly teaching the cub how to fish. Holly allowed the cub to join with her and her own offspring and according to Newser and Alaska Dispatch they have become inseparable. While Holly is obviously saving the life of the cub, experts also believe she could be preserving her own life and cubs too for good measure. They think that the adopted cub will provide another warm body for the winter.","Holly, lives in Katami National Park and her maternal behavior has amazed seasoned bear watchers ."
"There was the same languid stride, opening up to cover the pitch; the same fiery will to win when he slid, sometimes rashly, into tackles and a muscular core that defied opponents to win the ball off him. Paul Pogba, the £60million midfielder, was the man of the match as France beat Nigeria 2-0 on Monday and for Arsene Wenger, watching in the stands for French TV, and France manager Didier Deschamps there must have been some wistful memories. For Wenger they would have been fond recollections of a towering presence in his Arsenal sides and, for Deschamps, of a formidable former midfield partner. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Pogba amazing freestyling for France in training . The only way is up: Pogba points to the heavens after scoring in France's win against Nigeria . Eyes on the prize: Pogba follows the flight of the ball before looping a header to make it 1-0 . Complimentary: France legend Patrick Vieira has compared the midfield to himself . Decorated: Vieira played 106 times for France, wining the World Cup in 1998 and the Euros two years later . Yohan Cabaye, the tactical brains of . this France team, sensed it too. ‘Fortunately for us he is like Patrick . Vieira,’ said the former Newcastle United midfielder. ‘He . is very important for the team dynamic, and we just enjoy playing . together with him. That unity is the best way for us to progress as far . as we can.’ And the Manchester City coach, former Arsenal captain and icon of the greatest France team, indulges the comparison. ‘People . say he’s like me — I guess we have similar power in possession and he’s . strong, quite tall, an elegant player,’ said Vieira. ‘But . in his head he’s more attacking than I ever was. I would win more balls . but he’s more technical. He’ll become one of the best in the world.’ Full flow: Pogba powers past Ogenyi Onazi during France's last-16 victory at Estadio Nacional .

Formidable: At Juventus, Arturo Vidal and Pogba have formed an exceptional central-midfield partnership . VIDEO Pogba staying put . HEAD MASTERAt 6ft 1in Pogba is three inches shorter than Vieira but still stands out in central midfield. Unlike many tall players, who don’t need to try to win headers, he has good spring and a well-timed leap, as demonstrated for the opening goal against Nigeria.DICTATORVieira rates him a much better technical player than he was, though the former Arsenal man had a decent pass on him too. Nevertheless, an in-form Pogba has that rare ability to dictate a game with the quality of his distribution.TOUGH IN THE TACKLEHe is formidable — just ask Nigeria’s Ogenyi Onazi, who was targeted early in Monday’s match. As that challenge showed though, Pogba can be indiscriminate and so he risks being sent off if he can’t rein in his natural aggression.BOX-TO-BOX MANPogba isn’t slow, but he is more of a 400m runner than an out-and-out sprinter. Once his long legs open up their stride, he can chase down most players. As such, he is the ideal ‘box-to-box’ English midfielder.TOWER OF POWERThe comparison with Vieira bears up best when you consider his body strength. His physicality is his prime attribute and it’s near enough impossible to get the ball off him if he is focused on his task.BIG ENGINEHe’s young so it will take time to develop. Decision-making in the final ball could improve. ‘He likes running for the ball,’ said one scout.'Not sure how much he likes running to get it back.’ That . determined attitude led to his falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson at . United. At the time, in 2012,  Ferguson and the then chief executive . David Gill would not buckle when faced with the wage demands of Pogba . and Raiola. The fact that . the player was friendly with Mario Balotelli and enjoyed hanging out . with the Manchester City striker at the San Carlo restaurant in the city . is also unlikely to have endeared him to Ferguson. Part of Pogba’s argument was he expected first-team football; he made just seven appearances for the club, but was only 18. United . refused to back down, and Pogba left for Juventus. With hindsight, it . looks like the equivalent of winning a  battle but losing the war: the . Frenchman certainly looks a perfect fit for United’s midfield now. That . said, at 21 he remains raw and his decision-making with the final pass . at times against Nigeria was awry. ‘He is still young and he has a lot . of things to learn,’ said Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham goalkeeper and . France captain. ‘But that . kind of game can help him to get more confidence because to score and be . decisive in the last 16 of a World Cup is a big thing.’ Let go: Pogba in action for United's youth team in an FA Youth Cup semi-final versus Chelsea . Stalled: But the Frenchman was given few first-team opportunities at Old Trafford by Sir Alex Ferguson . Deschamps was under pressure to drop Pogba for Moussa Sissoko, as his displays had not been what France hoped for and expected. ‘He . kept his confidence even though he has been getting a lot of . criticism,’ said Cabaye. ‘He stays relaxed. He knows the team is with . him. Against Nigeria he showed what he can do and it is the best way to . give a response to those who criticise.’ He . certainly demonstrated his physical prowess — at times too well. His . early tackle on Ogenyi Onazi infuriated Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi. Deschamps had stressed to Blaise Matuidi and Pogba that they would have . to match the strength of the Nigerians in midfield. They seemed to take the message a step too far, with Onazi taken off with a serious ankle injury after one Matuidi challenge. Specimen: Pogba is tall, muscular and quick on the ball, making him a nightmare for his opponents . Powerful: Pogba has emerged as one of the most complete midfielders in Europe during his time in Serie A . What could have been: United let Pogba leave and now he has become a star for club and country . VIDEO Pogba can replace Pirlo - Conte . And . though Pogba rose well to score his header and hit an excellent . first-half volley, France’s win had as much to do with Mathieu . Valbuena’s steady work and the introduction of Antoine Griezmann. Nevertheless, . there is a feeling among the French that the goal and accolades that . followed will allow Pogba to fulfil the role prepared for him. ‘It was . one of the biggest evenings of my career but the victory is more . important than the goal,’ said Pogba. ‘It’s liberating for the team. I . play for the team, for France.’ ‘History . is repeating itself’ was the front-page headline of France’s sports . daily L’Equipe yesterday and they dared to reference those great teams . of 1998 and 2006. After . all they have Deschamps, who lifted the World Cup in 98, and perhaps . they have Vieira’s replacement.

"These are the e-fit images of two of the suspects wanted over the shooting of South African national football captain Senzo Meyiwa. Police created the images from witness accounts of Sunday's killing of the popular footballer, whose death in an apparent robbery has dismayed South Africans. Both suspects have high cheekbones and dreadlocks. One is wearing a hood and the image of the other suspect is shown twice - with a hat and without one. A third suspect was not depicted. Wanted: E-fit images of two of the suspects wanted over the shooting of South African footballer Senzo Meyiwa . Headgear: The hat that one of the suspects wore during the apparent robbery in a township near Johannesburg . Meyiwa, goalkeeper for South Africa and club team Orlando Pirates, will be buried on Saturday in his home town of Umlazi on the country's east coast, his club said. His death in Vosloorus township near Johannesburg led to an outpouring of despair and anger in South Africa, which has a high murder rate. South African police have offered a reward of nearly $23,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Meyiwa's killers. Two of the suspects entered the home that Meyiwa was visiting and demanded money and cellular telephones, while a third kept watch outside, according to police and witness accounts. They fled on foot after the shooting and the police force has launched a huge operation to find them. No arrests have been announced. Meyiwa's funeral this weekend will be partly organised by the local government of the Kwazulu-Natal province, Orlando Pirates said. Top South African sports officials visited Meyiwa's family in Umlazi on Tuesday to offer their condolences, while the South African Football Association said it had received messages of sympathy from countries including Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Sao Tome and Principe, Egypt and Jordan. Egyptian club Al Ahly, which beat Meyiwa's Orlando Pirates in a 2013 final to win Africa's top club title, said it was saddened by 'the tragic loss of such a highly admired player.' 'Highly admired player': Meyiwa, in his black goalkeeper's strip, in action during the Orange AFCON, Morocco 2015 Final Round Qualifier match between South Africa and Nigeria at Cape Town Stadium on September 10 . Meyiwa's funeral will be held on the same day as the burials of two other prominent figures in South African sports. Former 800m world champion and Olympic silver medalist Mbulaeni Mulaudzi was killed Friday in a car crash and female boxer Phindile Mwelase died Saturday in a hospital after being in a coma for two weeks following a bout. South Africa's sports ministry said it was 'a very difficult week.' An earlier setback was the case of Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee Olympic runner who was sentenced to five years in prison last week for killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter. Prosecutors, who had sought a murder conviction against Pistorius, say they will appeal the verdict and sentence.","Both suspects pictured have high cheekbones and dreadlocks .

"Widespread advice to avoid exposure to the sun is under question after a study suggested that sunbathing has startling benefits to health. Despite its strong links with skin cancer, they found that exposure to the sun seems to cut the odds of heart attacks and an early death – on top of the widely accepted benefit of healthy bones. But British experts stressed that skin cancer can kill. A team from the University of Copenhagen analysed the health records of the entire population of Denmark over the age of 40 – more than four million people – and found that those who had been diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer were four per cent less likely to have suffered a heart attack than others. Risky?  The sun seems to cut the odds of heart attacks and an early death . They were half as likely to have died young and the data suggested their bones were stronger. ‘The overall data indirectly suggest that sun exposure for many individuals may have beneficial health effects and therefore question the widespread advice that sun exposure should be avoided,’ they reported  in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Non-melanoma skin cancer, which develops in the upper layers of the skin, is one of the most common cancers in the world. There are an estimated 100,000 new cases every year in the UK, but survival rates are high. It is distinguished from the more serious and rarer melanoma, which can spread quickly to other parts in the body and kills 2,000 people in Britain every year. Non-melanoma skin cancer, which develops in the upper layers of the skin, is one of the most common cancers in the world . British experts questioned the conclusions. Dr Claire Knight, of Cancer Research UK, said: . ‘Overexposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds is the main cause of skin cancer. ‘We all need some sun in our lives to make vitamin D, which is crucial for healthy bones. But the key is to enjoy the sun safely and avoid sunburn.’ The Danish researchers sounded a note of caution by saying that sun-worshippers might benefit simply from making more vitamin D, which is credited with a host of health benefits. It could also be that they have a more healthy, outdoor lifestyle.","Study suggests people who sunbathed are half as likely to die young .

Daring: Despite not having two-eyed stereoscopic vision to judge distances and the speed of approaching objects accurately, he showed little trouble killing his first bull in front of a crowd of 5,400 . He then dedicated the second 1,100lb beast to his tearful father, fulfilling what he described as an 'unquenchable desire to face a fighting bull with the aid of only a cape and a sword'. He said: 'This is like a dream come true after so many months. I am fully aware that nobody thought I would be back. 'But I am not a hero, just someone who has been given the chance to stay alive and continue his passion.'

"Pro-Russian rebels have shot down a helicopter from the skies above Slaviansk in eastern Ukraine with nine people thought to have been killed in the single burst of violence. The Ukrainian helicopter was carrying military cargo when it was brought down by the rebel fire. Only days ago did new Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko initiate his ceasefire for the region in an attempt to quell the violence which has been plaguing the region for months. Scroll down for video . Putin, right, spent today discussing the conflict with his Austrian counterpart Heinz Fischer, left, in Vienna . Ukrainian government forces spokesman . Vladyslav Seleznyov confirmed the helictoper had been shot down, . stating: 'There was a three-man crew, in all, nine people (on board).' The violence comes just as Russian president Vladimir . Putin staged an extraordinary retreat in seeking the withdrawal of a . resolution by the Russian parliament allowing him to send Russian troops . into Ukraine. His climbdown appeared to be a victory for the West's threat of brutal new sanctions unless he backed peace moves in Ukraine. Russian . senators granted Mr Putin the right to send the army into Ukraine on March 1, but yesterday he called for the removal of this threat against . his neighbouring state. While the West remained wary, the Kremlin claimed Putin was committed to 'normalising the atmosphere and resolving the situation in the eastern regions of Ukraine'. However, the Russian strongman is adamant that the Ukrainian government must hold direct talks with separatist leaders which Kiev has labelled 'terrorists'. And he retains 65,000 troops on active combat alert in central Russia. Mr Poroshenko dubbed Mr Putin's surprise move his 'first practical step' in support of the peace plan to end the worst east-west conflict since the end of the Cold War in which at least 375 have perished. Until now, the West saw Mr Putin as pouring fuel on crisis in a bid to destabilise Ukraine because its new government was looking towards Europe rather than Russia. There were genuine fears he could invade eastern Ukraine. The US and EU had threatened Mr Putin with sanctions that would damage entire sectors of his already ailing economy unless he showed his backing for the peace plan. Ukrainian government army volunteers taking the oath of allegiance after agreeing to help operations in the east on Monday . The volunteers joined the government battalion Azov and will help in Donetsk and Lugansk . They also spent time praying before they head east where nine of their new colleagues have just been killed . Until now, Moscow has scoffed at the penalties imposed by the West over the March annexation of Crimea. But yesterday the Russian financial markets surged and the rouble rose to its highest level since mid-January. Mr Putin acted after initial talks between Poroshenko's envoy, ex-president Leonid Kuchma, and separatist leaders. Despite this, a ceasefire agreed to by the rebels runs out on Friday, and many separatists remain opposed to any deal as evidenced by an attack on Kuchma's car in Donetsk. Mr Putin yesterday kept his forces on combat alert drilling in 'peacekeeping duties'. The West has feared such a pretext could be used by the Russian leader to send his forces into Ukraine. After a phone call between Barack Obama and Mr Putin, the White House stressed that Russian 'will face additional costs if we do not see concrete actions to de-escalate the situation'. The drill involves 180 warplanes, 60 helicopters, and 5,500 weapons. A Royal Navy warship intercepted a Russian military vessel that strayed close to Nato-protected waters in the Baltics in an echo of the Cold War. HMS Montrose, a Type 23 frigate, was taking part in a multinational exercise off the Danish coast when she was dispatched to investigate an unidentified surface ship picked up on radar. Despite choppy seas and 30 knot winds, the crew identified the unknown ship as the 104 metre-long Steregushchiy-class frigate RFS Soobrazitelny skirting Danish waters as it sailed west in the Baltic Sea. As HMS Montrose closed with the Russian vessel, a Russian Ilyushin IL-20 ‘Coot’ maritime patrol aircraft was detected and appeared overhead, circling the two ships. It was one of the Royal Navy's most significant encounters with Russian warships in the region since the Ukraine crisis began. Navy chiefs said the show of strength demonstrated Nato’s resolve to protect its 28-members against any threat from the kremlin. Both the Russian vessel and aircraft appeared to be carrying out routine manoeuvres in international waters. Commander James Parkin, commanding officer of HMS Montrose, said: ‘All our interaction so far has been professional, and effective, and we have gained huge benefit from working so closely with our allies in such a busy and challenging environment.’ Lieutenant Chloe Lea, HMS Montrose’s watch officer, said: ‘We picked up a vessel on our radar that was not showing any of the normal behaviour expected of merchant vessels or allied warships. We have seen the Russians operate a lot in this area but this is the closest we have seen them.’ Plymouth-based HMS Montrose, which has 205 crew and is armed with Sting Ray torpedoes, Sea Wolf missiles and Harpoon missiles, is taking part in the US-led exercise involving warships, submarines and helicopters from 14 different nations. Last week two RAF fighters shadowed seven menacing Russian warplanes that flew too close to Baltic airspace. The fully-armed Typhoons from 3 (Fighter) Squadron were scrambled after unidentified aircraft were detected by Nato air defences in international airspace. All were subsequently identified as Russian. Four Typhoons were deployed to the region in April under orders to respond forcefully to any violation of the airspace of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania which do not have their own air defence fighters and rely upon Nato.","Nine killed in eastern Ukraine as rebels shoot down Ukrainian helicopter .

"A volunteer medic tweeted ‘I’m dying’ after she was shot in the throat, as violence exploded on the streets of Kiev again yesterday. Olesia Zhukovska, 21, was able to send the message just moments before she lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital for an emergency lifesaving operation. A shocking photograph of Ms Zhukovska being led from the protests on Independence Square with blood seeping from a neck wound has since gone viral, being shared thousands of times. Scroll down for videos . Shocking: This photograph of Ms Zhukovska being led from the protests with blood seeping from a neck wound has been shared thousands of times online . The 21-year-old was able to send this tweet, which reads 'I'm dying', just moments before she lost consciousness and was rushed to hospital for an operation . In the photograph Ms Zhukovska, a volunteer medic working with EuroMaidan protesters, can be seen clutching her mobile phone as blood soaks into her scarf and white medical vest. The tweet she sent would have been sent around this time as Ms Zhukovska reportedly lost concioseness shortly after leaving Independent Square.It is believed she was subsequently taken to Kiev’s Number 17 hospital, before being moved the Institute of Neurosurgery. Lawmaker Iryna Herashchenko of UDAR party visited her in hospital yesterday evening, reportedly telling the Kiev Post: ‘She gained consciousness already’. Ms Zhukovska’s profile on Maidaners media project suggests she has been a part of the protests in Kiev since they first erupted back in November. Although she returned to her hometown of Kremenets in Ternopil Oblast in January, she caught a bus back into Kiev two days ago as the violence grew, according to her profile. Just 20 minutes before she was shot, Ms Zhukovska wrote online: ‘We need your support. The carnage started this morning. It can turn worse later in the day. The incident comes as the bodies of 20 civilians lay strewn on the ground after riot police were authorised to use live ammunition in place of rubber bullets. There were reports of snipers firing at protesters. And, in a chilling twist, the demonstrators took at least 67 police officers hostage, according to Ukraine’s interior ministry. As many as 70 are believed to have died and up to 500 injured – on what was supposed to be a day of mourning for those killed earlier this week. A protest doctor told AP that at least 70 protesters were killed Thursday and over 500 were wounded in the clashes - and that the death toll could well rise further .

Protesters hurled petrol bombs and paving slabs at police in a three-hour battle to recapture Independence Square, where former hotels have become makeshift mortuaries. Just hours earlier President Viktor Yanukovych had agreed a truce with opposition leaders ‘with the aim of ending bloodshed’. But after the Ukrainian leader met an EU delegation of German, Polish and French foreign ministers to discuss a ‘road map’ to peace, demonstrators held police captive in Kiev’s occupied city hall. The country’s parliament building and the foreign ministry were evacuated because of fears that protesters would storm them. Last night, the EU imposed sanctions on senior Ukrainian figures as Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the violence as ‘utterly unacceptable and indefensible’. Prime Minister David Cameron made an urgent telephone call to Russian president Vladimir Putin urging him to get behind the plan for negotiations put forward by the European foreign ministers in Kiev.

At least 21 bodies were counted on the edge of the smouldering protest encampment in central Kiev and one policeman had been shot 28 times, according to reports. Dozens of bullet-riddled bodies were seen by reporters laid out in white sheets on the marble floors of hotels around Independence Square, known as Maidan. As support for President Yanukovych began to crumble, there were reports of his family and top officials leaving the country with suitcases of cash. There were varying estimates of the death toll yesterday. But Dr Oleh Musiy, the top medical coordinator for the opposition, said at least 70 demonstrators were killed and more than 500 injured. It was reported that 28 were killed and more than 500 wounded in fighting earlier this week. Riot police fire at anti government demonstrators on the Independence square in Kiev . The police snipers made no attempt to conceal themselves . This officer appears to be brandishing an automatic weapon . Live rounds: A protester holds a cartridge and two empty cases he found during clashes with police in central Kiev on Thursday . The government blamed the opposition, saying the ‘calls for a truce and dialogue were nothing but a way of playing for time to mobilise and arm militants from Maidan’. But opposition leaders called the violence ‘an act of provocation’ by the authorities. This week’s clashes are the most deadly since protests began peacefully three months ago when Yanukovych abandoned closer ties with Europe in favour of Russia. Ukraine is a nation of 46million, ethnically divided between Ukrainians who favour closer ties with Europe, and Russians who prefer links to Moscow. The president opted to sign a deal with Russia, who offered a multibillion-pound bailout for Ukraine’s severe economic problems, rather than sign a trade deal with Europe.

Protesters are calling for the resignation of Yanukovych and early elections, but the embattled leader was fighting on last night despite signs that his empire was crumbling. Leading figures left his party and troops were reported to have supplied protesters with weapons, while senior party members said he had ‘completely lost control of the situation’. European Union foreign ministers have agreed to impose sanctions on those ‘suspected of violence against anti-government protesters’. Mr Hague said yesterday: ‘Of course we call on all involved to turn away from violence, but some people are responsible for the violence and so we have decided to introduce targeted measures and targeted sanctions involving visa bans and asset freezes on those individuals who are responsible.’ Earlier the Ukrainian ambassador to London, Volodymyr Khandogiy, was summoned to the Foreign Office for the second time to be told that action to crush the protests was ‘unacceptable’.

Protest: The women were demonstrating over alleged corruption in the country, referring to Parliament as a 'stable' for the 'horses of oligarchs' Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is the leader of the main opposition party, All-Ukrainian Union, also known as 'Fatherland'. She lost the Ukrainian presidential election to Viktor Yanukovych in 2010 and has since faced a number of criminal charges. Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after being found guilty of abuse of office when brokering a gas deal with Russia in 2009. The European Union and other international organisations have ruled the conviction as 'justice being applied selectively under political motivation'. Tymoshenko is currently being held in . Kharkiv, where she is receiving treatment at a hospital . after being diagnosed with a spinal disc herniation. She is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights against her conviction. The Ukraine government commissioned a team of U.S. lawyers to compile a dossier on the case to use in its defence at the appeal. But the Daily Telegraph reports the dossier states the trial was 'flawed' and would not have met the requirements of a Western court. Gregory Craig, former White House counsel for President Barack Obama and the dossier lead author, said: 'We concluded that there were ways in which Tymoshenko was not given a fair trial.' A legal expert told the newspaper the procedural violations would have led 'to a cancellations of the verdict' in the West.

Tymoshenko remains in prison after being sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 for alleged abuse of office over a gas deal with Russia. Yanukovich's pro-business Party of the . Regions and their allies enjoyed a strong majority in the last . parliament, which allowed them to push through changes to the electoral . law and a law on use of the Russian language that sparked street . protests. Despite losing seats in the October elections, the results were seen as a consolidation of President Yanukovych's power as his party still remained the biggest in parliament. Most analysts said they believed horse-trading would ensure enough support from independents and others to secure the required 226 or more seats. But the new opposition line-up, whose leaders have ruled out any coalition with the Regions, quickly showed their teeth. Deputies from the three main opposition parties surrounded the speaker's rostrum, effectively blocking activation of the electronic system which would allow deputies to vote on Azarov's nomination and the appointment of parliamentary officials. After a prolonged stand-off, both sides went home agreeing to resume business on Thursday, according to the Regions Party. Separately, the government put off a meeting scheduled for Thursday morning.

"Russian president Vladimir Putin yesterday dramatically ordered pro-Moscow militias to scrap independence referendums planned for Sunday and claimed he had pulled his troops back from Ukraine's border. The Kremlin leader also said Ukraine's presidential elections, due on May 25, were a step 'in the right direction'. There were immediate suspicions last night that his words amounted to a ploy to temporarily ease Western concerns, offering an olive branch with no substantial change of position. Scroll down for video . Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, speaks during a meeting with Swiss Federal President Didier Burkhalter, left, in the Kremlin in Moscow today .

'Beware of this sudden move, we have . seen these tactics before,' said one Western diplomat. 'Putin has given . ground before, only to take it back again. This will be a hollow promise . to his guest.' Putin added . that the vote would do nothing to ease the crisis engulfing the eastern . European country unless the rights of 'all citizens' – including Russian . speakers – were protected. Ukraine . has repeatedly rejected separatists' demands for greater autonomy in . the south and east amid fears it could lead to the break-up of the . nation of 45million. Shortly . before Putin's about-turn Foreign Secretary William Hague, on a visit . to Kiev, launched a blistering attack on his stance during the conflict. But in a blow to hopes of a . breakthrough, Nato and the Pentagon said there was 'no indication' the . Red Army had eased tensions by withdrawing the 40,000 troops it had . stationed at the frontier. Some . militant leaders vowed to ignore Moscow's call for referendums in the . industrial regions of Donetsk and Lugansk – branded illegal by Kiev, the . US and EU – to be postponed.

Russia’s contestants for this year’s Eurovision Song Contest were booed in Copenhagen as it was announced they had qualified for the final of the annual competition. Anastasia and Maria Tolmachevy had originally received a warm reception when they performed their song Shine during last night’s semi-final. However, when the 17-year-old Tolmachevy twins were voted into the final – which is to be held on Saturday - boos from the 10,000-strong audience erupted. In contrast, the audience clapped and cheered when Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk qualified for Saturday's final too. The annual competition is supposed to be completely removed from politics. However, the Ukraine crisis has raised anew questions about the competition's scoring, which is partly done by phone voting across Europe. Even though Russia has annexed Crimea, votes from the Black Sea peninsula will count for Ukraine because the phone operator there is still Ukrainian, the EBU said. Bookmakers place Ukraine in the top 10 and Russia at the bottom. The winner is picked by juries and television viewers across Europe. The . crisis in Ukraine, which has seen Russia seize Crimea from its former . Soviet partner, is the worst between the East and West since the Cold . War. Putin made his remarks . after talks in Moscow with Didier Burkhalter, head of the Organisation . for Security and Co-operation in Europe, who promised a 'road map' to . defuse  the stand-off. In . what appeared to be a softening of his stance, Putin urged separatists . to postpone the May 11 polls because he wanted to 'create the conditions . for dialogue' after weeks in which the West accused him of fuelling . unrest. He said he had . pulled back Russian forces from the Ukraine border after 'we were told . constantly about concerns' over their positioning. Earlier, . Mr Hague warned the Kremlin was seeking to derail the impending . presidential elections, brought about following the ousting of Ukraine's . pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych in February by pro-Western . protesters. He said: 'There . should be no doubt the Russian government is trying to orchestrate . conflict and provocations in the east and south of Ukraine. 'The immediate goal is the disruption of elections, although they might also be trying to provide a pretext for intervention.' Urging . caution over Putin's latest remarks, a Western diplomat cited Geneva . talks last month involving the US and EU when Russia signed up to a . peace process to lower tension. The West claims Russia failed to . implement the deal. Putin . could be seeking to confuse or divide the West into delaying sanctions, . or seeking a window to allow pro-Moscow separatists to flee from . Sloviansk where they are besieged.

Friday the pro-Russian region of Transnistria, officially part of . Moldova, will present a petition to Putin amounting to a massive demand . to be incorporated into Russia, as happened with Crimea.

"Facial: Sergei Polonsky tweeted this picture of him having a beauty treatment, telling Lebedev 'I will appear at your nightmares' (sic) A Russian tycoon who has refused to appear at the trial of media mogul Alexander Lebedev spent last week goading him on social network sites. Sergei Polonsky has sent a series of taunts to Mr Lebedev from a luxury apartment in Israel. Mr Lebedev is accused of punching Mr Polonsky during a TV talk show in Russia in 2011. In the latest online attack, Polonsky posted a photograph of himself on Twitter having a facial treatment with white strips attached to his face giving him a ‘horror mask’ appearance. With it was the comment: ‘I will appear at your nightmares @lebedevalex :)) have a great weekend everyone.’ That image has followed others of the 40-year-old billionaire in which he is seen enjoying himself in a hot tub, kite-surfing on an Israeli beach and posing before a red sunset with an unidentified woman. Mr Lebedev, 53, whose family controls the Independent newspaper titles and the London Evening Standard, faces up to five years in jail if the judge at the Moscow trial finds he punched Mr Polonsky because of ‘political hatred’. Supporters of Mr Lebedev, who also owns a Russian investigative newspaper, say that Mr Polonsky’s games and refusal to appear in court make a mockery of the trial and his credibility as a witness. Mr Polonsky had claimed he was in Cambodia, where he is on bail facing allegations of kidnap and assault, and was unable to leave. Despite objections from Mr Lebedev’s lawyers, Mr Polonsky’s written statement has been accepted as evidence – but without him being available to be cross-examined about potentially goading his alleged attacker. Yesterday, The Mail on Sunday traced Mr Polonsky to a $1 million luxury apartment overlooking Bat Yam beach near Tel Aviv. Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev (left)  is on trial for allegedly punching businessman Sergei . Polonsky (right) because of political hatred . It is from there that he is believed to have spent the past few days continuing his campaign to undermine and embarrass Mr Lebedev. The apartment is in a Russian-built development which was constructed at a cost of $6 million two years ago. Flats in the high-rise building cost around $1 million and owners receive security from a Russian-speaking concierge. Yesterday a constant stream of luxury vehicles – many with blacked out windows – arrived at the automated security barrier before heading for the underground car park. It was revealed yesterday that Mr Polonsky was released in early April – after writing a personal appeal to the Prime Minister of Cambodia – and was then spirited out of the country first to Europe and then to the Middle East. ‘Polonsky was taken out of Cambodia on a diplomatic plane almost as luggage,’ said a Moscow source. Israel: The Mail on Sunday have tracked Mr Polonsky down to a luxury apartment near Tel Aviv . Taunts: Mr Polonsky has been tweeting pictures of himself to Mr Lebedev . ‘It happened several days after he was released from jail, perhaps even the next day.’ Last night, it emerged that his spy-style escape route may have involved a boat trip from Cambodia, – where he has a private island retreat – to Thailand with the ‘diplomatic plane’ believed to be from Bangkok. Yesterday The Mail on Sunday tried to contact Mr Polonsky on a mobile phone he is said to have been using in Israel but he did not reply to text or voicemail messages. Earlier, Mr Lebedev wrote on his blog that he believed the tycoon to be near Tel Aviv. He said: ‘I am addressing fellow bloggers from Israel: Have you seen our “victim” by any chance, somewhere on the Mediterranean coast between Ashdod and Tel Aviv? He is keenly waited at the trial.’ Mr Polonsky’s immediate reaction to Mr Lebedev’s plea was to post on Twitter: ‘@Lebedevalex calls for help, isn’t it funny.’","MoS finds Sergei Polonsky in luxury apartment near Tel Aviv .

Azarov and his government were present, the chamber echoed to opposition . cries of 'Hanba! Hanba!' (Shame!) MPs . from Tymoshenko's party wore black jerseys with her portrait on the . front and the phrase 'Freedom to Political Prisoners' on the back. Tymoshenko remains in prison after being sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 for alleged abuse of office over a gas deal with Russia. Yanukovich's pro-business Party of the . Regions and their allies enjoyed a strong majority in the last . parliament, which allowed them to push through changes to the electoral . law and a law on use of the Russian language that sparked street . protests. Despite losing seats in the October elections, the results were seen as a consolidation of President Yanukovych's power as his party still remained the biggest in parliament. Most analysts said they believed horse-trading would ensure enough support from independents and others to secure the required 226 or more seats. But the new opposition line-up, whose leaders have ruled out any coalition with the Regions, quickly showed their teeth. Deputies from the three main opposition parties surrounded the speaker's rostrum, effectively blocking activation of the electronic system which would allow deputies to vote on Azarov's nomination and the appointment of parliamentary officials. After a prolonged stand-off, both sides went home agreeing to resume business on Thursday, according to the Regions Party. Separately, the government put off a meeting scheduled for Thursday morning.

"Activists calling for Blair to resign from role as advisor to president Nazarbayev . Campaign follows the death of 14 sacked oil workers . Tony Blair has blood on his hands from his ‘consultancy’ work with the dictator of Kazakhstan, opposition leaders in the former Soviet state claimed last night. In an open letter, activists called for the former British premier to resign from his controversial role as an advisor to their president Nursultan Nazarbayev. The campaigners are part of a growing protest over a bloody Christmas crackdown on sacked oil workers in which at least 14 died and 80 were wounded. Dubious: Tony Blair and Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev in the capital Astana in November . The Daily Mail revealed in October that Mr Blair had assembled a high-powered team to improve the reputation and business links of the oil and gas-rich central Asian state. According to one source, the consultancy deal brokered by the ex-premier is worth as much as £8million for the companies involved. Mr Blair’s advisory firm, Tony Blair Associates, has helped him earn as much as £20million since leaving Downing Street in 2007, but a spokesman has insisted he is not profiting from the Kazakhstan deal. His links with Mr Nazarbayev – who has introduced laws forbidding criticism of himself, and is believed to rig his elections – have roused particular controversy because he began cultivating him a decade ago when the despot made an official visit to London. The call for Mr Blair to sever links with the regime was made by 50 activists in a letter published in the opposition newspaper Respublika, headlined: ‘Blood on Your Hands, Blair!’ The letter goes on: ‘It is known that you were an adviser to the bloody dictator Muammar Gaddafi. 'The whole world saw with its own eyes that he used weapons against civilians in his country, trying hard to suppress the riots. The bloody scenario of Libya was repeated in Kazakhstan. ‘The leadership of Kazakhstan in peacetime opened fire and shot at unarmed citizens.  Such bloody methods are being used in our country since you became an adviser to President Nursultan Nazarbayev.’ Controvertial: Blair's relationship with the late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi has been criticised by Kazak activists . The activists – young politicians, youth workers and journalists – had made an earlier appeal to Mr Blair to rethink his role. The latest open letter continues: ‘In our previous appeal we said that your support for authoritarianism and dictatorship will badly affect your reputation. Our forecasts, unfortunately, came true. 'We once again urge you to resign from the position of presidential adviser and to stop co-operating with the criminal regime.’ The letter highlighted the case of oil workers from the Mangistau region, whose ‘legitimate and fair demands were ignored for many months’. ‘There was bloodshed, the blood of innocent citizens of our country. You are an adviser to Kazakhstan’s leadership. Why within the last seven months were authorities deaf to the demands of oil workers? And finally, they shot at its citizens?’ The U.S. State Department says it is ‘deeply concerned’ over the violence and clampdown, sentiments echoed by the EU and human rights groups. Nazarbayev has blamed his son-in-law Timur Kulibayev – the head of the company that fired the striking oil workers – for the violence. Kulibayev is a friend of Prince Andrew, and bought the prince’s home in Windsor for £3million above the asking price. Mr Blair visited Kazakhstan in  January, May and November this year. Former No10 chief of staff Jonathan Powell and ex-spin doctor Alastair Campbell also visited this year. A spokesman for Mr Blair said:  ‘Tony Blair’s team has been advising on the Kazakhstan government reform programme. He has had no role in this dispute. But the president has promised an inquiry.’","Activists calling for Blair to resign from role as advisor to president Nazarbayev .

"A Russian businessman machine-gunned in London was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain for himself and his family. German Gorbuntsov’s business visa, which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008, expires next year. It is thought the 45-year-old financier, who was in hiding in London, feared he would be forced to return to Russia and into the clutches of his many enemies. Coma: German Gorbuntsov was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near Canary Wharf in an attempted assassination . Danger: There are now fears for the safety of Larisa Gorbuntsov, pictured, who flew to her husband's bedside in London . He said recently: ‘If I go back to . Russia, they will kill me.’ Last night Mr Gorbuntsov was under armed . guard in hospital after being hit up to six times. With . the would-be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the . safety of Mr Gorbuntsov’s wife Larisa, 46, and son. Mrs Gorbuntsov flew . to London to be at her husband’s bedside while their 25-year-old son . Vladislav is seeking a visa to come to Britain. Scotland . Yard yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the . shooting to come forward. Mr Gorbuntsov was shot after being dropped off . by taxi at his apartment block next to Canary Wharf on Tuesday evening. The . banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City . earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just . stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The . hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot. Shooting: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was attacked on the Isle of Dogs close to Canary Wharf. Detectives leading the investigation revealed today that they had found a weapon, said by sources to be a pistol . A . young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the . mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services . arrived. The . attack has been linked to the attempted murder of Mr Gorbuntsov’s . former business partner Alexander Antonov who was shot in Moscow in . 2009. Last night Mr . Antonov, 61, claimed he and Mr Gorbuntsov were on ‘friendly’ terms in . spite of an alleged £60million debt he owed to the victim. Last . month Mr Gorbuntsov accused two former business partners of being . responsible for the attack, allegedly to settle the debt. At one point, . the Russian authorities regarded Mr Gorbuntsov as a possible suspect. Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf . But yesterday Mr Antonov said: ‘He was not a part of the assassination attempt.’ Three Chechen men were convicted of attempted murder, but police never identified the mastermind. The . same group were said to have forced Mr Gorbuntsov and his wife to sign . over as much as £1.5billion. In 2010, Mr Gorbuntsov, fearing for his . life, fled to London. Yesterday . his lawyer Vadim Vedenin said the banker had been planning to submit a . political asylum request to stay within days. A successful asylum claim . would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on . allegations of embezzlement. There . was also a financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways, . whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin. An estimated £415million . was not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank . whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.","German Gorbuntsov, 45, feared he would be forced back into the clutches of enemies in Russia .

"A millionaire couple have launched their own private rescue service ferrying migrants adrift in the Mediterranean to Europe. Inspired by Pope Francis, Malta-based entrepreneurs and philanthropists Cristofer and Regina Catrambone have spent millions of dollars of their own money on a 140 foot ship, which made its first rescue this weekend. The Phoenix 1 picked up 227 migrants, who were floundering on an overcrowded wooden fishing vessel, before handing them over to the Italian Navy. Chris Catrambone, benefactor of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) vessel, speaks to the press before it sets sail from Grand Harbour, Valletta on August 25, 2014 for its first 20-day mission . Inspired by Pope Francis, Malta-based entrepreneurs and philanthropists Cristofer and Regina Catrambone have spent millions of dollars of their own money on a 140 foot ship, which made its first rescue this weekend . The Phoenix 1 picked up 227 migrants, who were floundering on an overcrowded wooden fishing vessel, before handing them over to the Italian Navy . Tens of thousands make the journey from North Africa every year, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats. Many die attempting the crossing. This year more than 90,000 have landed, eclipsing the record year of 2011 when swathes fled the Arab Spring. Mrs Catrambone, who is originally from Italy, says she was first touched by the migrants’ plight last summer during a Mediterranean cruise, when she spotted a winter jacket floating on the sea. The captain told her it ‘probably belonged to someone who had not survived the journey.’ But it was when Pope Francis visited the island of Lampedusa, where 366 migrants died in a shipwreck last year, that she felt compelled to act.  She said: ‘I remember an appeal the Pope made after the umpteenth drowning incident off the coast of Lampedusa. He said we must all do our own bit to help others, with the means, resources and abilities we have in our possession. ‘He said that all those who had the possibility to help the migrants had the duty to do so. Syrian refugees coming ashore after being rescued by the Italian Navy, in Palermo, Italy . ‘His words were at the heart of our initiative’, she said. ‘We could not stand by idly and watch this carnage take place.’ Following the tragedy in October last year, the couple, who also own an insurance company, decided to act sooner rather than later. They invested an estimated Euro4 million of their own money in the ship, a former expedition vessel, which includes a fully-equipped sickbay, two inflatable fast boats and two helicopter drones armed with the latest imaging technology. The Italian Navy brought to shore over 200 Syrian migrants, 49 women and 73 children, after a delicate rescue operation on the Strait of Sicily . The so-called Migrant Offshore Aid Station launched on Wednesday and aims to provide first aid as well as life jackets, food, water and blankets. But inevitably it has already become a means of ferrying migrants across the Mediterranean to Europe. Mrs Catrambone said: ‘They are desperate people. We want to make sure above all that they do not die in their desperation.’ She said the couple want to encourage other people with means to take action, ‘especially in this time of crisis when people value money more than human life.’ The ship picked up 130 men, 40 women and 57 children from Palestine and Syria after they ran into trouble in a stretch of sea south of Malta. The group were taken on board and were later handed over to the Italian navy to be brought to Italy. The NGO said on Twitter: 'No lives were lost and no injuries were incurred, besides a special needs child who needs insulin and several pregnant women.'","Cristofer and Regina Catrambone have spent millions on a 140 foot ship .

"Pope Francis has backed international military intervention to protect Christians driven from their homes by the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq. The pope, who is visiting Korea this week, has written to the United Nations in an 'urgent appeal to the international community to take action to end the humanitarian tragedy now underway'.

Pope Francis holds hands with an Indonesian youth during a meeting with Asian youth at the Solmoe Sanctuary in Dangjin, South Korea . In a letter addressed to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, he wrote: 'The violent attacks that are sweeping across Northern Iraq cannot but awaken the consciences of all men and women of goodwill to concrete acts of solidarity by protecting those affected or threatened by violence and assuring the necessary and urgent assistance for the many displaced people as well as their safe return to their cities and their homes.' Islamic State jihadists have unleashed a campaign of terror in Iraq by targeting religious minorities, forcing thousands from their homes, beheading prisoners and kidnapping women. The letter added: 'The tragic experiences of the 20th Century, and the most basic understanding of human dignity, compels the international community, particularly through the norms and mechanisms of international law, to do all that it can to stop and to prevent further systematic violence against ethnic and religious minorities.'

Creeping death: A map showing the ISIS strongholds across Iraq since the uprising began in June . Archbishop Tomasi, the Vatican observer at the UN, said the pope's use of word 'compel' meant there was 'a moral imperative, a necessity to act.' He said we should not let the bloodshed become another 'Rwanda'. He said: 'Every year when we commemorate the almost 1 million people killed in that genocide we make a kind of mea culpa saying we have not done anything effective to prevent the killing of those innocent people. 'God forbid that this may also be the same situation today.’ Francis held out an olive branch to China on Thursday when he sent greetings to the president as he became the first pontiff to cross into China's air space on his way to Korea. The atheist state has had no diplomatic relations with the Vatican since the 1950s. He also sent greetings to Vladimir Putin as he crossed Russia.","Pontiff makes 'urgent appeal' to the UN to end the humanitarian crisis .

"The Bank of England has admitted it is ‘running behind’ on publishing the expenses of its £1million governor Mark Carney. The central bank is due to disclose the expenses of its senior staff for the six months between October 2013 and March 2014 in the coming days. But, having published the last set of details late, it is now struggling to put the latest claims into the public domain as planned. The delay in releasing his expenses is embarrassing for the Bank and Mark Carney who promised to usher in an era of greater transparency when he took over as governor in July last year . The delay is embarrassing for the Bank and Mr Carney who promised to usher in an era of greater transparency when he took over as governor in July last year. The Canadian’s expenses are particularly sensitive because of his bumper pay of £874,000 a year, which includes a £250,000 housing allowance. The Bank also spent almost £200,000 moving Mr Carney and his family from Canada to London – taking his total earnings for his first year in charge to more than £1million. His predecessor Lord King was paid £309,297 in his final year as governor. The Bank only recently published details of the expenses racked up by Mr Carney for his first three months as governor – from July 2013 to September 2013. They show he spent £31,905 including £8,727 on foreign business travel to Moscow, Geneva, St Petersburg and Frankfurt. The Bank also spent almost £200,000 moving Mr Carney and his family from Canada to London – taking his total earnings for his first year in charge to more than £1million . He spent a further £339 on a lunch and two dinners while his use of the Bank’s pool of ‘secure’ cars was shown to have been worth £22,069. The Bank said it has ‘no legal requirement’ to publish the information but tries to do so with a lag of around six months in the interests of transparency and accountability. But it said publication has been delayed due to major changes at the Bank over the past year. ‘The Bank’s most recent disclosure has exceeded the desired 6-month lag,’ a spokesman said. ‘The Bank is taking concerted steps not only to bring current reporting up to date, but to put in place a more timely and frequent reporting framework on a forward basis. Transparency and accountability is of paramount importance to the Bank, and these steps will ensure that we are at the forefront of best practices in this area.’","Central bank due to disclose expenses of senior staff for six months between October 2013 and March 2014 in coming days .

"A brutal Ethopian prison guard who tortured inmates with cattle prods in the 1970s has been arrested following a chance encounter in a U.S.restaurant by one of his victims, immigration chiefs claimed today. Kefelegn Alemu Worku is also said to have beaten prisoners with rifle butts, whips and pipes during a period known as the Red Terror when up to 500,000 people died in a political purge by communist rulers. Worku was previously known as Tufa when he worked at the notorious Higher 15 detention camp - the site of many executions - according to two former inmates who identified him in a photo line-up. Arrest: The man was arrested in a cafe frequented by members of the Ethiopian community in Aurora, Colorado . He was spotted in the Cozy Cafe in Aurora, Colorado last May by a another former . prisoner who recognized him. Worku was a regular at the cafe, . which is a hangout for Ethiopian immigrants in the Denver area, said . restaurant manager Girma Baye. Worku, who worked at a parking lot and had previous held a job at Denver International Airport, has been . charged with unlawfully procuring citizenship or naturalization and . aggravated identity theft. Power: Mengistu Haile Mariam (pictured) was the most prominent officer of the Derg, Communist military junta that oversaw the Red Terror in Ethiopia during the late 1970s . If convicted of both, he faces up to 12 years . in prison and fines of up to $500,000. The Ethiopian who alerted the authorities claims he escaped from the prison in 1979, Homeland Security . Agent Jeffrey Lembke said. The three immigrants told authorities . the man they identified as Worku participated in beatings and torture . sessions that included a cattle prod, rifle butts, whips and pipes. They . also said he threatened at least one witness with an AK-47 at the . prison where detainees were regularly beaten and executed. The former prisoners had 'a very strong reason to remember, even though it was 30 years . ago,' said federal prosecutor Brenda Taylor in court. Federal public defender Matthew Golla said his client denies all of the charges. The . man entered his plea in federal court before being held without bail by . a judge who noted that he is accused of using several aliases. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen Mix also said the man faces serious accusations involving a detention center known as Higher 15. It . was established during the late 1970s in a campaign known as the Red . Terror, which Human Rights Watch has called 'one of the . most systematic uses of mass murder by a state ever witnessed in . Africa.' Years of suffering: An Ethiopian refugee camp in Ali Sabieh, Djibouti. Ethiopians have suffered terribly from the effects of war and famine during recent decades .

"When your family is as upwardly mobile as the Middletons, and your big sister has already nabbed the top prize by marrying a future King, what’s a boy to do? The answer, it would seem, is rebel. Because, if these pictures are anything to go by, James Middleton’s future wife is a single mother from a working-class Newcastle family. Of course, she is also none other  than TV presenter Donna Air – but one still cannot help wondering what  Mr Middleton’s mother Carole will say when she sees the sparkling diamond on her ring finger. Put a ring on it: Donna Air and boyfriend James Middleton are seen leaving the Serpentine Gallery summer party, and the former model flashed a ring on her ring finger . Miss Air, 33, set tongues wagging when . she was spotted wearing the ring this week, just four months after she . began dating 26-year-old Mr Middleton. She flashed the rather conspicuous diamond as she and Mr Middleton left the Serpentine Gallery summer party hand in hand. They even dressed to match, with both . looking relaxed and summery in complementary shades of blue at the event . in London’s Hyde Park. Significant: Donna flashed the platinum band which was studded with diamonds as she sat in the back of the car . Despite a whole list of celebrity . guests, including Mick Jagger and his family and actress Sarah  Jessica . Parker, the pair had eyes only for each other throughout the evening. They looked just as lovestruck  on the . way home, with Miss Air clasping Mr Middleton’s hand in both of hers as . they sat in the back of a taxi. The couple began a discreet relationship in February after meeting at 5 Hertford Street, a private members’ club in Mayfair. They were initially reluctant to be . seen together, but were soon spotted holding hands on dog-walking dates . in Hyde Park, and out for drinks with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Despite the age gap and their . different backgrounds, the relationship reportedly has the approval of . Mr Middleton’s sister Pippa, with whom he shares a flat in Chelsea. Mr Middleton works for his parents’ party products website in Berkshire and runs his own Cake Kit Company, . which produces cake-making kits and novelty cakes. He has had few girlfriends and tends . to mix with people from the same social set as Pippa and his other . sister, the Duchess of Cambridge. By contrast, Miss Air, the daughter of . a builder who began her showbusiness career as a child star in TV show . Byker Grove, has a colourful romantic past. She's on fire: New couple Donna Air and James Middleton arrive at the Serpentine Gallery Summer Party in Kensington Garden . Summer's here: Donna and James sport a relaxed look for a warm evening in Kensington . Six years ago, she separated from . multi-millionaire zoo and casino owner Damian Aspinall. The pair never . married, but had a daughter, Freya. It was rumoured they broke up after . Mr Aspinall refused to marry Miss Air. Since the split she has dated several . rich, older men, including John Dorrance IV, the London-based American . heir to the Campbell’s soup fortune, and Sam Goldstone, a Cheshire-born . millionaire. Miss Air recently told the Mail: ‘It . has been an uphill struggle, as any woman starting again knows. It . ain’t no picnic. It ain’t no walk in the park when you have children and . you go through a separation.’ Unusual: Donna teamed her turquoise blouse with the maxi skirt with a fire-patterned hemline . Comfortable: The couple, who have been dating since February, looked at ease with each other . Are they getting really serious? Donna was spotted leaving the event at the Serpentine in a taxi sporting a ring on her engagement finger . Along with her chequered love life, it . also remains to be seen quite what Mrs Middleton will make of some of . Miss Air’s professional activities. She once wrote a blog for matchmaking . website eHarmony in which she recommended ‘a spray tan, a Wonderbra, a . vodka and tonic, and high heels’ before a date. And in 2001 she presented a TV show . called Fifty Ways To Tease Your Lover, advising women to please their . boyfriends with a striptease, pole dancing and by dressing as a . schoolgirl. Loved up: the couple looked very close and tactile at the summer bash . Neither Mr Middleton nor Miss Air were . available for comment last night. But a friend insisted they were not . about to walk down the aisle any time soon, claiming Miss Air was simply . making a fashion statement with the ring. The friend said: ‘The simple answer is no, they haven’t [got engaged]. I think it’s a fashion thing girls just sometimes do.’ Friends in high places: Donna and James's pal Princess Beatrice was also in attendance .","Pair were spotted together at the Serpentine Gallery summer party .

"Scroll down for video . News of the Duchess of Cambridge’s admission to hospital yesterday, suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum – extreme morning sickness – instantly made me relive the agonies of my first pregnancy 15 years ago. How I feel for our future Queen. I was 34, just over three years older than Kate is now. I remember how the joy and excitement at the thought of a baby on the way was overshadowed by the sudden and violent onslaught of nausea that took hold at about four weeks. ‘Oh, it will go away quickly enough,’ said everyone kindly, passing me ginger biscuits and cups of peppermint tea. So ill: Sonia Purnell, from Hammersmith, suffered the same condition as Kate but went on to have a healthy son. It felt like being poisoned: Sonia Purnell struggled with acute morning sickness just like Kate . These homely ‘cures’ for morning sickness did nothing. In fact, they only made things worse. Strangely, to start with, I found passing relief from chewing the toughest of American hard gums. But even this home-devised remedy was soon powerless against a tide of nausea so strong, so all-encompassing, so toxic that it sucked all the colour out of life. I could think of nothing but the  nausea and the metallic taste in  my mouth – and soon the vomiting began. It sounds a strange way to describe a pregnancy, but it felt as if I was being poisoned. The nausea was there every waking minute, but the actual vomiting could be triggered by almost anything, ranging from certain colours (there is still a certain shade of pinky-red I can barely look at), smells (even the supposedly friendly camomile) and any attempt to eat or drink. Even water, however slowly I sipped it, was impossible to keep down. At my worst, I was sick up to 30 times a day. All morning, yes, but also noon and night. The name ‘morning sickness’ came to sound like a cruel joke. The great convulsions of my body each time I made a mad dash to the toilet terrified me. When I visited my GP after ten days of this hell I was told to pull myself together. Only when I failed to make it to the door of her surgery without retching over her yucca plant – a spasm triggered by her perfume – did she agree to take my pulse and blood pressure. Fortunately she decided to  send me straight to hospital in a cab, with me clutching on to the inside of the door, willing the contents of my stomach (already very sparse) to stay down. My head was pounding and I was beginning to feel quite confused. My skin was itchy and dry. At Queen Charlotte’s, a specialised maternity hospital in west London, they were both immediately attentive and kind. At last, what was happening to me was not seen as fabricated or beyond help. There is something very isolating about this condition when you compare it to the glowing health and poise of so many women who make pregnancy look easy. I seemed to be making such a hash of it. Yet I discovered that up to one in 50 women suffers some form of hyperemesis gravidarum (which literally means very severe pregnancy sickness), but only a handful have it as badly as I did. Nausea: Sonia purnell, who suffered extreme morning sickness, feels for Kate, pictured last week . Poorly: Kate Middleton has been taken to hospital with hyperemesis gravidarum, which usually leaves women on a drip because they can't eat or drink . I saw on my notes that I had three plus signs against my diagnosis, meaning I was a particularly severe case. It is likely it became so serious because I was not treated straight away – not all GPs are on the look-out for the condition and there is a widespread assumption amongst some doctors that a fuss is being made over mere ‘morning sickness’. I trust that, at the King Edward VII hospital in central London, Kate is receiving the early and assiduous treatment she needs to keep it under control. One of the immediate steps is likely to be rehydration. The reason that my skin was so dry and itchy – and looked like that of a woman  30 years older – was that I had failed to retain any water for many days by this stage. Doctors put me on an intravenous drip, swapping the bags between saline, sugar and potassium. Nobody ever told me what the potassium was supposed to do  for me. I was ordered to stay in  my bed and rest – not a difficult instruction to follow as by now my legs felt like jelly. At first the vomiting continued. One terrible night – the loneliest of my life – I remember I was bringing up scary quantities of blood. Extreme: Even sipping water was impossible to keep down according to Sonia Purnell, who suffered the same condition during pregnancy as Kate, pictured with Prince William . It turned out that I had ripped my oesophagus, which was excruciating as the bile (by now the only contents of my stomach) burned the wound as it passed up through my body. The doctors moved me to a room of my own and posted a ‘nil by mouth’ sign above my bed, as anything passing my lips could trigger yet more vomiting. Even a toothbrush was banned. Meanwhile, they started to pump Zantac (normally used for ulcers but intended to help my oesophagus heal) and anti-sickness drugs into my veins. I pleaded not to have these drugs, remembering all too well the terrible effects of thalidomide on an earlier generation of pregnant women. But the serious look on my doctors’ faces as they sat next to my bed made it clear I had no choice. So uncomfortable was this method of administering the drugs that the doctors switched to injections. My backside – now quite bony anyway – was soon too black and blue to lie on. Gradually, though, I started to feel more human, and the doctors thought I was well enough to explain that my condition was caused in effect by a severe reaction to the pregnancy hormone HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). HCG can trigger the mildest of reactions, such as a passing morning sickness, or at the worst, a virtual bodily shutdown, as I endured. Care: Sonia Purnell describes the medical care given to her when suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. The Duchess of Cambridge is receiving treatment at the King Edward VII Hospital in London pictured . Doctors ran constant checks to make sure my vital organs were still functioning. It is possible that this severe reaction may run in families; another school of thought attributes it to the mother’s blood group being negative when the father’s is positive. I just hope that Kate is not at my end of the spectrum – and that her suffering passes, as it sometimes does, at around 13 weeks. Mine continued at varying levels, requiring further hospitalisations, right to the end. I lost a lot of weight even though I was pregnant. It worries me that Kate herself has so little to lose as it is not uncommon for sufferers to shed up to a tenth of their body weight. My condition almost certainly triggered my waters breaking at 33 weeks and the premature birth  of my son, Laurie. Yet bizarrely as soon my waters broke, the symptoms disappeared entirely and I ate my first meal for seven months before I went into hospital. I still remember the joy. I hope Kate will be lucky and that early intervention will save her some of the agonies I endured. Treatment is improving all the time, as is recognition of the condition. The danger of accompanying depression is also now better understood. My own case was, I know, studied with interest by medics. But if left untreated, hyperemesis can be dangerous for the baby and the mother too, particularly if she becomes too dehydrated. The . Victorian novelist Charlotte Bronte is understood to have died from it – and deaths, although rare, are not unknown even now. I loved my son so much when he arrived I was able in time to put the whole experience behind me. Surely it could not be so bad second time round, I thought. So I got pregnant again two years later. Ladies, I went through the same hellish experience. So I stopped at two children. I rather wonder if the royal couple will do the same.","Sonia Purnell was 34 when she suffered hyperemesis gravidarum - the same condition as the Duchess of Cambridge .

"When William first introduced Prince George to the world, he quipped that luckily their newborn had inherited his mother's looks, to which Kate replied 'I'm not sure about that'. But judging by yesterday's snaps of His Royal Highness Prince . George Alexander Louis of Cambridge, who put on a perfect display of royal . etiquette on one the biggest day of his life so far, he really is the spitting image of his mother as baby. As the former Kate Middleton carried her son out of the service, dressed in a handmade replica of Queen Victoria’s daughter’s christening robe, it was impossible to miss the resemblance between the pair. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: As the Duchess of Cambridge left her son's christening, it was impossible not to notice the similarities between the pair . Little George has inherited his mother's head shape, chubby little cheeks and the Middleton button nose. And it isn't just his mother's looks that the youngster has acquired. According to aides, there wasn’t ‘even a peep’ out of the three-month-old future king as he was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. ‘He went in smiling, came out smiling and, as far as we are aware, smiled throughout,’ said one. His good behaviour seemingly resonates that of his mother. George Brown, a 68-year-old former neighbour of the Middleton family told the Mail on Sunday: 'Catherine was a good . baby. She was always very well turned-out and there weren’t any . problems. 'She was very content. Carole and I would often take the girls . for walks together and have a coffee, and there was never much crying.’ Uncanny: Prince George has inherited his mother's button nose and chubby cheeks and it is hard to tell the difference between his and his mother's 1982 (r) christening snap . So where did it all begin for Kate? Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on January 9, 1982, the eldest of three children to British Airways stewardess Carole and her trainee pilot husband Michael Middleton, who had been married for two years. The . christening of Catherine took place on June 20, 1982 — the day before . her future husband was born — at her local church, St Andrew’s, in . Bradfield on the banks of the River Pang, Berkshire. Her . father Michael sported a traditional dark suit with striped tie for the . occasion and posed proudly with Kate and Carole, who wore a Laura Ashley floral dress for the down-to-earth family event. William's baptism was very different to Kate's small village gathering. He was baptised in the Music Room of . Buckingham Palace on August 4 (the 82nd birthday of the Queen Mother) by . the then Archbishop of Canterbury,  Robert Runcie. Little lookalike: Kate pictured on June 20 1982 at her local church, St Andrew's, with grandmother Dorothy Goldsmith (mother of Carole Middleton) and Prince William (r) at his baptism on August 8, 1982 . Princess Diana, just 21 and wearing a . fuchsia pink, blue and white floral dress with a pink hat set at a . rakish angle, looked radiant. But she later confided to friends that it . had been a trial. ‘No one . consulted me as to whether 11am would fit in with William’s schedule,’ she said. ‘I was totally excluded, totally exhausted and the photos went . on and on. I blubbed my eyes out.’ George's intimate christening, which saw just 23 guests in attendance, was a far cry from William's, but the little boy has definitely inherited some of his father's key features. Prince George has inherited his father's eyes and ears, and his late grandmother Diana's face shape. 'Prince George is a very bonny baby, just like his father,' said Clarissa Campbell Orr, a historian of the monarchy at Anglia Ruskin University. Like father, like son: Prince George has inherited his father's eyes and ears, and his late grandmother Diana's face shape (r) shows William in 1982 at his own christening with Diana . 'The resemblance to his father during the christening was particularly striking because he wore an identical christening robe. 'The robe is a replica of one first used by Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter and then subsequent royal christenings, including the Duke of Cambridge’s. 'The original is now too fragile so the replica was commissioned by the Queen and used for the christening of Prince Edward’s son James, Viscount Severn, and Prince George.' In an historic . ceremony which brought together four generations of the Royal Family, . the three-month-old future king was christened by the Archbishop of . Canterbury in the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace. Runs in the family: The tot even has a similar profile to Queen Victoria (pictured left, in the late 1800s) Big day: George wore an ivory gown made of delicate Honiton lace and white satin, worn before him by every baby born to the British Royal family since 1841 .

"An exhibit celebrating the seventieth anniversary of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince has opened at New York City’s Morgan Library & Museum. ‘The Little Price: A New York Story’ displays more than 40 of the French author’s original illustrations from the famous children’s story, which is the most-read French-language book in history. The Morgan acquired the author's works in 1968 from their original owner, Silvia Hamilton – who was a close friend of Mr Saint-Exupéry during his time spent writing the book in New York. Then and now: The Morgan Library has displayed Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's early sketches beside those that ultimately made it into The Little Prince . Home sweet home: The Little Prince's most famous image (one which is often used as the book's cover) features the title character standing on his home planet, known as Asteroid B-612 . The Little Prince, or Le Petit Prince as it is titled in French, has been translated in more than 250 languages since its 1943 release. It is a semi-autobiographical story written from the vantage point of an unnamed narrator, who crashes his plane into the Sahara and meets a ‘little prince’ who hails from a small planet where he lives in solitude. The two embark on an endearing relationship where the prince recounts his visits through outer space over the course of eight trialing days. After nearly dying of dehydration, and then finding water with the help of the prince, the narrator reluctantly bids his friend adieu – unable to find him again, likely at the cause of his own hallucinations. The book has been praised as a classic for its sage passages that provide valuable advice to both children and adults alike.

Griswold said in a release: ‘The exhibition allows us to step back to the moment of creation and witness Saint-Exupéry at work right here in New York. ‘One discovers the author-aviary struggling with the enormity of events impacting his native France and the world at large, while finding the focus to complete a tale as magical today as it was seventy years ago.’ In despair: Mr Saint-Exupéry's drawing 'The Saddest Day' (left) was rendered in black-and-white in its final version (right) Hailing from an aristocratic family, . Mr Saint-Exupéry had enjoyed a successful career as a commercial and . army pilot prior to his American visit. Upon Germany’s upheaval of the . French government, though, he lost his position within the French Air . Force. During his stay in New York, Mr Saint-Exupéry lived with his wife Consuelo on Central Park South, and later on Beekman Place. He would often write in assorted . locations around the city, including the residence of his friend Silvia . Halmilton, whose black poodle served as the visual inspiration for The . Little Prince’s reoccurring sheep character. Upon . his invitation to join the Allied forces as a pilot in 1943, Mr . Saint-Exupéry decamped New York City just as The Little Prince began to . hit store shelves. Feeling alone: In 'He laid down and cried' Mr Saint-Exupéry's consummate character is seen weeping among nature . But before leaving, he unexpectedly appeared at Ms Hamilton’s door and gifted her the book’s original manuscripts and drawings. The Morgan Library purchased the full lot in 1968. It is the only handwritten draft of The Little Prince known to exist today, as Mr Saint-Exupéry died in 1944 (at the age of 44) while on a observational military flight in the South of France - only weeks before the liberation of Paris. The Morgan Library, founded in 1906 to house J.P. Morgan’s private collection of books, has displayed Mr Saint-Exupéry’s original sketches beside the illustrations that ultimately made it into his consummate literary contribution. In doing so, the Morgan has shown how . one of the world’s most famous stories came to fruition, on both . textual and visual fronts. Practice runs: Mr Saint-Exupéry's sketches often display coffee stains and cigarette burns, which allude to the lifestyle he maintained while writing his famous book . Later versions: The author's drawing titled 'The Fatal Bargain' begins to take shape (left), culminating in its published form (right) But . even more interesting is how the Morgan Library’s manuscripts show the . intensive methods that Mr Saint-Exupéry took to develop his . golden-haired prince’s precocious personality. Original notes written by the author show a detailed analysis of the Prince’s would-be vegetarian diet, outlining how his self-tended garden included radishes, tomatoes, beans and potatoes, but not fruit, as their corresponding trees would prove too large for the protagonist’s small, house-sized planet. Similarly discarded scratchpad stages of The Little Prince’s creation include one of the Morgan Library’s most valued sketches by Mr Saint-Exupéry – an image showing the little prince wearing a yellow scarf and floating above earth, which had clearly been crumpled and thrown in the trash before being rescued, and later flattened out. In the thick of it: Here, Mr Saint-Exupéry is seen working on The Little Prince at the Park Avenue residence of his friend, Silvia Hamilton . Other treasures include the only copy of The Little Prince that Mr Saint-Exupéry is said to have gifted to a child. The author’s military ID bracelet, which was discovered by a French fisherman in 1998, has also been put on display.

Ksenia Yudayeva, first deputy chairwoman at the central bank, described the risk of a US default as 'very low'. 'U.S. Treasuries will remain the safest asset in the world even in the event of a US technical default,' she said. To deal with any market volatility that may arise, the Russian central bank would roll out its standard range of liquidity provision measures, Yudayeva told reporters after she and Siluanov testified before a parliamentary committee.

World stock markets fluctuated between gains and losses today as a deadline for divided U.S. lawmakers to agree on a higher government borrowing limit drew ever closer. Unless Congress acts by Thursday, the government will lose its ability to borrow and will be required to meet its obligations by relying on cash in hand and incoming tax receipts. That could mean the U.S. is unable to repay holders of Treasury bills that mature in coming days, or that it could miss interest payments on longer-dated Treasurys, and would be in default on its debt.

'The market is still relatively calm waiting for the storm to hit tomorrow, when the U.S. will reach its debt ceiling and then default will follow and all hell will break loose,' said Francis Lun, chief economist at GE Oriental Finance Group in Hong Kong. 'Everybody is thinking the inevitable now. It is inevitable that the U.S. will miss an agreement before the deadline,' he said.

The contract fell $1.20 to close at $101.21 on Tuesday. The price of oil has swung back and forth for two weeks as lawmakers attempt to resolve the impasse. 'The uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. have caused further volatility and nervous trading in the oil market, with investors worrying about a slowdown in the US oil demand,' said a report from Sucden Financial Research in London. Government agencies including the Energy Information Administration, which keeps track of US crude and fuel supplies, have stopped many services. The EIA's weekly report on supplies gives an indication about the strength of demand and often pushes the oil price up or down. Also setting a ceiling over prices were talks on Iran's nuclear programme in Geneva between the Islamic Republic and six major world powers. A deal would likely end US-led economic sanctions, which have greatly reduced Iran's oil exports over the past couple of years. 'Progress continues to be made and it seems that Iran is proposing a detailed framework rather than philosophical ideas,' said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix in Switzerland.

"Best-selling author and self-styled weight loss guru Kevin Trudeau was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison for bilking consumers through late night infomercials. Trudeau's book 'The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About' sold more than 850,000 copies at $30 a piece through oft-played tv infomercials a federal judge decided were part of a con. A $37million judgement was also entered against him. The pitchman's lawyer argued the sentence was too harsh and said the most anyone lost through his commercials was $30, but the judge disagreed, calling him a habitual fraudster. Trudeau has been an 'unrepentant, untiring, and uncontrollable huckster who has defrauded the unsuspecting for 30 years,' said U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Guzman. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Locked up: Kevin Trudeau speaks to the media last year after leaving the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago . Guzman even noted a time he once even used his own mother's Social Security number in a scheme. 'Since his 20s, he has steadfastly attempted to cheat others for his own gain,' the judge continued, adding that Trudeau is 'deceitful to the very core.' Trudeau's trademark dyed black hair turned partially gray while sitting in jail, he showed little emotion as the stiff sentence was handed down at the hearing in Chicago. He insisted he's become a changed man while addressing the judge just before sentencing, saying he's meditated, prayed and read self-help books while locked up at Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Center. 'I have truly had a significant reawakening,' said Trudeau, who was dressed in orange jail clothes. 'If I ever do an infomercial again ... I promise: No embellishments, no puffery, no lies.' A Trudeau supporter interrupted Guzman as he read his judgement. That person then cut the judge short a second time and was carried out by a U.S. Marshal. Neither Trudeau's pleas for leaniency or the supporter's words were enough to sway the judge after jurors convicted Trudeau of criminal contempt in November for defying a 2004 court order barring him from running false ads about the weight-loss book. Chart-topper: The best-selling book 'Natural Cures' by Kevin Trudeau stands on display at a Borders bookstore August 22, 2005 in Washington, DC. Despite the order, he aired the infomercials at least 32,000 times, according to prosecutors. He sold more than 850,000 copies of the weight-loss book, generating $39 million in revenue, prosecutors say. And the judge agreed with prosecutors that the amount of loss stemming from Trudeau's deception was more than $37 million — nearly the amount in revenue. But in remarks Monday asking for a sentence of less than two years for his client, defense attorney Tom Kirsch said the harm Trudeau caused was minor compared to fraud in which some people are cheated out of their life savings. 'A 10-year sentence might be appropriate . for a defendant who destroyed lives,' Kirsch said. '(But) Trudeau — if . he swindled anyone — swindled them out of $30 (the price of the book).' Kevin Trudeau made late-night infomercials for more that 20 years. Doctors have expressed concern in the past about his book Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About which has sold more than five million copies and appeared at the top of non-fiction bestseller lists. His claims include: 'The sun does not cause cancer. Sun block has been shown to cause cancer.' Another one of his statements is that Aids is 'one of the greatest hoaxes and deceptions ever perpetrated on the American public'. The FTC first came after Trudeau in 1998 for making false claims on TV. He claimed his alternative medicines could cause dramatic weight loss and cure addictions to alcohol, cigarettes and heroin. He even said the herbal remedies could give users a photographic memory. More than 25 million Americans have purchased products from Trudeau. A look at some of the steps Trudeau recommended to people looking to lose weight might provide some insight into why the judge felt otherwise. Trudeau's 'Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About' involved a three step process detailed in a WebMD critique. Step one involved switching over to an all-organic diet, colonics and liver cleanses, among other steps. Step two was to take daily injections of human chorionicgonadotropin, an enzyme found in urine that has not been approved for use as a weight loss treatment in the United States. Step three involved eating anything the dieter wanted, as long as it was organic, while continuing the cleanses but stopping the injections. The fourth and final step includes cleansing of the kidneys and liver, as well as ridding one's body of parasites and metals. It is notable that Trudeau has no medical certifications and has written other books touting the benefits of holistic medicine. 'He preys on the fears of consumers, giving them someone to blame for their overweight or obese conditions,' RD, LD Kathleen Zelman writes on the site. Another defense attorney, Carolyn Gurland, added that Trudeau's legal troubles had already cost him his businesses and his home, and nearly all his other worldly possessions. 'He has a suitcase containing his personal artifacts. That's what he has left,' she said. But Guzman showed little sympathy, appearing angry as he said that Trudeau had thumbed his nose at the justice system by violating multiple court orders since the 1990s . 'He has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions ... or impediments to be side-stepped, out-maneuvered or just ignored,' the judge said. Trudeau's weight-loss book describes a grueling, 500-calorie-a-day diet, as well as hormone treatments. The deception, Guzman explained, came in Trudeau's infomercials that misrepresented the contents of the book as laying out 'a simple, no hunger... diet-free method of losing weight,' which enticed more people to buy the book. Trudeau became rich selling millions of books with titles such as 'Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About' and 'Debt Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About,' touting them in commercials using sometimes hour-long news-interview formats. As legal scrutiny intensified over the years, Trudeau claimed the U.S. government was out to get him, and he accused agencies and other vested interests of conspiring to suppress low-cost, common remedies to diseases, including cancer. His weight-loss book, which once topped best-seller lists, was the focus of the criminal conviction for which he was sentenced. It also was the subject of related civil case brought by the Federal Trade Commission, in which Trudeau was ordered to pay a $37 million judgment. In that civil case, Trudeau said he couldn't pay the judgment because he's broke. But FTC lawyers balked at that claim, accusing him of hiding money in shell companies. Trudeau, they noted, has spent lavishly in recent years, including $359 on two haircuts.","Kevin Trudeau was found guilty of defrauding hundreds of thousands of people out of $37million .

"Fans of the country’s most popular light bulbs - the traditional 40 and 60-watt incandescent bulbs - are being encouraging to start stocking up as on January 1 it will become illegal for American businesses to either manufacture or import the old-style bulbs. Possible alternatives to the old-style bulbs are halogen bulbs, compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL), LED bulbs and high efficiency incandescents - all are more energy efficient, but also more expensive. ‘Get them while you still can,’ Home Depot, the nation’s largest bulb retailer, is urging on its website. 'Stock up on incandescent light bulbs before they are completely discontinued.' On January 1 it will become illegal for American businesses to either manufacture or import the old-style 40 and 60-watt light bulbs . The move is the result of a 2007 bill, signed by President George W. Bush, that set strict minimum efficiency standards. Many old light bulbs were grossly inefficient with only 10 percent of the energy used converted into light, while the rest was wasted as heat, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The alternatives may be significantly more cost efficient int he long run, but that hasn’t stopped many Tea Party conservatives and Libertarians from voicing their unhappiness at the government trying to tell people which light bulbs they can use. These critics argue that if the new bulbs really are so good, people will buy them on their own without being forced to do so. 'Get them while you still can': Home Depot, the nation's largest bulb retailer, estimates it has enough supply to last another six months . Amongst the more energy efficient alternatives are compact fluorescent light bulbs, although they are more expensive too . The Republican-controlled House has already tried and failed to overturn the law. For fan of the old-style bulbs, Home Depot estimates that it has a six-month stockpile. ‘Home Depot anticipates running out of their stock of 40W to 60W bulbs six months into 2014,’ Mark Voykovic, the store’s national light bulb merchant, told FoxNews. The retail giant said it has made 'a concerted effort' to educate employees and customers about the phaseout before then. 'In two years, you pay off that bulb,' said Voykovik. And because LED bulbs are expected to last at least 20 . years - it's all savings for the next 18 years. Many Tea Party conservatives and Libertarians have accused the government of trying to tell people which light bulbs they can use . The beginning of 2013 saw the phasing out of incandescent 75 and 100-watt light bulbs. High efficiency incandescents cost about $1.50 each, compared to 50 cents or so for the old bulbs. But they last twice as long, and use 28 per cent less power. With LEDs, the saving are even greater. While a 40-watt LED goes for about $7.50, it uses 85 per cent less energy than a traditional bulb. Over the course of the year, a LED will consume about $2 in power under normal circumstances, compared to over $7 for an incandescent.","On January 1 it will become illegal for American businesses to either manufacture or import the old-style bulbs .

"Former 100 metre world record holder Asafa Powell has asked for his 18-month doping ban to be reduced to three months, arguing that he only committed a minor offence. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said in a statement that it has received an appeal from the Jamaican sprinter, who has been suspended from competition since his doping case was disclosed last July. The 31-year-old Powell and three-time Olympic medalist Sherone Simpson tested positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrone at Jamaica's national trials last June. They were suspended by a Jamaican disciplinary panel last month. Tarnished: Jamaican sprinter Asafa Powell was banned for 18 months following a doping ban . Banned: And fellow Jamaican Sherone Simpson has also been banned following a positive drugs test . Simpson has also asked for her suspension to be cut to three months. ""The athletes put forward that the offense committed is minor and request that the suspensions be reduced to 3 months,"" CAS said in a statement Monday. Once the top sprinter on the track, Powell lowered the world record in the 100 to 9.77 in 2005, then 9.74 in 2008 before being eclipsed by Usain Bolt. Powell's backdated ban began from the date of his sample collection on June 21, 2013, meaning he's eligible to return to competition on Dec. 20, about a month after he turns 32. Like Simpson, Powell put the blame on a newly-hired trainer who provided him and Simpson with supplements, including one called ""Epiphany D1"" which lab tests later showed to contain oxilofrone. Eclipsed: Powell has been overtaken by compatriots Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake . During hearings earlier this year, Powell testified that he received nine supplements from Canadian physiotherapist Christopher Xuereb, including Epiphany D1. Powell said he started taking the capsules after he and a friend researched the supplement for up to six hours online and found no prohibited substances. But Xuereb has said he never gave Powell or Simpson any performance-enhancing drugs and only purchased major brand vitamins. Xuereb once worked at the Toronto clinic run by Anthony Galea, a sports physician who pleaded guilty to bringing unapproved and mislabeled drugs into the U.S. for house calls.","Powell wants ban reduced to three months arguing his offence was minor .

"Jailed: Philip Burgess, 22, from Salford, was sentenced to three years for inciting violence during the Manchester riots . A Facebook user who posted on the social networking site that rioters should 'put Manchester on the map' has been jailed for three years. Philip Burgess, from Salford, wrote the message when the August riots were at their most fervent, and urged his friends to wreak havoc in the city centre. The 22-year-old, who admitted encouraging the commission of offences of riot and inciting racial hatred, sobbed as the sentence was handed down at Manchester Crown Court. Unemployed Burgess logged on to . Facebook on August 9 under his profile name 'Philip Rio Burgess', at 11.44am posted: 'Message to all - we need to start riot . 'n we need to put Manchester on the map, first lets riot king street . Manchester, haha.' At that point Manchester had not yet been targeted by rioters, but shortly afterwards trouble flared up in the city. King . Street, one of the most important thoroughfares of the city and an . affluent shopping area, was hit within hours of the message being . written, with marauding bands of hooded youths running amok. The copycat riots in England's third-largest city - and . nearby Salford, where Burgess lived - also saw widespread looting and . vandalism which threatened to stretch police resources to breaking . point. Burgess went on to post a string of . racist comments about the ethnicity of the rioters and also posted 'bring bk the riots' on Facebook in the . aftermath of the violence. Manchester . Crown Court heard his crime was so serious he would have to go to jail . on the spot - and serve a sentence 'measured in years'. Copycats: Looters ran amok in Manchester in August, in similar scenes witnessed in London . The court heard that Burgess's remarks could potentially have been seen by his 475 Facebook 'friends' and anyone else who stumbled across his page. Jonathan Sandiford, prosecuting, said: 'Within hours of the message being posted, rioting did occur in the very place named. 'In reality we can't say any person who saw the message decided to riot because of it, but it was plainly the defendant's intention and it may well have encouraged some of those who did behave in that way.' Burgess, who has a previous conviction for racially aggravated common assault, was arrested at his home on August 16, a week after posting the first message. Arrests: Police detain rioters who had been looting a Tesco supermarket on Oxford Street, Manchester, in August . When cautioned he reportedly replied: 'Riot? I wanted to be part of it but I wasn't.' Two other young men, Jordan Blackshaw and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, are currently serving four-year sentences for encouraging people to riot in Cheshire. The pair's bid to have their jail-time cut by the Court of Appeal failed earlier this month. David Abbot, defending Burgess, said he had not gone as far as Blackshaw and Sutcliffe-Keenan, who set up dedicated pages calling for disorder. He said Burgess had 'got caught up in what was going on' and was remorseful and ashamed. Sentencing him, Judge Michael Henshell said the disorder in Manchester was 'simply lawlessness'. Chaos: A policeman in riot gear stands on Market Street in Manchester as a fire, started by rioters, blazes behind him . He said of Burgess's remark: 'Even if one or two people had read it and talked about it to others, it had the potential of causing real public mischief.' Police constable John Hepke added: 'The widespread disorder in Manchester city centre and Salford drew disbelief and shock. 'Everyone witnessed the disgraceful scenes of violence, looting and arson and it is clear that social networking sites were used to incite certain elements of this disorder. 'At that time, Greater Manchester Police vowed that we would identify anyone involved in using social networking sites to stir up hatred, and once Burgess had been exposed, our team in Bolton was brought in to investigate. 'The sheer scale of the disorder meant that teams from across Greater Manchester Police were brought in to help bring the offenders to justice. 'The comments Burgess posted on Facebook were clearly designed to incite people to commit disorder in Manchester just hours before those awful scenes.

"The shamed son of Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour was ‘thoroughly intoxicated’ when he attacked the royal convoy during the student fees riots, a court heard yesterday. Charlie Gilmour, 21, was seen swinging on the Union Flag at the Cenotaph just hours before he hurled a bin at a car escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall. The disgraced Cambridge University student also jumped on the bonnet of the car, which was carrying close protection officers, blocking the driver’s view of the Prince’s Rolls-Royce in front, it was claimed. Charlie Gilmour arrived at court yesterday flanked by his father, Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, and his mother Polly Samson . Kingston Crown Court heard . details of the chaos as a 100-strong baying mob laid siege to the royals . during the tuition fees protest in London on December 9 last year. During the five-minute onslaught, the . windows next to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall were smashed and the . car battered by rubbish bins, sticks, fists and paint. Prosecutor Duncan Penny told how a . royal protection officer sitting in the front seat of the Prince’s . limousine reacted with shock on coming under attack after dismissing the . crowd’s mood as merely ‘boisterous'. Mr Penny said: ‘At first he thought the mood was merely boisterous with the crowd chanting and waving banners and flags. ‘But the inspector said people then . started kicking and punching the vehicle, making obscene gestures and . striking the car with sticks. ‘He said how one man stood in front . of the vehicle with his arms raised, a person threw a large cardboard . box into the carriageway forcing the car to veer and another man raised a . large black bin to shoulder height and threw it at them. ‘The window next to the Prince of . Wales shattered but remained in place but the window next to the Duchess . of Cornwall was broken and almost completely open. ‘He estimates the vehicle was under . attack for at least five minutes and was deeply concerned and was under . extreme levels of pressure.’ Under attack: The Rolls-Royce of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was attacked during the protests . A constable sitting in the Jaguar . following the Rolls-Royce pushed his car door open to fend off the . attack, striking a number of protesters with the door, including . Gilmour. The yob responded by sitting on the car’s bonnet, causing the driver to brake suddenly. The officer was later injured when a bottle was lobbed through the door, hitting him on the forehead. The Jaguar was also covered in spit . from the jeering crowds who chanted: ‘Off with their heads’, ‘Tory scum’ and ‘Give us some money’. In a third vehicle carrying members of the Royal household, the back window was smashed. Prince Charles’ equerry, Major Will . Mackinlay was ‘very concerned and fearful for the people in the vehicle . and also concerned about how the police protection officers may react,’ the . court heard. Gilmour claims he was so high that he cannot recollect whether he threw a bin at the Royal protection officers’ car. Minutes later he looted a mannequin’s . leg after smashing his way into Topshop with other protesters causing . £50,000 with of damage and terrifying customers and staff who needed . counselling afterwards. Yesterday the court were shown a . series of video clips showing the pop star’s son at the heart of the . demonstration earlier in the day around Parliament Square and later in . Regent Street and Oxford Street. He was pictured clutching a rock and threatened to ‘storm parliament’ during the violent clashes with police. The defendant squirmed in his seat as footage was shown of him confronting police lines, shouting: ‘Let them eat cake, they say. ‘We will not eat cake, we will eat fire and ice and destruction because we are angry, very f****** angry.’ Cenotaph swing: Gilmour was photographed and filmed swinging from the Union Flag on the Cenotaph . In other clips, he is heard shouting: ‘They broke the moral law, we are going to break all the laws. Arson. Destroy. ‘We are not going to stand for it any f**king more, storm Parliament.’ Later the protester appeared unsteady . on his feet, slurring his words in a BBC interview in which he . attempted to hide the stolen mannequin’s leg under his jacket. David Spens, QC, representing Gilmour . said he was ‘thoroughly intoxicated’ and ‘didn’t remember’ throwing a bin, . and had simply spent the day ‘playing the fool’. He said: ‘There was a huge amount of . playing to the cameras and attention seeking during the course of the . afternoon and early evening. ‘Up until Topshop, the extent of his behaviour was playing the fool, acting up to the cameras and showing off. ‘The defendant has no recollection of throwing anything. The defence case is there is no reliable evidence showing he did so.’ But Judge Nicholas Price QC said: ‘It was more than intoxication.’ Yesterday, dressed in a designer grey . suit and his hair newly cropped, Gilmour cut an altogether different . figure than the long-haired lout seen on CCTV. The defendant’s biological father is the poet and playwright Heathcote Williams. His adoptive father David Gilmour and mother, writer and journalist Polly Samson, accompanied him to court. Gilmour faces jail when he is sentenced today after pleading guilty to violent disorder.","Cambridge Uni student arrived in court yesterday with parents .

"Basketball superstar LeBron James landed in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the World Cup final on Sunday, and he said the Maracana showdown is bigger than the NBA Finals. Fresh from announcing his decision to leave the Miami Heat and return to his first team the Cleveland Cavaliers, James touched down in Brazil to watch Germany face Argentina. According to ESPN.com, the two-time NBA champion signed a two-year contract with the Cavaliers worth $42.1m (£24.6m). Centre of attention: LeBron James arrived in Rio ahead of the World Cup final on Sunday . Appearance: James spoke in public for the first time since announcing his decision to return to Cleveland . Speaking at a promotional event in Rio, James said; 'This is bigger than the NBA finals in the sense of the world. You have all the players representing their countries. It's the ultimate sport. You have to play as a team. 'The NBA finals is the ultimate for basketball. This is the ultimate for football. I've been watching it from home in the States and it's been an unbelievable tournament.' But James declined to pick a winner between Germany and Argentina after meeting hundreds of fans and watching young Brazilians show off their basketball skills at a warehouse near Guanabara Bay. I'm coming home: James has signed a two-year deal with the Cavaliers worth over $42million . VIDEO 'I'm coming home' - LeBron James returns to Cleveland . Ovation: The baseball scoreboard at Cleveland Indians' Progressive Field welcomes James back . Praise: James singled out Argentina's Lionel Messi as the best player in the world . He said: 'The Germans have a better team overall but Argentina have one of the best, if not the best, player in the world in Messi. We'll see. That is why you play the game.' James announced to Sports Illustrated on Friday that he was returning home to the Cavaliers after four years in Miami. Under the terms of his new contract, James can opt out as a free agent if he wants to next summer. By only signing for two years, James can negotiate another contract with the Cavaliers before the 2016-17 season, when a new television deal is expected to push the maximum salary higher than it currently stands at $20.7m (£12.09m). 'We could not be happier to welcome LeBron James home,' Cavaliers general manager David Griffin said. 'LeBron, through his essay, told us he wasn't going anywhere except Cleveland and that ""Cleveland is where he always believed he would finish his career."" On the move: James leaves the Miami Heat after four years, during which he won two NBA titles . No comment: James did not confirm whether he would be back in Rio in 2016 to defend USA's Olympic title . VIDEO Miami fans sad to lose LeBron . 'These words and commitment put all of us, including LeBron, in the best position to build our franchise the right way and achieve the kind of goals we all know are possible. Expectations will be at the highest levels but no one should expect immediate and automatic success.' James said: 'It's a really exciting time for myself. I am ready for the challenge.' But one thing James didn't comment on was returning to Rio in 2016 to represent USA in the Olympic basketball tournament. James led the United States team to gold at both the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympics, but didn't confirm whether he would play at Rio 2016.","James lands in Rio de Janeiro ahead of World Cup final .

"Detroit Mayor Dave Bing accused his Boston counterpart of insensitivity Tuesday after Thomas Menino told a magazine that if he ever visited the Motor City, he'd 'blow up the place and start all over.' In a New York Times Magazine article that first appeared online last week, Menino said Detroit is a place he'd like to visit, then added the rest when asked what he'd do there. 'It is extremely regrettable that Boston Mayor Thomas Menino used such an unfortunate choice of words to describe what he would do if he came to Detroit,' said Bing, who is not running for re-election after one term as mayor. 'I would think the mayor of a city that recently experienced a deadly bombing attack would be more sensitive and not use the phrase `blow up.' Insensitive: Detroit Mayor Dave Bing, left, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. Bing accused his Boston counterpart of insensitivity  after Menino told a magazine that if he ever visited the Motor City, he'd 'blow up the place and start all over' In the red: Detroit is the first major American city to declare bankruptcy . A spokeswoman for the Boston mayor said Menino 'feels strongly about cities,' cares about Detroit's problems and 'would like to help in any way he can.' 'The mayor is sorry that people have taken offense,' Dot Joyce told The Associated Press in a phone interview. 'It was never his intention.' She said that Menino's proposal to 'blow up the place' meant to overhaul the broken systems that have helped bring down Detroit. Three people were killed and more than 260 injured in April when pressure cookers packed with explosives, nails, ball bearings and metal shards detonated near the finish line of the popular Boston Marathon. One of the suspects was killed three . days later in a gun battle with police. His brother was captured and has . pleaded not guilty to using a weapon of mass destruction charges. Menino . also told the magazine that 'inaction' and 'leadership' are behind some . of Detroit's problems, like boarded up buildings, nonworking . streetlights and lengthy police response times to 911 calls. Unfortunate: Detroit's Mayor, Dave Bing said Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's choice of words were ill chosen given the city's recent history . Bing, . a member of professional basketball's Hall of Fame and former steel . supply company owner, said Menino should have gotten 'his facts right.' 'The . Detroit Police Department's response time is not - and has never been - . 90 minutes,' Bing said. 'And, most of our city's buildings are not . boarded up. Since taking office more than four years ago, there has been . tireless action on the part of my administration to improve the quality . of life for our citizens. In fact, I invite Mayor Menino to visit . Detroit to see our city for himself.' Menino . is the latest politician to offer his take on Detroit and its troubles. Two years ago, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told NBC-TV's 'Meet the . Press' that Detroit should welcome immigrants to boost the city's . shrinking population. Detroit . in July became the largest city in the country to seek bankruptcy when . state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr filed for court protection . as he tries to restructure finances. Orr said Detroit's debt could be $18 billion or more.","Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said if he ever visited Detroit he'd 'blow up the place and start all over'

"Malta is a small island - and Valletta is the smallest capital in the EU. But now the former British colony is getting a planet-sized chunk of attention. This month, the Duchess of Cambridge will represent the Queen on her first official overseas trip without Prince William (or Prince George) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Maltese independence. Truly splendid: Valletta may be the EU's smallest capital, but it has one of the continent's finest skylines . Already the island has gone Kate-crazy. People could talk of little else as I travelled around Malta and its neighbour, Gozo. As if that wasn’t enough, Brangelina - the newly wed Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie - have been in Gozo filming By The Sea, written by Jolie. The couple took over the secluded pebble beach of Mgarr ix-Xini. The Duchess will feel at home on Malta, where 150 years of British rule have left their mark. The Maltese drive on the left, British phone and post boxes are everywhere, there’s even a M&S in Valletta - and they still use three-pin electric plugs. What’s more, Malta has been held in great affection by the Queen for nearly 70 years. Between 1949 and 1951, as Princess Elizabeth, she lived just outside Valletta, when Prince Philip was stationed there as a naval officer. Famous faces: The Duchess of Cambridge (left) will in Malta for an official visit on 20 and 21 September; (right) newlywed Angelina Jolie has been on Gozo with new husband Brad Pitt, filming her latest project By The Sea . The links were strengthened during the war when the island came under Luftwaffe bombardment. It held out and was awarded the George Cross by George VI as a result. It’s a pity the Duchess will be there for only two days - there’s so much to see on these small, but fascinating islands. Malta is by far the larger of the two, and the more crowded, while Gozo is the deserted, rural cousin. Do take the regular 25-minute ferry across the channel that separates the islands. Both are so rich in history that I swam off the golden-red sands of Ramla Bay, on northern Gozo, without realising its significance. Only later did I discover this was the beach where Odysseus, hero of Homer’s Odyssey, was washed up, clinging on to a timber, the last fragment of his shipwrecked boat. He was given refuge in a nearby cave by Calypso, a drop-dead gorgeous nymph. He promptly hopped into bed with her. Sadly, in reality, Calypso’s Cave, on the hill overlooking the bay, was depressingly short on attractive nymphs. Back on Malta, Valletta was a delight. It’s only a three-hour flight from London, but it feels tropical: a place where Italy meets Arab Africa. Sicily is only 50 miles to the north; Tunisia 176 miles west. Happy days: The queen (then Princess Elizabeth) and Prince Phillip survey Valletta harbour while living on Malta . The city is built on a grid, like an early Manhattan, but there are no skyscrapers and all but essential traffic is banned. At its heart is St John’s Co-Cathedral, built by the Knights of Malta from 1573. The knights - from Italy, Provence, Auvergne and Aragon - competed to produce the most ornate chapels. The result is a blingy series of gilded rooms, studded with baroque monuments. The generous knights gave two Caravaggios, of St Jerome and The Beheading Of John The Baptist, to the cathedral. Both are still there. As a crucial naval port, Valletta once had a rackety side, concentrated on Strait Street, in the heart of the city. Nicknamed ‘the Gut’ by heavy drinking sailors, it was once thick with brothels, bars and seedy lodging houses. These days, the Gut has cleaned up its act - I ate well at Palazzo Preca, a 16th-century palace at 54 Strait Street, run by the pretty, young Preca sisters, Ramona and Roberta. For a grander experience of Malta, stay at the Phoenicia, which the Queen and Prince Philip visited for naval parties when they lived on Malta. It has all the charms of a grand colonial hotel - along with free wi-fi and excellent service. I can understand how Odysseus couldn’t tear himself away from Malta and Gozo for seven years. You might find it just as difficult to leave. Double rooms at the Phoenicia Hotel (00356 2291 1023, www.phoeniciamalta.com) cost from £100 a night, room only. easyJet (www.easyjet.com) flies to Malta from Gatwick from £42 return.","The Duchess of Cambridge will visit the island on 20 and 21 September .

"Fancy a stroll between two of the highest points in the Swiss Alps? The world's first suspension bridge between mountain peaks is about to make this panoramic dream a reality. The bridge, suspended 9,700ft in the air, will also have a partial glass floor to allow visitors a once in a lifetime view of the 6,500ft drop between the Glacier 3000 and Scex Rouge. This mock-up shows what the suspension bridge will look like, linking the Glacier 3000 and Scex Rouge peaks . Peak Walk, as it will be known, will also boast stunning views of the distant Mont Blanc and Eiger mountains. Scheduled to open this November, the bridge will be able to hold 300 visitors for any given walk, but will limit numbers to 150 to offer tourists the option for a more leisurely stroll. The bridge will be open year round and has been built to withstand winds of up to 155mph. Switzerland hopes this new engineering marvel will help to double the amount of visitors to the region each summer, though its construction has gone anything but smoothly. Peak Walk is set to open this November and will be able to hold 300 visitors at any given time . Bad weather over the summer, as well as struggles faced by workers in the thin mountain-top air, have caused a variety of scheduling difficulties. Nevertheless, the steel cable for the bridge was brought up to the mountains by helicopter this week. The bridge is estimated to cost £1.2million to construct, and while impressive it will actually only be the second highest suspension bridge in the world, with the The Titlis Cliff Walk in Obwalden, Switzerland, taking top honours.","Peak Walk will link popular mountain peaks Glacier 3000 and Scex Rouge .

"Watch out! There’s a spider about! Or, to be more accurate, there are millions of them. Britain is having a bumper spider year. And, right now, the breeding season is starting, as male spiders go in search of spindly spiderwomen. There’s an enormous queue of spiders waiting to climb up the sides of your bath. And your garden will be thickly laced with cobwebs. Scroll down for video . Booming: The spider population of Britain is fatter, healthier and more numerous than it has been for years . The spider population of Britain is fatter, healthier and more numerous than it has been for years — thanks to the warm autumn, which has provided a bounteous food supply in the form of flies and bugs. Professor Adam Hart, an entomologist at the University of Gloucestershire, explains: ‘This year has seemingly been a good one for the invertebrates that spiders feed on.’ Lawrence Bee of the British Arachnological Association says it means spiders are ‘appearing a little bigger than average perhaps’. What’s more, there are more of them in our homes because they’ve gained easy access — the warm weather has seen many people opening their windows and doors. Yet far from getting aggravated by this abundance of spiders, experts say you should welcome them. Because the bad boy of the anthropod world is, in fact, a wonderful ally. Spiders are extremely good for your garden — trapping and devouring all manner of insects that eat your plants. And in the home a single spider can kill 2,000 bugs every year. Spider venom, meanwhile, has been used as an eco-friendly pesticide — and also to treat heart problems, muscular dystrophy and even erectile dysfunction. House guests: There are more of them in our homes because they’ve gained easy access - and experts say that we should let them stay indoors . And there’s not much point in trying to eradicate them from your home anyway. Spiders are dogged creatures who happily produce a cobweb or more a day — if you clear an area of spiders, a new colony is likely to come along very quickly. You’re much better off — and more humane — gently sweeping them up and putting them in a covered, outside space, such as a shed or garage. Because as temperatures plummet, spiders want to be indoors. A fear of spiders, or arachnophobia, is really pretty irrational — in this country, anyway. Our 660 species, such as the house spider, or Tegenaria, are practically all harmless. And the average number of spider bites anyone receives in a lifetime is the same as the number of bee or wasp stings — around three. If you’re unlucky enough to be bitten in Britain, it’ll almost certainly lead to nothing worse than mild irritation. A dozen of those 660 species are slightly more robust, and some people have been hospitalised as a result of reported gangrene-like infections after a bite. But these infections are invariably caused by bacteria infecting a scratched bite rather than by the spider itself. ‘The house spider can give you a nip but only if you disturb it or pick one up,’ says Stuart Hine, of the Natural History Museum. ‘The venom has a negligible effect. Even the bite of the False Widow — the most venomous spider in Britain — is not as bad as a bee or wasp sting. ‘If you use a cup and a bit of cardboard to get a spider out of your home, you won’t get bitten. ‘If you don’t want to find one in your bath, lay a towel over the edge so it can climb out. They don’t come in through the plugholes — they fall from the walls and ceilings then get trapped because they can’t grip on to the sides of the bath.’ If anything, we should feel sorry for the male spiders in search of mates. Bigger females are often in the habit of eating smaller males — unless the males perform exhausting courtship rituals to keep the flame of arachnid romance flickering. More to come: The spider breeding season is starting, as male spiders go in search of spindly spiderwomen . These include dances, jumps, gentle touches of the female spider and mini-vibrations of the web. Even if they do avoid becoming their loved one’s lunch, they are only capable of a few sad, brief acts of love before their short lifespan comes to an end. It is then left to the female to weave together the elaborate silk egg sacks, which each contain hundreds of eggs. The spider hasn’t been helpful in promoting its best side. Those eight crawling, spindly legs and the scuttling walk don’t do it for everyone. And their table manners leave a lot to be desired: they can’t deal with solids, so they liquidise their lunch by breaking it down with digestive enzymes to produce a meaty soup they suck from victims’ bodies. And they’ve usually got four pairs of eyes — three pairs too many for us humans, who like our animals to have roughly the same quantity of facial characteristics as ourselves. On the plus side, spiders are astonishingly sophisticated, producing silk from glands within their abdomen. The spiders in your bathroom are carrying out a complex industrial process that puts the silk mills of 19th-century Britain to shame. Most spiders have six tiny spinnerets, pouring out a liquid, protein silk, which dries and hardens as it is stretched. It is as strong as nylon but much more elastic — which explains the extraordinary strength of the webs that stretch across your garden, with the marvellously intricate central designs anchored by only a few supporting threads. They come in an infinite variety of shapes — with circular patterns connected by radial lengths holding them together. The aim is to trap prey, of course, but that’s easier said than done. BeneficiaLSpiders are extremely good for your garden — trapping and devouring insects that eat your plants . The webs have to be sticky enough to catch the victims — about half escape — and strong enough to absorb the momentum of an insect flying at great speed. Look closely at a web in your garden and you’ll see that the clever spiders don’t design them to be symmetrical. Because spiders can move downwards more quickly than upwards, they make the lower half longer than the top half. And if one anchor point offers a safer refuge than the others, the hub will be placed closer to that anchor point. What a brilliant little insect the spider is! So let’s embrace it — or at least give it a helping hand out of the bath tub.","Britain is having a bumper spider year and breeding season is just starting .

"Apparently some phones are made of sterner stuff - especially one Alabama woman's iPhone, which survived a drop from a small airplane on Friday and was returned unscathed to its owner. Angela Dalton and her 10-year-old son were riding as passengers in a three-seat plane on Friday for an aerial tour of Dothan, courtesy of a family friend who happens to be a pilot. When the plane neared Dalton's Dothan neighborhood, she lifted her iPhone to snap a photo. Phone a friend: Angela Dalton displays the iPhone she accidentally dropped out of an airplane which then landed in the front yard of Eric Hall (pictured left) 'I was trying to zoom it on my phone, and the wind just caught it and ripped it out of my hand,' Dalton said. A panicked Dalton watched as the phone spiraled away, soaring down an estimated 1,400 feet toward the city. 'All that kept going through my head was, ""I hope I don't get home and it's all over the news that I knocked somebody out or somebody got killed or it hit a windshield and caused a car accident,""' she said. Resigned to the fact that her beloved phone had been decimated, she nevertheless called her number when she got home. To her surprise, the phone rang but no one answered. Still, she and her husband suspended the account and, after being told the drop wasn't covered by the phone's warranty, thought the situation to be over. Monday afternoon, Eric Hall had just left his house to check the mail when he noticed an orange cellphone sitting in his yard about six feet from the curb. 'My neighbor was out here, and I thought it might have been his daughter's phone,' Hall said. Fear of falling: When Angela Dalton dropped her phone from a small airplane, she believed it would be smashed to smithereens . After realizing that wasn't the case, Hall charged the phone and called the last number the phone had dialed - Bill Smith, the pilot of the airplane from which the phone had fallen. 'I said, ""Hey, I found this phone."" He paused and then said, ""You're kidding me,""' Hall said. 'He asked what it looked like, and I said, ""It looks great, like somebody dropped it out of their pocket while walking."" He said that, no, it fell 1,400-feet out of an airplane. So then I paused.' Not only had the phone survived the fall, it was in pristine condition, even after a weekend storm. Dalton said she didn't have any kind of tracker installed on the phone, so she was stunned when her husband approached her Monday evening and told her it had been found in working condition. The iPhone, in a SYSTM case, is now back in Dalton's possession, but the story got even stranger when Hall told Dalton his job title - air-traffic controller. 'It's just crazy,' Hall said. While it's unknown if scientists worldwide will begin studying the phone's composition, Dalton said she plans to notify the makers of SYSTM and the iPhoneof its harrowing journey.","Angela Dalton dropped her iPhone from a small airplane while trying to snap a picture .

"What is it about the British and treasure hunts? Hint at something shiny, add an air of mystery — and we reach for our spades. That’s what’s happening on Folkestone’s Outer Harbour beach this week, where wily German artist Michael Sailstorfer has tapped deep into the British national character by hiding 30 miniature 24-carat gold bars beneath the sand. He has upped the romance of it all by burying the bullion, worth £10,000, between the high and low tidelines. Cue dozens of people rushing down to the shore whenever the sea goes out. National obsession: Hundreds flocked to Folkestone's Outer Harbour beach in search of bullion this week . So far, just a handful of the bars are thought to have been discovered, with those successful including a trio from Canterbury — Kevin Wood, Kirsty Henderson and her sister Megan — and a local family. There’s still plenty of gold in them thar sands. And the Folkestone hoard, part of an arts festival, isn’t the only treasure around. In Cheltenham, a jeweller is staging a diamond hunt to raise money for cancer charity Maggie’s. Ten genuine, if small, diamonds — worth £10,000 in total — have been hidden in obscure spots around the town. Participants buy maps and clues to track them down, and the winners can have the stones made into their own unique piece of jewellery. In June this year, U.S. property millionaire Jason Buzi was even more ambitious in the scale of his hunt, hiding cash in cities around the world and posting clues online. What he called ‘a fun game that brings people together’ caused such a fever that a park in California was ripped apart — the fences torn down by fortune seekers. The reaction was also intense in London, where crowds descended on Kensington Gardens in search of envelopes containing £50 each. Success: Kirsty Henderson, 26, and Kevin Wood, 28, from Canterbury, were among the lucky ones in Kent . Even writers are getting in on the act. U.S. author James Frey is offering £300,000 to the first reader who can crack the hidden code in his book The Calling, published in the UK next month. So, why does treasure hunting exert such a magnetic pull on us? There’s the money, of course. But it’s more than that. These latest stunts play on a long history of real and fictional trails that have excited the British for more than 150 years. The most famous of all — and still the most influential — is that featured in Treasure Island, written in 1883 by Robert Louis Stevenson. The original treasure hunt: Treasure Island had it all - one-legged seamen and an X that marked the spot . His novel established many of the crucial elements of the traditional buried treasure adventure: Caribbean islands, one-legged seamen and — most importantly — a map with an X that marks the spot. It begins with the young hero Jim Hawkins (as in ‘Arr, Jim Lad!’) sifting through the contents of an old sailor’s sea chest and finding a map of a faraway isle where the loot is hidden. The battle to find the haul is on. There had been other desert island stories before it, chief among them Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, published in 1719, which told of a castaway stranded on a South American island for decades. There had been treasure stories, too, notably Edgar Allan Poe’s The Gold-Bug, in 1843. In it, a man is bitten by a gold-coloured insect and becomes obsessed with finding treasure. Deciphering a secret message, he ends up doing exactly that. Stevenson’s genius was to combine these different elements into the ultimate tale of fortune-hunting. Yet it wasn’t just fiction that inspired him and sparked off our national obsession. Real pirates such as William Kidd, who is mentioned in Treasure Island, did in fact bury their loot. (Kidd’s booty, hidden on Gardiners Island in East Hampton, New York, was dug up by the authorities.) The discoveries of the lost Roman cities of Herculaneum, in 1738, and Pompeii, in 1748, and the valuables they held, also gripped the public imagination — as did the excavation of Tutankhamun’s gold-filled tomb in Egypt in 1922. Indeed, much of early archaeology was driven by the search for lost riches. In the late 19th century, Heinrich Schliemann, the German who excavated the ancient Greek cities of Troy and Mycenae, caused a stir by claiming to have dug up the gold mask of Greek hero Agamemnon and jewels belonging to Helen of Troy. In all likelihood, the treasure belonged to an even earlier civilisation. Elusive: The gold bars hidden in Folkestone. But why is Britain so obsessed with the idea of hidden plunder? Sometimes the riches haven’t been hidden so much as mislaid. Ships loaded with precious cargo, have been sinking to the bottom of the ocean since man first took to the sea, and pirates, chancers and looters have been trying to retrieve it ever since. Stevenson’s novel refers to a famous real-life salvaged wreck: the Spanish Treasure Fleet, sunk off the coast of Florida in 1715 and later picked apart by pirates and opportunists. Among them was a privateer (a kind of government-approved mercenary) called Henry Jennings, who made off with 350,000 pieces of eight. There are still prizes to be found. The greatest discovery of modern times is the Mary Rose, Henry VIII’s warship, which sank in the Solent in 1545 while fighting the French. In 1982, her hull and 26,000 precious artefacts were raised from the seabed — not by pirates, but a charitable trust. The appetite for obscure clues has been around for a long time, too, with some still unsolved after centuries. In 1820, prospector Thomas Jefferson Beale buried gold and silver in Virginia for safekeeping. He then gave three coded messages to a bar owner and promised to return with the key — but never did. Modern times: The treasures of the Mary Rose were recovered not by pirates but a charitable trust . The bar owner, in turn, left the messages to a friend on his death. That friend deciphered one of them but found none of the treasure, thought to be worth £40 million today. People are still burrowing into the Virginian hills in search of it. More recently, artist Kit Williams used elaborate pictures in his 1979 book Masquerade to give clues to the whereabouts of a hare-shaped jewel. After three years of frantic searching — during which time the book became a best-seller — it was discovered by a man called Ken Thomas. He rushed down to its hiding place in Bedfordshire, the nation heard, to find a pile of earth dug up by two rivals who were agonisingly close to reaching the jewel — and whisked it from under their noses. Thomas, however, turned out to be one Dugald Thompson, who knew Williams’s ex-girlfriend. She had accidentally revealed the rough location of the prize. Despite not finding it in the expected way, he got to keep the hare, which was later sold at auction by Sotheby’s for £31,900. Today we are still a country packed with treasure-hunters, but they’re now aided by modern technology. In recent years, some staggering finds have been made, going back to the earliest British civilisations. In 2009, the Staffordshire Hoard — the largest haul of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver ever discovered — was dug up in a field near the village of Hammerwich. Sensational: The Staffordshire Hoard, found in 2009, was the largest ever haul of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver . The 3,500 pieces, reckoned to be from the seventh or eighth century AD, are thought to have been buried by their owner with the intention of returning to claim them one day. There they lay until they were discovered by a metal-detector enthusiast searching a freshly-ploughed field. The following year, an exceptional Roman antiquity, a rare copper alloy helmet with a griffin crest, was unturfed by another metal detective in Crosby Garrett, Cumbria. It’s thought the helmet had been hidden away in a stone box by an owner who, again, failed to return. These ancient treasures are far more valuable than the gold bars buried at Folkestone. That Roman helmet was sold for £2.3 million, and the Staffordshire Hoard has been valued at close to £3.3 million. The message is clear. If you want to track down a fortune, the only way forwards is backwards — start digging into the past.","Artist Michael Sailstorfer set the hares running with gold bars in Folkestone .

"The newest tool in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease could already be in your cupboard because peanut butter has been found to help detect the illness. Researchers at the University of Florida used the sandwich spread in a sniff test to determine patients’ loss of smell in one nostril compared to the other. They found that those in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease lose their sense of smell in the left nostril more quickly than in the right and peanut butter is the perfect substance with which to detect the problem. Scroll down for video... Eureka: Researchers used peanut butter to show that Alzheimer's patients in the early stages of the disease lose their sense of smell in the left nostril before the right . That’s thanks to its status as a ‘pure odorant,’ meaning its smell is detected exclusively by our olfactory nerve. Most smells are also detected with our trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face. But it’s the olfactory nerve that’s important in Alzheimer’s research. Degradation in the olfactory center of the brain is one of the first signs of the disease, but detecting it isn’t easy. Researcher Jennifer Stamps at UF McKnight Brain Institute Center for Smell and Taste conducted the experiment by holding a ruler to the noses of patients with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. One nostril at a time, with the other one held shut, Stamps then slowly moved a tablespoon of peanut butter closer to the nostril in centimeter increments. Smelly experiment: Peanut butter is a 'pure odorant,' meaning it is detected only by the olfactory nerve, unlike most smells which are detected by the nerves of the face as well . Useful: As a 'pure odorant,' peanut butter was perfect for the experiment because Alzheimer's first strikes the olfactory center of the brain, though its hard to detect at early stages . The patients signaled when they could smell the peanut butter. What Stamps found is that Alzheimer’s patients, unlike those with other forms of dementia, had better smell in the right nostril than in the left. On average, patients could smell the peanut butter at about 20 centimeters from their right nostril versus 10 centimeters from their left. Discovery: Researcher Jennifer Stamps slowly moved the peanut butter toward one nostril at a time. She found that Alzheimer's patients could smell the peanut butter with their night nostril about twice as well as with their left . ‘There was a big asymmetry there,’ Stamps said. Her findings could translate into a fast and easy way to detect the initial stages of Alzheimer’s, so that it can be slowed with drugs as early as possible. ‘At the moment, we can use this test to confirm diagnosis,’ Stamps said. ‘But we plan to study patients with mild cognitive impairment to see if this test might be used to predict which patients are going to get Alzheimer’s disease.’","Researchers at the University of Florida have found that patients lose sense of smell in their left nostril faster than their right .

"A Florida man running for a seat in the state legislature is standing behind a Tweet where he wrote 'It's time to arrest the President and 'hang him high.' Josh Black says he did not expect all the attention he got over his Tweet. He's says he's Tweeted negatively about the President before and he's not backing down on his opinions. 'I know that we don't use hanging as a method of execution here in the U.S. anymore, so be it. Whatever method is applicable for the situation, I just want justice to be served,' said the candidate. Black says he was having a Twitter conversation with others who oppose many of the President's actions. Scroll down for video... High him high: 'I know that we don't use hanging as a method of execution here in the U.S. anymore, so be it. Whatever method is applicable for the situation, I just want justice to be served,' said the candidate, Joshua Black . Bring him to justice: Joshua Black explained in his opinion the President has committed multiple crimes and if he's tried and convicted, President Obama should be killed . In regards to deadly drone strikes against US citizens in the middle east, Black wrote, 'I'm past impeachment. It's time to arrest and hang him high.' His tweet, where Black agreed with someone who said the president should be 'hung high,' came from anger over a 2011 drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awalki, an American-born al Qaeda planner in Yemen. Al-Awlaki's son died soon after in a strike officials later admitted was a mistake. 'I believe that every murder should face the death penalty. When George Zimmerman took out Trayvon Martin everyone wanted justice, ok, so we stick him in front of a jury and put him on trial and we give the evidence to a jury and we see what they say. If they say guilty. Death penalty,' said Black. Blinded by his views: The political newcomer said he doesn't fear U.S. Secret Service agents showing up on his doorstep. Many voters might agree with his position, he said, adding: 'I guess they're going to call me a racist now.' Crazy: Joshua Black, who is running to represent District 68 in the Sunshine state, argued that President Barack Obama should be executed for his foreign policies, according 'I¿m past impeachment,' Black wrote on Twitter. 'It¿s time to arrest and hang him high.' Extremist: Despite widespread criticism for his comments, Black is not backing down. ¿He should be executed for treason,' Black said. 'I think the appropriate punishment is death.' The man currently in office, Dwight Dudley says is flawed that anyone would tweet about hanging the President, but he was shocked it turned out be his opponent in the race to represent District 68. 'I think people reveal themselves in what they say. They reveal there true feelings and beliefs, I hope he doesn't truly believe that the President should be hung. I think that's outrageous and wrong,' said Dudley to ABC News. Among others lashing out at the black, Republican candidate house candidate Chris Latvala took to Twitter, writing 'I know you are crazy but good heavens. U R an embarrassment.' He called him the 'loser of the week.' Criticized: Joshua Black certainly didn't make any friends with his outspoken Tweets and Facebook comments . Defending his comments: Hours after the tweet, Black defended his comment. Obama should be held responsible for ordering a drone strike that killed a U.S. citizen overseas, he said . Black, a former street minister, now drives a taxi to make a living, . He says all this attention is weighing hard on him and his pregnant wife. But he spent Tuesday answering to his Tweet and even meeting with the Secret Service. He says he isn't in any trouble with the government or anyone else and doesn't believe his remarks incite violence against the president. 'Not with all the guns he has around him, no. That's the whole reason for having Secret Service, that's the whole reason for having firearms, is personal protection.' 'When you say something you got to own it. And I said what I said, and I'm gonna own it,' Black said. Despite of all the negative attention, he is still continuing his campaign for the State House as a Republican candidate.","Local Republican candidate, Joshua Black, said President Barack Obama should be hanged for war crimes .

"Following the news that Duck Dynasty reality star Phil Robertson made homophobic statements, Cracker Barrel restaurants were the first to make a stance and pull his products from their country stores. But less than 48 hours after that decision was made, the chain of restaurants was met with flurry of negative responses from customers and has since decided to restock Robertson products. 'When we made the decision to remove and evaluate certain Duck Dynasty items, we offended many of our loyal customers,' the company wrote on Facebook. 'Our intent was to avoid offending, but that's just what we've done. You flat out told us we were wrong. We listened.' Back on Phil's side: Cracker Barrel restaurants will go back to selling Phil Robertson products due to customer demand . Side line: A range of products such as this Phil Robertson seasoning are available at the stores. It is not clear if Cracker Barrel has removed items from the family's Duck Commander ranger or A&E merchandise . For the most part, sponsors have . stuck behind Robertson. The shows biggest advertiser, Under Armor, stuck . with the show after the scandal that started this week. 'People weren't shy. They wrote, called and took to social media,' Cracker Barrel spokesman Jeff Eller told ABC News. 'Cracker . Barrel's mission is pleasing people. We operate within the ideals of . fairness, mutual respect and equal treatment of all people. These ideals . are the core of our corporate culture,' the company added on Facebook. The 67-year-old had been quoted in a January 2014 edition of GQ as saying: 'It seems . like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s . anus. 'That’s just . me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I . mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not . logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' Managers at Cracker Barrel were concerned that customers may be offended by the comments, leading them to drop some of the products they stocked. 'We removed selected products which we were concerned might offend some of our guests while we evaluate the situation,' Cracker Barrel said in a Facebook statement. A range of items linked to the program, such as Phil Robertson's Cajun Style Seasoning, have been marketed off the back of the show's success. It is not clear whether the items were the family's Duck Commander ranger or A&E products. The show will go on: Robertson's family will continue starring in the series. He is pictured here with wife Kay in May . Despite initially losing a sponsor and being put on suspension by the network, Robertson has found backing from Bristol Palin, daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah. 'Everyone needs to leave Phil Robertson alone for expressing his beliefs,' she wrote on her blog. 'I hate how the LGBT community says it’s all about ""love"" and ""equality"". However, if you don’t agree with their lifestyle, they spread the most hate. It is so hypocritical it makes my stomach turn.' According to RadarOnline, Miss Palin added: 'If I were Duck Dynasty, I would take my show to another channel.' When Robertson's comments went public, A&E network said: 'We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson’s . comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not . reflected in the series Duck Dynasty. 'His personal views in no way reflect those of A&E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. 'The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely,' said the statement released to Entertainment Weekly. However, a source at the network told EW yesterday that Phil will be featured in new episodes when the fourth season debuts in mid-January, and that they would ideally like to keep him on for a fifth season. According to the source, the network is hoping the situation will blow over during the holiday season. Sarah Palin, pictured with the Duck Dynasty cast while on her book tour in Louisiana. The former governor and her daughter, Bristol, have defended Robertson . The reality show - which follows the Robertson clan running their duck-calling business in the swampland of West Monroe, Louisiana - has been a runaway success for A&E, with a Christmas special recently pulling in 9 million viewers. The 67-year-old came under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine. He told the magazine: 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behaviour and just morph out from there. 'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.' Robertson, who claims to be devoutly . Christian, also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes . when he referenced a Bible quote in the magazine interview. He . said: 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the . male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, . the slanderers, the swindlers - they won’t inherit the kingdom of God.

"A new winter misery index confirms what many Americans in the Midwest and East know in their all-too-chilled bones: This has been one of the harshest winters of our lifetimes. And nowhere has been hit harder, relatively, than Detroit. Sure Chicago, Indianapolis and Philadelphia and Moline, Ill., are in the midst of their third most extreme winters in more than 60 years. But Detroit, a city that is trying to crawl out of bankruptcy, is also slogging through what so far is the most extreme winter it has had since Harry Truman was president, at least, according to a winter extremity index created by a National Weather Service meteorologist Barbara Mayes Boustead. Freezing: Temperatures are set to drop up to 30 degrees below normal mid-week across the Midwest as the Polar Vortex returns for a third round of severe arctic weather. Wednesday forecast: The eastern two-thirds of the U.S is expected to see below-average temperatures this week after January averages were found to have been well below normal . Brutal: Cars with their high beams on drive slowly through the powdery snow in Casper, Wyoming . The index is based on cold temperatures and snowfall. And so far Detroit has had more than 6 1/2 feet of snow and 100 days when the thermometer plunged below the freezing mark. Of two dozen cities studied, Detroit alone is in the middle of its harshest winter since 1950. Boustead, a former Detroit-area . resident who now works in Omaha, Neb., created the index a couple years . ago to judge the severity of winters. Omaha, . by the way, is the only city in two dozen metro areas that Boustead . examined that is not having an 'extreme' or 'severe' winter. It's merely . average. Boustead . uses daily high and low temperatures and daily and accumulated snowfall . to come up with a winter index that's equivalent to the way . meteorologists categorize hurricanes and tornadoes. Officially, it is . called the Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index. 'I personally would call this a misery index,' said Boustead. Not so high: Northern parts of the U.S. will reach highs of 0 degrees . Brutal: The arctic blast will plunge temperatures in Indiana and Massachusetts into single digits . New York, Milwaukee and Duluth are in the midst of their fourth harshest winters. Also having top-10 harshest winters are Minneapolis-St. Paul in Minnesota; Louisville, Ky.; Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and Cheyenne, Wyo. The idea is to put winter in context. This winter seems unusually harsh because it has been a while since the . late 1970s and early 1980s when severe winters were far more frequent. People have short memories. Plus, for almost three-quarters of the places studied the winter of 2011-2012 was the mildest on record, Boustead said. But why Detroit? Just . bad geography and luck. Much of the cold and snow this winter is . because of a change in the jet stream that has funneled frigid air south . from the Arctic 'right down the alley' through Detroit, Hilberg said. Here we again: Susan Pilosi digs through a foot of snow to create a path to her Pennsylvania home . The . winter index keeps going, until the cold, snowy weather stops. And . that's at least a couple weeks away, according to forecasts. 'We're going to push that index a little bit higher,' Boustead said. 'Let's see how much higher we can go.' The relentless snow and ice storms this season have been connected to scores of traffic-related deaths and have led to the highest number of flight cancellations in more than 25 years. U.S. airlines have canceled more than 75,000 domestic flights since December 1, including roughly 14,000 last week - the highest total number and highest percent of cancellations since at least the winter of 1987-1988, when records began.

Still smiling: Not even the driving snow could dampen the spirits of this fashionista attending the Ralph Lauren Fashion show in New York last week . Meanwhile, temperatures are set to drop up to 30 degrees below normal mid-week across the Midwest as the Polar Vortex returns for a third round of severe arctic weather. The arctic blast will head east plunging temperatures in Indiana and Massachusetts into single digits. Even the Deep South will experience temperatures below freezing, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). The NWS said it will not be as severe as the first Polar Vortex to hit the U.S. in January but described it as 'a cold mass of arctic air.' Cities including New York to Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit and Washington, D.C. had all been enjoying temperatures in the 50s last weekend. The Midwest and North East were thawing out after being covered with more than a foot of snow over the past week, but forecasters have warned it won't be for long as another cold front is on its way. The eastern two-thirds of the U.S is expected to see below-average temperatures this week after January averages were found to have been well below normal according to a to a monthly climate report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The cold spell comes from the northern polar vortex, a high-altitude flow of air that circles west to east above the North Pole.

West Ham defender Reece Oxford was named captain again after serving a one-match suspension for a red card in Saturday's opener against Cyprus and Manchester City's Cameron Humphreys made way. Chances were few in the opening minutes though Arsenal youngster Willock saw a 25-yard shot saved by France goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of legend Zinedine. France started to threaten and Maxime Pelican, totally unmarked from a corner, headed the ball into the ground and saw it bounce over the crossbar. The contest had been even but England seized control with two goals in the 10 minutes leading up to half-time. First, after Layton Ndukwu won a corner, Will Patching's quickly-taken delivery was put in by Willock at the far-post, a deflection helping its progress past Zidane. And seconds before the half-time whistle, Tottenham's Marcus Edwards won a free-kick on the edge of the box after beating three defenders. Edwards fancied the kick but Manchester City's Patching had other ideas and curled the ball into the bottom right corner for 2-0.

Inevitably, France, who had also won their opening two matches, returned stronger after the break and saw chances for captain Timothe Cognat and Yann Karamoh go begging. But they halved the deficit on 62 minutes when Karamoh, a half-time substitute, curled home from 20 yards beyond the dive of goalkeeper Paul Woolston. Peacock introduced Middlesbrough's Hayden Coulson and Liverpool's Herbie Kane to stem the French flow and England scored a minute or so later. Chelsea's Da Silva thundered through the French defence and calmly slotted the ball past the goalkeeper to make absoilutely sure of England's win.

"Ukrainian government forces came under artillery fire late on Saturday near the strategic port of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine - just 30 hours after leaders declared a ceasefire. The presidents of Russia and Ukraine had said earlier that the truce - part of a plan intended to end more than four months of conflict - was largely holding across eastern Ukraine, where Kiev's forces have been battling pro-Russian separatists. Witnesses reported that heavy explosions were coming from Mariupol's eastern outskirts, where Ukrainian troops have held defensive lines against the rebels.The port has been a key flashpoint in the past week of fighting. A Ukrainian army checkpoint burns on the road to Russia after loud explosions were heard on the outskirts of the key southeastern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Saturday night . There were also reports of a truck, a gas station and an industrial facility ablaze in the city, while pictures taken on Saturday night showed a Ukrainian army checkpoint up in flames. One Ukrainian fighter said on Facebook that Grad rockets were fired at their positions surrounding Mariupol, a city of about 500,000 on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Trucks were seen moving eastwards with agitated-looking pro-government militia volunteers, according to reports. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were also seen headed in the same direction. One Ukrainian officer told Reuters: 'There has been an artillery attack. We received a number of impacts. We have no information about casualties.' The area had been quiet since the ceasefire took effect on Friday evening, but many in Mariupol and in Donetsk - the other main flashpoint in the conflict - expressed doubts that the ceasefire could last. Meanwhile, . the International Committee for the Red Cross said on its Twitter . account that its workers had tried to deliver food aid to the city of . Luhansk, which had endured weeks of heavy fighting, but turned back . after shelling northeast of the city. It did not give further details. In the days leading up to the ceasefire, pro-Russian opened a new front on the coast of Mariupol, leading to fears that the separatists were trying to secure a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in March. A tank sporting the national emblem of Ukraine rolls down a road on the outskirts of Mariupol, where witnesses reported seeing a petrol station on fire . Earlier on Saturday, both sides said the cease-fire was mostly holding, but the truce still appeared fragile as both sides of the conflict claimed violations. Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said he and Russia's Vladimir Putin . had agreed in a telephone call that 'overall the ceasefire was being . implemented' and that they needed to find ways to make it more durable. The Kremlin later released a similar statement. Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's national security council, told reporters that rebels had fired at Ukrainian forces on 10 occasions Friday night after the ceasefire took effect. In Donetsk, the largest city controlled by the Russian-backed separatists, the night passed quietly - a rarity after several months of daily shelling in residential areas. A car with bullet holes is parked on a street on the outskirts of the key southeastern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, a key port for Ukraine's steel exports . Ukraine, . Russia and the Kremlin-backed separatists signed the cease-fire deal . Friday in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, in an effort to end more than . four months of fighting in the region. The . negotiators also agreed on the withdrawal of all heavy weaponry, the . release of all prisoners and the delivery of humanitarian aid to . devastated cities in eastern Ukraine. Andriy Lysenko, the spokesman of . Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, said Kiev wanted the . exchange of prisoners of war to take place 'as fast as possible' but . gave no timeframe. He said the rebels were holding more than 200 Ukrainians captive. Mr Poroshenko agreed to the ceasefire . after Ukraine accused Russia of sending troops and arms onto its . territory in support of the separatists, who had suffered big losses . over the summer. Moscow denies sending troops or arming the rebels. Tanks line the side of the road on the outskirts of Mariupol. The Russian and Ukrainian leaders had said earlier that the ceasefire, part of a plan intended to end months of conflict, was largely holding across eastern Ukraine . If . the ceasefire holds, it would be a landmark achievement for both sides. Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian government troops has . ravaged the already teetering Ukrainian economy, claimed at least 2,600 . civilian lives and left hundreds of thousands homeless, according to . United Nations estimates. A . previous 10-day cease-fire, which each side repeatedly accused the . other of violating, yielded few results at the negotiating table. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was hopeful the cease-fire would hold but unsure the rebels would follow through. 'It has to be tested,' President Obama said Friday at the close of a two-day NATO summit in Wales. Mr Poroshenko spent Thursday and Friday . at the NATO summit in Wales where David Cameron, U.S. President Barack . Obama and other leaders urged Putin to pull its forces out of Ukraine. NATO also approved wide-ranging plans to boost its defences in eastern Europe in response to the Ukraine crisis. The Ukraine conflict has revived talk of a new Cold War as the West accuses Putin of deliberately destabilising the former Soviet republic. Putin says he is defending the interests of ethnic Russians facing discrimination and oppression. The European Union announced new economic sanctions against Russia late on Friday over its role in Ukraine but said they could be suspended if Moscow withdraws its troops and observes the conditions of the ceasefire. Russia's foreign ministry responded angrily on Saturday to the measures, pledging unspecified 'reaction' if they were implemented. Moscow responded to a previous round of U.S. and EU sanctions by banning most Western food imports.","Witnesses reported hearing prolonged artillery fire late on Saturday night .

"Climate change is expected to contribute to a 'dramatic increase' in forest fires in Europe, according to a new study. The research claims that increased temperatures and longer droughts will create a 200 per cent increase in raging forest infernos by 2090. However, preventive fires could keep that increase to below 50 per cent, the Austrian scientists claim. Research claims that increased temperatures and droughts will create a 200 per cent increase in forest fires . Researchers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis focused on two strategies to mitigate the impact: prescribed burns and fire suppression. Prescribed burns help prevent major fires by removing dead wood from forests. 'There is still a big debate on the effectiveness of prescribed burning as a forest fire management tool,' said Nikolay Khabarov, who led the study. 'This study shows that it can be a promising option to protect European forests from the impacts of climate change.' Prescribed burns help prevent major fires by removing dead wood from forests. 'There is still a big debate on the effectiveness of prescribed burning as a forest fire management tool,' said researcher Nikolay Khabarov . The study also examined the potential of better firefighting to help reduce burned areas. But in a statement, the research team said no study has yet managed to find out the cost and benefit of such efforts at a continental scale. 'European forests are vital reservoirs for wildlife, for biodiversity, and for our own enjoyment and well-being,' said Dr Khabarov, 'We need to find ways to protect them.' The researchers claim that in Europe, over 95 per cent of all forest fires are caused by humans, including negligence when smoking cigarettes, using campfires and other open fires that are not put out properly, and even arson. 'In more populous areas, the chance of occurrence of forest fires rises dramatically,' said researcher Andrey Krasovskii, a study co-author. This map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents. The IPCC report claims that no one will be untouched by climate change . 'We could prevent many of these fires simply by being more responsible.' The findings follow a recent report that claims no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges, flooding and heatwaves among the key risks of global warming in the coming decades. This was the warning made in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II report, published in March. The report said that violent conflicts, food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years. It argued that rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species. It also claimed that the world is in ‘an era of man-made climate change’ and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans. Europe: The IPCC expects 'multiple stresses and systemic failures due to climate change' in the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050. North America: Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of New York. Southern areas are expected to experience a shortage of water. Asia: The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern Asia. However, water  is also expected to affect most of Asia. Australasia: There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme weather is predicted. The Great Barrier Reef will continue to degrade, with warmer  water bleaching more coral. Africa: Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought. There will also be more soil erosion from storms. Central and South America: Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100, while the area around Chile could get a 25 per cent increase.","Preventive fires may keep increase to under 50 per cent, study says .

"A satanic group unveiled designs Monday for a 7-foot-tall statue of Satan it wants to put at the Oklahoma state Capitol, where a Ten Commandments monument was placed in 2012. The New York-based Satanic Temple formally submitted its application to a panel that oversees the Capitol grounds, including an artist's rendering that depicts Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, wings and a long beard that's often used as a symbol of the occult. In the rendering, Satan is sitting in a pentagram-adorned throne with smiling children next to him. 'The monument has been designed to reflect the views of Satanists in Oklahoma City and beyond,' temple spokesman Lucien Greaves said in a statement. Satan: This artist's rendering provided by the Satanic Temple shows a proposed monument that the New York-based Satanic group wants to place at the Oklahoma state Capitol . 'The statue will also have a functional purpose as a chair where people of all ages may sit on the lap of Satan for inspiration and contemplation.' The Satanic Temple maintains that the Oklahoma Legislature's decision to authorize a privately funded Ten Commandments monument at the Capitol opened the door for its statue. The Ten Commandments monument was placed on the north steps of the building in 2012, and the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has sued to have it removed. Similar requests for monuments have been made by a Hindu leader in Nevada, an animal rights group and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. In response, the Oklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission recently placed a moratorium on considering any new requests. Capitol: The New York-based Satanic Temple formally submitted its application to a panel that oversees the Capitol grounds, pictured . 'Anybody can still make their . request, but we'll hold off on considering them until the lawsuit is . adjudicated,' commission Chairman Trait Thompson said. The push by the Satanic Temple has rankled elected leaders in this conservative state known as the buckle of the Bible Belt, who say such a proposal would never be approved by the commission. 'I think you've got to remember where you are. This is Oklahoma, the middle of the heartland,' said Don Armes, Republican representative for Faxon. 'I think we need to be tolerant of people who think different than us, but this is Oklahoma, and that's not going to fly here.' While Greaves acknowledges the Satanic Temple's effort is in part to highlight what it says is hypocrisy of state leaders in Oklahoma, he says the group is serious about having a monument placed there. Statue: The group wants the statue to go where a Ten Commandments monument, pictured, was placed in 2012 . The group already has raised nearly half of the $20,000 it says it needs to build the monument. 'We plan on moving forward one way or another,' Greaves said. Another Oklahoma legislator, representative Earl Sears, called the group's effort 'an insult to the good people of the state.' 'I do not see Satanism as a religion, and they have no place at the state Capitol,' said Sears, Republican for Bartlesville. On its website, the Satanic Temple explains that it 'seeks to separate Religion from Superstition by acknowledging religious belief as a metaphorical framework with which we construct a narrative context for our goals and works. 'Satan stands as the ultimate icon for the selfless revolt against tyranny, free & rational inquiry, and the responsible pursuit of happiness,' the website says.","The New York-based Satanic Temple formally submitted its application to a panel that oversees the Capitol grounds .

"Russia sent a naval convoy to reopen a military base in the Arctic in support of Vladimir Putin's claims to vast energy riches under the ice cap . Russia yesterday sent a naval convoy to reopen a military base in the Arctic in support of Vladimir Putin’s claims to vast energy riches under the ice cap. The move comes the day after a ceasefire in Ukraine saw a major territorial advantage to his separatist supporters, and as Russia contests Canada, Denmark, Norway and the US for the right to exploit the mineral wealth of the Arctic. The Arctic Circle is estimated to contain 22 per cent of global recoverable energy resources. The base will also supervise the Northern Sea Route between Europe and Asia, viable since ice melted in the region. The presidents of Russia and Ukraine said on Saturday that a ceasefire between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists was holding up fairly well and they discussed urgent humanitarian aid for the shattered region. Residents and combatants in eastern Ukraine welcomed the respite in a five-month conflict that has killed at least 2,600 people but said they did not expect it to last. They also each accused the enemy of using the truce to rebuild their forces. The presidents also expressed support for the full involvement of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a rights watchdog, in monitoring the ceasefire. Envoys of Ukraine, Russia, the separatist leadership and the OSCE approved the ceasefire in Minsk on Friday as part of a peace roadmap that also includes an exchange of prisoners of war and establishing a humanitarian corridor for refugees and aid. Russia sent a navy convoy to reopen a base, which will also supervise the Northern Sea Route between Europe and Asia, viable since ice melted in the region.

The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes. It . is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire . screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704 x 904 resolution. Experts . also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - . possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support. It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5. A video has also been posted to YouTube by PhoneEvaluation, which claims to be the first review of the new iPhone model. In the video and images, the model's larger screen is shown being able to fit an extra row of icons - taking the total up to six, plus the dock, compared to the current row of five plus dock. Although the video and images don’t reveal much more about the upcoming phone’s other features, it does include an updated Passbook icon. For example, along the bottom row of icons in the demo video, the Passbook icon is shown with four tabs - red, blue, green and yellow. By comparison, the current, iOS 7 Passbook icon features just blue, green and yellow. Passbook is used to store airline boarding passes, movie tickets, and gift cards all in one place, letting users scan their iPhone or iPod touch to check in for a flight, get into a movie, redeem a coupon, and more.

"The West is exploiting the Ukraine conflict in a deliberate bid to force Vladimir Putin out of power, Moscow claims. This is the real aim of US policy, but the attempt will backfire, warned former FSB secret service chief Sergei Stepashin, who preceded Putin as prime minister. In an open letter to Barack Obama – amid a fragile ceasefire in Ukraine – he accused the US president of ‘propaganda’ in blaming Russia for the violence in Ukraine and claiming Moscow threatens its neighbours. Scroll down for video . Under threat: Vladimir Putin is said to have 'hurt' Barack Obama over Syria, according to former Russian prime minister, Sergei Stepashin . He said Mr Obama was ratcheting up sanctions to ‘isolate Russia and generate a new Cold War’, aiming to hurt the country’s economy to the extent that Putin is forced out. ‘It is perfectly obvious that you are preparing grounds to loudly state your main goal: “Putin should resign”,’ he said. Stepashin, now head of the Russian government’s accounts chamber, claimed Putin had outplayed a ‘hurt’ Mr Obama over Syria, preventing Western military intervention, and with his peace plan had caused the US president ‘to lose face’ in Ukraine. Open letter: Mr Stepashin has accused Barack Obama of generating a new Cold War to force Vladimir Putin out . He added the White House was seeking to pull Europe into a conflict there, showing Mr Obama to be a ‘hawk who dresses up as a peacekeeper and can be called the father of the new Cold War’. It comes as Russia faces claims from Amnesty International that it lied to the world in denying its troops and weaponry were supporting rebels in Ukraine. The human rights group accuses Putin’s forces of backing militias ‘responsible for war crimes’. It produced satellite images to back its case and ‘documented incidents of indiscriminate shelling, abductions, torture and killings’ by Moscow’s supporters. Moscow has angrily denied its forces were deployed in Ukraine. Last night it vowed to hit back against the EU if a new list of sanctions – which target Russian officials as well as the Kremlin’s oil and gas interests – is approved this week, saying there would ‘undoubtedly be a reaction’. And Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko made clear that the ceasefire may not hold. ‘I am ready to fight for my country and even to die for it,’ he said.","Ex prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, says Barack Obama lost face over Syria .

"Speer (pictured with Hitler) spent 20 years in Spandau Prison for war crimes - not Spandau Ballet, as a BBC presenter has suggested . A BBC radio announcer has apologised after accidentally saying that Nazi architect Albert Speer spent 20 years in the 1980's new romantic band Spandau Ballet, instead of Spandau Prison.

"Swiss Alpine cows, adorned with flowers and ribbons, have just been brought down to lower mountain pastures, signalling the imminent arrival of winter. But despite Switzerland celebrating 150 years of winter-sports tourism this year, new legislation demanding that the Swiss minimum wage is paid to staff in British-run chalets has all but wiped out the value end of chalet ski holidays in the country. As most UK companies cannot afford the cost, they have simply pulled out of the market. Only the most luxurious chalets remain, but these fetch on average £2,000 per person, per week – and that’s excluding flights. Switzerland celebrates 150 years of winter sports tourism this year . UK companies have pulled out of the Switzerland's value for sports tourism  due to the new legislation .

"Worms weren't always as spineless as you might think. In fact, human spines may have evolved from an ancient marine worm, according to new research. The study claims that the first vertebrate skeleton 'probably evolved from muscle', and its origins are older than first thought. The marine worm Platynereis has a muscle (red) which develops in the same place and has the same genetic signature as the notochord (blue) that develops into our spinal discs . Humans are part of a group of animals called chordates, whose defining feature is a rod of cartilage that runs lengthwise under the spinal chord. This structure, called the notochord, was the first vertebrate skeleton, according to scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany. It is present in human embryos, and is replaced with the backbone as we develop, with the cartilage reduced to those tell-tale discs. Since starfish, sea urchins and related animals have no such structure, scientists assumed the notochord had emerged in a relatively recent ancestor, after our branch of the evolutionary tree split away from the 'starfish branch'. Scientists found that the larva of the marine worm Platynereis has a group of cells with that same genetic signature as the first ever vertebrate skeleton . Researchers at Cambridge University believe a 505 million-year-old creature, found only in the Burgess Shale fossil beds in Canada’s Yoho National Park, is the most primitive known vertebrate. Named Pikaia gracilens, it is the most primitive member of the chordate family, the group of animals that today includes fish, amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals. Pikaia was first described, on the basis of only a few specimens, by American palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1911. Averaging about five centimetres in length, Pikaia was a sideways-flattened, somewhat eel-like animal. The flattened body is divided into a series of segmented muscle blocks seen as S-shaped lines that lie on either side of the notochord which runs along most, if not all of the body length. It likely swam above the sea floor by moving its body in a series of side-to-side curves. 'People simply haven't been looking beyond our direct relatives, but that means you could be fooled, if the structure appeared earlier and that single group lost it,' says Detlev Arendt from EMBL, who led the study. 'And in fact, when we looked at a broader range of animals, this is what we found.' Antonella Lauri and Thibaut Brunet identified the genetic signature of the notochord - the combination of genes that have to be turned on for a healthy notochord to form. When they found that the larva of the marine worm Platynereis has a group of cells with that same genetic signature, the scientists teamed up with EMBL to use microscopy to follow those cells as the larva developed. They found that the cells form a muscle that runs along the animal's midline, precisely where the notochord would be if the worm were a chordate. The researchers named this muscle the axochord, as it runs along the animal's axis. Most of the animal groups that sit between Platynereis and chordates on the evolutionary tree also have a similar, muscle-based structure in the same position. Human spines may have evolved from an ancient marine worm, according to new research.The study claims that the first vertebrate skeleton 'probably evolved from muscle', and its origins are older than first thought . The scientists reason that such a structure probably first emerged in an ancient ancestor, before all these different animal groups branched out on their separate evolutionary paths. Such a scenario would also explain why the lancelet amphioxus, a 'primitive' chordate, has a notochord with both cartilage and muscle. Rather than having acquired the muscle independently, amphioxus could be a living record of the transition from muscle-based midline to cartilaginous notochord. The shift from muscle to cartilage could have come about because a stiffened central rod would make swimming more efficient, the scientists claim.","German study claims the first vertebrate skeleton 'evolved from muscle'

"To the schoolboy stamp collector who plucked it from a pile of family papers more than a century ago, it was simply a new addition to his collection. But now a 1-cent postage stamp is set to become the most expensive in the world. The unremarkable-looking 1856 British Guiana 1-cent Magenta is set to sell for an amazing £12million at auction. In this undated photo provided by Sotheby's Auction House, the one-cent 1856 British Guiana stamp is shown. Already having set three price records for the sale of a single stamp, the stamp is poised to set a fourth when it is offered at auction by Sotheby's in June . It is described by experts as the Mona Lisa of the stamp world and hasn’t been displayed publicly since 1986. Measuring 1inch by 1 and 1/4 inches, it bears the image of a ship with the former colony’s motto, ‘We give and expect in return’ in Latin. The image is in black on magenta paper. It first belonged to a Scottish boy, Vernon Vaughan, who spotted it at the age of 12 in 1873 when he was living with his parents in the former colony, now known as Guyana. He sold it on for a few shillings to fellow Scot, Neil R McKinnon, to buy more stamps. Each time it changed hands, the stamp increased in value. Stamp collecting has long been a pastime of many British children, as well as children and adults across the world. Even John Lennon of the Beatles had a stamp collection as a schoolboy (pictured) By 1980, it had reached a then record . price of £402,000 – equivalent to about £1.5million today – when John E . Du Pont bought it. However, Du Pont, heir to the eponymous chemical company fortune, died in prison in 2010 after he was convicted of fatally shooting a 1984 Olympic champion wrestler 13 years earlier. The stamp is now being sold by his estate, which will designate part of the proceeds to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Conservation Foundation that du Pont championed during his lifetime. The stamp is being sold at Sotheby’s in New York on June 14, where it will easily fetch a world record price  if it sells within its estimate. Allen Kane, director of the Smithsonian National Postal Museum, said: ‘You’re probably not going to find anything rarer than this. It’s a stamp the world of collectors has been dying to see for a long time.’ David Beech, a curator of stamps at the British Library before he retired last year, said it was like buying the Mona Lisa. David Redden, director of special projects and worldwide chairman of Sotheby’s books department, said it was ‘the superstar of the stamp world’. He added: ‘I have been with Sotheby’s all my working life, but before I knew about the world’s greatest art, I knew about the British Guiana. ‘As a schoolboy stamp collector, it was a magical object.’ The stamp will go on display in London before its sale. The current world auction best for a single stamp is £1.41million in 1996 – equivalent to £2.24million today – for the Swedish Treskilling Yellow. When the Treskilling Yellow was sold, it was most expensive item in the world by weight.","First belonged to a Scottish boy, Vernon Vaughan, who spotted it in 1873 .

In New York, Mayor de Blasio has come in for sharp criticism for his handling of the snow storm after residents in the Upper East Side complained that their neighborhood was being ignored by snow plows. At one point on Tuesday afternoon the city's PlowNYC website appeared to show no snow plows between East 59th and 79th Streets and between Second and Fifth Avenues. Residents complained to the New York Post that the wealthy area had been deliberately ignored. 'He is trying to get us back. He is very divisive and political,' said one angry resident. But Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty has claimed the map was inaccurate because one spreader had a broken GPS and so wasn't reporting its progress. 'The GPS was not working,' he said. 'Also, traffic created a lot of problems for us in that area.' At the same press conference de Blasio stood by his performance. 'All city agencies are acting [like] usual very, very effectively and in a coordinated fashion.' All public schools will be open Wednesday.

"These newly re-released images show the moment Adolf Hitler rose to power - exactly 80 years ago today. On January 30, 1933, the man who would become one of the worst tyrants in history was appointed Chancellor of Germany, the first step towards his creation of a totalitarian regime.

A . spokesman for British Pathe said: 'Hitler's appointment as Chancellor . was significant in his rise to power and the footage from 80 years ago . is an important piece of history because of what followed.' Hitler immediately began consolidating his power and dismantled a number of freedoms in Germany . Hitler was able to achieve power thanks to the backing of captains of industry, businessmen and powerul politicians. He had come second in the 1932 election . Hitler was appointed chancellor by . German statesman Paul von Hindenburg after three elections had not . resulted in the formation of a majority government. Von .

"Carlo Ancelotti will attempt to block any move by Premier League clubs to buy Sami Khedira this January, but Real Madrid will overrule their coach if the offer comes close to their £10million valuation of the player whose contract runs out at the end of the season. Here’s Sportsmail's assessment of who should be pushing hardest for the 27-year-old World Cup winner: . Sami Khedira celebrates winning the World Cup with Germany in Brazil in the summer . Arsenal . It’s not difficult to see why Arsenal might try to meet that evaluation as soon as the window opens and then talk wages with the German World Cup winner who was understood to be demanding over £150,000-a-week in the summer. Khedira has all the qualities Arsene Wenger wants in the new holding midfielder he delayed buying in the summer because he believed he might end up with the German only to be outmaneuvered by Bayern Munich, who pounced for Xabi Alonso and left Real suddenly far more reluctant to sell Khedira. In Glenn Hoddle’s Mail on Sunday column at the weekend he touched on the great Arsene Wenger sides having a solid centre – most famously with Emmanuel Petit and Partick Vieira – and Khedira fits that mould. Arsenal need a solid central midfielder in the mould of Patrick Vieira, and Khedira would provide that . He has the intelligence and the physical condition to screen the back four and he has the vision and technical ability to release players around him. He might also put some spark back into fellow German World Cup winner Mesut Ozil. The pair were not that close at Madrid owing to their different tastes away from football. Ozil would wind down socially from big games whereas Khedira would already be thinking about what might be asked of him in the next match. But the two men are friends and if Wenger were to move Ozil into the No 10 position he would have, with Per Mertesacker and Khedira, a German World Cup winning spine to his team. Khedira could leave Real Madrid in January if an offer of around £10million comes in . Manchester United . Just as Khedira would have an instant friend at Arsenal in Ozil, a move to Old Trafford would reunite him with Angel di Maria. They arrived at Real Madrid in the same summer and the two would have plenty to talk about having both felt undervalued in the Spanish capital. On the pitch Khedira would fit into Louis van Gaal’s team right where it appears most vulnerable. The Dutch coach turned down the chance to sign him for Bayern in Germany but his options at United are considerably worse and Khedira’s flexibility would be a major plus. Louis van Gaal and Manchester United could be in for the German midfielder come January . He could hold in front of the defence or even play to the left or right of a holder and release Di Maria to play further forward. The quietly spoken German will not be the vocal leader United have missed in the middle of the park since Roy Keane but he would be an upgrade on some of the attempts at filling his shoes in recent seasons. The wages that are likely to frighten Arsenal would not be a problem and the lines of communication are firmly open after the Di Maria switch this summer and Javier Hernandez’ move in the opposite direction. United even came close to landing Khedira on the last day of the transfer window a year ago but the offer of around £31m arrived too late for Madrid to properly consider it. It will take a lot less this time. Manchester United have missed a tough man in the middle of the park ever since Roy Keane left . Chelsea . When Jose Mourinho took over at Real Madrid in May 2010 one of his first requests to his new club was that they buy Khedira. His impressive FIFA match stats from the World Cup stood up the confidence Mourinho had in him. Only Xavi and Bastian Schweinsteiger ran more in that tournament and in what FIFA call ‘high intensity activity’ Khedira came out on top. Carlo Ancelotti's decision to keep Khedira may be overturned if the right money is offered . His performances in Brazil despite having missed almost all of the 2013-14 season will have done nothing to change that reputation for being a multi-purpose midfield machine. Mourinho has Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas combining perfectly at the moment but Khedira would give him more tactical alternatives, the relationship between the pair is good enough for the player to wait until the end of the season saving Roman Abramovich the transfer fee. And boy wouldn’t it annoy Arsene? Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger may be doing battle sooner than expected; in the transfer market .","Carlo Ancelotti will attempt to block moves from Premier League clubs .

"Action: A Libyan soldier in training. Three stationed at a barracks in Cambridgeshire were detained after breaking orders not to go to the local supermarket . They are being trained to defeat violent militia and restore order to a war-ravaged country – but Libyan troops at a UK base have staged a mutiny fighting for a more British freedom: the right to go to Tesco. The uprising kicked off when three North African soldiers stationed at barracks in Cambridgeshire were detained after breaking orders not to go to the village supermarket. And it became a full-on mutiny when up to 20 of their comrades stormed the area where they were being kept to demand their release. The British corporal in charge of the guardroom was jostled and shouted at during the angry confrontation and eventually defused the situation by releasing the Tesco Three, who had earlier been picked up by police after leaving the barracks without permission. They are among more than 300 Libyan cadets who are being trained in infantry and leadership skills  by soldiers from 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland at Bassingbourn Barracks. But under rules agreed by the MoD and the 4,000 residents of the village, trainees are allowed to leave the base only on organised tourist trips. An Army source said: ‘Between 15 and 20 of the Libyans got wind of what had happened to their friends and felt they had a grievance. They made their way to the guardroom and remonstrated with the soldiers. ‘It got a bit heated and the corporal in charge showed remarkable restraint in the face of considerable intimidation. He eventually decided to de-escalate the situation and everyone was let out of the guardroom.’ No weapons were involved in the stand-off, which happened a month ago but has only now come to light. About 30 cadets, including some of those involved in the fracas, have left the course early and returned home. Confined: Under rules agreed by the MoD, Libyan soldiers were told not to leave Bassingbourn base unless they were taken to the local village as part of organised tourist trips . Standoff: The British corporal in charge of the guardroom at Bassingbourn Barracks (pictured) was jostled and shouted at during the angry confrontation and eventually defused the situation by releasing the Tesco Three . The MoD confirmed a disturbance and said: ‘This behaviour was unacceptable and steps have been taken to investigate the reasons behind  it. Appropriate action was taken against some of those involved. All recruits have been reminded of the standards of behaviour we expect.’ According to British military sources, the miscreants were disciplined by Libyan officials but it  is not known what penalties were imposed. Some recruits have also been unhappy about delays to their pay and allowances, over which the  British Army has no control. Britain is training about 2,000 Libyan troops, with the aim of them returning home and ‘supporting Libya’s transition to a stable and open democracy’, in the words of Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. No weapons were involved in the stand-off, which happened a month ago but has only now come to light.

"Hero firefighter Jimmy Martinez was off duty when he saw the first aircraft crash into the World Trade Center 13 years ago before racing to his assigned station house in Staten Island. Now the 24-year veteran is facing a life-or-death battle with a rare form of blood cancer, which he believed was caused by breathing toxic dust from the scene of the disaster. Such was the rush to get to Ground Zero, many of Martinez's colleagues didn't even have basic safety equipment such as masks or respirators. The 54-year-old firefighter was diagnosed last year with multiple myeloma in June 2013 and now needs a lifesaving bone marrow transplant. Firefighter Jimmy Martinez believes his cancer was caused by breathing in toxic dust from 9/11 . As soon as Jimmy Martinez saw the second aircraft crash he raced to Ground Zero to help with the rescue . Martinez said the area was covered by toxic dust but his main thoughts were about rescuing other people . Since his diagnosis, the father of three has undergone five intensive rounds of chemotherapy, but requires stem cell treatment to control the incurable disease. Six members of his firehouse died on 9/11 while four others have gone on to develop cancer. New research has shown that emergency service personnel who spent long periods of time at Ground Zero following the disaster have a 20 per cent higher change of developing cancer compared with the general population. A study published in The Lancet in 2011 proved the link between working at Ground Zero and an elevated cancer risk. The Fire Department of New York even lists the names of men who have died from cancer linked to 9/11 on a memorial to their fallen colleagues. Now the firefighter is trying to encourage people to sign up to a national bone marrow register in order to help sufferers like himself. Speaking to Fox News, Martinez said: 'I knew that there was potential for great harm, but I just didn’t think it would come in the form of cancer as multiple myeloma years later. So now I’m no longer fighting fires, I’m basically fighting for my life, hoping for a donor.' He added: 'In my firehouse alone, over the last few years, including myself, there have been five men diagnosed with cancer; two with multiple myeloma, one with leukemia, one lymphoma and one with lung cancer . 'So if you multiply that by all the firehouses throughout New York City, I think you start to get a picture of what we’re dealing with here.' Six members of his old firehouse in Brooklyn died on 9/11 while four others have developed cancer . He told the Huffington Post that he has no regrets about his actions on 9/11 even though it is responsible for his cancer. He said: 'Every firefighter on the job would say if they had to do it all over again, they would. That’s the way it goes. There’s nothing like having a job where you help people for a living. Any time you go out and come across someone in need, you think about your own family. 'And then there's the brotherhood. We work together through thick and thin. Form really strong bonds. I don’t know too many other jobs out there that offer that. It’s rewarding on so many levels.' Medics treating Martinez were able to harvest some of his own stem cells and give him a transfusion that has sent the cancer into partial remission. But in the longer term he will require a donor. As a result he is involved in a massive awareness raising campaign to get people to join the national bone marrow register. Potential donors only need to supply a simple cheek swab which takes only three to five minutes.","Jimmy Martinez raced to Ground Zero even though it was his day off .

"An actor best known for a bit role in the first Austin Powers film pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he murdered his cell mate at a Southern California prison. Joseph Son, 42, played Dr. Evil’s shoe-wielding henchman Random Task in 1997’s Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. He was arrested in 1998 for raping and torturing an Orange County woman years before. Authorities say that just a month into Son’s life sentence, the mixed marital arts fighter killed his cell mate Charles Graham, 50, with a ‘combination of kicks and punches.’ Nothing to lose? The man who played Random Task in the first Austin Powers film has pleaded not guilty to killing his cell mate just a month into a life sentence for a 1990 gang rape and torture . Sex offender: Son, a mixed martial artist, is charged with killing cell mate, convicted child molester Charles Graham, in 2011 . This, according to TMZ, where it’s been reported that Son could face the death penalty. He is next scheduled to make an appearance on October 7 in Kern County Superior Court, reports the Bakersfield Californian. Graham was serving out two years at Wasco State Prison for failing to register as a sex offender when prison authorities found him dead. It was subsequently revealed that Graham was a convicted child molester. The brutal nature of his murder will reportedly be taken into consideration as part of Son’s trial. The official charge against Son, as read by Judge H.A. 'Skip' Staley is assault by a life prisoner with force causing death. Son was serving life for helping rape and torture a woman on Christmas Eve in 1990. Son and co-defendant Santiago Lopez Gaitan abducted the then-19-year-old victim as she was walking her dog by her apartment. They then drove the woman to Huntington Beach and repeatedly raped and sodomized her in the back of the car at gunpoint. They also pistol-whipped her and repeatedly threatened to kill her, counting the bullets and telling her she was going to die. Life sentence: Joseph Son, a former UFC fighter and bit player in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (right), was already serving a life sentence for the Christmas Eve 1990 rape and murder of an Orange County woman . Prosecutors say the woman, identified in court papers as Jane Doe, begged for her life before Son and Gaitan released her, naked, badly injured and blindfolded with her own pants.She went to a local home, where police were called. Evidence was collected from the woman that Christmas Eve, but the case eventually went cold. It wasn't until Son pleaded guilty to felony vandalism in 2008 and violated probation that he was required to provide a DNA sample. That sample was linked to DNA collected from Doe in 1990. Prosecutor Eric Scarborough said Son was sadist who took pleasure in terrifying his victim. Far fall: Son was a former UFC fighter and had a small role in the first Austin Powers fild (pictured) as Random Task, the henchman of Dr. Evil (right), played by Mike Myers .","Joseph Son, 42, played henchman Random Task in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery .

"It's not the first place you might think of when booking a ski trip. But in sunny South Africa's Drakensberg mountain range, fans of the downward slope can gather for an altogether surreal ski experience. Just don't expect soft powder and runs which go on for miles. Tiffindell resort, which is perched upon the Ben McDhui peak  - the highest point in the Cape - offers tourists the chance to hit the slopes South Africa style. A lone skier on a slope surrounded by the dry Drakensberg mountain range in north east South Africa . Accommodating about 150 guests in timber chalets, the resort offers three- and four-night ski and snowboard packages. And for those all important apres ski refreshments -  it also boasts the highest pub in South Africa. But the major flaw to the ski resort is that it sees very little actual snowfall. The mountains are high and dry, and while the area sees the occasional blizzard, it can go as long as a year without seeing a single flake of the white stuff. The Drankensberg mountains can go as long as a year without seeing a single flake of the white stuff . Downhill: When it opened the resort boosted tourism, but it was later closed due to a lack of custom . Instead, the process of snow-making - usually used by ski resorts to supplement natural flakes and extend the season - is employed by resort staff. The artificially-made white stuff covers around 1,000m of ski runs for three months of the year during an average winter. But this type of snow creates a super-slidey surface, which while being popular with ski races, can be risky for beginners - or indeed anyone other than true professionals. It's also quite an adventure to get there. Situated 24km above the town of Rhodes and about 212km east of Aliwal North, it is only reachable in small vehicles with no trailers  in dry conditions. Snowmaking - used by resorts to supplement natural snow - is employed by Tiffindell staff . Originally established in 1993, making it the first resort in the area (there is another one Afriski in neighbouring Lesotho), initially it brought people to this remote area, boosting local tourism. But things went downhill and the resort was closed in 2010 due to a lack of custom. It was sold at auction in 2012 and reopened in 2013 by local skier and businessman Lew Campbell. Situated 24km above the town of Rhodes, the resort is only reachable in small vehicles . 'I used to go to Tiffindell all the time, and I'm part of this special community of skiers in South Africa,' he said at the time. While most ski resorts boast hundreds and sometimes thousands of acres, Tiffindell's five acres might seem a little poky. It also only has one ski lift.

"Kmart has launched its Christmas advertising campaign more than 100 days before the holiday in a desperate bid to beat off the competition. But the extra-early ad blitz has infuriated shoppers who've taken to the retailer's Facebook page to slam the out-of-season commercial. Industry analysts say the unprecedented move will bring forward the Christmas ad cycle 'by a few weeks' as competitors jump on the promotional bandwagon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . What the? Kmart has enraged customers by airing its first Christmas advertisement about its layaway program - featuring a gingerbread man - more than 100 days before the holiday . Market leader: Ad industry analysts say Kmart's decision to air a Christmas ad this week will move the Christmas ad cycle up 'by a few weeks' The . commercial, which first aired on September 8, promotes the retailer's layaway program. It features a . gingerbread man sneaking up on a woman working in an office cubicle, with a voice over saying: 'Don't let the holidays sneak up on you. Shop early with . Kmart free layaway.' Almost instantly, the retailer's Facebook page was brimming with complaints. One customer wrote: 'What happened to Halloween and thanksgiving? Stop with the Christmas commercials ALREAY! [sic]'. Another wrote: 'I WON'T be shopping at Kmart at Christmas. This is just a money making scheme. Kmart is only eager for the dollar signs. Places that start Christmas too early don't get my money. Christmas is NOT about gifts...it's about Jesus and family.' Unperturbed by the backlash, Kmart merely thanked its critics: 'We're just really excited for the holidays and layaway!'

"Tesco has bitten back against both cut-price and upmarket rivals snapping at its heels. The supermarket’s Finest range has won 22 out of 74 gold medals in the supermarket own-label food ‘Oscars’. The triumph is particularly sweet for the giant because it regained top spot from budget chain Aldi, which fell to fourth place. But the results suggest Tesco has no room for complacency because second place went to discounter Lidl, which achieved 19 golds.

Gold also went to its Finest Wensleydale Terrine with Cranberry & Blueberry from the Long Clawson Dairy in Leicestershire, which was founded more than 100 years ago and its best known for its blue stilton. There were also golds for many premium imports such as Finest Italian Pomodorini Tomato sauce. Consumer tests showed it appealed particularly to the over 55s and wealthier ABC1 customers.

"No wonder Manchester United can't wait for Wayne Rooney to return in the Manchester derby on Sunday. The Etihad is a particularly happy hunting ground for the England striker with seven of his record 11 derby goals coming there – including his last five against City. So while Manuel Pellegrini's men will boast home advantage, the Premier League title and a better team than their neighbours, United's players inside the away dressing-room will see Rooney and still believe they can win. Nobody has scored more Manchester derby goals than Rooney – 11 in 22 appearances. There will be international talent worth hundreds of millions on show but none is proven in this special fixture than Rooney. Wayne Rooney will captain Manchester United in Sunday's derby after serving a three-game suspension . Rooney (right) hasn't featured for the Red Devils since being sent off against West Ham in September . The 29-year-old will return from a three-match suspension to wear the captain's armband for the first time ever in a Manchester derby and his return can't come soon enough for United who have failed to win their last two games without him and are off the pace for a top-four finish. Some of his best moments in a United shirt have come against the emerging enemy from across the city – the special atmosphere clearly fires him up. Most famous of course was his spectacular overhead kick against City in February 2011, which was voted the best goal of the first 20 years of the Premier League. It was important too – the winning goal in a 2-1 United victory at Old Trafford, but it's by no means his only derby highlight. After drawing a blank in his first derby, Rooney sent out a warning to City fans for future years by converting a Gary Neville cross to score in a 2-0 United win at the Etihad in 2005. Rooney won the Manchester derby for United in February 2011 with a spectacular overhead kick . The change in City's ownership in 2008 was always likely to tilt the balance of power away from United, who had been completely dominant in Manchester before then. But Rooney more than any other Red seemed to thrive on the challenge. In the first derby of the “Abu Dhabi era”, Rooney scored the only goal at The Etihad in 2008 and United went on to retain the Premier League. City have become serial trophy-winners themselves since then but Rooney has always been the one player they have failed to control. Rooney (right) scored the only goal of the game as United beat City 1-0 at the Etihad in 2008 . He followed up his wonder-goal in 2011 by scoring four times against City the following year. He struck twice in an FA Cup tie in January and twice more in a Premier League game in December. Ironically, both games at The Etihad ended with United winning 3-2. His last derby goal was less celebrated though, a weak consolation in a 4-1 defeat during the dark days of David Moyes. There were those who thought Louis van Gaal's arrival in the summer might be a threat to Rooney. After all Robin van Persie was Van Gaal's World Cup captain for Holland. Rooney scored twice as United beat their local rivals 3-2 in the third round of the FA Cup in 2012 . The England international was on the scoresheet again as United beat City 3-2 later that year in the league . It hasn't worked out like that though. After much deliberation, the new United manager turned to Rooney to be his captain as successor to Nemanja Vidic. Van Gaal felt United's captain should be British and ingrained in the values of the club. Though Rooney is from Liverpool rather than Manchester, he has been at Old Trafford for a decade and set to pass Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time goalscoring record one day. A red card against West Ham for kicking Stewart Downing to prevent a counter-attack was unwise. But nothing in United's results since then has suggested that Rooney won't walk straight back into the team as captain and leader. Falcao has taken time to adjust following his loan move from Monaco and been hit by minor injuries that often accompany a return from a long-term injury, his knee. Rooney's last goal in a Manchester derby came in United's 4-1 thrashing at the Etihad last season . Juan Mata has failed to convince in a No10 role and was taken off by Van Gaal against Chelsea before United scored the equaliser. So Rooney is set to face City – a foot problem early in the week seems to have been overcome - and remains one of the first names on van Gaal's team sheet, either up top alongside van Persie or as a No10 behind the Dutchman and Falcao. Rooney's will-to-win was epitomised by his reaction to losing at City last season. He had just broken the record for derby goals but it was no consolation following a 4-1 loss. 'Not good enough,' he said afterwards. 'We have to improve, stop giving these sloppy goals away and capitalise on some of our good play.' That is exactly what he will be trying to do on Sunday and given his Etihad record, City will be wary. United boss Louis van Gaal (right) will be hoping Rooney can add to his tally of 11 derby goals against City .","Manchester City host fierce rivals United in the Premier League on Sunday .

"A gene linked to the amount of grey matter in our brains – and therefore our intelligence – has been identified. Scientists found a variant of the gene was associated with a thinner cerebral cortex – the outer layer of the brain known as grey matter – and that those who had it tended to do less well in verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests. Previous studies have shown the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language and consciousness. Thinking: Scientists found a variant of the gene was associated with a thinner cerebral cortex and that those who had it tended to do less well in verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests . However, the latest research, led by scientists at King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry, is the first to identify a genetic connection between intelligence and grey matter. It is not known how the study, conducted among nearly 1,600 14-year-olds, applies to the wider population, but the results were confirmed by looking at the same gene, NPTN, in mice. Dr Sylvane Desrivieres, lead author of the study in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, said the genetic variation was linked to communication between brain cells. ‘This may help us understand what happens in certain forms of intellectual impairments, where the ability of the neurons to communicate effectively is compromised. 'The genetic variation we identified is linked to synaptic plasticity - how neurons communicate. She added: 'It's important to point out that intelligence is influenced by many genetic and environmental factors. 'The . gene we identified only explains a tiny proportion of the differences . in intellectual ability, so it's by no means a 'gene for intelligence.' Outer layer: Previous studies have shown the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language and consciousness . Researchers studied more than 54,000 genetic variants possibly involved in brain development. It was revealed that teenagers carrying a particular gene variant had a thinner cortex in the left cerebral hemisphere, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes. And they tended to perform less well in tests. The genetic variation affects the expression of the NPTN gene, which encodes a protein that affects how brain cells communicate. The team also looked at the NPTN gene in mouse and human brain cells. It was discovered that the NPTN gene had a different activity in the left and right hemispheres of the brain, which may cause the left hemisphere to be more sensitive to the effects of NPTN mutations. Their findings suggest that some differences in intellectual abilities can be caused by the decreased function of the NPTN gene in parts of the left brain hemisphere. The genetic variation identified in this study only accounts for an estimated 0.5 percent of the total variation in intelligence. Researchers hope that the study, published in Molecular Psychiatry may help experts understand some of the biological mechanisms behind mental disorders. And it is hoped that in future the findings may help us more effectively diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.","Thought the outermost layer of the brain is connected to intelligence .

"Walk to freedom: Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel leaves Fleury-Merogis prison near Paris . Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel, who cost his bank nearly €5billion (£4billion), has walked free from a French prison today - after serving just four months of a five-year jail term. The 37-year-old, who nearly brought Societe Generale - one of Europe's biggest banks - to its knees with wildly risky trades, was released from France's Fleury-Merogis prison near Paris. His first thought was for his mother, whom he said he 'couldn't wait' to call. 'I am super happy to leave today ... I want to rebuild my life. I want to have a normal life with my loved ones, start a family and finally be able to enjoy life,' Kerviel told reporters as he left the prison. Branded a crook by his ex-employer and a scapegoat by his apologists, Kerviel has insisted his bosses knew what he was doing and turned a blind eye to possible breaches of rules as long as the profits kept rolling in. Even as he racked up billions for the bank in its skyscraper in Paris's La Defense business district, Kerviel lived modestly in a small suburban flat and took the train to Brittany during the holidays to visit his widowed mother. 'I am an ordinary person. I am not crazy,' he said during investigations into the scandal after Societe Generale was driven to unwind €50billion of risky deals that it blames on him. 'I didn't earn millions and I didn't drive a Porsche,' said Kerviel, who was paid €50,000 a year plus tens of thousands more in bonuses when the scandal erupted in January 2008. 'Have you seen my apartment? Forty-five square metres (485 square feet), no masters' paintings. Ikea furniture,' he added. Some commentators have interpreted his big risk-taking as motivated by the desire to prove himself, a young man from a modest background, among the ranks of high-flying traders from elite schools. Societe Generale says he worked out how to circumvent complex risk-control mechanisms and its lawyer Jean Veil accused him of 'duplicity' in reassuring his employers that all was well. Kerviel joined Societe Generale in 2000 and, five years later, was promoted to the 'front office' to trade futures on European share indices - effectively betting on the direction of the stock market. Colleagues at the time described him as a quiet loner. Free after four months: The former trader, left, was greeted at the prison gates by his lawyer David Koubbi . The rogue trader spent 38 days in custody after his arrest in 2008 and later took up a job at a small IT company in a suburb of Paris. He said ahead of his initial trial that he hoped it would teach people the lessons of the global financial crisis. 'Respect for work, solidarity, honesty - I grew up with these notions. But when I became a trader, I lost part of these morals.' Call home: The trader, above, told reporters he 'couldn't wait' to speak to his mother after being released . He even visited Rome to highlight the 'tyranny of the markets', securing an audience with Pope Francis. Under the terms of his release, he must wear an electronic tagging bracelet that will track his movements and he has to be at home between the hours of 8:30pm and 7:00am. But the Paris appeals court, who authorised Kerviel's release, said the trader will have freedom of movement on weekends and during the day on weekdays. He has also been ordered to pay €4.9billion in damages - seen as an unlikely possibility.","Walks free from Fleury-Merogis prison near Paris wearing electronic tag .

"Ian Rush believes Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey can break his Wales all-time goalscoring record. Rush scored 28 goals for his county and Gareth Bale is already halfway towards his tally having netted 14 times in 47 matches for Wales. The former Liverpool striker added that Arsenal talisman Aaron Ramsey, who is currently on eight international goals is also capable of surpassing his record. Gareth Bale has already scored 14 goals for Wales and is aiming to overtake Ian Rush's record . 'There's no reason why Bale can't, but I think Aaron Ramsey is in that category as well,' Rush told the BBC. 'It's nice having a record but if someone like Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey broke it I'll be happy because it means Wales are doing well.' Bale became the World's most expensive player in September 2013 when he joined Real Madrid for a mouth watering £85m. Bale signed for Real Madrid for a world record £85m and has taken the weight of expectation in his stride . He has scored 11 goals in his last 18 appearances and is in a rich vein of form on the international stage having scored twice against Andorra in Wales' European qualifying match against the Minnows. Ramsey, was absent from Wales' last two qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus through injury, but is expected to have a huge impact upon his return to the Wales fold. 'They are playing more games now and they are young,' said Rush, who played for Wales between 1980 and 1996, 'so I'm sure one of them will break it one day.' Aaron Ramsey return against Belgium will be a huge boost for national team as they look to beat Belgium . Wales currently top their qualifying group and face a formidable task against Belgium away from home in their next match in November . Rush insists Wales' hopes are pinned on Bale and Ramsey as they look to secure what would be a monumental victory against Belgium. 'That's the two players that are going to win the games, who will score you the goals,' said Rush. 'There's no reason why we can't get something out of the game. 'It's a big game for us but it's a big game for Belgium as well.' Wales have not qualified for the finals of a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup and Rush hopes to see his record broken at the Euro 2016 finals in France. 'I didn't get to play in a major tournament for Wales,' said Rush, 'but my ambition is, while I'm still alive to see Wales hopefully in a major competition. 'If they [Bale or Ramsey] break my record doing that then it would be the icing on the cake.'","Ian Rush is Wales' top all time goalscorer on 28 .

"Scroll down for video . William Seed, 81, has been spared jail for continuing to harass his neighbours, despite being banned from doing so under an ASBO . A pensioner who was given an ASBO for waging a six-year campaign of 'absolute hell' against his neighbours has been spared jail - despite breaching his order at least five times. William Seed, 81, from Longridge, Lancashire, became one of the oldest people in the country to be given an ASBO in August last year after carrying out an 'ongoing campaign of harassment' against Carolyn and William Maxwell. During that hearing, the court heard how Seed would beep his car horn all day and night, make loud animal noises, scrape shovels along the ground to make a racket and slowly drive past the couple while staring at them. He also repeatedly accused Mrs Maxwell, 43, of having an affair with an ex-policeman and swore at the couple in front of children. The court heard how dead rats and rabbits, chickens’ feet and a . mallards head had also appeared in the Maxwells' garden. But yesterday, the retired lorry driver was again hauled before the courts for continuing to carry out the long-running 'hate' campaign. The court heard Seed has continued to beep his horn at the . Maxwells and had also thrown bags over their fence, which contained newspaper cuttings about so-called neighbours from hell. But, despite there being 'no sign of abatement' to his harassment campaign, magistrates spared Seed jail. Presiding magistrate Richard Clews said Seed's poor health - and the fact he cared for his elderly wife - meant he should not be sent to prison. Speaking after the sentence, Mr Maxwell, 48, slammed the decision saying: 'We knew he’d play on the fact he’s 81, but his health doesn’t stop him harassing us.' The campaign of abuse against the Maxwells began in 2008, shortly after the couple moved into their bungalow and put up a fence on their property. During last year's hearing, Seed pleaded guilty to harassing his neighbours and was given a community supervision for 12 months. He was also banned from using foul or abusive language, along with his ASBO. But during yesterday's case, prosecutor Andy Robinson said there had been five or six separate breaches of the ASBO since March this year. Scroll down for video . Mr Seed, pictured left and right hiding his face as he came out of Blackburn Magistrates' Court, was spared jail because he was is not in 'the best of health' and also because he cares for his elderly wife . Seed was filmed by his neighbour in June this year leaning over the Maxwells' garden fence and shouting profanities . Seed was filmed leaning over the fence which separates the two homes and waving a metal garden rake towards the camera . Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard how, on one occasion, Mr Maxwell saw Mr Seed throwing the bag full of newspaper cuttings over their fence. Seed also beeped his car horn continuously while the couple were at home on March 24. In June this year, Seed began 'shouting, swearing and being abusive' towards the couple for playing their radio in their garden - an incident Mr Maxwell caught on video. In the footage, the pensioner can be seen leaning over the garden fence that separates the two properties, shouting profanities. He is then filmed smirking into the camera lens, before swearing and shouting at Mr Maxwell, who is filming. He shouts: 'I pity your wife, but actually I don't, because she's a f***ing ugly cow' Seed is filmed for more than a minute by his neighbour and does not appeared to be fazed by the camera . He then then grabs a metal garden rake and waves it at Mr Maxwell, while shouting 'I pity your wife, but actually I don't, because she's a f***ing ugly cow.' Sentencing, Mr Clews said: 'The report makes for a very sorry read. This has been an ongoing campaign of harassment which has been going on for years with no sign of abatement. 'I’m not prepared to accept that your neighbours are in any way to blame. All they would like is to live their lives in peace which is not a great deal to ask. 'Last year, you were made the subject of an ASBO after a long-running dispute with your neighbours and you were given a community order at the same time. 'In March you breached this and it has gone on for far too long. There are only two ways to bring this to an end. 'He is so hateful towards our family and . it has been absolute hell. He’s so bitter inside and I know this won’t . be the last. It’s not fair that we are left to suffer' Mr Maxwell . 'You can either look at yourself in the mirror and make a decision to bring it to an end or the other option is for the court to send you to prison. 'There are a catalogue of incidents I have heard about that are so serious they can only be dealt with by a custodial sentence. 'But, you are 81-years-old and you are not in the best of health and you look after your wife, who is of a similar age. 'No court would want to send an 81-year-old man to prison but I can assure you it will if it needs to.' Mr Maxwell, a council worker, said: 'We were hoping for a prison sentence. 'I think he thinks of himself as a loveable rogue and he believes he’s always right. He doesn’t have a lot in his life and he just sits and waits for us to get home. 'He is so hateful towards our family and it has been absolute hell. He’s so bitter inside and I know this won’t be the last. It’s not fair that we are left to suffer.' Mrs Maxwell added: 'All we want is for him to leave us alone so we can enjoy our lives.' Seed was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for two years, and his ASBO was extended for five years. He was fined £165 and was given a curfew to last four months. Seed previously avoided jail in 2003 after he admitted killing up to 10 cats by smashing them over the head with a hammer and then drowning them in a dustbin filled with water.","William Seed harassed Carolyn and William Maxwell in Longridge, Lancashire .

"Shane Watson has been named in Australia's squad for the T20 series against South Africa as he continues his comeback from injury. The 33-year-old all-rounder has not played for the national team since the World Twenty20 in April, but returned to club action for Sutherland on Sunday after ankle and calf injuries resulting from stepping on a ball in training in May.

"An Australian dentists' association has apologised unreservedly after raunchy footage from a late night burlesque event held at its conference was posted online. The video - believed to have been filmed in Melbourne last year - was a promotion for the Australian Dental Association’s national congress due to be held in Brisbane in 2015.

Mr Boyd-Boland told the Courier Mail the video sent 'an inappropriate signal about the event' and would investigate who was responsible for uploading it. According to the ADA’s website, 90 per cent of dentists around Australia are members. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the ADA told Mail Online the burlesque performance comprised only a small portion of the event but apologised 'unreservedly' for the offence it had caused. 'The video of the event in question was a small excerpt of a portion of the entertainment from the Dentists ‘Late Night’ at the 2013 Australian Dental Congress in Melbourne.

"Luke Campbell extended his unbeaten professional record to nine fights with a ruthless fifth-round stoppage of Daniel Brizuela at Hull Ice Arena on Saturday night. Campbell, who won gold in the 56kg Bantamweight division at London 2012, took control early on in the fight and landed a series of shots with ease in the first two rounds while the Argentinian struggled to make any headway at all. Brizuela (26-3-2 8KOs), finally showed signs of life in the third round with a stinging two-punch combo but he looked wobbly as Campbell fought back and had him on the ropes at the end of the three minutes. Luke Campbell celebrates after defeating Daniel Brizuela at Hull Ice Arena on Saturday night . The next two rounds were like a game of cat and mouse, with Brizuela manfully delaying the inevitable but causing Campbell no problems as the Hull lightweight searched for the killer blow. The 27-year-old almost found it when a barrage of blows sent Brizuela down in the fifth, but with 45 seconds remaining he got back to his feet almost immediately. For a time Brizuela was doing well to dodge Campbell's flurry of combos, but with each weave he looked increasingly unsure on his feet and referee Ingo Barrabas called a halt to proceedings.

"Gene Haas is confident he can avoid the 'mistakes' he feels have been made by other new teams ahead of entering Formula One in 2016. Of the three marques that made their bow in the sport in 2010, HRT have already folded, Caterham are on the brink of going to the wall, whilst Marussia continue to struggle financially. Haas, who runs a successful team in America's NASCAR, has already been told he is crazy for trying to break into F1, but has belief he will make it on to the grid in 17 months' time. Gene Haas (above) is sure his idea to enter Formula One is  viable, saying he will learn from mistakes of others . 'I guess I don't have any doubts we can do it,' said Haas, speaking to CNN. 'People keep saying, 'Well, you're going to fail', but to me it's just a challenge you need to do. 'I know it's a hard, but just don't give up. You just keep banging your head against the wall until you open the door.' Haas was granted his entry earlier this year, but opted against a 2015 start date, believing the additional year would ensure he and his team would be fully prepared. That is where he feels the likes of HRT, Caterham and Marussia stumbled as they only had six months to put together a team and build their cars. Haas (right) runs a successful American NASCAR side but now is set to break into Formula One in 2016 . 'The biggest problem they had, in trying to get to the grid so fast, they wound up having to take on partnerships that maybe weren't thoroughly thought out,' added Haas. 'They wound up making a lot of mistakes. Inevitably they didn't have the resources, or the cars weren't properly put together, because they rushed things.' One route Haas has taken is to form a partnership with Ferrari who will supply the power trains and other key parts, further adding credence to his team's entry. That, however, has led to suggestions Haas will be nothing more than a 'B team' for Ferrari, although it is a comment he appreciates. 'Ferrari were more accommodating. Surprisingly they wanted to go beyond just being an engine supplier,' said Haas. 'They were going to help us with a lot of the basic structure of the car. Haas is not put off from competing by the financial struggles of sides such as Marussia (above) Caterham (front) entered Formula One in 2010 but are now expected to fold due to money issues . 'And we'd be very proud to be a Ferrari 'B' team because that would certainly teach us how to run in Formula One. 'Quite frankly we will take all the help they can give us because you can't get any better than Ferrari.' Haas, though, is aware of the struggles he will encounter once he is up and running, which is why he is not setting his sights high. Asked to define a successful time in F1, Haas replied: 'In the first five years it's just surviving. 'I don't have expectations of grandeur we are going to go out there and win championships. 'If we can even win one race in five years then I think that would be a tremendous success.'","Gene Haas sure he can avoid errors he felt others made when entering F1 .

'The Samoa match has come too soon but we remain confident he'll be ready for Australia the week after. 'James Graham will take over the captaincy for this game. He is a great leader and we saw that with the Bulldogs this season in the NRL where he single-handedly led them to a Grand Final. Sean O'Loughlin (centre), pictured in action against Ireland during the World Cup, is out with a muscle injury . 'He leads by example and gives 100 per cent effort in everything he does. He inspires everyone around him to follow his lead.' McNamara has named four debutants in his 17-man squad - Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith and Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson in the starting line-up and Joe Westerman (Hull) and Daryl Clark (Castleford) on the bench. 'They are ready,' McNamara said. 'They've been in our system for a long time. All four have been in great form during the Super League season. 'There is a slight evolution to the squad this year with some new faces on show. The debutants are exciting and they can prove themselves on the international stage.' England coach Steve McNamara has named four debutants in his 17-man squad to face Samoa . The England team to play Samoa in the opening game of the Four Nations Series at Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane, on Saturday is: . S Tomkins (New Zealand Warriors); J Charnley (Wigan), K Watkins (Leeds), M Shenton (Castleford), R Hall (Leeds); G Widdop (St George Illawarra), M Smith (Wigan); G Burgess (South Sydney), J Hodgson (Hull KR), J Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs, capt), L Farrell (Wigan), J Tomkins (Wigan), J Westerman (Hull).

"Super League champions St Helens are poised to announce their new head coach. Saints have acted quickly to appoint a successor to Nathan Brown, who stepped down after his club's 14-6 Grand Final triumph over Wigan last weekend, with an announcement set to be made at a press conference at Langtree Park on Monday morning. The former St George and Huddersfield boss was released 12 months early from his three-year contract in order to take his young family back to Australia. Nathan Brown departed the club after their Grand Final win to head back to Australia with his family . Another Australian, Daniel Anderson, has been linked with the vacancy following his successful stint at St Helens from 2005-08 but the speed with which the club have put themselves in a position to unveil their new man suggests a domestic appointment, with former hooker Keiron Cunningham the bookmakers' favourite. Jamahl Lolesi, a former New Zealand international centre who followed Brown from Huddersfield to St Helens two years ago, could also be a contender. Cunningham and Lolesi were assistants to Brown for the last two years while Cunningham coached the team alongside then general manager Mike Rush for most of the 2012 season following the departure of Royce Simmons. Keiron Cunningham, who has been Brown's assistant for two years, is the bookmakers' favourite to take over . The appointment of Cunningham would go down particularly well with supporters, who in 2010 voted overwhelmingly to immortalise him with a bronze, life-size statue, which was erected in the town centre and moved to Langtree Park when St Helens moved into their new stadium three years ago. Cunningham, who turns 38 next week, made 419 appearances for his home-town club from 1993 to 2010. He would become St Helens' first British head coach since Ellery Hanley held the reins from 1998 to 2000, since when Australians Ian Millward, Anderson, Mick Potter and Simmons held the post.

"John Wade shares the lead with Thorbjorn Olesen on eight under after the opening day of the ISPS HANDA Perth International. The 46-year-old Australian made a blistering start at Lake Karrinyup, carding four birdies on his first five holes on the back nine, before adding an eagle on the 15th. He picked up two further shots after turning in 30 to set the pace before being pegged back by Denmark's Olesen, who notched eight birdies to join him in finishing on 64, with the rest of the field at least two shots behind.

Wade, who has only won one title on the Challenge Tour eight years ago, told the European Tour website: 'This is ridiculous really. I didn't know what to expect. 'I was just proud that I didn't let it go after I was six under, which is really annoying for most guys. And someone in my situation, you're probably half expecting that to happen. Friday is another day. This is all new to me; I'll just have to go out with the same attitude.' Olesen, 24, was also thrilled to be one of the early front runners for the £156,810 winner's cheque and he said: 'I played really, really well, the front nine especially. The back nine I hit a couple bad drives, but got a little bit lucky and got away with them. Olesen, pictured teeing off on the 15th hole, was delighted with his short game during the opening round .

Australian Michael Sim shares third on six under with a trio of players all fighting to keep their Tour card for 2015. With those outside the top 111 in the Race to Dubai dropping down to the European Tour Qualifying School, Scot Peter Whiteford (149) and Sihwan Kim (138) are currently in danger of missing out but they made strong starts in Perth. Australian Michael Sim checks out the line for a put on the 18th during round one of the Perth International . Both men eagled the par-five seventh as they had eerily similar rounds, adding five birdies and a bogey apiece to card 66, which also leaves them level with Tom Lewis - who is yet to cement his own place for next year. The 23-year-old Englishman is currently ranked 104th and he should be safe barring an unlikely set of results, while Whiteford and Kim both need top-two finishes to avoid dropping out.

"American tycoon Josh Harris' proposed takeover of Crystal Palace will enter its final stages this week, with a deal close to completion. News broke of Harris' interest in the Selhurst Park club on Friday night, but Sportsmail understands negotiations between the businessman and current Eagles supremo Steve Parish are at now at an 'very advanced' stage. Talk of Harris' arrival has been received with caution at the south London club, but Palace sources claim the deal, barring a dramatic collapse, could even be agreed by the end of the week. Josh Harris has visited Selhurst Park at least three times as he looks into buying Crystal Palace . The 49-year-old is locked in 'advanced stage' talks with Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish . A fee of £70million for the club has been suggested, though that figure is unconfirmed. Sportsmail can reveal Harris, who also owns US sports teams Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils, has visited Selhurst Park at least three times, with talks over the proposed takeover understood to have been ongoing for a month. Harris has a long-standing interest in purchasing a Barclays Premier League club. He is believed to have shown an interest in taking over at Aston Villa, West Bromwich and Everton in recent months but opted against pursuing deals at those clubs.

"It may be the last regular event of the European Tour year but for some players the ISPS HANDA Perth International is all about comebacks - in more ways than one. American Jason Dufner plays his first competitive golf in three months after injury ruled him out of his US PGA defence, the FedEx Cup and the Ryder Cup but for others the focus is on ensuring they make appearances next season. With only the top 78 in The Race to Dubai rankings going through to the final series of four tournaments, this event is the last chance for players to secure a place in that. More important for others is to secure their cards, as come Sunday the top 111 players on the list will retain their playing privileges for the 2015 European Tour season. Jason Dufner plays his first competitive golf in three months after injury ruled him out of his US PGA defence . Manchester's Matthew Nixon currently occupies the last available place - courtesy of Zimbabwe's 66th-placed Brendon de Jonge being only an affiliate member so he is not included in the top 110 cut-off. The 25-year-old has made the cut in his last three events and needs to do so again to consolidate his position while former European Tour winners Irishman Peter Lawrie (174th) and Argentina's Ricardo Gonzalo (131st) have to perform much better. Dufner, one of three major champions in the field alongside Charl Schwartzel and Geoff Ogilvy, committed to the event at Lake Karrinyup back in May and so did not want to let down organisers after his shoulder and neck problems. Dufner celebrates on the 18th green after his two-stroke victory at the 95th PGA Golf Championship in 2013 . 'It it has been about 11 weeks since I last played so it is getting better,' he told European Tour Radio. 'It was frustrating to miss the last major, the play-offs and Ryder Cup but in the end it was probably nice to do it. 'It was nice to get my fitness and health better and I worked on one of my weaknesses which was my putting. 'I've had a couple of weeks with no pain swinging the golf club and they have told me I can't do more damage.' Frenchman Victor Dubuisson, who was a member of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team, is among the favourites this week. 'It's better to be one of the favourites but I will just try to do my best,' said the 24-year-old. 'There are a lot of good players. Jason, Charl, and also some players who played a lot in the States and are just at the limit of qualifying for the Final Series and this is the last tournament before that.'","Injury ruled American Jason Dufner out of defending his US PGA title .

"Swansea City Supporters Trust has responded to the Barclays Premier League club after holding talks with potential investors by stating it does not believe there is a need for an ownership change. The Trust owns more than 21 per cent of shares in the Swans. Swansea revealed on Tuesday that they have spoken with potential investors who could buy a minority share interest in the club. Swansea City Supporters Trust are happy with the club's ownership despite interest from foreign investors .

"St Helens have appointed Keiron Cunningham as their new head coach. Cunningham is the successor to Nathan Brown, who stepped down following his club's 14-6 Grand Final triumph over Wigan last weekend. The former St George and Huddersfield boss was released 12 months early from his three-year contract in order to take his young family back to Australia. Keiron Cunningham has been named St Helens' head coach after working as their assistant head coach . Nathan Brown (left) holds the Super League trophy with Paul Wellens after victory against Wigan Warriors . Cunningham was an assistant to Brown for the previous two seasons. Chairman Eamonn McManus told the club's official website saintsrlfc.com: 'Keiron is ready for this professionally and totally committed to the task ahead of him. 'He has been heavily involved in the success of this season and is ideally placed to carry it on for years to come.' Cunningham has signed a two-year contract and will be assisted by former New Zealand Test centre Jamahl Lolesi, who worked alongside him after following Brown from Huddersfield two years ago. The 37-year-old former Great Britain hooker is immortalised in bronze outside Langtree Park, where he was unveiled on Monday as Saints' first British coach for 14 years. Cunningham will also be the first man to coach his home-town club since Alex Murphy held the reins from 1985-90.

'Not only does he understand our culture, he has been instrumental in its development since the inception of Super League. 'Everyone at the club is totally behind his appointment and enthused by it.' The appointment is sure to go down well with supporters, who in 2010 overwhelmingly selected him from a list of all-time greats to be the subject of a bronze, life-size statue, which was erected in the town centre and moved to Langtree Park when St Helens moved into their new stadium three years ago. Cunningham, who turns 38 next week, made 419 appearances for his home-town club from 1993 to 2010. Cunningham, pictured in action for St Helens, made 419 appearances for the club over 17 years .

'CEO Mike Rush, Keiron and myself have worked together at the club in one form or another for 14 years. We understand the town and the club and their highest expectations. We will together continue to do our very best to meet them.' Cunningham is the club's second British head coach in the history of Super League. Ellery Hanley held the post from 1998 to 2000 in between spells by Australians Shaun McRae, Ian Millward, Daniel Anderson, Mick Potter and Royce Simmons.

"Click here for all the heat maps and statistics that matter in Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone . There was a moment before kick-off when Nigel Pearson let it be known to the officials that he thought Swansea’s goals were too big and a measuring tape was brought out. Had he called for a bricklayer, it’s unlikely that he would have improved the result. Not with finishing as sharp as Wilfried Bony’s and moves as slick and quick as the two that made his goals. Wilfried Bony finishes off his first goal to give Swansea a 1-0 lead over Leicester at the Liberty Stadium . Bony acknowledges team-mate Gylfi Sigurdsson (left) after a slick interchange between the pair led to the opening goal . Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 6; Rangel 7, Fernandez 6, Williams 7, Taylor 6; Ki 6, Shelvey 6.5; Routledge 6 (Dyer 82), Sigurdsson 7.5 (Carroll 58, 6), Montero 7; Bony 8 (Gomis 82) Subs not used: Tremmel, Emnes, Bartley, Shephard . Leicester (4-4-2): Schmeichel 5; De Laet 5, Morgan 7, Moore 6.5, Konchesky 6.5; Mahrez 6, Hammond 6 (King 67, 6), Drinkwater 6 (Cambiasso 67, 6), Vardy 6 (James 67, 6); Nugent 5, Ulloa 5 . Subs not used: Smith, Schlupp, Wasilewski, Wood . Referee: Mike Jones 7 . Att: 20,259 . MOM: Wilfried Bony . Even with all the possession Leicester managed — 51 per cent, which is no small achievement in these parts — they rarely looked like scoring. When Esteban Cambiasso had an open goal in stoppage time, he hit the post. It’s why Pearson puffed out his cheeks as he considered a fourth game without victory since that remarkable toppling of Manchester United last month. It’s why Garry Monk afforded himself a big grin after a week of big statements and mild controversy. While the past six days had been spent absorbing the fallout of his claim that Stoke’s Victor Moses cheated and his assertion that referees are not fair to Swansea, this was merely a convincing win with no incident worth complaining about. ‘It’s quite boring,’ Monk joked. Pearson was rather more subdued. ‘We didn’t perform as well as we should have done,’ he said. ‘We didn’t manage the ball well enough. You can ill afford to make too many unforced errors. It made it a frustrating afternoon for the players. ‘The bottom line is our baseline performance has to be better. The work ethic we have has always been exceptionally good and here I didn’t feel we really gave as much as we could do to stay in the game. That is the biggest disappointment.’ And on the goal posts? ‘The goalkeepers felt they were a bit high (in the warm-up),’ Pearson said. ‘I thought it was in everyone’s best interest, bearing in mind the controversy Garry has had to deal with this week, to get it checked. It was quite light-hearted.’ The rest of his day was quite heavy going. His tactic appeared to be sit, stifle and ambush, and two thirds of the plan were occasionally effectively. But with no obvious proficiency for getting the ball from back to front, Leicester spent most of the first half inviting pressure. Diving Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel is given no chance as Bony's strike is put away clinically from the top of the box .

Angel Rangel took possession on the right and fed a ball to Bony, whose backheel inside Liam Moore found Sigurdsson. The Iceland forward returned a pass to Bony and the striker scored in his third successive match. Now, Leicester needed to attack and Swansea needed to avoid giving away a lead for a third straight game. The Leicester rush was instant and within two minutes of the second half they hit the bar, albeit directly from a Liam Moore throw, so it wouldn’t have counted. In the 57th minute Bony got his second after another move dominated by the excellence of Sigurdsson and the finishing of the Ivorian. Jefferson Montero rolled the ball to Sigurdsson, who threaded a quite brilliant pass back to the winger. Montero squared and Bony notched his 20th career Premier League goal. Monk concluded: 'It was about getting three points as we could feel that little bit of pressure on us within the crowd and amongst the players. 'It was never going to be easy, especially when Leicester threw caution to the wind, and we could have controlled the ball a bit better in the second half, but I thought we deserved it. 'We limited them to shots from distance which is credit to the shape we've been working on and how hard defensively we've been working. 'Three goals we've conceded in the last two games - two against Newcastle and the second one against Stoke - has not been the standard we've set but we got back to that to keep a clean sheet.'

"West Ham ace Diafra Sakho has revealed he had to ask Ricardo Vaz Te what 'he scores when he wants' meant after the song was directed at the Senegal international during his side's win against Manchester City. Sakho has been in a rich vein since joining the Hammers in the summer from Metz in a deal worth £3,5million. The 24-year-old has scored seven goals in eight  games - including what turned out to be a winner against City - which has already made the forward somewhat of a crowd favourite at Upton Park. Diafra Sakho acknowledges the West Ham crowd after scoring against Manchester City . Sakho is enjoying his time at the Hammers since joining the east London outfit in the summer . West Ham new boy Sakho was mobbed by his team-mates after scoring what turned out to be the winner . 'I didn't understand it at the beginning, but I asked Ricardo Vaz Te and he translated it for me,' Sakho told West Ham's official website. 'I'm really touched by them saying that all the time. It makes me happy to hear that and gives me even more motivation to score. I'll always try to give them that, if I can.' Sakho believes his side can follow up their impressive 2-1 victory against Premier League champions Manchester City by stringing a run of wins together in their upcoming games. 'The run goes on for all of us, the whole team,' he added. 'We know that after Saturday there's still a long, long way to go - as I always say - but we're trying to bag all the points that we can. 'We're trying to keep it going and that's really pleasing. My team-mates on Saturday inspired me and so I dream big. When it ends, I'll accept that. But we're going to slog away to continue it. 'Saturday was great. To play at home in front of our fans, that spurs us all on to aim high and we'll carry on right until the end so that it will be the stuff of dreams for all the fans who came to watch us every week.'","Diafra Sakho was not sure what the football chant translated to .

"Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Malky Mackay called Cardiff City's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan a 'chink' How Matt Lawton's exclusive story on Malky Mackay rocked football... Senior FA figures are braced for a furious backlash if, as expected, they fail to charge Malky Mackay and Iain Moody over their exchange of sexist, racist and homophobic texts and emails. The FA will leave themselves open to accusations of inconsistency and weakness if they do not take action against the former Cardiff City manager and the head of recruitment who worked alongside him in south Wales. Particularly when the correspondence was passed to the FA by Cardiff City, having been obtained through a search order of Moody's house granted by a High Court judge. The FA insist the matter is ongoing despite the fact that Sportsmail first revealed the details of the texts and emails on August 21. But it appears to be reaching a conclusion with the belief being that the FA will not charge Moody and Mackay. Former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay is expected to avoid punishment for sending offensive texts and emails . Mackay and his former colleague Iain Moody have been the subject of an FA investigation since late August . Cardiff owner Vincent Tan (left) helped uncover the offensive messages while investigating Mackay and Moody . 'Fkn chinkys. Fk it. There's enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.'

It is understood the FA will cite their policy is not to act on 'private communications'; a position they adopted earlier this year when sexist emails sent by Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore from his work inbox were leaked to the media. FA officials realise there is likely to be uproar if they fail to act on the Mackay and Moody messages that included deeply offensive remarks about players — Korean midfielder Kim Bo-kyung and his representatives were referred to as 'Fkn chinkys' by Mackay — as well as their own employers at Cardiff and football agents. The FA is also expected to announce a review of the organisation's policy on private communications. Mackay has apologised for sending messages that were 'disrespectful of other cultures', while Moody resigned as director of football at Crystal Palace in a week when he hoped to appoint Mackay as manager at the club. If there is no charge there is expected to be a detailed, written explanation from the FA's governance department, outlining the efforts they went to in an attempt to bring charges against Mackay and Moody. Moody (centre) quit his role as sporting director of Crystal Palace after his behaviour was revealed . Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton broke the story about messages sent by Mackay and Moody . Mackay's relationship with Tan (right) quickly deteriorated after Cardiff earned promotion to the top flight . MALKY MACKAY: A powerful centre-back with Queen’s Park, Celtic, Norwich, West Ham and Watford — winning five Scotland caps — he began his managerial career at Championship club Watford in 2009, after Brendan Rodgers resigned. He spent two years at Vicarage Road, safeguarding them from relegation, before moving to Cardiff in 2011. In his first season in charge of the Welsh club, Mackay, 42, guided them to their first ever League Cup final, which they lost to Liverpool on penalties and finished sixth in the Championship, though they missed out on promotion through the play-offs. Still, 2012’s heartache proved to be short-lived, as Cardiff were promoted to the Premier League as champions the following year. Despite his successes, however, Mackay’s relationship with club owner Vincent Tan became increasingly strained. The Malaysian businessman was reportedly dissatisfied with Mackay’s transfer dealings. Mackay was dismissed as Cardiff manager in December 2013. This, Sportsmail understands, included requesting a statement from former Cardiff City player Ibrahim Farah, who responded to the original revelations by tweeting and then deleting that Mackay would call him the 'Wee Egyptian' during their time together at the club. Whether a written explanation and review would appease those who feel Mackay and Moody should be punished remains to be seen. Cardiff City are sure to be unimpressed. But senior figures at the FA already fear the organisation could be accused of double standards when players like Rio Ferdinand have been charged with misconduct for an alleged breach of FA rules; in Ferdinand's case for referring to a Twitter follower's mother as a 'Sket', a Caribbean word for a promiscuous woman. The FA could point to the fact that Ferdinand communicated on a social media platform. But senior football officials see a major weakness in that particular 'private-public' argument when last year Paul Elliott was condemned by the FA for using the 'n' word in a private text to another black former footballer, Richard Rufus. The FA accepted the resignation of anti-racism campaigner Elliott from all his positions within the organisation after he made 'discriminatory abusive comments'. Elliott, now back at the FA as a member of the Inclusion Advisory Board, also stepped down as a trustee of the Kick It Out campaign, and was criticised by then FA chairman David Bernstein. QPR defender Rio Ferdinand was charged with misconduct by the FA for a message sent on Twitter . Sportsmail covered the Mackay-Moody story right from the start, including Moody's resignation (right) Former Cardiff player Ibrahim Farah claimed that Mackay referred to him as the 'Wee Egyptian' IAIN MOODY: As a graduate in French and Italian, Moody initially found work as a translator for the Italy side during Euro 96, before taking a staff writer’s position at Football365.com. In 2001, he made the move to Athole Still International, a London-based sports management franchise, then leaving to become Watford’s press officer four years later. It was at Vicarage Road that Moody first linked up with Malky Mackay, forming a close professional relationship that saw him soon promoted to football operations manager. When Mackay left for Cardiff in 2011, Moody followed, this time as head of recruitment. Cardiff reached the League Cup final in 2012 and were promoted to the Premier League a year later, but amid a protracted bust-up between Mackay and the club’s controversial owner, Vincent Tan, Moody was dismissed in October 2013. He was replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, who was at the club on work experience and a friend of Tan’s son. Crystal Palace were quick to appoint Moody as their sporting director, with a remit to improve their club infrastructure and to address weaknesses in player recruitment. 'The use of discriminatory language is unacceptable regardless of its context and in effect has made Paul's position untenable,' said Bernstein. 'The use of discriminatory language is unacceptable regardless of its context and in effect has made Paul's position untenable,' said Bernstein. Now, however, context seems to be the central issue, even if other senior officials would argue that there is even an important distinction that should be recognised between the Scudamore case and the Moody and Mackay case. As one observer put it, there is a 'clear work context' in the communication between Moody and Mackay. The fear, claims another senior official, is that players will think there is one rule for them and another for people in positions of authority. The Scudamore case, and the decision under the leadership of chairman Greg Dyke not to act on private communication, led to calls from within the FA to look at the policy of private and public accountability. This process was ongoing when the Mackay-Moody story broke and the FA governance department appear to have been struggling with the issue as a consequence. Particularly when they know an attempt to charge Mackay — and possibly even hit him with a ban that would come into effect the moment he lands a new managerial role — could face a serious legal challenge, perhaps even with the support of the League Managers' Association. Paul Elliott (left) resigned from his role at Kick It Out after making 'discriminatory abusive comments' in a text . Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore (centre) was caught in a sexism scandal earlier this year . The LMA also came in for serious criticism in August when they initially attempted to defend Mackay by dismissing his comments as 'friendly text message banter', and had to then apologise for the wording of the apology. There is nothing in the FA rules on discrimination exempting private correspondence but the controversial policy of not prosecuting such cases also recently benefited referees chief David Elleray, who made racist remarks to Robert McCarthy, a black non-League referee coaching manager. Elleray was ordered by the FA to attend an equality and diversity training course but that was seen as little more than a slap on the wrists. The view of many within football is that the FA's current policy is not sustainable in the digital age. 'Having taken a stance on Scudamore it was not long before the Moody and Mackay case put the FA in a very uncomfortable position,' said another insider. Legal experts argue that there is no basis for why the FA could not bring a misconduct charge for private communication. As John Cooper QC explained: 'Whether or not the alleged remarks are made in private or in public does not matter. The fact is they were made and the reality is the FA have a choice what to do about it.'","Malky Mackay and Iain Moody sent a number of offensive texts and emails .

"Hat-trick hero John Guidetti claimed Rangers or any other of Celtic's Scottish League Cup semi-final opponents will be 'going down' if they are drawn against the Parkhead men. The 22-year-old Swede, on loan from Manchester City, took his tally to eight in eight games for the Hoops with two wonderful free-kicks and a penalty in the 6-0 quarter-final thrashing of Partick Thistle at Celtic Park. Substitute Leigh Griffiths grabbed a brace and left-back Emilio Izaguirre also notched as Ronny Deila's side ran riot albeit against a side who played the second-half with 10 men after midfielder Stuart Bannigan was shown a straight red card by referee Kevin Glancy for a needless challenge on Guidetti just before the break.

The win set up a possibility of what would be the first Old Firm meeting in almost three years in the semi-final, rivals Rangers clinching their last-four place with a 1-0 win over St Johnstone at Ibrox on Tuesday night, while Aberdeen and Dundee United will also be in Saturday's draw. Asked about the possibility of playing the Light Blues at Hampden Park after the New Year, Guidetti said: 'Of course it would be a fantastic game to be a part of. Whatever happens, happens. 'Come Hampden Park, 11 people standing in front of us, they are going down. Hampden Park will be amazing, no matter who we play. 'I am excited about every game for Celtic. 'We all know (the Old Firm clash) is a special game. This is a game I woke up at 11.30am when I was a small kid to watch. 'It is fantastic, very spicy and you see that it means a lot. 'The atmosphere is amazing, you can hear it through the television. On-loan Manchester City striker Guidetti leaves Celtic Park with the match ball after scoring three times . 'But we need to stay focused. There are four good teams left in the cup and this club deserves trophies so hopefully we can do this.' Manager Ronny Deila, delighted with the form of Guidetti and the rest of his side's performance, tip-toed around the possibility of an Old Firm game. He said: 'For me it is about winning trophies and we are now two wins away from getting the first one. 'So I am looking forward to the semi-final, who we meet doesn't bother me. We just have to win. 'What you remember when your career is finished is titles and that's why I'm here - to win trophies and make sure Celtic is successful. To do that we have to meet whatever team is in front of us.'

Guidetti celebrates with Emilio Izaguirre (left) in front of the home supporters at Celtic Park on Wednesday . He said: 'It probably is nowadays (a red). I think the reaction of the Celtic players made it look like that as well I don't think that helps either. 'I'm disappointed as I felt he didn't have to make the challenge. I think he wins the ball but it is probably the manner he goes in. 'He's disappointed, he's sitting with his head in his hands at half-time. He can't blame excitement playing against Celtic.

"Next stop, Match of the Day? Arsenal duo Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny have taken to the microphone to give their thoughts on the Gunners 3-0 win over Newcastle in April.

"Former Manchester United captain Bryan Robson claims Louis van Gaal's side have struggled at the start of the season because of Michael Carrick's absence. The midfielder missed the first three months of the season due to ankle surgery as United laboured to just three wins in their opening nine games. The 33-year-old was an unused substitute in draws against West Brom and Chelsea as he regains full fitness but Robson thinks the Manchester derby on Sunday could be a game too soon for Carrick. Manchester United star Michael Carrick got 64 minutes under his belt for the U21 side last week . 'Michael's been a big miss to United,' Robson told the Daily Express. 'When he was injured last season he was a big loss to us and again this season. 'He's an intelligent player who gets into the right areas. He's about 6ft 2ins and defensively at set plays is very good. He intercepts things very well. That's why he's important as well. 'The only thing the manager has to be careful of is, if there are a few players coming back from injury, you don't want to play too many who are a little bit rusty because it's a derby game. Carrick was an unused substitute against West Brom and Chelsea as he closes in on a return to the first team . 'It's going to be a million miles an hour, loads of passion and pace, so the lads who have been playing week in week out are probably more up to speed with the game.' Robson has backed returning club captain Wayne Rooney to make a big impact at the Etihad Stadium in the Manchester derby on Sunday, also suggesting Robin van Persie's last-gasp equaliser against Chelsea was a perfect confidence boost for United. 'In the first half the lads performed well against a very good Chelsea side, full of pace and power,' he added. 'Chelsea are well established and rightly one of the favourites to win the title. Robin van Persie scored a late equaliser against league leaders Chelsea at Old Trafford last Sunday . Captain Wayne Rooney could return for the Manchester derby after serving a three-game suspension . 'United are in a transitional period with new players and new manager but after going a goal down they showed good character to come back and get a point. 'That should set them up nicely, going into the derby. Wayne Rooney's coming back, hopefully a few of the other injured players will be fit and ready. That sets it up really nicely for a good derby game. 'In these sort of games you need special players who can do special things and Wayne is one of those players. 'It's not just his ability but also his attitude. If the manager tells him to play in any position he is prepared to sacrifice himself for the team ... that's why he has achieved so much in his career already.'","Michael Carrick played for the Under 21 side last week against West Ham .

"'At least we're not Blackpool'. That mantra is just about all Birmingham City have had to cling on to of late with crises on and off the field suffocating the club. But Gary Rowett taking the managerial job on offer from the club is confirmation that things, even given Saturday's 8-0 mauling by Bournemouth, could indeed be worse. As Sportsmail revealed in September, Rowett turned down an unofficial approach from Blackpool to replace Jose Riga as their manager. Gary Rowett (left) is the new Birmingham City manager, replacing Lee Clark . Rowett, having sought assurances over Birmingham's finances before taking the job on Monday, must therefore see some light at the end of the St Andrew's tunnel in spite of the current malaise at the club. That being said, emotional attachment is sure to have played a part in Rowett's decision. He spent two years at Birmingham as a player from 1998 to 2000. But even if the club do not find much-needed financial investment soon, it's hard to think of a more suitable appointment at this time by Birmingham than Rowett. The task at hand for him is not an easy one by an stretch. The scoreline tells the tale after Birmingham's 8-0 thrashing by Bournemouth at St Andrew's on Saturday . Callum Reilly (left) and David Davis look dejected as another Bournemouth goal goes in . Anyone who thought sacking Lee Clark would immediately see an up-turn in form suffered a rude awakening on Saturday as a team picked and prepared by caretaker Malcolm Crosby were annihilated in front of their own fans. Neil Lennon and Kit Symons have revived the fortunes of Bolton and Fulham respectively in recent weeks, but the players were always there at those clubs. The squad assembled by Clark, on the other hand, is on paper frankly not good enough to stay in the Championship. Birmingham, along with Blackpool, stand out as lacking the pedigree of player to compete with the best in the second tier. A talented crop of youngsters are complemented by a smattering of players signed by Clark from the lower leagues who, to a man, have not delivered. Rowett challenges Barnsley's Bruce Dyer in a Division One (now Championship) play-off semi-final in 2000 . If Birmingham are to stand any chance of staying up Rowett must use the loan market wisely and get some of Clark's signings performing. Even assuming that Blackpool go down, Birmingham must leapfrog two more sides to stay up, and it is hard to see how they can do that. Those clubs immediately above them - Bolton, Fulham and Wigan - are all on an upward trajectory and should have more than enough about them to ease in to mid-table at least. More realistically, Rowett will be hoping to hunt down Leeds, Huddersfield, Rotherham and Millwall, all of whom are already five or six points clear of the Blues. For a club bereft of confidence with just two wins under their belt this season, that is a big gap. Grant Hall (left) apologises to the fans after the game and David Edgar (right) is sent off early on . But if anyone can do it, it's Rowett. Speaking to Sportsmail in September 2012, the 40-year-old's passion for coaching and, more specifically, improving players - something he will have to do at Birmingham - was evident. 'I've been coaching for eight years now, which I think a lot of people don't realise,' Rowett, now with 10 years' experience, said. 'When I finished at Charlton at aged 30 I had about a month off and then went straight into coaching. 'I looked back and realised I had had a good career, but I knew straight away that it wouldn't mean anything if I couldn't coach. I might get away with it for a year or two, but it didn't mean anything to me really. 'I thought, ""right, I've got to start again and learn my role, learn how to coach properly"".' That drive, passion and experience allows Rowett to exude an infectious confidence that brings the best out in his players, or certainly has done at Burton for the past two-and-a-half years. Rowett has been a resounding success at Burton, twice leading them to the League Two play-offs . At the Pirelli Stadium, Rowett made and maintained side noted for their organisation, consistency and professionalism, all things that Birmingham have lacked badly in recent years. Rowett, who cites Joe Royle, Sam Allardyce, Steve McClaren and Alan Curbishley as his biggest influences, was a defender in his playing days so will no doubt look to address Birmingham's backline as a priority. The Blues are conceding on average two goals per game - only Scunthorpe have conceded more than their 28 in the entire Football League. Perhaps most importantly of all, Rowett has the personality and background to bring the fans back to St Andrew's. Birmingham's home form has been woeful for a couple of years now and Clark, with the exception of those final-day survival celebrations at Bolton last season, never really connected with the fans. Lee Clark was sacked earlier this month with Birmingham struggling in the relegation zone . Rowett should not have the same problem. He was popular in his time at the club as a player, playing in a period that Blues fans look back on fondly. Another reason why moving for him makes perfect sense by a club whose decision-making has been questionable in recent times to say the least. You'd still be a brave man to back Birmingham to stay up. But if anyone can do it, it's Gary Rowett. Good week for... PRESTON. Simon Grayson's side made it six wins on the spin against Fleetwood as a 19-minute Joe Garner hat-trick completed a remarkable comeback from 2-0 down. So good is Preston's form that they will go above unbeaten Bristol City at the top of League One should they win their two games in hand. Bad week for... BURTON. Not only are they losing their manager, the Brewers somehow managed to contrive to lose to Stevenage despite their hosts not having a single shot all game on Saturday. A late Ian Sharps own goal settled it as Gary Rowett's former side, who had five shots, slipped to third in the League Two table. Talent scout: Lasse Vigen Christensen (Fulham) Fulham's revival under Kit Symons gathered pace on Friday night with a 3-0 win over London rivals Charlton. The Cottagers were sensational in the first half with Danish midfielder Christensen epitomising their energy, speed and accuracy when passing the ball. If Fulham had blooded youngsters such as the 20-year-old Christensen last season they might just have stayed up. Lasse Vigen Christensen looks like a highly talented player in Fulham's midfield .","Burton confirmed on Monday Gary Rowett is leaving them for Birmingham .

"Daryl Janmaat believes Newcastle’s turnaround is evidence of a united dressing-room behind boss Alan Pardew, as he declared: ‘We do not want another manager’. The Magpies travel to Manchester City in the Capital One Cup fourth round on Wednesday with back-to-back victories in the Premier League having hauled them to the relative comfort of 14th. The upturn in fortunes has lifted the spotlight on Pardew, who had been the odds-on favourite in the top-flight ‘sack race’.

But the mood in the black-and-white camp is good as they head to the Etihad Stadium, and summer signing Janmaat said: ‘We want him (Pardew) – we do not want another manager. We have proved that. ‘If you lose games then it is normal (the manager is under pressure), but now I expect the pressure to ease on him. It’s nice that we have given him those points.’ Pardew tore in to his players after an insipid first half at Spurs on Sunday and it was a ploy which paid dividends as they emerged after the break to claim a 2-1 victory. ‘After the first half the manager was angry,’ revealed Janmaat. ‘He said to us, “if you play like that you cannot win games”. Afterwards, he gave us a compliment and was very passionate, he said “if you play like that you will win games”.’ Dutch international Janmaat was part of the Newcastle side which picked up a 2-1 win against Tottenham . It will be a big ask for Newcastle to make it past City, especially with the club having gone on the record in stating that cup competitions are not a priority. But Janmaat insists the players take little notice of such policies. ‘Of course, the cup is very important,’ said the £5million former Feyenoord full back. ‘It is a prize and Newcastle have not won one since 1969. It would be a great party if we won a prize. The fans want that very much. ‘And we need them. It is an extra man for us, the 12th man. They were fantastic at Spurs. ‘That has given us hope ahead of this game. City have a big squad and a great squad – even their second team is very good. It will be a tough game. But if we play like we did in the second half at Spurs, then of course we have a chance. ‘We’ve had a great start to the week. We want to win the next two now (City and Liverpool at home on Saturday). ‘We needed those points but we need to be higher in the table. Two wins in a row after a draw has been very good for us. But we still have to improve and now we have confidence to do that.’ Janmaat (right) celebrates with his Newcastle team-mates after their victory at White Hart Lane .","Daryl Janmaat is keen on easing the pressure off of Alan Pardew .

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini insists uncertainty over Wayne Rooney's fitness will have no bearing on his plan for this weekend's Manchester derby. Doubt has been cast over United striker Rooney's availability for Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash against rivals City following a report that he has suffered a foot injury. It was claimed the United and England captain was seen limping at a sponsors' function on Monday after apparently being hurt in training. United have not commented on the report. City manager Manuel Pellegrini has more to focus on than just Wayne Rooney ahead of the Manchester derby . Uncertainty surrounds Rooney's fitness after reports he injured his foot in training on Monday . Pellegrini claims the uncertainty does not affect his preparations as his gameplan is based on containing United's firepower as a whole, rather focusing on any individual. Pellegrini said: 'We really don't change our way to play for some player, or other player. If it's not Wayne Rooney it will be Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata or Robin van Persie. 'They have so many creative players that they have a lot of different chances. We cannot prepare for a game talking about one player because (if) he doesn't play we have to change all of what we do. 'We really try to play with a style of play every game. Rooney is set to return after serving a three-game suspension for hacking down West Ham's Stewart Downing . England captain hold record for most goals scored in a Manchester derby, including this super strike in 2011 . 'I am sure Wayne Rooney is one of the important players of Manchester United but also other players are very difficult for us.' Rooney had been expected to return for the clash at the Etihad Stadium after completing a three-match suspension. Even though United have not lost since Rooney began his ban, his comeback would give the team a lift as they tackle the champions, to whom they lost 4-1 and 3-0 last season. The 29-year-old holds the record for the most goals scored in Manchester derbies with 11 in 22 appearances. The Premier League champions dropped points in the title race after being beaten 2-1 by West Ham . Pellegrini admits being pleased after Robin van Persie scored a late equaliser against league leaders Chelsea . Pellegrini, speaking at a press conference to preview his side's Capital One Cup tie against Newcastle, was also asked if United did City a favour last weekend. United struck a late equaliser to claim a draw against Premier League leaders Chelsea, preventing them moving eight points clear of City. Asked if he celebrated Van Persie's goal, Pellegrini said, laughing: 'I don't remember. At that moment, I thought the game was finished and I went to drink a glass of water. 'When they told me after how the game finished I smiled.' Â .","Manchester City host Manchester United in  derby on Sunday .

"Adel Taarabt was a non-starter for QPR reserves on Tuesday afternoon. Hoops boss Harry Redknapp stated in his post-match press conference following Monday night's win over Aston Villa that Taarabt would face Swansea in the Under-21 fixture on Tuesday afternoon at the club's Harlington training ground in west London. Redknapp said: 'He's (Adel's) working hard this week, he's working with the fitness coaches and we've got a game tomorrow for the reserves (at home to Swansea) and him and one or two of the lads will get a game.' Adel Taarabt posted a picture of himself training in the gym - but wasn't chosen for a QPR U21s game . The Moroccan midfielder has been accused of being three stone overweight by manager Harry Redknapp . Redknapp had claimed Taarabt would get a game in the reserves after being left out of the first team sqaud . But, just 16 hours later, there was no sign of the Moroccan international, slammed by his manager in the 'Fatgate' scandal and accused of being overweight last week, in the 16-man squad for the 2pm kick off. It is believed Taarabt trained on Tuesday morning with the rest of the QPR squad who did not feature in the 2-0 Premier League victory over Villa at Loftus Road. After that much-needed success, Redknapp sought an end to his spat with Taarabt, claiming the forward has a future at the club, as long as he gets himself fit. QPR owner Tony Fernandes (L) tried to make light of the situation by stripping off for a selfie . Charlie Austin scored a brace in QPR's 2-0 victory over Aston Villa to take them off the bottom of the table . Redknapp added: 'Absolutely he could still play a part in the future if he gets himself fit. 'All I ask people to do is come in every day, train, be thankful for being a professional footballer, work hard, god gave them a fantastic talent and I just hope he doesn't waste it. 'If he is fit and ready to play then he's a great talent.' But the 25-year-old will have to wait even longer to make his comeback.","Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt have been engaged in a war of words over the midfielder's weight .

"Arsenal reached the landmark of scoring 1,500 Premier League goals on Saturday following the 2-0 victory over Sunderland. Alexis Sanchez's double for Arsene Wenger's side at the Stadium of Light saw the Gunners become only the second Premier League club to reach the milestone. With Thierry Henry, Ian Wright, Robin van Persie and Dennis Bergkamp among Arsenal's former lethal forwards, it's little wonder they're the second-highest scorers in Premier League history. Alexis Sanchez shoots to score as Arsenal reached the milestone of netting 1,500 Premier League goals . Sanchez celebrates scoring in Arsenal's 2-0 win over Sunderland as he wrote his name into the record books . Arsenal's all-time top goalscorer Thierry Henry scored 175 times for the Gunners in the Premier League . Ian Wright beat Cliff Bastin's record number of goals in 1997 - the striker scored 104 Premier League goals . Dennis Bergkamp was a scorer of great goals as well as a great goalscorer during  eleven season with Arsenal . Incredibly, Thierry Henry is responsible for scoring more than 11 per cent of Arsenal's 1,500 Premier League goals. It also comes as no surprise that Manchester United - Premier League winners on 13 occasions - lead the way when it comes to finding the back of the net in England's top-flight. The Red Devils have amassed an impressive 1,707 in the 'Goals For' column. The partnership of Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke, the penalty-box ability of Ruud van Nistelrooy and the powerful pairing of Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney have all provided goals for Sir Alex Ferguson's title-winning sides over the years. Special mentions must also be given to the likes of Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs who also popped up with their fair share of strikes. However, Arsenal - scorers of sumptuous strikes and famed for free-flowing football under Arsene Wenger - are the Red Devils' closest challengers. Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney  played a huge part in maintaining United's place at the top of the table . Sir Alex Ferguson's free-scoring Manchester United teams won the Premier League on 13 occasions . The lethal partnership of Dwight Yorke and Andrew Cole helped guide Manchester United to the Treble in 1999 . Chelsea, who hold the record for the most number of goals scored in a single season, finding the net 103 times during the 2009-10 campaign (just one more than Manchester City managed last term) are the third highest scorers in the table. Meanwhile, Liverpool, who finished second in the Premier League last season thanks to the goals of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, are the fourth highest scorers. There's no doubting Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard also scored a fair share of the Anfield side's 1,421 goals. Chelsea scored a record-breaking 103 goals on their way to winning the Premier League title in 2010 . Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 53 goals  as Liverpool finished second in the Premier League last term . As expected, the Premier League's other ever-presents all make the top seven. Tottenham, Everton and Aston Villa have all scored over 1,000 goals having spent the previous 22 seasons in the top-flight. Newcastle and former Premier League champions Blackburn - two former clubs of the Premier League's all-time top scorer Alan Shearer, who found the net 260 times - sit eighth and ninth respectively in the table. Manchester City, who have won the title twice in the last three years, are 10th in the all-time table (on points) but have actually scored 31 more goals than Blackburn, who are now playing in the Championship following relegation in 2012.

"Aleksandar Kolarov believes there has been a power shift in Manchester, and he insists the current Premier League champions have been better than United for the last five or six years. City have won six of the last nine derbies between the two Manchester rivals, though the Red Devils have finished above their neighbors in four out of the last six seasons and since the start of 2009 United have eight derby wins to City's seven. But speaking before Sunday's showdown at the Etihad, Kolarov was quoted as saying on ESPN:  'It is a great game to watch or play in. Aleksandar Kolarov trains  ahead of Manchester City's Capital One Cup clash against Newcastle . The Serbian left back says City have been better than Manchester United for the last five or six years . Kolarov jumps on Edin Dzeko after the Bosnian scored in the Citizens' 6-1 win at Old Trafford in 2011 . 'Every player in the world would like to play [in] this game. United has a great history but in the last five or six years, I think we have been superior to them.' The Etihad side have certainly enjoyed the better of the derbies over the last couple of seasons, and have won the last three Premier League clashes between the two, including last season's 4-1 home success and a 3-0 win at Old Trafford. Despite this and Kolarov's confidence, the Serbian defender is not taking Louis van Gaal's side lightly, and he added: 'They have changed the manager and bought a lot of great players and I think they can have a good season in the Premier League. City have won two out of the last three Premier Leagues and Kolarov believes the power in the city has shifted .

They have bought some great players so it is up to them to do their best.' Reflecting on his own performances so far this season, Kolarov bemoaned Manuel Pellegrini's rotation policy that has seen him start only seven of City's 14 games as he battles it out with Gael Clichy to be the club's first-choice left back. The 28-year-old said: 'On a personal level, I don't like the rotation [policy] but it is the manager's choice and I give 100 per cent when I am playing.'","In the last six seasons, United won three Premier League titles to City's two .

"Gus Poyet is running out of answers to reverse the form of sorry Sunderland after individual errors again proved costly. The Black Cats boss pleaded for more time to stamp his identity on the team in the wake of their 8-0 humiliation at Southampton last weekend. But Poyet says his attempt at progress is being undermined by the mistakes of his players, Wes Brown and goalkeeper Vito Mannone the pair guilty of gifting Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez a match-winning double on Saturday. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet shows his frustrations on the touchline as his side lose 2-0 to Arsenal . Alexis Sanchez (centre) scores for Arsenal as Wes Brown (left) and John O'Shea look on . Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone can only watch as Sanchez (left) nets his second goal of the game . ‘We cannot make any more - no more mistakes,’ he blasted. ‘Individual ones like that, no more, otherwise it is impossible to win games. ‘One was bad enough, but to have two mistakes, two goals conceded like that after last weekend, is tough. It’s not something you expect or you can train (to prevent).’ Poyet, who has been in the job for one year now, continues to talk in riddles when asked whether or not he is happy with the strength and depth of his playing personnel. The subtext of his coded comments is that he is not responsible for the club’s transfer strategy and there is thought to be tension between himself and sporting director Lee Congerton. Poyet (right) shakes hands with Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger prior to kick-off on Saturday . Mannone (centre) is consoled by his opposite number Wojciech Szczesny (second left) after the match . Poyet, it seems, is now unhappy with the mass turnover during the summer. ‘From last year, the team that started against Arsenal here, seven players (it is six plus one substitute) from the Sunderland line up are not at the club anymore,’ he said. ‘Eight of the starting 11 of Arsenal are in their squad. We start all the way from zero, so how can you have a consistency of understanding the game and a mentality if you are starting afresh every year? You are always catching up. You need your team to get momentum.’ Poyet’s Sunderland certainly have momentum right now, only their trajectory is very much downwards.","Sunderland lost 2-0 at home to Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Marussia have become the second Formula One team in a matter of days to be placed in administration and will miss the US Grand Prix in Texas this weekend. A statement from London-based restructuring and recovery firm FRP Advisory confirmed the company, known as Manor Grand Prix Racing Limited and trading as Marussia F1 Team, 'will continue to operate while the joint administrators assess the longer-term viability of the company in its present form'. Caterham entered administration on Friday and have been given special dispensation to miss the next two grands prix while a buyer is sought for the cash-strapped marque. VIDEOS Scroll down Marussia placed administration unable race Grand Prix . The Marussia F1 team have been placed into administration and will be unable to race in the US Grand Prix . Caterham (pictured) will also miss next weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas . Last Monday a company known as Caterham Sports Limited (CSL) also went into administration. CSL supplies and makes cars for 1MRT, the entity which owns the licence for Caterham to race in F1. Following a mud-slinging dispute between the past and present owners of Caterham in the days that followed, on Friday it was decided the administrators of CSL, London-based accountancy Smith & Williamson, would be handed full-management responsibility for the team. Smith & Williamson are now working to find a buyer of 'substantial financial means', with Caterham granted dispensation by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to miss the next two grands prix in Texas and Brazil. Ecclestone has also granted Marussia the same dispensation, with the Banbury-based marque also able to miss the race at Interlagos should they require. Marussia had been struggling financially and are still reeling from French driver Jules Bianchi's serious accident in Japan three weeks ago. Medical staff gather around Jules Bianchi's car after the Marussia driver's horror crash in Japan . Acting on behalf of Marussia, one of the joint administrators - Geoff Rowley - said: 'Whilst the team has made significant progress during its relatively short period of operation, the highlight of which included securing two constructors' championship points in the current F1 season, the position remains operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment. 'With the existing shareholder unable to provide the required level of funding, the senior management team has worked tirelessly to bring new investment to the team to secure its long term future, but regrettably has been unable to do so within the time available. 'Therefore, they have been left with no alternative but to place the company into administration. 'With the Marussia F1 team now in administration, the joint administrators have assessed that, given the current financial circumstances of the group, it is not viable for the Marussia F1 team to participate in the next race, the 2014 Formula One United States Grand Prix, due to take place this weekend in Austin, Texas. Marussia and Caterham have both been granted dispensation by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to miss the next two grands prix in Texas and Brazil . 'The company will continue to operate while the joint administrators assess the longer-term viability of the company in its present form. 'Following Austin, there are two further rounds of the 2014 championship remaining, in Sao Paulo and Abu Dhabi, and the team's participation in those races will depend on the outcome of the administration process and any related negotiations with interested parties in what is a very limited window of opportunity. 'No redundancies have been made following the company's entering into administration and all staff have been paid in full to the end of October. The ongoing staff position will however be dependent on whether the company can secure new investment in the limited time available. 'We remain highly focused on engaging with interested parties.'","Marussia became second F1 team to enter administration after Caterham .

"Black is the new, erm, black, this weekend with the return of proper football boots. Many of us would have been forgiven for thinking plain boots were a thing of the past, sent to the footballing equivalent of Room 101, lost in the Bermuda Triangle. Red and orange and yellow and green, indigo, violet and blue; the colours of the rainbow really have helped to light up the game’s top leagues over the last decade. Cristiano Ronaldo will wear all-black boots in Real Madrid's La Liga clash against Barcelona on Saturday . Ronaldo, who scored in Real Madrid's 3-0 defeat of Liverpool on Tuesday, will don black boots this weekend . Indeed only one of the 22 who started Manchester City's Champions League tie at CSKA Moscow stuck with tradition, and it was the nosts' No 25. You know, Elvir Rahimic? OK, me neither. But now thanks to the planet’s biggest player, black will be back on the menu this weekend and with it a nod to football’s days of yore. Hallelujah. Cristiano Ronaldo, the footballer of the year, will wear black boots in the globe’s biggest game when Real Madrid host Barcelona in El Clasico on Saturday. And the Portugal superstar will not be alone. Only one of the 22 players who started Manchester City's match against CSKA Moscow wore black boots . Dutchman Robin van Persie will also be donning black footwear when he takes to the Old Trafford dancefloor for the visit of Premier League leaders Chelsea. Between them, Ronaldo and Van Persie will help to provide footballing fans with a throwback to yesteryear; and with it some nostalgia for those of us who grew up where black was the only option on the colour chart. I was probably about nine or 10, when our star striker turned up to match in a pair of all-white boots. Our manager was stunned. ‘Take those off,’ he blasted. ‘You’ll be a target for the opposition; they’ll want to kick you off the park because you think you're special.’ Ray Stewart in action for West Ham in 1984 and Ian Wright and his Arsenal team-mates back in 1995 .

He then begrudgingly walked back to the changing room, pulled on his Adidas Predators, and promptly bagged a hat-trick. Take a walk to your local playing field on a Sunday morning in 2014 however, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a kid sporting a black pair of boots. Wayne Rooney, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Co all wear coloured boots. So, why wouldn’t they? Ronaldo’s nod to footballing nostalgia could however, buck that trend.

Delighted Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe hailed his players for shrugging off Albion's late equaliser, Wilson almost immediately racing up the other end to fire the winner. Howe claimed the decisive strike when Bournemouth saw off Albion 1-0 in the FA Cup third round in 1999. The former Cherries defender admitted managing the club to a Premier League giant killing proved the more exhilarating feeling. 'We really didn't want extra time,' said Howe. 'It really pleased me we had the mentality to stay strong, score and see out the game. That shows how strong we are. 'Nothing beats this feeling; not that win against Albion I played in. When you score a goal as a player it's an unbelievable feeling. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe , who has guided the Cherries to fourth in the Championship, salutes the fans . 'But after some dark days for the club in the past, to be in a quarter-final, is fantastic.' If Irvine was left to defend his 10 changes, Howe was being hailed for making the same number of alterations from the line-up that blitzed Birmingham 8-0 on Saturday. 'The guys who have been out of the team have shown a great attitude, have been very professional,' said Howe. 'I don't think we'd have performed so well if we had people sulking or losing interest. I had it in my mind I was always going to make the changes. 'When you haven't been at this stage of the cup before, you don't care who you get. We'd love a home game, but who we get at home, we'll take whoever.' Howe (right), instructing his players against West Brom, was delighted with the result at Dean Court . Bournemouth's Russian owner Maxim Demin was once again conspicuous by his absence, with Howe admitting he abides by his boss' idiosyncratic superstitions. 'He thinks he's some kind of jinx so he finds it hard to watch us and I've been trying to convince him to come,' said Howe. 'He asked me to text him a specific thing at a particular time ahead of the match, and I did. He's been instrumental in helping turn this club around. 'When I came back to the club two years ago the immediate target was to stay up (in League One). 'We managed to win promotion that season which was a surprise. Last season we'd have accepted finishing fourth bottom in the Championship, but we finished 10th. 'Now it's about improving performances as much as league position.'","Baggies visited Bournemouth who sit fourth in the Championship .

"British viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of Saturday's game due to broadcasting regulations. Luka Modric has piled more misery on  Liverpool by claiming Real Madrid eased off in the second half of their Champions League clash to save themselves for Saturday's Clasico against Barcelona. Real cruised to a 3-0 win at Anfield and played much of the second half at walking pace as they conserved energy for the eagerly anticipated encounter at the Bernabeu. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring before a Karim Benzema double put the game out of Liverpool's reach before half-time, and Modric admitted the European champions started to think about the Barcelona match after the interval.

'In the last month, or month and a half, we have looked in great shape and we showed our top form in this iconic stadium,' said Modric to Goal.com. 'The first goal broke them. They lost enthusiasm. Then in the second half we were saving a little bit of energy for Saturday.'

"Carl Froch’s hopes of a dream Las Vegas swansong hinge on Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr accepting the challenge. Froch, who was made a freeman of Nottingham on Thursday night, is desperate to finish his career in Sin City. And Chavez’s promoter Bob Arum has offered the former middleweight world champion the fight for early next year. Carl Froch, 37, is close to sealing the dream Las Vegas fight with Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Chavez Jnr after winning the WBC World Middleweight Title bout against Sebastian Zbik in Los Angeles . Total fights 35 . Wins 33 . Wins by KO 24 . Losses 2 . Draws 0 . ‘We’ve offered Chavez Jnr a fight with Froch,’ Arum told Fight Hub. ‘If he does that fight he’s finished with the contract. We’re waiting to hear back from him.’ Should Chavez accept the fight, it is expected to take place before the end of January. But the 28-year-old has not fought since March and his contractual situation has proved a stubborn obstacle in the past. Froch (right) will likely take Chavez Jnr on next January if the Mexican boxer accepts the fight . Chavez was supposed to face middleweight knockout artist Gennady Golovkin last July but talks broke down. Chavez refused to sign a contract extension with Arum’s Top Rank promotional company as part of the deal, and then rejected a second offer of a smaller purse but without the extension. Earlier this week, Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn revealed he was more confident than ever that the fight will happen. Writing in his Sportsmail column, he said: ‘Having spent a lot of time with Carl Froch recently, it’s been difficult to ignore his burning desire to box in Las Vegas. Froch may have thrown his last punch if he's denied a showdown with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . ‘As we all know, anything can happen in boxing, but talks re-opened last week with the Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr camp and I am hopeful that a fight can be made in Las Vegas. ‘For Carl, it has always been his dream to fight in Vegas so it is something we will try hard to finalise. ‘It had seemingly died in the water, but I took a call from Top Rank on Saturday and they wanted to explore the possibilities further. Froch  was made a freeman of Nottingham on Thursday by Nottingham City Council leader Jim Collins (left) ‘I am now expecting to be on a conference call with Chavez’s representatives later this week where we will try to make more progress.’ Should an agreement be reached, Froch would likely be forced to vacate his IBF title.

"He's young, he's English, and he's a centre forward. But Harry Kane is still underrated. 'I have always believed in Harry since the first day… he has a very strong mind and is a very good player.' These were Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino's words in August, and events since will have only strengthened his confidence in the 21-year-old. Harry Kane trains at Tottenham's training ground ahead of their Europa League clash with Asteras Tripolis . Kane (right) gives Tottenham the lead against Besiktas at White Hart Lane with a left-foot strike . The England Under 21 striker celebrates his goal against Besiktas - one of four in five cup games this season . Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . Facebook: UEFAEuropaLeague . Twitter: @EuropaLeague . And at uefa.com . Yet still, there isn't a frenzied hype surrounding the front man, who has four goals in his five cup games this term and six goals in nine caps for England Under 21s. A good thing? Perhaps. Team-mate Andros Townsend's career has stalled since being heralded by Harry Redknapp as the closest thing to Arjen Robben English football has produced. The fact Spurs have two big-money, big-name and big-wage strikers in Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor goes against Kane. But going for him is the Europa League, a platform on which Kane can prove he deserves to start in the Premier League over Soldado in particular. Spurs' Road To Warsaw could push Kane into the big time. His form on paper since breaking into the first team far exceeds that of the Spaniard's, a £26million signing from Valencia last summer. The Englishman scores or creates a goal every 111 minutes in a Spurs shirt; Soldado every 152 minutes and Adebayor every 142. Roberto Soldado has been a major disappointment since joining from Valencia for £26m in the summer of 2013 . Emmanuel Adebayor (left) appears to be ahead of Kane and Soldado at Spurs despite his poor form . Soldado watches Manchester City keeper Joe Hart save his penalty during Spurs' 4-1 defeat at the Etihad . Kick-off: Thursday, October 23, 8.05pm . TV: ITV4 from 5.30pm (Lille vs Everton, 6pm) Kane has also impressed playing behind the striker, but he has only ever started with Soldado twice - both in this season's Europa League. Pochettino may try it again on Thursday evening against Asteras Tripolis on ITV4, but in the Premier League it is often one or the other. Spurs' indifferent form has forced calls for the youngster to lead the line in the top flight, and though comparisons to a young Teddy Sheringham may be premature, he is clever, astute and can score a variety of goals. There are still question marks as to whether Kane can be the lone striker in Pochettino's favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, but the doubts over Soldado are far greater at present. Many saw this as Kane's breakthrough year at White Hart Lane, but if he finds himself sitting behind Soldado in the pecking order come pre-season 2015, impatience could kick in. Kane would prosper with a start week in, week out. If Spurs can't provide that, a move to a mid-table Premier League club would make sense. Kane and Soldado could start up-front together when Spurs host Asteras Tripolis on Thursday . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (left) insists he has plenty of faith in Kane's ability . Kane nets another goal in the Europa League as Spurs beat AEL Limassol 3-0 to reach the group stage . The fear is that Spurs are constantly attempting to cling onto the tails of the top four, and playing a 21-year-old striker with just seven Premier League starts under his belt is risky. The culture goes that if a player cost the club millions, he should be tried and tried over the promising academy graduate, no matter who is on better form. Understandable, but Kane may begin to feel his qualities could be better utilised elsewhere. Nevertheless, Kane signed a new contract in August, 'keeping him' at the club until 2019, and Spurs are obviously keen on giving Kane his chances in short spells for now. And of course, a bigger stage beckons if Spurs can lift the Europa League this season, with the competition forming a gateway for the Champions League for the first time. He qualifies for the Republic of Ireland through his Irish-born Grandfather, but he ruled out a switch in August, instead pinning his hopes on a future England call up. He may not be waiting too much longer if he continues his form.","Harry Kane has three goals in the UEFA Europa League this season .

"Gareth Bale may have swapped Tottenham for Real Madrid but he is still having an impact on his former club, having helped countryman Ben Davies's move to White Hart Lane. After impressing with Swansea, the 21-year-old left back was lured to north London by Mauricio Pochettino in a deal worth a reported £10million. Davies had been attracting interest from Liverpool but plumped for a move to Spurs - a decision swayed in part by Wales team-mate Bale, who enjoyed six years at the club before his world-record £86 million transfer to Real Madrid. Ben Davies (centre) says he spoke to Wales team-mate Gareth Bale ahead of his Tottenham move . 'I spoke to him briefly about it, nothing too in-depth, but it was nice just to have that insight from him,' Davies said. 'He told me what the club was like and how it worked, and what he said really appealed to me. 'The transition's been relatively easy for me. I've enjoyed being up here and it's a great opportunity for me to get away from home and to experience a new lifestyle. 'I don't think there's any better time to do that than when you're young, and it's a learning curve really.' Davies joined the north London outfit for £10million from Premier League rivals Swansea in the summer . Davies is clearly enjoying life in north London, although first-team opportunities have been harder to come by than many expected. It was widely-assumed his arrival would see Danny Rose drop down the pecking order, although it is in fact the Welshman who has so far played understudy at left back. Davies has been reduced to cup appearances and is set to come back into the starting line-up when Spurs look for a first Europa League Group C win against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday. 'I think it's a good competition for the club to be in,' he said of the Europa League - a tournament he played in with Swansea last term. Bale enjoyed six years at White Hart Lane before joining Spanish giants Real Madrid last year . 'It gives the entire squad an opportunity for games, and games at the top level at that. 'The winner of this year's competition is guaranteed a spot in next year's Champions League too, so we've got to go into this competition looking to win it really, and if that means getting a Champions League spot at the end of it then that's great for us. 'We're expecting a tough game tomorrow. They are top of the league in our group and we've got to go out there as if it's a game against one of the best clubs in Europe. 'We've got to put our performance right on the field first, and if that's right then hopefully we'll be able to get the three points.'

"Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has blasted the club's transfer dealings on Twitter, believing they made a huge error in not signing a centre back and defensive midfielder this summer. The Gunners lie seventh in the Premier League currently, already finding themselves 11 points behind leaders Chelsea, and Frimpong says the £30million that was spent on bringing Alexis Sanchez to the club would have been better utilised elsewhere. The 22-year-old, who now plays in Russia for FC Ufa, vented his frustrations on the social networking site during Arsenal's Champions League game against Anderlecht. Former Arsenal starlet Emmanuel Frimpong expresses his frustration over Arsenal's defensive situation . Frimpong says too many of Arsenal's squad are similar in their style . Frimpong says Arsenal should have spent money on a centre-half and a defensive midfielder rather than Alexis Sanchez this summer . He said: 'Said it and will say it again we need a F***king centre-back with Laurent a bloody DMF and a bloody striker. 'And before you start going down on me it's bloody true all our players are so similar, Jack, Ramsey Arteta, Chambo, Sanchez, Ozil, all too similar. 'FFS Sanchez has had a good season but no disrespect would have been better using that to buy a centre back and a DMF bloody sick of it man.' Emmanuel Frimpong still has a close affinity for Arsenal despite being released by the club in the summer . Alexis Sanchez has impressed for Arsenal since signing from Barcelona but Frimpong thinks the money spent on him should have utilised better elsewhere . Ironically, Arsenal went on to recover from going 1-0 down against the Belgian champions, with Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski both scoring late on, as Arsene Wenger's side ensured it would be a birthday to remember for their manager, on the day he turned 65.

"Didier Drogba stirred Chelsea emotions and rekindled misty-eyed memories of Munich as he scored a Champions League penalty to celebrate his first goal since returning to Stamford Bridge. His first since the winning spot-kick against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena in May 2012 was the second in this six-goal Euro-romp against Maribor. Jose Mourinho’s team are in control at the top of Group G, smoothly on course for a place in the last 16 of the Champions League. Loic Remy put Chelsea ahead after 13 minutes after cutting in from the right hand side and firing past Jasmin Handanovic . Didier Drogba made it 2-0 from the penalty spot after Ales Mertelj was harshly adjudged to have committed a foul as the ball hit his hand .

Subs not used: Cotman, N’Diaye, Sallalich, Zahovic, Mendy, Arghus. Manager: Ante Simundza 5 . Referee: Danny Makkelie (Holland) 6.5 . They are unbeaten in 12 games this season, have scored 33 goals and Eden Hazard is in electrifying form. Yet, as supporters wallowed in the nostalgia and goose-pimpled with excitement at the prospect of the season ahead, they and Mourinho must have been wondering quietly about the collateral damage. Drogba was only on the pitch because Loic Remy had hurt his groin scoring the first of the night and Remy was only starting because Diego Costa was absent with his hamstring problems. These inconveniences did nothing to stop them outclassing the champions of Slovenia. John Terry scored a remarkable third, there was an own-goal, Maribor missed a penalty and Eden Hazard grabbed two late on, his first from another spot-kick. There was no shortage of incident and with the points safe, thoughts turned to Manchester United on Sunday, and Mourinho’s mounting problems. He also has Cesar Azpilicueta suspended, after his red card at Crystal Palace. Cesc Fabregas came off with 30 minutes remaining to preserve his energy and Chelsea ended with three teenagers on the pitch, including striker Dominic Solanke, making his debut. Mourinho had also rested Thibaut Courtois and Gary Cahill. Ahead of the game, Mourinho had been at pains to avoid complacency and Maribor, who took points from Schalke and Sporting Lisbon, produced an early warning when Damjan Bohar found space between Terry and Kurt Zouma and headed over. Willian takes on Maribor's Zeljko Filipovic as Chelsea attempted to consolidate their position at the top of Group G .

Remy stretches for the ball inside the Maribor box, and the French striker appeared to pick up an injury shortly before he scored . From here, Chelsea took a grip and had killed the game by half-time. First came Remy’s goal, followed by his injury. Terry split the Maribor defence and Remy fired low into the corner. As he moved away to celebrate the goal, he winced and pulled up. He must have warned Mourinho about the problem because Drogba was already warming up. After hobbling on for two minutes, Remy came off and went straight down the tunnel. He must have been devastated. After moving from Queen’s Park Rangers and waiting patiently for his chance, here it came and went and on came Drogba, to seize the script with a goal and a performance which was a considerable improvement on his only start of the season, against Schalke. Willian won the spot-kick when he jinked into the box and jabbed a pass which clearly struck Ales Mertelj on the hand. Mertelj seemed justified to complain that the ball had been struck from only a yard away and he had no chance to adjust, but the argument was lost. Dutch referee Danny Makkelie pointed to the spot, and Hazard gave Drogba the honour. “I was surprised and I wasn’t particularly pleased,” said Mourinho. “I have my choices and Hazard is number one.” Drogba made it easier for the manager to accept by stepping up and with a sense of history scored his 158th Chelsea goal, sweeping the ball into the same corner as the penalty he scored to win the Champions League shoot-out, with his last kick before leaving for China. Chelsea's first goal was pure simplicity as John Terry fed Loic Remy. Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone . Remy's strike from the edge of the box put Chelsea 1-0 up, but the French forward aggravated the injury to his groin in the process . As his Chelsea team-mates celebrate, Remy is left clutching at his troublesome groin, and was replaced soon after . Remy's injury could pose a serious problem for Chelsea, who go to Manchester United next week with Diego Costa already a doubt . It was far from an electric atmosphere at the Bridge for what always seemed likely to be a routine group game but this was a popular moment, greeted with an enormous cheer. Drogba is the club’s top European goalscorer and this was his 35th. Terry’s first of the season was nearly as popular. Chelsea had been defending a corner when a Drogba clearance sparked a counter-attack and the captain put his head down and ran. Hazard carried the ball to the edge of the Maribor penalty area, rolled in Fabregas on the overlap and his low cross was met at the back-post by Terry, who had made a 100-yard dash to convert, sliding in on the seat of his pants. He was a fraction offside, but there was no flag. The second half belonged to Hazard, although the Belgian winger began it with a couple of fluffed chances. He linked up neatly with Drogba only to stumble over the ball as he manoeuvred it out of his feet to shoot, with only the goalkeeper to beat.

Eden Hazard's cut-back was inadvertently turned in by Mitja Viler as Chelsea continued to dominate in the second half . Agim Ibraimi sees his penalty strike the base of the post after Nemanja Matic had conceded a penalty to offer Maribor a small ray of hope . He squandered another chance at the back-post as he reached a low cross zipped in from the left by Filipe Luis but, as he turned the ball back across goal, it was deflected into the net by Maribor left-back Mitja Viler. The Slovenians had the chance to pull one back from the spot when Nemanja Matic bundled into Agim Ibrami and sent him sprawling in the penalty area. Ibrami picked himself to take the kick himself and it seemed for a split-second as if Cech was about to continue the Munich theme. The Czech ‘keeper, demoted this season to No.2 behind Courtois, had saved three in that Champions League final, but this one flashed past his dive, smacked into the post and flew out. Willian rattled the woodwork before Hazard finally found the target, which the goals his dazzling skills deserved. This time he took responsibility from the spot, stepping up to score after Branislav Ivanovic had tumbled theatrically, . Hazard added his second and his team’s sixth as the clock ticked past 90 minutes. A win in Maribor in a fortnight and Chelsea will be within touching distance of the knock-out rounds with two games to spare.

"Diego Costa, Andre Schurrle and Ramires have all been ruled out of Chelsea's Champions League Group G clash with Maribor. Brazil midfielder Ramires (groin) and German forward Schurrle (illness) trained with the first team on Monday but Costa did not and Jose Mourinho ruled all three out of the game, along with Jon Mikel Obi (foot), on Monday afternoon. Costa, scorer of nine goals in seven Premier League games for the leaders, also missed Chelsea's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and has been hindered by persistent hamstring problems this season.

'It's the same problem he's having. But now an injury, not an almost injury. It's simple. He's not training because he is not in condition to do so,' Mourinho said. 'I have no idea how long. Tomorrow he cannot play. The weekend (against Manchester United) is not important but he cannot play tomorrow.' Costa's absence presents an opportunity for either Didier Drogba or Loic Remy to stake a claim for a regular place in the side. Remy, a summer signing from Queens Park Rangers, deputised in place of Costa on Saturday against Palace, but was unable to find the back of the net. And Mourinho hopes that whoever he selects can lead Chelsea to what he considers a vital three points. 'It is important to win. It is not an easy group. Sporting are a good team and playing better and better and better. Schalke are a good team with Roberto Di Matteo as coach.

"Liverpool's £10million striker Divock Origi will have personal revenge on his mind when he meets Everton keeper Tim Howard on Thursday for the first time since their memorable World Cup duel in Brazil. Origi, on loan at French club Lille who Everton face in the Europa League, missed a number of chances to beat Howard during Belgium’s 2-1 extra-time win against USA in July. Howard made a World Cup record 15 saves to become a hero back home, with even President Barack Obama phoning his congratulations. The 19-year-old Origi had been substituted by the time Belgium forced a win, but showed enough potential during the tournament to be snapped up by Liverpool when it ended.

Referee: Jorge Sousa (Portugal). ‘I had lots of chances to score against Tim in that game,’ said Origi. ‘I had seven or eight attempts but failed. He had a great game and we know how good he is. It would be symbolic to beat him this time.’ An astonishing 7,000 Everton fans, their biggest travelling contingent in Europe since the 1980s, will be in France to see if Howard can torment Origi again. ‘Origi is a good young player, very talented on the ball,’ said Howard. ‘I studied his strengths in Brazil and what he might do.

"Roberto Martinez has decided to leave two of his first-team players on Merseyside for the trip to Lille as he attempts to juggle domestic and European commitments. Steven Naismith and Leon Osman are both fit after starting last Saturday's 3-0 win against Aston Villa but the Spaniard has opted to rest both players as he looks ahead to Sunday's visit to Burnley in the Premier League. Speaking ahead of his side's Europa League clash at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy, Martinez said: 'Steven and Leon have been rested for this trip bearing in mind the number of games we have this month and in terms of their individual circumstances and the number of games they have played.' Steven Naismith (right), pictured in action against Aston Villa, has been rested for Everton's trip to Lille . Leon Osman has also remained on Merseyside instead of travelling to France with Roberto Martinez's squad . The other two members of Everton's squad unable to travel to France are Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone, both of whom are not yet ready to for action. Oviedo recently underwent minor surgery to remove a screw from his leg after breaking it earlier this year, while Kone is still battling for fitness following a long-term knee injury. 'Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone are not fully match fit, although they are not too far away. They were not 100 per cent for this trip,' Martinez added.

"Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham Hotspur can expect to win major silverware within two years but warned of suffering in store in the meantime. The Spurs manager said: ‘Sometimes to change something you need time. You need to suffer and have the bad moments. We know we’re heading in the right direction. ‘It may be in six months, one year, or two years. But I’m sure in the end the club will achieve a very important trophy.’ Mauricio Pochettino believes his Tottenham Hotspur side should target a trophy within the next two years . Tottenham players train ahead of their Europa League clash with Asteras Tripolis on Thursday . Spurs sit third in their Europa League group and host Greek Super League side Asteras Tripolis on Thursday. They slipped to ninth in the Barclays Premier League with a 4-1 defeat at Manchester City on Saturday. But, despite winning just two of their last nine games, they are still only two points away from the Champions League places. It is by no means a crisis. The worry, perhaps, is that key personnel are struggling to deliver. Roberto Soldado, a £26million striker with just six goals in 31 league appearances, had his penalty saved by Joe Hart as he made his first league start of the season against City, while Emmanuel Adebayor has scored once this campaign. Add defensive frailties in the big games - they have also lost 3-0 at home to Liverpool - and it is easy to see why Spurs have the worst goal difference in the top half of the table. Pochettino conceded that results were a concern, but was looking at the bigger picture. ‘We need to start scoring goals but we have confidence in our strikers,’ he said. ‘We made a lot of changes at the beginning of the season with our squad and had to implement a different philosophy on the group. England winger Andros Townsend (centre) jokes with his Tottenham Hotspur team-mates during training . Townsend (centre) and Aaron Lennon train ahead of Tottenham's important Europa League clash . ‘The same happened at Southampton when we arrived. Maybe in four or five months we will have changed the mentality. We need time, then we are confident we will show more consistency.’ Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has a reputation for being quick to press the ‘manager eject’ button, with 10 different managers passing through White Hart Lane during his 13-year tenure so far. But Pochettino insisted he and the board were on the same page. ‘When they offered me the job Daniel was very clear with me and explained a little bit how we need to move the club on,’ he said. ‘We agreed - we want to build something special at Tottenham, different but better than before.’ The building process continues this evening as Spurs host Asteras Tripolis, who top Group C after beating Partizan Belgrade in the last game and holding Besiktas to a draw. Spurs drew both their previous matches. Harry Kane could make another European appearance for Tottenham against Asteras Tripolis . The Greeks’ squad contains seven Argentines, including strikers Facundo Parra and Pablo Mazza. And Pochettino, a former Argentina international, knows how dangerous his countrymen can be. ‘It is a very good team,’ said Pochettino. ‘I know a lot about the Argentinians and they are very good. They are offensive, brave and we expect a tough game.’ Left back Ben Davies, who has found first team football hard to come by since arriving from Swansea in the summer, is expected to start. Davies, 21, said he would not throw his toys out of the pram as he competes with Danny Rose for a starting spot at Spurs. Pochettino was coy about whether Davies would soon be his first choice. ‘He’s still young,’ he said. ‘We knew when we signed him what his potential is but it is competition for Danny Rose. ‘I have a strong squad but we need to put the players on the pitch who can get three points (on Thursday). It’s a very important game.’ Tottenham players step out at their training ground and prepare for a session ahead of the Europa League .","Tottenham Hotspur face Asteras Tripolis in Europa League on Thursday .

"Erik Lamela cost Tottenham £30million. If his goal against Asteras Tripoli on Thursday night is replayed 30 million times, it still wouldn't be enough. When his rabona strike from the edge of the area flew past Tomas Kosicky, those at White Hart Lane had to double-take. Thank God for television replays; because one particular piece of footage will be shown again, and again, and again. CLICK HERE for the full match report from White Hart Lane. Host commentator . And breathe.... what a crazy ending at White Hart Lane. Spurs' first victory in the tournament moves them up to second in their group. Tottenham would be top on goal difference if it wasn't for Kane's error as Besiktas beat Partizan Belgrade 4-0 in the other match. Join Sportsmail again for matchday four of the Europa League on November 6. What a game at White Hart Lane. Lloris is sent off for bringing Tsokanis down, Harry Kane goes in goal to a huge ovation from the Spurs fans, then fumbles Jeronimo (Geronimoooo!) Barrales' free-kick into the net. The whole crowd gives another standing ovation. Crazy, crazy game. The referee brings an end to an eventful match at White Hart Lane. Harry Kane will hit the headlines for his hat-trick and his error to allow Asteras' pull back a consolation when in goal. Despite Kane's heroics undoubtedly the magic moment of the match came from Lamela and his first half 'rabona' strike. That was something special. The sight of Kane in goal has given the Greek side a boost as they all eye-up the following free kick on the edge of the box. Barrales shoots low and hard and the ball squirms under Kane's grasp, before trickling into the bottom corner for a comical goal. An unfortunate ending to Kane's night but he'll still be taking the match ball home. Tottenham's high line is made to pay at last. Hugo Lloris is shown a straight red card for his last man challenge. Hat-trick hero Kane has gone in goal with Spurs having made all their substitutes... What a night for this young man as he completes his hat-trick. Fazio whips in a cross and the striker was on hand to head home. Andros Townsend is replaced by Aaron Lennon. 80 mins: Asteras make a change with Parra replaced by Nicolas Fernandez. In among the celebrations Tottenham boss Pochettino brings off Lamela who is replaced by Christian Eriksen. Lamela has put in a display of quality for Spurs tonight and will be delighted with his performance. Nacir Chadli comes on for Emmanuel Adebayor. A night of superlatives at White Hart Lane. Lamela's rabona, his blistering second, Kane's fantastic finish and to top it all off, a world class save from Hugo Lloris. Spurs fans who stayed at home have missed out. Game over. Moussa Dembele fires a low left-footed strike which Kosicky can only spill into the path of Kane who taps home. Spurs have been clinical tonight. 73 mins: The Greek outfit make their first substitute of the match with Jeronimo Barrales replacing Rolle in a like-for-like switch in attack. 68 mins: Asteras have been threatening all match and would have pulled one back but for the brilliance of Lloris in the Tottenham goalkeeper. Martin Rolle plays a beautifulyl dinked ball into the path of Fernando Usero who's brilliant acrobatic effort is tipped behind for a corner. The scoreline flatters Spurs as the hosts have created a few chances of their own. He really is the man of the moment right now. Lamela evades the tackle of three or four players before attempting a lay-off inside the box. His attempted pass is blocked and ricochets up in the air. Instinctively he hits a crisp first-time volley that beats Kosicky at his near post. Another fantastic goal from Lamela. 60 mins: For their defensive worries, Tottenham are still looking menancing going forward and create another chance this time through Kane who sees his shot parried away by Kosicky in the Asteras goal. 58mins: Tottenham's high line is being brutally being exposed by the visitors at the moment. The Greek outfit are breaking with pace and sooner or later they may make Spurs pay. This game isn't over yet. 48 mins: Right on cue Tottenham's No 11 nearly delivers. Townsend's deep cross finds Adebayor who heads down into the path of Lamela but his strike is blocked for a corner. We're back underway in north London. Will there be some more Lamela magic? Besiktas are 2-0 up away to Partizan Belgrade. As things stand the Turkish side are top of the group on goal difference ahead of Spurs - with both sides on five points from three games. The referee brings a close to a dominant first half display by Tottenham. Harry Kane's great opener won't be spoken about by the White Hart Lane faithful - with all the talk going towards Lamela's stunning second. A real 'I was there' moment for those inside the ground. 38 mins: Harry Kane is at the heart of the majority of everything that Spurs are doing well. The striker wins a tackle and lays off a pass into Townsend who curls a left-footed strike a yard outside the post from long range. 35 mins: First caution of the night goes to Asteras defender Thanasis Panteliadis who unceremonisly chops down Andros Townsend in the middle of the pitch. Unbelievable goal by Erik Lamela. A rabona (if you don't know what that is, watch one of the 1,375,885 YouTube videos) from 20 yards, perfectly curled past the curiously named Tomas Kosicky in the Asteras net. It's gone quiet again at White Hart Lane, I don't think anyone can quite believe it... There's a damp atmosphere at White Hart Lane tonight. Understandably. If ever there was an example of why the Champions League is better than the Europa League, this is it. Well, apart from that goal from Lamela! What. A. Goal. Erik Lamela has scored one of the goals of the season across the planet. The ball falls to the Argentina international on the edge of the box on his weaker right foot. Instead of hitting it with his right, the midfielder instead chooses to perform a 'rabona' and wrap his left foot around the ball. The end result? A truly stunning strike that bends into the far corner. Pochettino motionless. Fantastic goal. The reason why Tottenham failed to beat Besiktas was to due to defensive lapses and it appears they haven't learned from their mistakes. Forward Facundo Parra delightfully collects a pass inside the Tottenham box. His first effort is brilliantly stopped by Hugo Lloris in goal before his second effort is thrwated once more. A warning sign for Spurs. 23 mins: Spurs nearly double their advantage. Etienne Capoue is played through by Kane but the France midfielder is unable to adjust his feet in time and clear the danger Asteras Tripolis. 18 mins: The goal has given Tottenham a firm grip on the game. The home fans are in full voice. 13 mins: He scored Tottenham's opener against Besiktas in their last Europa League match at White Hart Lane and he's done it again. Harry Kane picks up the ball from the 25 yards out and fires a low right-footed strike into the bottom corner. A brilliant strike from the young striker. Tottenham looking good so far. Here at White Hart Lane the fans haven't exactly turned out in force for this crucial clash… it looks about 70 per cent capacity. Mauricio Pochettino has made six changes to the side that lost 4-1 to Manchester City. Thats a grand total of 42 players in Spurs' five Europa League games so far. 5 mins: Asteras Tripolis sit top of Group C and show a glimpse of why. Following a Tottenham free-kick the champions break and a long pass finds Pablo Mazza who takes a touch before dragging a shot wide. Tottenham have started well but need to be on their guard if they are to record their first victory of the tournament. Tottenham get proceedings underway. Game on. Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham Hotspur can expect to win major silverware within two years but warned of suffering in store in the meantime.

"Javier Hernandez is adamant Real Madrid will not be fazed by the cauldron-like atmosphere that will await them at Anfield when they face Liverpool. The Champions League holders travel to Merseyside for their Group B clash on Wednesday night with a 100 per cent record in Europe. Liverpool's famous red-hot Anfield atmosphere has played a major part in famous European nights before but Hernandez believes the Spanish giants won't be intimidated by the reception they will face. Real Madrid's Javier Hernandez believes they won't be intimidated by Liverpool's Anfield atmosphere . The Mexico striker, who is on a season-long loan from Liverpool's arch-rivals Manchester United, has experienced Anfield and is confident his new team-mates will quickly adapt to it, too. 'Anfield will not intimidate us.' Hernandez said. 'I have played at Anfield before, and they do have a special atmosphere. With Real Madrid coming that atmosphere will be ever more special, but the atmosphere will not intimidate us. We have World Cup winners and Champions League winners in our team - big games and big atmospheres do not affect this club. 'I want to do well and win at Anfield, but I don't have anything to prove. I did not get the chances I wanted at Manchester United, but I am getting them at Real Madrid and I am scoring goals. If you prove yourself at Real Madrid, it shows you are capable of doing it anywhere.' Hernandez (centre) will be hoping to feature for Real in their Champions League clash against Liverpool . Hernandez's sentiments have been echoed by Real team-mate Isco, who thinks Liverpool are in for a torrid night against Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo is the current Ballon d'Or holder and has started this season in electrifying fashion, scoring 19 goals in 12 appearances for the Bernabeu outfit this season and Isco believes no club in the world can handle him at present. 'There is no player or no team that can stop Ronaldo at the moment,' he said. 'The form he is in is not of this world. He doesn't approach games thinking he will score, he approaches them knowing he will score. Cristiano Ronaldo will provide Liverpool's biggest threat in Wednesday Group B encounter . 'I am sure Liverpool will not be an easy place to go and play, but I know that it will not phase Ronaldo. 'They are probably preparing for the threat of him, but there is no preparation possible. If they play close to him he will beat them, if they put two players on him they will beat him, there is nothing you can do to stop him.' Despite the obvious threat of Ronaldo, Real are also aware of the dangers the hosts possess - especially in the shape of captain Steven Gerrard. Former Real star, and now coach of their B team, Zinedine Zidane describes the former England captain as 'one of the finest midfielders of the last 10 years' and believes stopping the 34-year-old is key if the Spanish giants are to leave Anfield with at least a point. Ronaldo (left) has scored a devastating 19 goals in 12 appearances for the Spanish giants so far . 'I would not pay any attention to the critics who say that Gerrard is finished,' said Zinedine. 'He has been one of the finest midfield players of the last 10 years. 'He knows his own body and will know he wont be able to run around like he did when he was 26, but he has more than enough intelligence to adapt his game - and sit back and control things from a deeper position. 'I still look at him as player who can control the game for Liverpool - so we have to try and stop the threat of him on Wednesday.'

"Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale has been ruled out of the season's first Clasico against Barcelona. Manager Carlo Ancelotti broke the news ahead of Wednesday night's Champions League clash with Liverpool which the Welshman misses with a buttock muscle injury. 'We are working hard to get him (Bale) fit but he is not available at Anfield and not available for Saturday,' said Ancelotti. 'We are working hard on his recuperation.'

The absence of Bale will be a blow to Madrid who scored a spectacular winning goal against Barcelona in last season's Copa del Rey. Ancelotti had been criticised for naming Bale as an unused sub against Levante in La Liga at the weekend but the Italian hit back: 'He travelled to Valencia (Levante's city) because we didn't think it was anything too much to worry about, just a slight strain. 'It was only when he got to Valencia and had a scan that we realised the situation.' Ancelotti was irritated however by further questions about El Clasico at his pre-match Champions League press conference at Anfield. 'It is very strange when you have this big match,' he grimaced. The Italian said he was excited about the game, and in particular the stunning form of Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 19 times in 12 matches in all competitions for the reigning European champions. 'You are going to see a spectacular encounter, everything that is good in football,' he said. 'It will be dynamic. 'Our player Cristiano (Ronaldo) is in a fantastic moment. It is impossible for him to do better. He is really focused on doing his best to continue.' Ancelotti said it was impossible for Cristiano Ronaldo to play any better than he has so far this season . Ancelotti tweeted a picture from the Anfield tunnel saying it was an honour to play in 'a legendary stadium' Even without Bale, Ancelotti says Real Madrid will stay true to their traditions with Ronaldo, Luka Modric, Isco and James Rodriguez in the team. 'I would think our tactics and philosophy are pretty much the same if we are at home or away. We try to control the ball and possession of the ball with the qualiy of the players we have,' he said. Ancelotti said he was honoured to play at the ground where Bob Paisley, the only other man to win three Champions Leagues, was manager.

Gareth Bale will miss Real Madrid's game with Liverpool and their Clasico clash with Barcelona on Saturday . Former Malaga midfielder Isco (right), pictured in action against Levante, looks set to replace Bale at Anfield . 'Gareth Bale is very important for us because he has a fantastic quality in every sense,' Ancelotti said. 'We have to replace him. We have a fantastic squad so we have to replace him.

"Real Madrid continued their 100 per cent start to this season's Champions League  with a one-sided victory at Liverpool on Wednesday night. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a Karim Benzema double gave the current tournament holders a 3-0 lead at half-time which they didn't look back from. For Liverpool, the result was a nightmare which saw £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli substituted at half-time after a dire performance. Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives  his verdict on how the players performed. Liverpool (4-3-3) Simon Mignolet - 5.5 . Failed to convince when coming for crosses and found himself embarrassed by Pepe’s prod for Benzema’s second. Atoned somewhat with super save when one-on-one with Ronaldo. Simon Mignolet failed to convince once more when trying to dealing with crosses inside his box . Glen Johnson - 4.5 . Allowed Ronaldo the freedom of Liverpool’s half at one point in the opening period by advancing too far forward and failed to get close to Benzema for his header. Martin Skrtel - 5 . Errantly tried to shepherd the ball back to Mignolet when it bounced off Pepe for the third goal and crashed into the hoardings when Benzema smartly side-stepped his sliding tackle by the touchline. Dejan Lovren - 5.5 . Being caught out by a sublime pass from James is no disgrace but appeared an uncertain presence . Alberto Moreno - 5.5 . Attacking thrusts were limited and defensively James had the beating of him. Over-stretched to cut out Benzema’s pass that set up Ronaldo in the second half. Alberto Moreno (right) struggled against James Rodriguez (left) throughout their battle at Anfield . Jordan Henderson - 5.5 . Tried to get physical with Ronaldo straight out the traps with a bodycheck. But failed to translate his energy into effective action. Steven Gerrard - 5 . Swamped by Real’s carousel of midfield passers. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric just a class apart. Tried to unleash Liverpool’s attackers with one swift pass forward but failed each time. Joe Allen - 6 . Produced a fine shot from 18 yards that whistled narrowly past the post, probably via a deflection from the fingertips of Casillas. A very good show given this was his first start since September 9. Joe Allen (left) impressed in his first Liverpool start since September 9 due to injury . Raheem Sterling - 6.5 . Willing runner all evening and Liverpool’s brightest player. No tired limbs here. Tested Casillas with a dipping shot in the second half. Mario Balotelli - 4.5 . Offered little as an attacking presence and sulked when things did not go his way. Time looks nigh for him to start on the bench. Philippe Coutinho - 6 . Went closest for Liverpool with a crisp shot from outside the box that smacked the post. But failed to dazzle like he can. Mario Balotelli (right) was woeful for the Reds up front and was substituted at half-time as a result . Substitutes . Adam Lallana - 6.5 (for Balotelli 45’) Lallana was silvery when he came on and did more than Balotelli in his first 10 minutes. Lazar Markovic - 6 (for Coutinho 67’), Emre Can - 6 (for Henderson 67’) Manager . Brendan Rodgers - 6 . Held faith with Balotelli but went unrewarded. Must consider altering tactics now. Credit for picking Allen, at least. Brendan Rodgers' faith in starting Mario Balotelli was unrewarded as the striker provided a woeful display . Real Madrid (4-4-2) Iker Casillas - 6.5 . Beat away Gerrard’s long-range shot in the first half but then looked shaky from the Liverpool captain’s corner, juggling the ball. Appeared to make a finger-tip save from Allen’s effort but was not recognised by officials. Alvaro Arbeloa - 6.5 . Got in an early shove on Sterling to mark his presence and was consistent. Brought ball out of defence confidently. Raphael Varane - 7 . Young centre-back snuffed out danger like a defender 10 years his senior. Never looked ruffled. Pepe - 7 . Real determination from Real’s nuisance-in-chief to reach the ball for Benzema’s second ahead of Liverpool’s players and was untroubled in the main by the hosts' attack, neatly dispossessing Sterling at one point. Pepe (left) was largely untroubled by Liverpool and did well to help create Karim Benzema's second goal . Marcelo - 7.5 . Offered a proper attacking outlet with bursts forward to pin back Johnson. Defended soundly too, which sometimes isn’t the case. James Rodriguez - 8 . Simply beautiful pass to set up Ronaldo and displayed the touches that made him one of the star’s of the World Cup for Colombia. Even after a nasty cut to his face. Toni Kroos - 8.5 . Appeared effortless as he conducted the Real midfield with pass after pass. Dictated the flow of the game from the first minute. Toni Kroos (left) bossed the midfield for Real, dictating the tempo with his array of passing . Luka Modric - 7.5 . Helped strangle the life out of Liverpool by keeping attacks flowing and tempo high. A diamond player. Isco - 7.5 . Starting because of injury to Gareth Bale, he showed he is more than just a stand-in. Neat dribbles down the left and retained the ball consummately. Karim Benzema - 9 - STAR MAN . Took his first with a brilliant header and showed striker’s instincts by side-footing second inside six-yard box. Broke at pace time and again. Benzema  doubled Real's advantage with a brilliant looping header to cap off a brilliant display . Cristiano Ronaldo - 8.5 . Celebrated his goal like a man who knew he would score. Caressed the ball into the back of the net and was a constant menace with darting runs. Substitutes . Sami Khedira - N/A (for Ronaldo 75’), Asier Illarramendi- N/A (for Kroos 82’) All came on when the match was won and barely broke a sweat. Cristiano Ronaldo was a constant menace throughout the match and set the tone by scoring Real's opener . Manager . Carlo Ancelotti - 8 . Sent his gilded crop out with ferocity and little sympathy. Will be pleased he saw out a 3-0 half-time lead against Liverpool. Referee . Nicola Rizzoli - 7 . Had no major decisions to make and correctly booked Kroos for a crude bodycheck on Sterling.

"Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool fans have promised him another famed European night at Anfield this evening. The Liverpool manager savoured the club's return to Champions League football after a five year absence with a 2-1 win against Ludogorets Razgrad last month. Yet tonight, when Liverpool take on European champions Real Madrid, Kopites have told Rodgers they will ramp up the atmosphere once again in the hope of inspiring his underdogs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool host Real in European epic . Liverpool fans have a history of producing a brilliant atmosphere at Anfield on Champions League nights . Anfield welcomed back Europe's premier club competition with a clash against Ludogorets . 'The fans will be massive against Madrid,' Rodgers told the club's official website. 'I remember talking to a couple of fans a few weeks back and haven't forgotten what they said. They told me: ''Just wait until you see the Real Madrid game''. 'So I've bore that in mind ever since and I know it's going to be a special night for them. It's a reward for them for their loyalty and the patience that they've shown with the team over the last number of years.' Despite a 3-2 win at QPR on Sunday, Liverpool have been holding inquests about their form and fortunate nature of their victory but the Liverpool boss remains upbeat. 'Sometimes it's just about taking a step back. Last night I had a think about where we were when I came in and then realised that in a couple of nights' time we would be playing in the Champions League against Real Madrid. We're joint-fourth in the league and we haven't been near our form yet. There's lots to be positive about.' Brendan Rodgers is primed for another stunning atmosphere as Liverpool welcome Real Madrid to Anfield . Liverpool's opponents trained at a weather-beaten Anfield on Tuesday night, shortly after Rodgers' players were put through their paces. 'You have to be mindful that they are arguably the best attack in world football at the moment, so you can't go gung-ho, that's for sure,' said Rodgers. 'On the counter-attack they are absolutely clinical. We've seen that over the course of the last year or so. But the confidence that a victory over a team such as Real Madrid can give you would be great. For us it's important because of the points - we want to qualify from the group stages.' Rodgers hopes to have Lucas Leiva available for selection but confirmed that Mamadou Sakho will play no part in the fixture. 'We've obviously a couple of niggles from the game at the weekend but we'll see how that is,' said Rodgers. 'Lucas Leiva was out for the weekend, so we're hoping he'll be available for [Madrid].

"Gary Cahill has warned Chelsea's rivals that Didier Drogba is back to his best after scoring three goals in the last three games for the Premier League title hopefuls. The England defender also believes Diego Costa will find it hard to force his way back into Jose Mourinho's side at Stamford Bridge. Drogba, 36, scored in Chelsea's narrow 2-1 win at Shrewsbury on Tuesday to fire them into the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup and team-mate Cahill believes the Ivory Coast star is on top form after his summer return following two years away. Didier Drogba looks to the skies after scoring Chelsea's second goal in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday . Drogba scored a vital goal for the Blues against rivals Manchester United last week . He said: 'In the last two games he is fully fit now, he's looking sharp and dangerous - exactly like he was when he went. He was massive for us on Tuesday and he got a vital goal. 'Who knows how long he can go on for? That's for the club and Didier to decide but at this moment we've started the season well and he's been a big part in that. 'What a character he is off the pitch. Obviously Diego is playing the majority of the games but Didier is getting back to match sharpness. Loic (Remy) scored but came off so to get them all back fit and scoring goals is vital for us.' Drogba has scored 160 goals in two spells for Chelsea and won the league three times, four FA Cups and the Champions League in 2012 before he left that year. Drogba's goal against Shrewsbury was vital in helping Jose Mourinho's side progress . Drogba looked delighted to net a goal against Louis van Gaal's United at Old Trafford last Sunday . Costa is expected to be fit for Saturday's Premier League visit of QPR after suffering with a virus and hamstring and groin problems, but Cahill insisted the nine-goal hitman is not guaranteed his place back following Drogba's recent form. The centre-back said: 'There are options, not just up front but all over the pitch. 'We have turned up on Tuesday with some fresh legs and some of the lads who played (at Manchester United on Sunday) and we knew it was going to be a tough game but we grafted and showed character and got the right result in the end.'

But Cahill said the leaders must not take three points for granted against second-bottom QPR. 'We have a chance to get the right result and hopefully sit back and enjoy Sunday but it's never easy, you have to prepare right, rest up and make sure we're ready,' he said. 'The onus is on us to be on the front foot, we need to prepare well and make sure we're fully focused. 'Last season we struggled at times against teams people thought we were going to beat. It's never as easy as that.'","Didier Drogba scored Chelsea's first of two goals against Shrewsbury .

"Chelsea's early season form may have led to comparisons with the Arsenal 'Invincibles' side, but Gary Neville believes they aren't even as good as the Chelsea side from 10 years ago. Jose Mourinho's side are currently four points clear at the top of the Premier League, but after letting leads slip against both Manchester City and United, their killer instinct has been called into question. 'If a team are going to be playing for a 1-0 then you better see it out,' Neville said on Monday Night Football. 'When I saw Jose Mourinho two weeks ago he talked about the 2005 (Chelsea) team and (compared) the team he had then to the team he has now and he said the killer instinct's missing. Chelsea have dropped more points from winning positions this season than they did in the whole of 2004/05 . Chelsea took the lead against both Manchester United and Manchester City, but drew both matches . 'When I look at the statistics they are staggering - 28 times they (the 2004/05 team) scored first (in Premier League matches), 27 the season after and they only dropped two and four points (respectively). 'This team this season, even though they're at a really high level, have scored first seven times and already dropped four points. They've got to get to that next level.' 'When (Manchester) City went down to 10 men I thought Chelsea let them off the hook and yesterday at 1-0 up I think Chelsea let United off the hook. 'There's a mentality shift.

That can't be an instruction from the manager. That's a shift in the players. 'Yesterday (against Manchester United) they went from 64 per cent (possession before scoring) to 45 per cent (after scoring). They switch off. 'This is not the manager changing it.

"There have been times during Rob Green’s career as the last line of defence when he has had a raw deal. Being made the scapegoat for a mistake that allowed Clint Dempsey to equalise for the USA in England’s opening World Cup fixture in South Africa four years ago is one of them. Returning to the QPR team, to play behind a defence as nervy as new born kittens, is another. Aston Villa at home was the ultimate anxiety test. QPR keeper Rob Green punches the ball clear during the win over Aston Villa on Monday night . Green makes a save from Christian Benteke of Aston Villa at Loftus Road . Green comes out of his box to clear the ball as Yun Suk-Young holds off Gabriel Agbonlahor . Last weekend, when Alex McCarthy deputised for QPR’s first-choice keeper against Liverpool, they looked lost in the big wide world of the Barclays Premier League. Poor McCarthy conceded three. Green’s double save here, brilliantly denying Tom Cleverley’s long ranger in the 80th minute and smothering the rebound from Ciaran Clark, makes west London feel a whole lot better. Here, in a match Rangers simply had to win to prevent chairman Tony Fernandes pulling the trigger on Harry Redknapp, the former England keeper offered composure and class. Goodness knows they needed it. In the first half especially, for all that Richard Dunne bullied Christian Benteke, QPR’s defence played as though the ball was on fire whenever it came near them. Even the match winner, Charlie Austin, on defensive duties at set pieces, launched a couple of unnecessary balls high into the stands. Fortunately, when he was presented with chances at the other end, he was clinical. His goals — he notched twice last night against this wretched Villa team — could keep Rangers in the top flight. At times, before Austin gave them the cushion of a two-goal advantage in the 69th minute, they played as if they had put their boots on the wrong feet. Steven Caulker of QPR, pictured tussling with Benteke, looked nervous in defence . Aston Villa's French defender Aly Cissokho is challenged by QPR's Chilean defender Mauricio Isla . This defence, comprising left back Yun Suk-young, central defenders Steven Caulker and Dunne, plus right back Mauricio Isla, still needs working on. If their first touch was bad, their second was usually a tackle. To think that Caulker was an England international, briefly, when he made his debut against Sweden at the Friends Arena in November 2012. He even scored. This is a different player, someone who has been shifted around a couple of lower-end Premier League clubs since he was allowed to leave Tottenham by Andre Villas-Boas. Caulker looked a bag of nerves before Austin’s soothing opener, afraid to influence the game at a stage in his career when he should be shouting the odds in this QPR team. He steadied himself in the second half, but QPR were 2-0 ahead with 21 minutes left on the clock by then. Villa barely posed a threat. Redknapp has made some big calls of late, jettisoning Rio Ferdinand after the team’s failure to get to grips with the 3-5-2 formation used at the start of the season. Everything is changing. This team conceded 18 goals in the League before Aston Villa’s arrival at Loftus Road and this defence needed surgery. Villa striker Agbonlahor chases QPR's' Yun Suk-young under the floodlights in the capital . Richard Dunne stretches to challenge Belgium international Benteke . Green made some decent saves, particularly in the first half when he got down quickly to save from Carlos Sanchez when the Villa midfielder plucked the ball out of the sky. At least this is a start, building from the back as Redknapp restructures a team with limited ambitions. Staying in the Premier League is achievable and Rangers’ manager has done it before, miraculously, with Portsmouth back in 2006. Next up for Rangers is Chelsea, a short journey across town to Stamford Bridge and a date with the League leaders on Saturday afternoon. Good luck with that. A couple of seasons ago, when Redknapp had replaced Mark Hughes as manager of this team, they went to Chelsea and famously came away with a 1-0 win. Shaun Wright-Phillips scored the only goal. The renaissance began here and this QPR team will come to rely on Green in the turbulent weeks and months ahead. Without him, there would be no defence for this QPR team.

"Diego Costa believes top sides cannot leave the smallest stone unturned in football nowadays if they are to win matches. The Chelsea striker has started his career at Stamford Bridge with a bang scoring nine goals in as many appearances since his £32million switch from Atletico Madrid in the summer. Costa's form has been mirrored by the Blues' start to the season that sees them leading the Premier League by four points after nine games. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho praises Diego Costa's incredible goal record (archive) Diego Costa has hailed Chelsea's attention to detail before matches as a key reason to their success . Costa has scored nine goals in as many appearances for the Blues since joining the club in the summer . The Stamford Bridge outfit also sit top of Group G in the UEFA Champions League and Costa has pinpointed their success to the level of detail the squad are prepared for before matches. 'Top teams nowadays are pretty much on a level playing field and you need to be super careful about every tiny detail of the contest because any single one of them could make the difference.' he told the latest Champions League Magazine. 'Chelsea is packed full of skilful players and if those of us up front become the first line of defence and help protect the rest of the team, then we are doing an important job,' he added. Diego Costa was speaking to latest issue of the Champions League Magazine which is on sale now . 'Since I was a kid I've always had a fierce hunger for victory inside me. I've always hated losing. 'Defeat can be useful for you if - and only if - you draw important lessons from it. My hunger to win is one of my fundamental assets. If one day I lose that desire then I'll not be useful any more.' The 26-year-old enjoyed a stellar campaign at Atletico last season helping the club lift their first La Liga title in 18 years. Costa played an integral part in Diego Simeone's side scoring 35 goals in all competitions last season as the club  also finished runners-up in the Champions League to bitter rivals Real Madrid. Despite this though, Costa is happy with his decision to move to Chelsea this summer - revealing that playing in the Premier League was something he had always wanted to try. 'I was extremely happy at Atletico and the last year when we achieved so much was the best year of my career as a footballer. 'However, you always try to improve your life. The opportunity to join this tremendously important club came and while Atleti is a great team, this was a different league, one I'd always wanted to try. 'People always used to say that my game would fit the Premier League perfectly and so the opportunity to sign for an extremely famous club like Chelsea made me super-excited. 'I have to keep on working hard. I still have many years ahead of me in my career so I hope I will be able to play in another Champions League final - to have another opportunity to win this competition.'

"Swansea boss Garry Monk was disappointed with referee Michael Oliver's decision to award the hosts their first-half penalty which changed the game, calling the decision a 'disgrace' as Stoke won 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium. With just over 10 minutes of the first half to go, Stoke's Ryan Shawcross conceded a penalty by bringing down Wilfried Bony and the Ivory Coast striker made no mistake as he slotted the ball past Asmir Begovic into the bottom right corner. Their lead did not last long as - nine minutes later - the Potters were awarded a penalty, with Angel Rangel challenging Victor Moses, but it looked as if the Nigerian went down easily.

Jonathan Walters nodded his powerful header home from substitute Oussama Assaidi's cross as Stoke went ahead for the first time deep into the second half and the Swans never found a way back despite some late pressure. On the two penalty decisions, Monk said: 'The first - it was a penalty, I've watched it back. Shawcross I think it is that has his hands all over Bony and twists him around and knocks him, pulls Bony to the ground - so for me that's a penalty. 'The penalty against is a disgrace. It's a disgraceful decision. Not in a million years is it a penalty and the problem we'll have with it now is a lot of games we're having this season a match-changing decision is going against us constantly and I don't see anything being done about it. 'I've spoke to the referees about it and the association about it and I don't hear anything from (referee chief) Mike Riley coming back to me at all, which I find poor leadership and the whole thing is becoming to mount up now which is becoming a very worrying situation. Swansea manager Garry Monk called the decisions a disgrace as his side failed to win again . 'It's happening a lot. We're having a lot of decisions going against us. Match-changing decsions and it's a disgraceful decision because not in a million years - I looked straight at their bench and even they (Stoke) couldn't believe it. 'He (Victor Moses) should be punished for diving, it's a clear dive which is cheating. He's cheated the ref and then the ref's cheated us for giving the decision that never was. 'I just think it's a poor, poor decision and it's cost us at a vital time where we're just coming up to half-time - we should have been coming in 1-0 up and it's a different game then, a different game plan for us second half.' He added: 'We have talked about being clinical and coming to a place like this the chances wouldn't be flowing so the very good chances that we had should have been goals but unfortunately we couldn't take them.' Man of the match Charlie Adam was delighted as Stoke returned to winning ways. He told Sky Sports 1: 'I think it was (well deserved). Once we got a grip on the game. Wilfried Bony caused us a couple of problems during the game in the first half. Walters was clearly delighted with his impact as Stoke held out against some late pressure from Swansea . 'There were too many balls going to his feet and he was able to turn and he and (Gylfi Sigurdsson) have managed to link up really well this year and we noticed that in the video. And once we got to grips with that and in the end I thought we desreved the victory. 'We stopped the ball getting to his feet... when you've got that and the movement they've got with people like Sigurdsson and (Nathan) Dyer on one side and (Wayne) Routledge on the other it's difficult to defend, and we had a tough time of it. 'But once we got to grips with it we dominated the second part of the game and Walters came on and won it for us.'

"Manuel Pellegrini insists that a traumatic week of international football will not affect his Manchester City stars against Tottenham on Saturday. Aleksandar Kolarov and Matija Nastasic were caught up in the politically-fuelled brawl that caused the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania to be abandoned, while Yaya Toure flew back from West Africa on a private jet after playing for Ivory Coast against DR Congo amid growing concerns over the Ebola crisis. City would not confirm whether Toure has been screened for the deadly virus, but Pellegrini revealed that the powerhouse midfielder is in the squad to face Spurs.

I don’t know if he was screened but for the moment he’s OK.’ On the trouble in Belgrade, Pellegrini added: ‘They (Kolarov and Nastasic) both came back on Thursday. Of course it was not a good experience for them. It’s very difficult to be involved in those kinds of incidents. We will see what happens in the future, but it was a very bad thing for football. In both a political sense and football sense. ‘Of course it is not easy to see which is the best starting 11 when you have so many players arriving on different days during the week. Tomorrow we will decide. Yaya arrived yesterday with Kolarov and Nastasic, other players arrived on Wednesday and some on Tuesday. But all of them are in the squad list.’ Eliaquim Mangala (left) heads out to training at the Etihad Stadium with team-mate Bacary Sagna . Yaya Toure is in contention for Saturday after returning from international duty with Ivory Coast .

City fly out on Sunday and must beat the Russians home and away to have a realistic chance of reaching the knockout stages. Pellegrini is trying to focus on keeping pace with leaders Chelsea, while his team also defend the Capital One Cup against Newcastle at the end of the month. ‘We know that from now until the next international break we have to play seven games in three different competitions,’ he said. ‘We have four games in the Premier League, and it is very important for us to try and recover points from Chelsea. James Milner, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero and Aleksandar Kolarov were all in action on Friday .

We will try to win it and after we will see which is the best team to try and win the next final.’ City beat Spurs 11-1 on aggregate in the league last season, but Pellegrini added: ‘I’m sure it is a different Tottenham.

"South Africa is reluctant to step in as a last-minute host for next year's Africa Cup of Nations after it emerged that Morocco wants to postpone or move the tournament because of fears over the spread of the Ebola epidemic. The South African sport ministry is also wary of the Ebola virus and cited unplanned staging costs as a reason for not wanting to host the tournament, which is scheduled to start on January 17. 'There are just too many factors to consider for South Africa,' the country's department of sport and recreation said in a statement on Friday. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup but is reluctant to step in as hosts for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations . The Moroccan Football Federation wrote to the Confederation of African Football (CAF)  to outline its concern that hundreds of thousands of fans travelling into the country from Ebola-affected areas could exacerbate the spread of the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people across west Africa. Although Morocco has not officially refused to host the finals, the country's authorities have made the case to CAF that the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone warrants either postponing the tournament or moving it to another country. It is unlikely that any of those three countries will qualify for the tournament. In response to Morocco's concerns,  CAF have reportedly approached seven nations including Ghana and South Africa about hosting the tournament, which is scheduled to start on January 17. The Africa Cup of Nations is under threat due to host nation Morocco's fears about the Ebola virus . The South African sports ministry stressed it had not yet been officially asked by the South African Football Association to consider hosting the tournament, but it moved quickly to rule itself out of the running. A statement  said the cost of an unplanned hosting in just three months was its 'major concern,' but Ebola was a factor. 'The tournament ... may also pose a challenge on how we can grapple with the Ebola challenge engulfing the continent at the moment.' The South African sport ministry is wary of the Ebola outbreak and the cost of hosting the competition . SAFA President Danny Jordaan added: 'We must all take care of this pandemic and put strict measures in place.' Sudan is another of the nations being touted as a possible replacement and a decision will be made when CAF's executive committee meets on November 2. The alternative option to finding a replacement host is postponing the competition, but that would cause havoc with the football calendar, which is jam-packed as it is. Ghana (wearing red), in action last week against Guinea, have also been approached to host the tournament . Ghanaian midfielder Michael Essien denied rumours this week that he had contracted the Ebola virus . In the event of CAF forcing Morocco to host the event and the country refusing, the governing body could ban the North Africans from the organisation's competitions. Mohamed Ouzzine, Morocco's sports minister, insisted the country's concerns were entirely sensible given the threat posed by the Ebola virus, and he stressed that his country was simply following the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO). 'Our concern is the health of Africa, and based on WHO reports and guidelines, we have to listen,' Ouzzine was quoted as saying in The Times. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is testing Cheick Tiote for Ebola after he played in Africa this week . 'Zero safety does not exist, but one has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast, bringing together our African brothers. But given the current Ebola situation, we don't think such a feast can take place as expected. 'We are talking about the Africa Cup of Nations where we are expecting between 200,000 and 400,000, even one million, spectators to converge in Morocco. I don't think there is any state or any country that has the necessary capabilities to monitor, check and control the current Ebola situation when faced with these numbers. This is our real problem. We don't have a problem with visiting teams, we have a problem with visitors.' Precautions are also being taken in England, with Newcastle manager Alan Pardew confirming that  that they have become the first Premier League club to screen African players returning from international duty for the virus. Papiss Cisse (R) is another player returning from Africa who will be monitored by Newcastle's medical staff . Pardew, when asked about Papiss Cisse, the Senegal striker, and Cheik Tiote, the Ivory Coast midfielder - who have played in Tunisia and the Democratic Republic of Congo respectively this week, as well as their own countries - stated that the Magpies would be 'naive not to have concerns' about the virus and advised other teams to take similar measures. 'We have a strategy for when they return and making sure they and their families are taken care of,' he said. 'They're essential to us and our doctor has looked into the problems that might arise and also protection for them, and making sure we do our very best to help them. It's something to be concerned about and we have to be on our guard.' Sunday Mba scored the only goal in Nigeria's 1-0 victory against Burkina Faso in the 2013 final .

"Gianluigi Buffon's landmark 500th Serie A appearance for Juventus ended on a sorry note as substitute Luca Antonini's last-gasp goal gave Genoa a 1-0 victory. The Italy goalkeeper has long been a mainstay at the Turin club following his move from Parma in 2001 and he had little to do at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris, but it would prove to be a miserable night for the 36-year-old, who was wearing a special armband to commemorate his milestone. Antonini, who was introduced from the bench in the 81st minute, bundled home in added-on time as Juve were made to pay for wasting a string of chances as they saw their unbeaten record and three-point lead at the Serie A summit disappear following Roma's 2-0 win over Cesena.

"It was Steven Gerrard who first sounded the warning: ‘We are playing against the best side in Europe and if we have two or three passengers it can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly’. The Liverpool skipper, it seems, is wise before the event. For if the Premier League’s bottom club, Queens Park Rangers, can expose their shortcomings, then the European champions could well humiliate. Just ask Ashley Cole and his Roma colleagues how brutal Bayern Munich were in their 7-1 demolition on Tuesday night, for the continent’s very best sides can be unforgiving if catching even illustrious opponents on an off-day. Cristiano Ronaldo gets reacquainted with the English weather as Real Madrid train at Anfield on Tuesday . Ronaldo has been in scintillating form so far this season, scoring 19 goals so far . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has warned Real Madrid could punish them if they don't perform . At Anfield, on Wednesday, a lacklustre Liverpool would be torn to pieces – they might even play well and be soundly beaten. For Real – and Cristiano Ronaldo – are not favourites to become the first team in history to defend a Champions League crown without very good reason. Already this season Ronaldo himself has provided us with 19 reminders as to his unrelenting hunger for goals and glory. Indeed, he has scored in every game he has played since La Liga kicked off in late August and is in the midst of a run of 16 goals in seven. With 15 in the league, he has two more than Liverpool have managed in total. Liverpool saw some weaknesses exposed in Sunday's match at QPR but they did emerge 3-2 winners . Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet reaches out in vain to try and prevent a Eduardo Vargas header creeping in . As Bayern Munich proved in their 7-1 thrashing of Roma, even European heavyweights can destroy each other . Carlo Ancelotti’s side have won their last seven on the spin – Levante and Athletic Bilbao demolished 5-0 in their last two – and any talk of an early-season stutter is now somewhat muted. Meanwhile, in the Premier League, Liverpool continue to stumble in a post-Luis Suarez existence. They have dropped 11 points already this season and recent victories over QPR and West Brom were not without their scares. Some supporters of a positive mindset may well point to Ronaldo’s record against them as reason for optimism, for in five appearances for Manchester United at Anfield he never once found the back of the net, scoring just twice in four fixtures at Old Trafford. Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid have won their last seven on the spin and their last two by a 5-0 scoreline . Cristiano Ronaldo has never scored at Anfield - he is pictured here celebrating John O'Shea's winner in 2007 . Ronaldo is within striking distance of Raul's Champions League goalscoring record . 1. Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) 71 goals . 2. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) 69 . 3. Lionel Messi (Barcelona) 69 . 4. Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Real Madrid) 56 . 5. Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) 50 . But the Portugal superstar only looks forward, not back, and his sights are now trained on yet another record – that of the Champions League greatest-ever goalscorer. The 29-year-old – with 69 strikes in Europe’s premier competition – needs just three more to surpass Real Madrid legend Raul. He will, of course, better that total, but with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi now tied with his Real counterpart following Tuesday’s goal against Ajax, Ronaldo will not want to afford his adversary the honour of taking the title before he does. To that end, a hat-trick in front of The Kop would just about do it. Gerrard wasn’t naming names when he guarded against Real’s ruthlessness, but we know who he meant. Liverpool: you have been warned.","Liverpool take on Real Madrid in Champions League on Wednesday .

"Jose Mourinho snorts in derision and dismisses with a smile the suggestion that it is the first cup he won as a manager. And Patrick Kluivert says he cannot even remember scoring the winning goal. But Barcelona's 3-0 win over Mataro in the Catalan Cup final of 2000 in the modest Olympic Stadium of Terrassa, nonetheless, remains a match of great significance for today's Manchester United and Chelsea managers. Though Mourinho has gone on to win more precious silverware, it was the first time he won something in charge of a team and he did so under the tutorship of his mentor and Sunday's opponent Louis van Gaal. Louis van Gaal (left) talks with Jose Mourinho (right) during their spell together at Barcelona . Mourinho (left) and Van Gaal (right) have gone on to become two of Europe's most successful managers . The pair, pictured at Barca, will be reunited when Manchester United host Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday . The relationship between Van Gaal and Mourinho has been much discussed, not least since Van Gaal paid a fulsome tribute to Mourinho last January at the Football Writers' Association tribute night. Mourinho was expecting the sack when Van Gaal was appointed as the new coach of Barca in 1999, with his previous mentor, Bobby Robson, being ushered into an upstairs role. Perhaps that explains why the 36-year-old Mourinho angrily took Barca directors to task in a swish restaurant where the arrangements were being discussed with Van Gaal, Robson and Mourinho. After all, he alone would be unemployed at the end of it all. Back then he was a mere appendage to Robson, dismissed internally as 'the translator'. But Van Gaal took note. 'I liked his loyalty and anger,' he said. 'And here was a man who already knew the club and could be useful.' When the call came, Mourinho was preparing to leave the club. 'He had expected the sack at that time and was astonished when Van Gaal offered him a role,' said a friend of Mourinho. 'I remember him ringing me up to say he had been offered the job and was absolutely stunned.' He was to become Van Gaal's most favoured assistant, even though a Dutchmen, Frans Hoek — still with Van Gaal at United as his goalkeeping coach — and Gerard van der Lem as well as Barca favourite, Jose Mari Bakero, were on his staff. 'Soon it was clear that he was the assistant Van Gaal trusted most, even though he hadn't previously known him,' said Mourinho's friend. 'For one thing, he had been there for years and knew the club and the players. And the players really liked him.' How Manchester United and Chelsea could line-up at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon . Mourinho greets Van Gaal before the 2010 Champions League final between Inter Milan and Bayern Munich . Van Gaal (left) made Mourinho (right) in charge of opposition scouting reports during their time at Barca . Mourinho and Van Gaal share a joke prior to a friendly between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich in 2010 . There was an unwitting role for former Newcastle winger Keith Gillespie, too. Van der Lem prepared scouting reports for Van Gaal and, when Barcelona drew Newcastle in the Champions League, Van der Lem was dismissive of Gillespie, telling Van Gaal and left-back Sergi they had nothing to fear from him. Yet on the night Gillespie was unstoppable, setting up two goals as Faustino Asprilla's hat-trick saw Newcastle win the game 3-2. To be fair to Van der Lem, Gillespie's performance was exceptional and hardly typical of his career. But it was enough to give Mourinho a break. 'After that Van der Lem was out and Mourinho was in,' said a member of the club's staff at the time. Van der Lem was still an important part of the staff but was no longer in charge of the scouting reports; instead Mourinho's meticulous dossiers became the norm for Barca players. Further signs that Mourinho was Van Gaal's star pupil came when he handed over the reins of the first team for the Catalan tournament. Mark the date: March 25, 1998. Jose Mourinho took charge of a first-class football team for the first time. The Catalan Cup is clearly a secondary affair for a club chasing European glory but nevertheless, given the sensibilities of the club's status in Catalunya, it cannot be ignored and the manager of the day usually takes charge. In that first year, Mourinho took the team and won the semi-final against Lleida, though in a serendipitous note, the late Tito Vilanova, whose eye Mourinho would later gouge during a Barca-Real clash, scored for Lleida. Van Gaal took charge for the final, which Barca lost but Mourinho was back in charge again in 1999, when they lost the semi-final to Lleida.

Eden Hazard (third from left) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Maribor . The reason why Mourinho does not count the 2000 triumph as his first trophy is because, in his eyes, he was just the assistant. But that is not strictly true. There was an expectation that Van Gaal would again take charge of the team for the final, as he had in 1998. But instead he allowed Mourinho to stay in control. Mourinho said: 'I took the team but he was in the stands. He was there to support. He came down at half-time to the dressing room to listen to my team talk. He didn't want to interfere, because probably he thought that was right. He did with me what I do with my assistants, give them not just responsibility, but also give them the tools for evolution, support an evolution and make them ready for a possible next step, if one day they decide to do it. It's normal.' And though these games were not quite the star-studded first XI, there were some world-renowned stars in his team. When Mourinho won the cup, his team contained Kluivert, Xavi, Sergi and Emmanuel Amunike. And he is grateful for the opportunity: 'I accepted it as a gift for somebody that was giving everything and was working hard. Good memories.' Daley Blind (centre) celebrates scoring a late equaliser for United at the Hawthorns on Monday evening . Mourinho's charisma was key to him winning over players at the time. 'You saw it with Jose from the beginning,' said Kluivert. 'Though he hadn't played, he wasn't a big name, he had charisma towards the group. The things he said really communicated. That was the most important thing. He knows how to talk to people as an individual and that was the difference with him. Everyone is different so you need to deal with them individually and he did that. Sure, he helped me. He helped everyone.' Robson gave Mourinho his chance but it was Van Gaal who gave him his head and, in doing so, helped create the iconic manager of today. Van Gaal always talks positively about his time with Mourinho but you cannot help but wonder whether, privately, he has the odd doubt. Mourinho beat Van Gaal at the 2011 Champions League final and today at Old Trafford his Chelsea team look much better set up than Van Gaal's. Like Victor Frankenstein, perhaps Van Gaal did not quite anticipate just what he was creating.

"Louis van Gaal has faced Jose Mourinho, the monster he created, just once before in a competitive match – and lost. And do you think the Manchester United manager is still bitter about the 2010 Champions League final that saw Mourinho's Inter Milan beat van Gaal's Bayern Munich with just 34 per cent possession? You bet. 'We have only played once and it was that game. And that honourable Howard Webb doesn't give a penalty to us. That game,' says a snarling van Gaal. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

'I said congratulations (to Jose) afterwards. Not more because I don't say anything about that game.' The role of van Gaal in Mourinho's career is well-documented. When the Dutchman took over at Barcelona in 1997, he decided not to sack Sir Bobby Robson's translator and instead promoted him to give him his first formal coaching job. The rest is history. Sunday's Manchester United-Chelsea showdown at Old Trafford will be their second clash as rivals. The first four years ago had a huge personal effect on van Gaal who will be privately savouring the prospect of making amends this afternoon. Bayern went into the European final as favourites at Real Madrid's Bernabeu. They had beaten Manchester United en route to the final and van Gaal could call upon Arjen Robben as well as future World Cup winners Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller and Miroslav Klose. Van Gaal, pictured in training with Manchester United, admits he is still bitter about his defeat to Mourinho . Yet Inter won with a double strike from unsung Argentine Diego Milito. Van Gaal still bears a grudge against English referee Webb, who two months later was at the centre of an infamous World Cup final between Spain and Holland. In Madrid, van Gaal watched with growing anger as Webb let off Inter hatchet-man Walter Samuel for scything down Robben. Then, crucially, he didn't give Bayern a penalty at 0-0 when Maicon handled. Van Gaal ended up losing the game and the following year his job – a huge blow to a manager who revels in his ""iron"" personality. And he'll surely be aware that the man in the middle for Sunday's big game, Phil Dowd, was once taken to task by Sir Alex Ferguson for being overweight, though he has clearly slimmed down since then. Despite the platitudes between van Gaal and Mourinho, it is hard for a mentor to see his protege overtake them. It's happened to Mourinho too. Last season he was desperate to beat Liverpool at Anfield and deny his protege Brendan Rodgers the title, even though it ended up in the hands of a manager he dislikes, Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini. Van Gaal is now motivated by chasing Mourinho. First of all, this afternoon and longer-term beating him to the Premier League title. 'He has won the championship in more than three countries. I am next with three, and I also want to do it here. Then I am equal again!' said van Gaal. 'He hasn't won as many titles overall as I have but he's done it in a shorter time.' Van Gaal has been a champion in Holland, Spain and Germany, but Mourinho has been top dog in four countries – Portugal, England, Italy and Spain. They first met in Spain 17 years ago and it was Mourinho's personality that helped him get a job on the training ground besides translation. Sir Bobby Robson loved the way the young Mourinho would be able to communicate his instructions to big egos like Ronaldo and Hristo Stoichkov with firmness and intensity. Van Gaal was also taken with his passion when he replaced Robson. 'We all had a meeting and he was angry that Sir Bobby was no longer coach. His anger was fantastic to see. So I said “You are my man”! Mourinho shows his emotions as he celebrates winning the Champions League for a second time . Tactically, the game at Old Trafford will be intriguing. United have used a record 30 different players in their opening eight league fixtures, testimony to the injury problems van Gaal has faced. Skipper Wayne Rooney is out of the game as he completes a three-game ban. Chelsea's early success this season, they are still unbeaten in the league, has owed a great deal to their midfield playmaker Cesc Fabregas being on top form while United's equivalent Michael Carrick has been unable to play for the first-team so far because of injury though he did return for the under-21s against West Ham on Friday. 'He (Fabregas) is a very interesting player and he can also dominate a game. He makes a big part of the attacking play of Chelsea,' accepted van Gaal, who is likely to start with Ander Herrera to try and snuff out the Fabregas threat. With Rooney out and van Gaal saying Falcao took a heavy kick in training on Friday, he will want the best out of former Chelsea player Juan Mata. 'I want to be a manager who can improve the qualities of players and that is a process,' he said of the £38million midfielder, who has not enjoyed the best first 12 months at Old Trafford. Whoever is on the pitch however, the television cameras will regularly point to the dug-outs to see the two protagonists van Gaal and Mourinho. For once, United won't be clear favourites for a game at Old Trafford. Their defensive resources have been stretched all season, hence conceding two at West Brom, two at home to Swansea, four at MK Dons and most startlingly, five at Leicester City in the Premier League. But having lost to Mourinho in a big final, van Gaal will not want a repeat and goes into the game believing he could sample some kind of revenge. 'We can beat any team,' he says. 'We have made individual errors at the back but we have also shown this season we can score goals and beat any team.'","Inter Milan beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in the 2010 Champions League final .

"Kit Symons believes he has done enough to land the manager’s job at Craven Cottage after he guided Fulham out of the bottom three. Under Symons Fulham have won 13 of their 14 points this season since he replaced Felix Magath in September. And Fulham wrapped up their third home win in a row against London rivals Charlton thanks to a goal from Scott Parker and two from Hugo Rodallega. Scott Parker scores Fulham's first goal after just six minutes en route to three important points on Friday . Parker slots home for Fulham's first of the night as they went on to claim the win over visitors Charlton . Parker runs away in celebration after giving Fulham a 1-0 lead on a successful night at the Craven Cottage . Parker celebrates scoring his opening goal against Charlton with Fulham team-mate Sean Kavanagh . Kit Symons of Fulham looks happy enough about claiming three points in the Championship against Charlton . Fulham (4-3-3): Bettinelli 6, Hoogland 6.5, Bodurov 6, Burn 6, Stafylidis 6, Parker 7, Christensen 6, Kavanagh 7, Ruiz 6.5 (Woodrow, 76), Rodallega 7 (Roberts, 90), McCormack 7.5 (Zverotic, 87) Subs (not used): Kiraly, Hutchinson,  Williams,  Smith . Goals: Parker (8), Rodallega (12, 89) Charlton (4-4-2): Henderson 6.5, Solly 5.5, Ben Haim 6, Bikey 6, Fox 6 (Ahearne-Grant, 67 6), Wilson 6, Jackson 6.5, Cousins 6, Bulot 6 (Morrison, 78), Moussa 6 (Gudmundsson, 59 6), Tucudean 6.5 . Subs (not used): Pope, Harriott, Munns, Thomas . Referee: Keith Stroud 6.5 . Attendance: 17,923 . And Symons said: ‘I am very confident I will get the job. It has got to be becoming more and more difficult not to when the team keep winning. I would like to think the five man panel will see what the obvious thing and the right thing to do for this football club. ‘I think they are very aware that I want the job and take this brilliant club forward. ‘The chairman is over the week after next. I don't know what to expect, I understand the process but not when a decision will be made or how it will, come about. Hopefully we'll find out sooner rather than later.’ Parker opened the scoring when he picked up a loose ball in the middle of the Charlton half and made a driving run forward before a neat one-two with Ross McCormack before turning the ball in off the cross bar from five yards out after just six minutes. Fulham doubled their lead through Rodallega, who was alert enough to poke home from close range after McCormack’s volley from the edge of the area was parried into his path by Stephen Henderson. Charlton did their best to get back into the game and looked neat and tidy in possession, but lacked the killer instinct in front of goal, George Tucudean had a shot from the edge of the area but it did little to trouble Marcus Bettinelli. It took Fulham just six minutes after Parker's opener to double their lead through Hugo Rodallega . Fulham striker Rodallega made it 2-0 inside the opening 15 minutes at Craven Cottage on Friday night . Fuham's Rodallega runs away in celebration after scoring against Charlton to make it 2-0 after 12 minutes . Championship strugglers Fulham desperately needed three points and got them against Charlton Athletic . Rodallega slides in celebration after scoring Fulham's second goal against Charlton on Friday night . Tim Hoogland almost extended Fulham’s lead on the half hour mark, but headed just wide from a McCormack free kick. Bettinelli was forced to make a save when Johnnie Jackson ghosted in to meet Chris Solly’s cross, but saw his effort tipped round the post for a corner. Charlton came to life at the start of the second half but were still restricted to shots from distance as Franck Moussa saw his effort go just wide. As Charlton looked for a way back into the game, they left gaps at the back and substitute Cauley Woodrow and Lasse Vigen Christiansen combined well but the Danish midfielder saw his effort go just wide. Rodallega scores his second goal of the night against Charlton as Fulham escape the relegation zone . But a third did come right at the end when Rodallega added his second when he was played in by Christiansen, he turned Michael Morrison and slotted the ball past Henderson. Charlton manager Bob Peeters said: ‘After 10 mins we were comfortable and then Solly lost the ball in the centre and they punished us. ‘We kept on doing the same things and created chances, then we did the same thing on the left and they punished us again. Charlton manager Bob Peeters suffered a frustrating night at Craven Cottage against Fulham on Friday . ‘I was very happy with response. Everyone gave their max second half. It’s about scoring the goals and that is what we lacked. ‘We have given Kit a gift today. He owes my players especially for the first half if he gets the job.’ It was a comprehensive win and one that is sure to have been noticed on the other side of the Atlantic by owner Shahid Khan . Khan is due in England in the next fortnight to appoint the new manager but after Symons’ fourth league win from seven he has put himself in the box seat.","Scott Parker scored opener in Championship match after just six minutes .

"Word at Tottenham's state-of-the-art Enfield training complex is that the club will make a concerted effort to sign Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez in January. What's for sure is manager Mauricio Pochettino needs to inject some life into his misfiring forward line, sooner rather than later. Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash against Brighton merely underlined the White Hart Lane club's need for a shiny new striker once the transfer window re-opens. Roberto Soldado failed to find the net once again as Tottenham struggled against Brighton . Spurs will reportedly make a January move for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez . Between them, Spurs' strike trio of Emmanuel Adebayor, Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane have scored five domestic goals this season. Kane, who scored last night, and Adebayor have two apiece, Soldado just one. Two of the five - both from Adebayor - have come in the league. In short: not good enough. Certainly not good enough for a team with aspirations of breaking into the Champions League qualification places. It was Soldado and Kane's turn to improve on that dismal record last night. But, once more, chance after chance was squandered before Kane tapped home late on as Brighton chased an equaliser. Kane, if given a prolonged run in the team, could solve Pochettino's problems - but the manager's reluctance to start the England Under-21 man in the league speaks volumes. 'You demand me to play Harry Kane in every game and he played today,' said Pochettino last night. 'He [Kane] shares with Adebayor and Soldado, they can share minutes, we need to understand that. Pochettino, upon his arrival from Southampton, insisted he wanted to give those at the club a chance to ink themselves into his blueprint. Harry Kane (left) looks to get away from Brighton' Jake Forster-Caskey in the Capital One Cup clash . Kane found the net with a second half strike to put Tottenham into commanding 2-0 lead . But with every passing 90 minutes, the Argentine knows he'll have to spend on a new striker in January. His interest in Rodriguez, a player he worked with and helped nurture at St Mary's, is no secret. There was a willingness, certainly from Pochettino, to strike a deal with the Saints for the England international in the summer. The long-term knee injury Rodriguez sustained towards the end of last season was one of the crucial factors in Spurs decision not to show more commitment in their attempts to land the 25-year-old. But Rodriguez is now approaching fitness; Pochettino knows it to, having been kept updated on his target's rehabilitation. Erik Lamela slots Tottenham into a 1-0 lead against Brighton on Tuesday night . Lamela celebrates his second half strike with the Tottenham faithful at White Hart Lane . What's more, those in control of the finances at White Hart Lane and are prepared to fund his move for Rodriguez at the turn of the year. Persuading, Rodriguez to leave upwardly mobile Southampton for Spurs maybe harder than it sounds, though. Pochettino will hope his relationship with the striker will help lure the forward to London. At the moment, with his current strikeforce, hope is all he has. Pochettino inherited this Spurs forward line, and until he is able to stamp his mark on it in the transfer market, he cannot truly call this HIS Spurs side. Mauricio Pochettino is aware Tottenham will have to look for a striker in the January transfer window .","Roberto Soldado fails to find the net against Brighton .

"England's Under 17s made it through to the next phase of European Championship qualifying with a hard-fought win over Macedonia on Monday. Manchester City striker Lukas Nmecha scored the decisive goal in Paphos, Cyprus as John Peacock's Young Lions made it two wins from two and progressed to the elite qualifying round. Having beaten hosts Cyprus 4-1 on Saturday, England - who are the defending European champions following their success in Malta back in May - knew a win over the Macedonians would likely take them through. England's Lukas Nmecha (left) celebrates with Layton Ndukwu after scoring the decisive goal in Paphos .

Peacock made six changes from the team that beat Cyprus, with Everton's Tom Davies assuming the captain's armband in place of the suspended Reece Oxford. Leicester City's Layton Ndukwu, who scored a hat-trick in Saturday's match, was moved to the left wing with Nmecha taking his place up front with Chelsea's Jacob Maddox just behind. Macedonia, who needed a win to stay in contention after their weekend loss to France, started brightly but found themselves trailing after 14 minutes. Maddox broke down the right to the byline and cut the ball back for Nmecha, evading his marker, to prod the ball home from close-range. It was very nearly a short-lived lead - Macedonia set Emil Abaz free with a long ball and goalkeeper Paul Woolston needed sharp reflexes to keep out the winger's shot. Maddox was England's most influential player in the first-half and a forward burst and cut-back to Chelsea colleague Charlie Wakefield nearly resulted in a second goal. Newcastle stopper Woolston was called upon again early in the second-half when Macedonia captain Davor Zdravkovski took aim from close range. And they had the ball in the net through defender Kiril Ristovski, only for an offside flag to cut short the celebrations.

"St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras died Sunday in a car accident in his native Dominican Republic. The crash happened on a highway between the beaches of Sosua and Cabarete in Puerto Plata, about 215 miles north of the capital of Santo Domingo. 'I spoke to the mayor of Sosua, Ylana Newman ... and she confirmed to us that Taveras lost control of his vehicle and went off the road,' police spokesman Jacobo Mateo Moquete told The Associated Press. St Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras has been killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic . Angel Ovalles, the Cardinals' representative in the Caribbean country, said late Sunday that Taveras was driving the car along with a young woman. Erico Rosario, one of Taveras' representatives, also confirmed his death. 'He was killed in an accident,' Rosario said, weeping. 'We are all stunned and deeply saddened by the tragic loss of one of the youngest members of the Cardinals family,' Cardinals Chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. said. 'Oscar was an amazing talent with a bright future who was taken from us well before his time. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends tonight.' Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr said Taveras was an amazing talent who was taken 'well before his time' 'I simply can't believe it,' said John Mozeliak, Sr. VP & GM of the St. Louis Cardinals. 'I first met Oscar when he was sixteen years old and will forever remember him as a wonderful young man who was a gifted athlete with an infectious love for life who lived every day to the fullest.' The 22-year-old Taveras made his major league debut this year. The promising slugger hit .239 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 80 games for the NL Central champions. 'I think he can be a star,' manager Mike Matheny said last Monday at his season-ending press conference. 'He proved that at times. Right to the end, he was very, very much into the competition. Yes, he wanted to be the guy out there every day. You see some things offensively that absolutely excite you.'

But the 35-year-old, who had already beaten testicular cancer last year and suffers from Crohn's disease, has admitted he will be unable to play his first tournament since May on medical orders.

"The struggling Caterham and Marussia Formula One teams will both miss next week's U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, the sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone said on Saturday. 'Neither of those two teams are going to go to America,' said the 83-year-old. Their absence will increase concern in the sport, whose smaller outfits have been saying for some time that they risk going out of business unless costs are slashed, even though Ecclestone has said he would be happy with 10 teams. Caterham (pictured) and Marussia Formula One teams will both miss next weekend's US Grand Prix in Texas . F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone says he would be happy to run with 10 teams next season . Caterham went into administration on Friday while Russian-registered Marussia are also struggling financially and are still reeling from French driver Jules Bianchi's serious accident in Japan three weeks ago. The air transport for all the teams' cars and freight is organised by Ecclestone's Formula One Management and they were due to be flown out on Saturday. Representatives of Marussia, who are currently ninth in the championship thanks to Bianchi's ninth place in Monaco in May, were not immediately contactable. However Caterham's administrator Finbarr O'Connell told Sky Sports television that the cars remained in the factory at Leafield. A security guard takes down the flag at the Caterham factory after the team went into administration . 'The racing kit was heading towards Austin but it's still in the UK. It will stay in the UK and hopefully if Caterham races in one of the last races we will ship the racing kit from here,' he said. O'Connell added that there had been '10 to 15 serious interested parties on the phone today and we are speaking to all those and getting information together for them to examine.' By missing the race in Austin, the two teams will also be absent from Brazil since the races are back to back with the cars going direct from the United States to Brazil before returning to Europe. The 19th and final race of the season is in Abu Dhabi on Nov. 23, when double points are to be awarded for the first time. Ecclestone said on Friday that Caterham had been given a dispensation to miss the next two races while they sought a buyer. Medical staff gather around Jules Bianchi's car after the Marussia driver's horror crash in Japan . Marussia's absence, apart from giving 10th placed Sauber more of chance to overtake them in the championship, will leave the grid in Austin with only nine teams and none of the three entirely new entrants that made debuts in 2010. Of that trio, HRT folded at the end of 2012. The 18-car grid will be the smallest since Monaco in 2005, when the BAR team were banned for two races for a breach of the technical regulations. The absence of Marussia also wrecks the hopes of American Alexander Rossi, the reserve driver, making a home appearance at Austin although the team had yet to make any announcement about their line-up. Rossi almost stepped in at the Belgian Grand Prix for Britain's Max Chilton when contractual problems emerged. Marussia's absence means there will only be nine teams starting from the grid in Austin . At the time, Chilton's management suggested he had voluntarily stepped aside 'to allow the team to attract much-needed funds by selling his seat' and Marussia were in talks with new investors. Reports in the European media have indicated that Russian majority owner Andrei Cheglakov has been looking to sell for some time. Ferrari-powered Marussia ran only one car in Sochi, Russia, two weeks ago, as a mark of respect for Bianchi who remains in critical condition in hospital in Japan after his horrific crash at Suzuka. There has been no medical update on Bianchi's condition since Sochi.","Formula One teams Caterham and Marussia are both struggling financially .

"Ross Brawn, Emerson Fittipaldi and Stefano Domenicali are just three of the high-profile names on a 10-strong FIA Accident Panel formed in the wake of Jules Bianchi's horrific crash in Japan a fortnight ago. One of the measures announced by FIA president Jean Todt soon after Bianchi's smash into a recovery vehicle at Suzuka that has left him fighting for his life was the formation of a body to not only look into the incident, but also to propose new safety recommendations. The newly-formed body is led by Peter Wright, president of the FIA's Safety Commission, and a member of motorsport's world governing body since 1995. Jules Bianchi receives urgent treatment after crashing during the Japanese Grand Prix . The Team Marussia driver remains fighting for his life after what has been described as a 'perfect storm' A statement from the FIA read: 'The group will carry out a full review of the accident to gain a better understanding of what happened, and will propose new measures to reinforce safety at circuits, with recommendations to be made for the FIA president. 'The work of the group will start this week, and a full presentation of its findings is to be made at the next meeting of the World Motor Sport Council on 3 December, 2014, in Doha, Qatar.' Wright has formed an experienced team around him, notably including one of the most respected figures in F1 in Brawn, a man who helped Ferrari win numerous titles during his time at Maranello as technical director. Following Honda's exit from F1 in 2008, from the ashes Brawn formed his own eponymously named marque, leading them to the drivers' and constructors' titles a year later prior to a takeover by Mercedes. The FIA has set up an Accidents Panel to determine what went wrong in Suzuka . Drivers displayed good will messages for Bianchi on their helmets during the Russian Grand Prix . Although Brawn remained as team principal, he left Mercedes at the end of last year following a dispute over the direction of the team, yet has been rightly accredited with the success that has followed this season. Double world champion Fittipaldi, who is also president of the FIA Drivers' Commission and an F1 steward, joins Brawn, along with Domenicali, who for six years until April this year was team principal at Ferrari. Also on the panel are Gerd Ennser, chief stewards' representative; Eduardo de Freitas, World Endurance Championship race director; Roger Peart, president of the Circuits Commission; Gerard Saillant, president of the FIA Institute and Medical Commission; Grand Prix Drivers' Association president Alex Wurz, and Antonio Rigozzi, a judge who sits on the International Court of Appeal. Former Mercedes Team Principle Ros Brawn is one of 10 people called up to the panel . FIA race director Charlie Whiting claims that 'nothing more could have been done better' to prevent accident . The panel will look into the findings of FIA race director Charlie Whiting, who claimed 'a perfect storm' of circumstances conspired against Bianchi and that 'nothing more could have been done better' either by his team or the stewards trackside. The FIA has already proposed an electronically-controlled speed limit is to be imposed on drivers and cars during periods when double-waved yellow flags are in evidence, as was the case during Bianchi's accident. There is also the possibility that from next season 'skirts' around the base of recovery vehicles are to be introduced given their ground clearance in relation to the height of a cockpit of an F1 car.","Jules Bianchi was severely injured after a freak accident at the Japan GP .

"Liverpool forward Luis Suarez has been voted the 2014 Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association. The Uruguay international, 27, topped the poll of 300-plus journalists with a victory over Anfield team-mate Steven Gerrard, the England captain. Suarez's 30 goals have helped propel Brendan Rodgers' men towards a first championship in 24 years. Main man: Luis Suarez has been in stunning form for Liverpool this season . Bullet: Suarez scores on of his 30 Premier League goals against Norwich last December . The Liverpool forward will be honoured . with the prestigious FWA accolade, which has been running since 1948, . at a gala dinner at the Lancaster London Hotel on May 15. Suarez was last week also named Player of the Year by the Professional Footballers' Association. FWA . chairman Andy Dunn said: 'Those members who have . been fortunate enough to be working at a match involving Luis Suarez . have witnessed an astonishing talent first-hand. 'Tireless . endeavour allied to extraordinary imagination makes an irresistible . combination. Add ingenious, impudent finishing and you have a footballer . who truly quickens the pulse. 'Luis is a remarkably gifted addition to the long and distinguished list of winners of our award.' In . a poll that saw 10 different players collect votes, Suarez collected 52 . per cent of the overall vote, ahead of his club captain, Gerrard, with . Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure in third place. Treble: Suarez also won the  Football Supporters' Federation (left) and PFA Player of the Year awards . Suarez received two votes in last year's FWA poll, which was won by then Tottenham winger Gareth Bale, and has come full circle since serving a 10-match ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. Dunn added on Sky Sports News: 'There was a groundswell of support for him last season, but our voting opened 12 hours after the biting incident at Anfield, so I think that was taken into account. 'I must stress the importance in this award that the football writers are asked to base their decision on obviously the footballing contribution throughout the season, but also to take into account the player's behaviour - the original citation for the FWA award back in 1947/48 mentioned 'precept and example', so that is taken into account. 'While no-one would say Suarez is whiter than white, you would have to say his behaviour all throughout the season has been very good and I think the football writers have taken that into account, an element of redemption if you like, and allied with those 30 goals, and the sensational talent he has displayed all season, that made him a very, very popular choice.'

"Mario Balotelli will face no charges for allegedly 'threatening' a woman who took photographs of his red Ferrari F12 Berlinetta after she decided not to make a formal complaint. Police were called to a housing estate at 3pm on October 23 in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester, where the Liverpool striker was reportedly visiting his mum Rose Barwuah. GMP were investigating Balotelli's use of 'threatening behaviour' after the forward demanded the woman stop taking photographs of the £240,000 car he shipped from Italy during the summer.

"David Moyes is on Inter Milan’s shortlist as the Italian giants scout Europe for a new manager with current coach Walter Mazzarri coming under increasing pressure with the club struggling in Serie A. The former Manchester United and Everton manager is considered a potential replacement for Mazzarri, whose team plays Cesena today and who is under considerable pressure after a run of poor results which has seen Inter sink to ninth in the table. But though Moyes himself has always made it clear the coaching abroad would appeal to him, the current instability at the Italian club may deter him should he be offered the job. David Moyes is on Inter Milan’s shortlist as the Italian Serie A giants scout Europe for a new manager . Current Inter manager  Walter Mazzarri is coming under increasing pressure with the club struggling in Serie A . Former owner and president Massimo Moratti resigned from his honourary post on Friday, having publicly questioned Mazzarri. New owner Indonesian Erick Thohir has stuck by the former Napoli boss until now – but the Moratti family still own one third of the club and, according to reports in Italy, the boardroom split has been caused by their desire to sack Mazzarri now. Michael Bolingbroke, the former chief operating officer at Manchester United, is the current chief executive at Inter and would provide an obvious point of contact and potential reassurance to Moyes. Former Everton boss Moyes is currently without a club after being sacked by Manchester United in April 2014 . Bolingbroke had already announced he was moving to Inter before Moyes was sacked by United last April and so had no direct part in his dismissal. Moving to Serie A would be an attractive option to Moyes, especially to one of Europe’s superclubs. Though Inter are currently playing in the Europa League and finished fifth last season, there is clearly an expectation of qualifying for Champions League football, which would allow Moyes to prove himself again at that level after his disappointment in following Sir Alex Ferguson at United. However, he is known to regard the stability of a club as a key factor when he does come back to management, meaning Inter would have to present a united front to convince him it was the right job.","David Moyes could be offered managerial job at struggling Inter Milan .

"Newcastle summer signing Remy Cabella claimed Alan Pardew made the right choice by dropping him for recent matches, admitting he has struggled with the Premier League's physicality. The 24-year-old France international finally arrived on Tyneside from Montpellier in July, almost seven months after the Magpies initially targeted him in the wake of Yohan Cabaye's January departure for Paris St Germain. However, the £7million man has found the pace and power of the Barclays Premier League a challenge and having started the first six league games, was taken out of the firing line for the trip to Swansea on October 4. Remy Cabella celebrates with Sammy Ameobi after the striker scored Newcastle's opener against Tottenham . But he returned as a half-time substitute at Tottenham on Sunday and provided the cross from which Ayoze Perez headed Pardew's men to a second successive victory, and he is now hoping that will provide him with a springboard to show what he can do on a sustained basis. Cabella told L'Equipe: 'It's logical. The coach had been starting me in the first two months, but I had not scored or had an assist. 'Dropping me to the bench, and indeed not playing me at all at Swansea, hurt my pride. But I have not eased off, I have worked more. Steven Taylor congratulates Cabella after the Frenchman provided the assist for Newcastle's second goal . 'He [Pardew] trusted me to play the second half [against Tottenham]. I got my first assist and it is good for the confidence. 'Alan Pardew wants me to be decisive, to score goals. Up to now, I have not done that. That is why I am not playing. 'Now I am only thinking about scoring. But I don't feel any pressure, that would be pointless. I am just here to play football, it is the best job.' Cabella said Alan Pardew was right to drop him for the trip to Tottenham as his form had been poor . Cabella freely admits the physicality of the Premier League came as a surprise, but insists he is gradually coming to terms with it. He said: 'I like England, it's another universe. It is another challenge in a new league, so of course it takes time to adapt. The rhythm and intensity of the game have surprised me. 'For 90 minutes, you attack, you defend, the referee doesn't whistle for anything. But after 90 minutes, you are dead! I didn't have the preparation I needed so I have to work twice as hard, and I am getting there bit by bit.'

"Everton midfielder Ross Barkley doesn't have any kind of buy-out clause in his contract, manager Roberto Martinez has revealed. Barkley signed a new four-year deal with the Toffees at the end of July. But despite pledging his future to Everton a matter of months ago the 20-year-old continues to be linked with a switch to either Manchester City or Chelsea next summer. However, should either club attempt to lure the England international away from Goodison Park, they will have to meet Everton's valuation after Martinez quashed rumours Barkley had a price on his head.

'The only one was with Marouane (Fellaini) and that wasn't triggered, so it didn't matter. 'All the speculation and talk is positive. Because you don't get any of that when your players are not playing well or they haven't got potential.'

Barkley, pictured in action against Aston Villa, is back in the first-team after two months out injured . 'Football and finances always go hand in hand,' explained Martinez, ahead of his side's clash with Burnley on Sunday. 'Now at Everton, every decision is going to be a football decision.' Martinez accepted, however, that every player ultimately does have their price.

"Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has blasted Mario Balotelli, claiming that he would be shocked if the striker is still at Anfield next season. Speaking post-match on Sky Sports, the former Reds centre half, along with Jamie Redknapp and Graeme Souness, gave their thoughts on a lacklustre Liverpool display, and lambasted Balotelli's contribution. 'I can't change the way I feel about Balotelli, and that is nothing to do with what he's done in a Liverpool shirt,' Carragher said. 'It's what he's done at Manchester City and AC Milan. Mario Balotelli was criticised after Liverpool's 3-0 loss to Real Madrid at Anfield on Tuesday night .

No, I'd be surprised to see him here next season if I'm being honest.' Redknapp followed up Carragher's comments with his own assessment - instead blaming Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers for bringing Balotelli to the club in the first place. 'I don't blame Mario Balotelli, I blame Brendan Rodgers for bringing him here. How he thought he could turn around a player who (Jose) Mourinho, (Roberto) Mancini and (Cesare) Prandelli have all washed their hands of.

"Everton skipper Phil Jagielka has recovered from his World Cup hangover and aiming to continue his impressive run of clean sheets against Burnley on Sunday. Jagielka, 32, hasn't conceded in four matches for club and country following an impressive Europa League draw in Lille on Thursday night and another at Turf Moor will make it five-in-a-row for the first time since the end of the 2012/13 season. It's not a bad comeback for a player blamed for England's costly defeats against Italy and Uruguay in the summer. Idrissa Gueye of Lille is chased by Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka during their Europa League tie . Jagielka has been making positive headlines in late September and says earlier criticism was over the top . And he's also added goals to his game, scoring against San Marino, Liverpool and Aston Villa this season. 'Keeping clean sheets is what my game is all about. If I can pop up with the occasinal goal, all the better, but as a defender my end of the bargain is to keep the ball out,' he said. 'There have been times this season at Everton where we didn't even look like keeping one clean sheet, never mind two in a row. Now we've got two decent results from difficult games, it gives the boys up front more to go on. 'People were quick to point out how bad my loss of form was at the start of the season, but I knew it wasn't as bad as had been made out. 'Then I score a couple of goals and I become a better player all of a sudden. That's the way football is. 'I feel for the majority of the season I can look myself in the mirror and the game against Lille was one of those.' Since a 2-1 defeat at Manchester United on October 5, Jagielka has played for England against San Marino and Estonia, and for his club side against Aston Villa and Lille, and hasn't seen Joe Hart or Tim Howard have to pick the ball out of the net. Jagielka: 'I score a couple of goals and I become a better player all of a sudden. That is the way football is' Everton centre back Jagielka was mobbed by his Everton team-mates after scoring against Liverpool . His club manager Roberto Martinez has hailed his recent displays as 'immense' particularly as he's had to play with a number of different partners at the back; John Stones, Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin at Everton, and Gary Cahill for his country. Talking about Everton, he said: 'It has been difficult when you've not go much continuity because of the amount of games and injuries that we've had. 'But fair play to the boys, Hibbo (Tony Hibbert) came in against Lille. Obviously I have played together a lot with Sylvain so it was nice to keep a clean sheet with our first appearance together in a while.' What made it even more satisfying to Everton fans was that their skipper snuffed out £10million Lille striker Divock Origi, who is on loan there from Liverpool. 'He looked like a threat but I thought we dealt with him,' he said. Everton climbed away from the lower regions of the table with a comprehensive 3-0 win against Aston Villa last weekend. It was only their second Premier League victory of the season and they will expect to use it as a springboard against opponents Burnley who are still seeking their first win. Jagielka is looking towards Everton's clash with Burnley on Sunday and is keen to earn another clean sheet .","Phil Jagielka was being criticised earlier in the season as Everton conceded 13 goals in their opening five Premier League games .

"Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have called on tyre manufacturer Pirelli to improve the performance of their wet-weather tyre in order to make Formula One safer. Hamilton, who leads the drivers’ standings with three races remaining, and Vettel, the reigning four-time champion, are both in agreement that Pirelli’s current wet-weather tyre, which was introduced this season, is not up to scratch. Rivals Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have joined forces to issue tyre warning . Their comments come in the wake of Jules Bianchi’s horror crash at the rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix. The Frenchman suffered a severe head trauma when he ploughed into the back of a tractor after he aquaplaned off the track on the intermediate tyre – the lighter treaded of the two options – despite the worsening weather conditions. ‘It is no secret that they are not the greatest wet tyres that I have known,’ said Hamilton. ‘The slick will always be improved, but I guess not so much focus gets put on the wet. You want a tyre that clears the water and does not force us to go to the intermediate when it is so much quicker, and when it is probably not safe enough to do so.’ Bianchi catastrophically lost control of his Marussia during the closing stages of the race in Suzuka. He remains in a grave condition at Mie University Hospital, 10 miles from the circuit. Jules Bianchi suffered traumatic brain injury when he crashed in the wet at the Japanese Grand Prix . ‘It’s definitely something we’ve passed on already, not just after Japan,’ said Vettel, who raised his concerns about the intermediate tyre in a drivers’ briefing ahead of last week’s Russian Grand Prix. ‘Currently the extreme tyre has a very narrow window and the intermediate is quicker. ‘As soon as you’ve got rid of most of the water, you try to put the intermediate on, taking a lot of risk into account, just because it’s the quicker tyre. ‘That’s something we need to work on.’ Sergio Marchionne, the man employed by Ferrari to replace former chairman Luca Di Montezemolo, says the famous marque must ‘kick some ass’ in order to return to winning ways. Ferrari are approaching the end of yet another below-par campaign with a dissatisfied Fernando Alonso heading for the exit, news confirmed by the departing Di Montezemolo on Wednesday. ‘We’ve got to kick some ass and we’ve got to do it quickly,’ said Marchionne, who will make Vettel the highest-paid driver in the sport’s history with the German leaving Red Bull to join Ferrari in a £50million-a-year deal. ‘We might screw up, but we’ve got nothing to lose, right?

"After a year of speculation, countless leaks and many rival devices, Apple is on the verge of unveiling its next-generation iPhone 6 at an event in California. The event begins at 10am PDT (6pm BST) at the same location Steve Jobs unveiled the first Mac computer 20 years ago. Alongside two new larger-screen iPhones, Apple may also use the event to finally unveil a smartwatch - a device that has been on the cards since 2012. Scroll down for video . After a year of speculation, countless leaks and many rival devices, Apple is on the verge of unveiling its next-generation iPhone 6 (concept image pictured) at an event in California . It is unsure whether the watch will be called the iWatch, or iTime - but numerous sources are reporting the device is incoming. Other reports have also suggested Apple could reveal its new range of iPads, which is typically reserved for a separate event in October. Before the event, rumours claimed Apple was working on two versions of its next iPhone, in different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One. A larger version was also rumoured to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. Leaked specifications earlier today claimed the device would have an Apple A8 processor, 1GB of memory, 128GB of storage and an 8MP camera. Although this is the same as the current model, reports claim Apple has improved the camera's overall performance 'in other ways.' The 4.7-inch iPhone will reportedly come with a display resolution of 1334 x 750. It is unsure whether the watch will be called the iWatch, or iTime - but numerous sources are reporting the device (concept pictured) is incoming. Other reports have also suggested Apple could reveal its new range of iPads, which is typically reserved for a separate event in October . The new products have been overseen by senior vice president of design at Apple, Sir Jonathan Ive (pictured). Last week, reports claimed Sir Ive had joked that 'Switzerland is trouble' - making reference to the fact that the iWatch could disrupt the traditional watchmaking nation's business . Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which is expected to be the smaller handset. In April, Taiwan-based Commercial Times similarly referenced a 2mm-thick battery. This . follows the release of Apple’s super-thin iPad Air last year, which, at . 0.2-inches (7.5mm) thick, is 2mm thinner than the iPad 4’s 0.4-inch . (9.4mm) depth. Two concept images released earlier this year depicted Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. The first concept predicted the phone will be 4.5mm thick. Other designers, including Martin Hajek, have imagined what both the iPhone 6 and the iWatch will look like. Before the event, rumours claimed Apple was working on two versions of its next iPhone, in different sizes - 4.7-inches and 5.5-inches. Previous rumours also pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, (leaked handset pictured right, next to the current iPhone 5S left) While the second went a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.2 inches (7.6mm). The iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, the second concept suggested doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys. The event is being held at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino, the same location where Steve Jobs introduced the original Mac 30 years ago . The new products are being unvieiled by Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. Last week, reports claimed Apple's iPhone 6 will include a system that lets owners pay in stores by tapping their phone on a reader. Called Near Field Communication (NFC), the technology is already widely used by credit cards for low-cost payments. A leaked handset (pictured) appeared to show an updated Passbook app . The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. Apple previously hinted at the wearable in the latest update to its iOS software, which includes health tracking capabilities. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Last week, new details also emerged of the firm's iWatch, claiming it would come in male and female versions, with flexible screen sizes of 1.3 and 1.5-inches.

"Violent turmoil in the Middle East could indirectly lead to millions of people starving from food shortages, research suggests. Scientists have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties lie in an area known as the Fertile Crescent. However, this area is also at the centre of a number of civil wars that are placing valuable crop species at risk of extinction. Scientists in the UK have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties is in an area known as the Fertile Crescent, which includes Israel (pictured) The Fertile Crescent is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the Arabian desert from Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and ending in Iraq and Iran. It has the largest diversity of 'crop wild relatives' (CWRs) - species closely related to our crops which are needed to create future 'super crop' varieties. These wild relatives of crops grow naturally outside mainstream agriculture and possess a number of useful traits including drought tolerance, yield improvement, and resilience to pests and diseases. Given that the human population is set to expand from the 7.26 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050, CWRs will be needed to improve crop yields and feed the extra people. The Fertile Crescent is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the Arabian desert from Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and ending in Iraq and Iran . Crop wild relative of wheat (pictured), Aegilops tauschii, is resistant to Hessian Fly which is pest of cereals . But researchers at Birmingham have shown that 12 per cent of CWRs are threatened with extinction and all are likely to be already suffering a loss of genetic diversity. Scientists have created the inventory lists 173 crops and their 1667 priority wild relatives, along with their particular traits. For example, the wild relative of the wheat crop, Aegilops tauschii, is resistant to Hessian Fly which is pest of cereal crops. Saccharum arundinaceumis is a relative of sugar cane and can survive very low temperatures, while  Prunus ferganensis, the crop wild relative of peach, is tolerant to drought conditions . The research team is currently involved in a new initiative by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to help conserve the wild relatives of crop plants in the country's within the Fertile Crescent . Their research found the largest collection of seeds in the Fertile Crescent is in Syria and believed to be under the control of rebel forces. The research team is currently involved in a new initiative by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to help conserve the wild relatives of crop plants in these countries. They are currently negotiating with governments in the Fertile Crescent to implement conservation schemes in biodiversity 'hotspots'. They are also taking samples and placing them in gene banks as a safety back up, where the genetic material can be kept for up to 300 years. 'There has previously been no opportunity to systematically conserve and use CWR as there was a lack of clarity over their identities and distribution,' said Dr Nigel Maxted, lead investigator from the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences. 'By creating an inventory of globally important CWR we can discover which countries and regions are the richest in terms of priority CWR, and more efficiently plan and coordinate conservation efforts to ensure their survival.'","Highest concentration of crop wild relatives (CWR) is in Fertile Crescent .

Marc Newson, left, will be part of his close friend senior vice president of design Sir Jonathan Ive's (right) team at Apple - and is believed to have already worked on apple projects including the upcoming iWatch. Recent hires by the company include Angela Ahrendts, a former Burberry C.E.O. who now heads up the firm's retail operations. Yves Saint Laurent's Paul Deneve now looks after 'special projects. Other hires include Nike's Ben Shaffer, and Patrick Pruniaux from swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer. the company also recently took on Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine as part of its acquisition of Beats. It follows a raft of Apple hires from the fashion and design world, including senior staff from Burberry, Yves Saint Laurent and Nike. Ive and Newson, who have been close friends for years, have been spending time together over the past year. During that time, they have also worked on some designs for Apple. 'Marc is without question one of the most influential designers of this generation,' Ive said in a statement provided to Vanity Fair Daily. 'He is extraordinarily talented. The pair recently collaborated on U2 singer Bono's (RED) auction in November, which raised $26.2 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS in Africa. their designs included these gold headphones.

"Forget everything you learned about volcanoes in your geography class. The textbook explanation of magma being spewed out from narrow jets deep within Earth is wrong, according to a new study. Researchers now believe that these narrow jets – called mantle plumes - don't exist, and they say basic physics can back up their findings. Scroll down for video . According to current mantle-plume theory, heat from Earth's core somehow generates narrow jets of hot magma that gush through the mantle and to the surface. But scientists now believe this theory is incorrect . 'Mantle plumes have never had a sound physical or logical basis,' said Don Anderson, a professor at the California Institute of Technology. According to current mantle-plume theory, heat from Earth's core somehow generates narrow jets of hot magma that gush through the mantle and to the surface. They have been assumed to exist, originating near where the Earth's core meets the mantle, almost 1,860 miles (3,000km) underground - nearly halfway towards the planet's centre. While the top of the mantle is a type of fluid sludge, the uppermost layer is rigid rock, broken up into plates that float on the magma-bearing layers. What is driving this motion is not heat from the core, but cooling at Earth's surface. When material in the planet's crust cools, it sinks, displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward. Magma, which is less dense than the surrounding mantle, rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates that run through them . The textbook image (left) of magma being spewed out from narrow jets deep within Earth mantle (right)  is wrong, according to a new study.  Researchers now believe that those narrow jets don't exist . Magma from the mantle beneath the plates bursts through the plate to create volcanoes. 'Much of solid-Earth science for the past 20 years - and large amounts of money - have been spent looking for elusive narrow mantle plumes that wind their way upward through the mantle,' said Professor Anderson. Top-down tectonics suggest that plate tectonics is driven by causes at the surface. Instead of narrow jets, known as mantle plumes, there are broad upwellings of heat, which are balanced by narrow channels of sinking material called slabs. What is driving this motion is not heat from the core, but cooling at Earth's surface. When material in the planet's crust cools, it sinks, displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward. Magma, which is less dense than the surrounding mantle, rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates or fissures that run through them. Stresses in the plates, cracks, and other tectonic forces can squeeze the magma out, in a similar way to how water is squeezed out of a sponge. That magma then erupts out of the surface as volcanoes. Now, thanks in part to more seismic stations spaced closer together, analysis of the planet's seismology is good enough to confirm that there are no narrow mantle plumes. Instead, data reveals that there are large, slow, upward-moving chunks of mantle 620 miles (1,000km) wide. In the mantle-plume theory, Professor Anderson explains, the heat that is transferred upward via jets is balanced by the slower downward motion of cooled, broad, uniform chunks of mantle. The new measurements suggest that what is really happening is just the opposite: Instead of narrow jets, there are broad 'upwellings', which are balanced by narrow channels of sinking material called slabs. What is driving this motion is not heat from the core, but cooling at Earth's surface. In fact, Professor Anderson says, the behaviour is the regular mantle convection first proposed more than a century ago by Lord Kelvin. When material in the planet's crust cools, it sinks, displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward. 'What's new is incredibly simple: upwellings in the mantle are thousands of kilometres across,' Professor Anderson said. When material in the planet's crust cools, it sinks, displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward. Magma, which is less dense than the surrounding mantle, rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates or fissures that run through them, according to the theory . He calls this theory 'top-down tectonics,' based on Kelvin's initial principles of mantle convection. Magma, which is less dense than the surrounding mantle, rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates or fissures that run through them. Stresses in the plates, cracks, and other tectonic forces can squeeze the magma out, in a similar way to how water is squeezed out of a sponge. That magma then erupts out of the surface as volcanoes. The magma comes from within the upper 124 miles (200km) of the mantle and not thousands of miles deep, as the mantle-plume theory suggests. 'This is a simple demonstration that volcanoes are the result of normal broad-scale convection and plate tectonics,' Professor Anderson says.","Conventional theory is that mantle plumes bring magma to the surface .
The thin jets are assumed to exist but scientists have never seen them .

'It . is in immaculate condition and is in one of the leading locations for . the horse training industry. We hope to see considerable interest in the . yard.' The stables were specifically . designed by Piggott with a jockey's eye for detail. It is said that Piggott was greatly influenced by a visit to . Colin Hayes, an Australian champion trainer, and his Lindsay Park . establishment in Adelaide, when he designed the stables. Piggott and his wife have two daughters, Maureen, a former eventer, and . Tracy, a sports presenter for RTE in Ireland. Piggott is one of the most famous jockeys in British history. In a career spanning 48 years, he was champion . jockey 11 times and also had 30 Classic wins, including a record nine in The Derby. He also had 116 successes at Royal Ascot in a total of 4,493 career wins in . Britain - a record that only Sir Gordon Richards and Pat Eddery have bettered. He won the Oaks six times and the St Leger eight times. He won the Epsom Derby . for the first time in 1955 and went on to win the race eight more times.

"The US Open final that nobody predicted and not everyone wanted was seized on Monday night with unblinking composure by Croatian giant Marin Cilic. The No 14 seed completed his third consecutive straight sets win to defeat a somewhat overwhelmed Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in less than two hours to deny Japan its equally unlikely Grand Slam winner. An outstanding performance from Cilic disappointed the millions who rose with the dawn there to watch their new national hero try and became the first Asian-born man to lift one of the sport's biggest prizes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Marin Cilic fans celebrating in Zagreb's Ban Jelacic square . Game raised: Marin Cilic holds his US Open trophy aloft after his emphatic victory . Sinking in: Cilic falls to the court after clinching the win over Kei Nishikori in the final . Champion: Marin Cilic celebrates during his victory over Kei Nishikori in the US Open men's singles final . Team CIlic: Goran Ivanisevic, Marin's coach and long-time mentor, celebrates with his supporters . It completed a remarkable comeback for the 25-year-old Cilic who, this time last year, was sitting out an ultimately truncated doping ban after testing positive for the banned stimulant Nikethamide, which was contained in glucose tablets bought for him by his mother. While most in the game believe Cilic, who vehemently protested his innocence, to be an honest man guilty only of naivety the fact remains that his triumph is not an entirely good look for the sport. The one-sided nature of the contest between two relatively unheralded players was certainly a far cry from some of the beguiling thrillers involving the so-called Big Four in recent times. It is not one that will linger long in the memory save, perhaps, for the fact that it is the last US final to be held on a Monday before the reversion to Sundays next year. Big serve: Cilic's booming serve provided the foundation for his convincing win . Power play: Nishikori reaches for a forehand in vain as he fell in straight sets to the big-hitting Croatian . Frustration: Nishikori shouts during a tough match on Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York . That should not detract from a brave and skilfull performance from the mild-mannered Croatian, who rose to the occasion manfully and dictated the whole match with his serve and raking groundstrokes. Afterwards Cilic paid tribute to his coach, ex Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, saying, 'My team has brought me something, especially Goran. The most important thing he brought to me was to make tennis enjoyable. 'I have played the best of my life here. For all the other players who work hard it shows how it is going to pay off. I think the stars aligned.' A deflated Nishikori reflected: 'He was playing really well tonight and I couldn't play my tennis. It is a tough loss.' Marin fans: Cilic fans stand out in the red and white checks of Croatia . Pumped: Cilic reacts as his first Grand Slam title approached . Helpless: Nishikori had no answers for Cilic's relentless strength . When Nishikori, giving away eight inches in height, threatened to revive with three break points at 2-4 in the third set Cilic held firm and, as in the whole match, his vastly improved serve was there to get him out of trouble. He closed it out with a cross court backhand winner and fell on his back, Rafael Nadal-style, in his unbridled delight before scaling the stands to celebrate with his supporters. At the slightly surreal start time of 5pm nobody could be sure how either player would be able to react. It was the first US Open final since 1997, when Greg Rusedski lost to Pat Rafter, to feature two players making their debut in the climax to a Grand Slam. The victory is not especially good news for Andy Murray, who finds himself outside the world's top ten for the first time in six years at number eleven, and facing a real challenge to qualify for the Barclays ATP World Finals at the O2 Arena. In his corner: Michael Chang has worked wonders with Nishikori since taking over as coach . Supporters: Fans in Nishikori's home town of Matsue in western Japan watch the match on a big screen . Emotional: A woman in Matsue reacts as Nishikori is blown away by his bigger opponent . Cilic's game is impressively functional rather than anything of great beauty, but one outstanding feature is his easy movement for such a tall man, which would grace any NBA basketball team. A Nishikori strength is his explosive footspeed, but he looked somewhat sluggish from the off, a product of nerves and perhaps his tougher run to the final. There was no great surprise when he was broken for 2-4, as the towering Croatian was all over his second serve and profiting from a surfeit of unforced errors. He made the breakthrough when a particularly inauspicious sliced forehand that floated wide. Cilic was making a lot of headway by driving hard and wide to his opponent's backhand and he went ahead in the second set when another one of those went bulging into the net. The Croatian, saved two break points immediately afterwards, the second one with an ace delivered by a serve that has been part of his considerable improvement. He blinked when serving for the set at 5-2 but the Japanese was somewhat reminiscent of Andy Murray inhis first US Open final six years ago – looking tired and overwhelmed – and he dropped serve again to fall two behind. One player never got going while the other was on it from the start – the uneven scale of the contest the final Tale of the Unexpected from the 2014 US Open.

"A horse which single-handedly brought both sides of the M62 to a standstill when it leapt into the motorway from a field has had to be put down. Student Olivia Wynn took a picture of the galloping animal from the passenger seat of the car she was driving back from a day trip in York in with her mum, Deborah just by junction 27 near Birstall, West Yorkshire. All lanes were affected for almost one hour when the horse hurtled through a fence near junction 28 in Tingley and attempted to travel the wrong way along the east-bound side at evening rush hour. A horse singlehandedly brought both sides of the M62 to a standstill when it leapt into the motorway from a field. Student Olivia Wynn took this picture from the passenger seat just by junction 27 near Birstall . Then it jumped over the central reservation into the west bound lane and ran at least three miles up the motorway to Birstall. Sadly the horse had to be put down after suffering severe damage to its leg while running free down the motorway. Police say they have no idea where the animal came from, or who it belonged to, but that it had badly injured itself whilst running free on the motorway and had to be put down. Inspector David Peach, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'We tried to corral the horse to safety but whilst it had been running free, it had caused severe damage to its leg and when it was finally rescued, it was in considerable distress. 'The only humane option was to put it down. The only right thing to do was to put it out of its misery.' Olivia, 20, who is studying American studies at Sussex University, was on her iPhone looking at social media websites when she looked up and saw the horse galloping down the road. She said: 'We were just sat crawling along the road. It was a slow journey. 'Then we looked up and saw one of those animal warning signs on the motorway - beware animals on the road. All lanes were affected for almost one hour when the dare devil animal hurtled through a fence near junction 28 in Tingley and attempted to travel the wrong way along the east-bound side at 5.05pm . 'I said to my mum ""I have never seen an animal on the motorway"" and seconds later my mum lets out a yelp. I thought there had been a car crash. I looked up and I saw this horse. It was coming full force at us. Then I just snapped and got the picture. 'We were in the outside lane. I was just praying it didn't hit the car and injure itself. 'It missed us by a few feet. 'Afterwards I couldn't believe how clear the picture was. It was certainly a fast horse. If it wasn't on a motorway it might have got done for speeding.' Deborah, who lives in Rochdale, said: 'Not what you expect to see on the M62. It was a bit scary to say the least.' Her father, Mark Wynn, is chairman of professional rugby league club, Rochdale Hornets. Mr Wynn said: 'I think they were just very shocked to see a horse in full flight. It was a wild animal animal on an ultra modern road. It made for a surprising contrast. 'The last thing you expect is a horse coming towards you at full speed.' In a Twitter alert, West Yorkshire Police RPU, who were called to the scene following calls from several bewildered motorists, said that it was 'running all over the place' and warned drivers to be careful. Police officers stopped lanes and slowed traffic until they were able to approach the horse. They are now trying to arrange for repairs to be made to the fence to prevent it from escaping again. No passengers or vehicles were hurt in the bizarre incident.","Student Olivia Wynn took picture from passenger seat of car on M62 .

The 59-year-old, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, can often be found taking her miniature horses Tinkerbell and Jezabell for a canter along the roads in her housing estate. Elizabeth Curran with her horse Tinker Bell. They are a regular sight for the community of Wythenshawe as she takes her animals for walks . At the same time, she holds the reins of her tiny pets or clips on a dog lead and drives her scooter along by their side. The mother-of-two, who lives at Peel Hall, competed for many years as a long distance rider, but her career and hobby was cut short by weight issues. But she has found a new way to spend time with her beloved horses - even if it is on a much smaller scale. She said: 'It might be unusual for a woman with a mobility scooter to walk a horse, but Tinkerbell is only tiny and I can't ride her. 'I used to . be able to ride but I can't now. Tinkerbell and Jezabell like to go out . and meet people so I thought 'well, my scooter can be my legs'. 'Everybody knows me in Wythenshawe. People stop their cars and come running back and say 'can I take a photograph?'.'

Mrs Curran often takes Tinkerbell, eight, and Jezabell, 12, to care homes and charities and they are also at home on a stage, where they double as donkeys in nativities. She bought the horses for £1,000 each from a stud farm in Cornwall. Hairdresser Christine Williams, who runs the Reflections salon in Peel Hall, said: 'We see her out all the time, it's a lovely sight. It's particularly good at Christmas when she dresses them as reindeer.' Grandfather-of-four Alan Millington, 62, said: 'I remember Liz moving in and thinking ""oh my God, horses in Wythenshawe, that can't be right"". 'But it really works. She's famous now, all the kids come to see the horses and she does lovely stuff for charities.' Mrs Curran, who is married to Clifford and also has five dogs, added: ""My animals give me a reason to get out of bed in the morning.'

"Ukip was last night forced to apologise after branding Labour rising star Chuka Umunna a ‘racist’ – based on words he never used. The Shadow Business Secretary was shocked after Ukip Euro MP Jane Collins last week went on Twitter to accuse him of racism. She posted an image of Mr Umunna allegedly saying black people should be preferred to white people for top jobs to ‘spice things up a bit’, calling it an ‘extraordinary racist comment’. Extraordinary indeed: Ukip MEP Jane Collins circulated this quote - which Labour's Chuka Umunna never said . Ukip parliamentary candidate David Sprason also tweeted the picture and accused Mr Umunna of promoting a ‘racist agenda’. But the two politicians were forced to apologise after Mr Umunna insisted the quotation was fiction, made up by a far-Right website. Labour MP Steve Rotheram said: ‘This just shows once again the true face of Ukip – a party that is happy to regurgitate lies originating on a far-Right website.’ Last night, Mrs Collins said: ‘When I realised this quote about Chuka Umunna was untrue, I immediately sent a tweet to apologise. It was a lapse of judgment on my part.’ Mr Sprason said: ‘If Chuka didn’t say these words, I will apologise and withdraw my comments.’ Wrongly accused: The words attributed to the Labour shadow cabinet member (pictured) were made up .","Quote by Labour's Chuka Umunna was circulated by Ukip MEP Jane Collins .

"TACKLE KEOWN special on being part of that great Invincibles side . Graham Poll: Invincibles had it all (including a bit of backchat!) It was another victory, another game undefeated, another match cemented into the history of English football. On this very day a decade ago, a 3-1 win against Aston Villa took Arsenal to 49 games unbeaten. It’s a feat that’s never been bettered, an achievement that’s unlikely to be matched. They are the greatest team of the Premier League era. Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea came close in 2005, but fell nine games short. Manchester United’s famous Treble-winning side could manage only 29 games without defeat. Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest held the record with 42 matches before Arsenal bettered it and then surpassed it by seven games. Thierry Henry (left), Patrick Viera (centre) and Arsene Wenger (right) celebrate Arsenal's 2004 title triumph . Arsenal fans crowd the streets of Islington to congratulate their team during a victory parade in north London . Henry shows off the Premier League trophy after helping Arsenal go the entire season unbeaten . And to think it all could have ended after just six matches. The Gunners were losing 1-0 at home against Portsmouth before a dubious penalty won by Robert Pires and converted by Thierry Henry (who was forced by the referee to take and score it twice) saw them salvage a draw. ‘I did not cheat, I’m not a diver,’ Pires said, although the evidence would point to the contrary. Henry and Pires jog back to the centre circle after the former's equaliser against Portsmouth, whose keeper Shaka Hislop looks dejected . Eight days later the Gunners travelled to Manchester United. There wasn’t a better fixture on the calendar than the meeting of Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson, Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane, the Arsenal defence and Ruud van Nistelrooy. The game was poised to end in a goalless draw – the Gunners were down to 10 men after Vieira was sent off - before Martin Keown was adjudged to have fouled Van Nistelrooy in the area. The Dutchman stepped up to take the penalty, and the rest is history, and messy, too. United’s striker rattled Jens Lehmann’s crossbar before the Arsenal defence rattled him, in an iconic, albeit distasteful moment. Van Nistelrooy would act revenge 13 months later, but for now Arsenal’s streak, which began with an emphatic 6-1 win against Southampton following hat-tricks from Pires and Jermaine Pennant on a late spring evening at Highbury, remained intact. Just. Fines and bans were awarded to five Arsenal players after the ‘Battle at Old Trafford’ (not to be confused with the following year's Battle of the Buffet) but their squad, spearheaded by Henry, went from strength-to-strength. The imperious Frenchman, who played in all but one of the unbeaten matches, scored 38 times and teed up 19 goals over the run.

Things get ugly during the goalless draw as Arsenal defender Lauren (right) grabs Phil Neville by the throat . Patrick Vieira (left) points the finger at Van Nistelrooy after the Arsenal captain was sent off . Back-to-back victories at Anfield and against Chelsea at Highbury followed. Wenger’s men then beat the Blues away to complete the league double over their title rivals. This was an era when Chelsea feared their London rivals. Ten years on and the boot is firmly on the other foot. Vieira and Edu were on target at Stamford Bridge to extend their lead at the top to seven points. The title was all-but won in February. Good Friday provided Arsenal with the toughest test of their unbeaten run. After crashing out of the FA Cup to United and Champions League to Chelsea in just six days, Wenger’s men hosted Liverpool. Dreams of a Treble were over, and their bid to become the only team to go through a top-flight English campaign without defeat appeared in ruins, too. Michael Owen had helped Liverpool take a 2-1 lead at Highbury into the interval, and the mood at a sun-laden Highbury was bleak. Bergkamp (left) Arsenal scores against Chelsea at Highbury with Marcel Desailly and William Gallas helpless . But Henry single-handedly pulled Arsenal from the abyss with one of the finest performances ever seen in the Premier League. Pires levelled for the Gunners four minutes after half-time before the brilliant Henry gave the host the leads moments later. Picking up the ball just inside the Liverpool half he terrorised and taunted the visiting defence before slotting past Jerzy Dudek and celebrating in front of the west stand. Cue wild scenes at Highbury. Panic over. Henry completed his treble with 12 minutes left.

Arsenal secured the league with four games to spare at the home of bitter rivals Tottenham with a 2-2 draw before completing the campaign undefeated at home to Leicester. Paul Dickov gave the visitors a surprise lead, but Arsenal won 2-1. History was made. A 3-0 win at home to Blackburn near the beginning of the ensuing campaign saw Wenger’s side surpass Forest’s record with their 43rd undefeated match. ‘We are unbeatable,’ the Arsenal faithful would sing, and they were right. Jermaine Pennant (left), Gilberto and Robert Pires (right) enjoy the win against Blackburn that broke the record . That was until they faced United at Old Trafford on October 26, 2004. Wayne Rooney, celebrating his 19th birthday, went down under a challenge from Sol Campbell. A dive? Probably. Van Nistelrooy exorcised his demons from 12 months previous, slotting home from the spot before Rooney converted from close range to secure a 2-0 win. It was 49 and out for Wenger’s side, and the end of a glorious run. Wayne Rooney pounces to score past Jens Lehmann and seal the end of Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run . Tempers flared during the clash at Old Trafford, which became known as the Battle of the Buffet . Arsenal's players argue with referee Mike Riley after his award of a penalty to Manchester United . ‘When I look back now and see the quality of each player, that’s when you realise it was exceptional,’ said Wenger on Thursday when asked about his Invincibles on the 10-year anniversary of the record being set. Indeed his team oozed pace, power, quality, team spirit and an excellent defence, too. They really did have it all. Thirty-three players contributed to obtaining 121 points from a possible 147 in a 77-week unbeaten stretch. Go down to the Arsenal today, and they’ll remind you of the feat: ’Forty-nine, 49 undefeated, 49, 49, I say, 49, 49 undefeated, playing football the Arsenal way.’ Living in the past? Perhaps.

"Marin Cilic's jubilant coach Goran Ivanisevic declared it was ‘justice’ after the world No 14 overwhelmed Roger Federer to make Monday night’s final of the US Open with a career-best performance. The 25-year-old Croatian played outstandingly well and was a thoroughly deserved winner, but his success is nonetheless tinged with controversy. In April last year he tested positive for the stimulant Nikethamide contained in some glucose tablets bought by his mother. Final challenge: Cilic produced a fantastic performance to beat Roger Federer on Saturday . Deserved: Federer is one of the more outspoken players in regards to drugs, but he has absolved the Croat . He denied any wrongdoing and was given a nine-month ban, later reduced to four, as the Court of Arbitration for Sport accepted its ingestion was an accident. Despite being outspoken on doping, Federer sportingly stated after his defeat that he believed Cilic — who has always enjoyed a good reputation in the game — is someone who was not guilty of being anything more than naive. Yet CAS did not fully exonerate Cilic, and people outside tennis will again look at this sport and wonder how serious it is about tackling doping when bans are so short and careers continue so seamlessly after violations. Naive: Cilic tested positive but his ban was reduced to four months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport . Opponent: Cilic will face Kei Nishikori of Japan in the US Open final on Monday in New York . Shortly before Cilic’s positive test, Serbian ex-top 20 player Victor Troicki declined to give a blood test after his match at the Monte Carlo Open. CAS reduced his ban from 18 months to one year and he is back playing. His supporters such as Novak Djokovic peddled disgraceful slurs about the experienced doctor involved, and faced no sanction. Both cases involved complex evidence but the emerging reality is their suspensions cannot be much of a deterrent to potential dopers in tennis. Use of doping is likely to be limited but it surely exists in the game, probably including at the highest level, and the sport needs to be ever vigilant. It is a fine achievement by Cilic to make the final, and the sense of injustice over his ban may have motivated him. But there are still mixed signals here.","Cilic was banned for nine months after testing positive for Nikiethamide in April 2013 .

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thomas Muller dancing Gangnam style in a club . Team player: Muller celebrates with Ozil after opening the scoring in Belo Horizonte . UNORTHODOX TALENT . There is a beautiful ugliness to Muller’s game. Sometimes his touch can be scrappy and he doesn’t go for fancy tricks, but he’s so effective. How many times does he pop up in the right place at the right time? That doesn’t happen by accident — he is aware of where he needs to be and does whatever it takes to get there. TOP TECHNICIAN . As well as reading the game so well, Muller has the technique to go with it. He is quick, strong and good with both feet; he can just as easily bend one in the top corner as scuff one in from close range. He’s good in the air, holds the ball up well and brings team-mates into the game. A manager’s dream. Workaholic: Muller in action during the quarter-final win over France in Rio de Janeiro . TEAM PLAYER . Muller is unique in that you don’t really know his best position. He’s not quite a striker, not quite a winger. You could play him as a No 10 or an old-fashioned inside-forward. But wherever he ends up he’s dangerous. How would England use a player like that? Because he doesn’t catch the eye and his skills aren’t as apparent, he might not even get a chance. Credit Germany for getting the best out of such a versatile player. Start of the rout: Muller took advantage of awful Brazil defending to score Germany's opening goal . WORKAHOLIC . One thing you are guaranteed is a huge amount of effort. Even if things aren’t coming off, he gives everything for his team and it rubs off on the rest of the side. Their work ethic is fantastic. WORLD CUP WONDER . It's the pinnacle of the game, so you don’t score 10 goals in two tournaments without being something special. Muller was young player of the tournament and Golden Boot winner in South Africa and is one game away from being player of the tournament in Brazil. Muller’s one of those players who thrives on this kind of pressure. He is a tournament specialist and he is clearly enjoying himself in Brazil.

"Given that they died in combat, it seems almost appropriate that auctioneers plan to make a killing from these two dinosaurs. Described as ‘possibly the most amazing fossil in the world’, the bones of the dinosaurs who fought to the death 65million years ago are expected to fetch a record-breaking £6million at auction in November. They were unearthed in Montana in 2006 and depict a ‘sensational prehistoric death match between predator and prey’. Death match: The fight between the predator nanotyrannus (left) and the relative of the triceratops (right) have been preserved in the fossil. The pair are believed to have died after the region in which they roamed was hit by an earthquake . The predator nanotyrannus, a 24ft-long cousin of the tyrannosaurus rex, left teeth embedded in the neck of a plant-eating triceratops, who in turn left its opponent with a large dent in its skull. It is thought the pair fought before being buried by an earthquake. The Bonham’s auction house in New York describes the fossil as ‘breathtaking’ and adds: ‘The remarkable state of the skeletons indicates the pair was buried very shortly after the fatal struggle.’ Manchester University palaeontologist Philip Manning said the lot was ‘possibly the most amazing fossil in the world’. He added: ‘It was a bad day for both of them. If you’re cornered by a top predator you will do everything you can to stop yourself being eaten. You will fight.’ Speaking at the British Science Festival in Newcastle, he called on museums to pool their resources to buy the fossil, which could otherwise be locked in a private collection.

"At least 400 British Muslims have joined the jihadist fanatics bringing terror to Iraq and Syria, William Hague warned last night. In his first statement to MPs since the crisis in Iraq erupted more than a week ago, the Foreign Secretary said security chiefs were becoming increasingly alarmed at the prospect that British extremists waging jihad in the region could bring their murderous philosophy and methods to the streets of the UK. He said some were 'inevitably fighting with ISIS' - the extremist group whose barbaric tactics and seizure of a huge swathes of Iraq have provoked international outrage. Mr Hague also revealed Britain was on the brink of an astonishing diplomatic U-turn over Iran, in the hope that Tehran may be able to help prevent the total collapse of its neighbour. Scroll down for video . British Foreign Secretary William Hague has held talks with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif about the growing crisis in Iraq . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also offered 'passive assistance' to the US, hinting Britain could allow airbases to be used to launch 'well-judged, targeted action' against the rapid spread of the ISIS - Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria. Iraq has been plunged into its bloodiest crisis since the withdrawal of US troops in 2011. ISIS rebels, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are said to have murdered 1,700 soldiers last week. Iran's President Rouhani has said he is was willing to take part in talks with other countries and has claimed to have had written correspondence with US President Barack Obama. Mr Hague revealed he had also spoken to Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The Foreign Secretary told the Commons: 'We do have, over many decades including now, important common interests with Iran. That includes stability in Iraq and in Afghanistan. 'There are many other issues - dealing with the narcotics trade and so on - on which Iran and the UK have common interests. Britons will 'inevitably' be fighting alongside the extremist group which has overrun large parts of Iraq, Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs. Mr Hague said it was possible that Britons who had travelled to Syria to fight in the country's bloody civil war could be among militants in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis), which the Foreign Secretary called the 'most violent and brutal militant group in the Middle East'. In a Commons statement updating MPs on the crisis, Mr Hague repeated his position that there was no prospect of a British military intervention to tackle Isis in Iraq. But he said counter-terrorism support could be offered to the government in Baghdad and a Ministry of Defence (MoD) team had been sent to the country to assist embassy staff in contingency planning. He said the majority of Isis' members were Iraqi or Syrian but 'it also includes a significant number of foreign fighters among its ranks'. Mr Hague said: 'As I have previously told this House, we estimate the number of UK-linked individuals fighting in Syria to include approximately 400 British nationals and other UK-linked individuals who could present a particular risk should they return to the UK.' He said 'some of these, inevitably' are 'fighting with' Isis. The Foreign Secretary said: 'We are taking action in three areas: . promoting political unity among those who support a democratic Iraqi state and stability in the region; offering assistance where appropriate and possible and alleviating humanitarian suffering. 'We have made it clear this does not involve planning a military intervention by the United Kingdom.' 'That is a very good argument for trying to advance our bilateral relations. Of course, we do also have to deal with the issue of Iran's nuclear programme. 'We do need Iran to make its contribution to stability in the region by seizing support for sectarian groups in other parts of the region.' It came amid reports that Tehran is considering military support to the Shia-led administration in Iraq. Representatives of Iran and the Western powers met in Vienna to discuss international concerns about Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. The Foreign Office declined to discuss the content of Mr Hague’s call. The Foreign Secretary will brief MPs on the latest situation in an oral statement to the House of Commons this afternoon. Prime Minister David Cameron’s official spokesman indicated that the UK saw a role for regional powers such as Iran in supporting the Baghdad government, telling reporters at a Westminster media briefing: 'In terms of the decisions around the immediate security response in Iraq, those are for the Iraqi authorities to take. 'Is there a wider regional issue here and is there a role in the region supporting the Iraqi government in trying as much as possible to take a broad-based and inclusive approach going forward and avoiding some of the risks of a sectarian approach, as the Foreign Secretary was talking about? Yes. 'Is there a role for the region and the international community as a whole to support this approach of unity and co-operation - as the Foreign Secretary described it this morning? Yes, I think there is a regional angle to it.' Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw  welcomed the Government's move to open talks with the Iranians - but called on Mr Hague to be 'more positive' about Britain's relations with the Middle Eastern power. He told the BBC's World at One radio programme: 'There is a strategic necessity and opportunity to engage more with Iran.' A map of northern Iraq shows the towns and cities taken over by Sunni insurgents and Kurdish Peshmerga . Britain will not block well-judged, targeted action by the US against Iraq, Nick Clegg said. The Deputy Prime Minister suggested the UK could allow its bases to be used to launch attacks on ISIS forces. Speaking at a press confernece in London, Mr Clegg said: 'We will not be providing active frontline military resources to the action taken. 'But we are certainly not going to stand in the way of action that is well-judged and well-targeted. I am not suggesting we will rule out passive assistance even if we are not going to embark on our own active role. 'We are not going to start deploying British military forces in Iraq. We will equally not stand in the way of America, in particular, seeking to take well-judged, targeted action. 'That is why it is sensible of President Obama to take his time to assess options. Obviously we will be comparing notes.' But Conservative Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee, warned against fuelling the unrest by involving Tehran because it is seen by Sunnis 'as part of the problem'. He told the programme: 'Involving them will strengthen al-Maliki's hand, it will provide resources to Baghdad but it is not going to solve the fundamental problem, which is regaining the trust of the Sunni population. 'They are going to be alienated by a stronger Iranian hand in Iraqi politics.' He added: 'It's a horrendous situation. Nobody should doubt that this is almost the worst nightmare that the West imagined in Iraq.' At the weekend Iran's President Rouhani refused to rule out working with Britain and the US to defeat the Iraqi insurgents. He said: 'When the US takes action, then one can think about cooperation. Until today, no specific request for help has been demanded. But we are ready to help within international law.' It is not clear how talks with Iran, which refers to the U.S. as the 'Great Satan', would take place, and other countries have expressed concern that any deal could damage negotiations on Tehran's nuclear program. Amid international outrage at the atrocity, President Obama is weighing up what help to give Baghdad to counter the land-grab by the al-Qaida-inspired ISIS. The British government has ruled out any new military intervention, in part because the Commons last year voted against action in Syria. Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘So many situations can arise in the world that we cannot predict that to absolutely rule all things out in all circumstances tends to be a mistake. ‘But in this situation today, in Iraq, with what we’ve seen in recent days, are we looking at a British military intervention? No, we’re not. I can’t be clearer than that.’ Britain has already offered humanitarian assistance for the Iraqi people displaced in the north, and Mr Hague hinted that British special forces could be offered. 'I’ve said that we might be able to help with counter-terrorism expertise. We are looking at that now,' he said. However, Mr Hague, who also voted for the 2003 war, denied that the invasion had itself been a mistake. 'No, I don’t think the invasion itself was a mistake. I have always thought that many mistakes occurred in the aftermath of the invasion. ‘It’s entirely possible to say that it was the right thing to remove Saddam Hussein, but that mistakes were made in the aftermath of that.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Britain would not attempt to 'stand in the way' of a well-judged US initiative to restore order in Iraq. Mr Clegg told a Whitehall press conference: 'We are not providing active, frontline resources to any action that is taken but of course we will want to talk to the United States and other allies about what can be done. 'We are certainly not going to stand in the way of action that is well-judged and well-targeted in order to try to re-assert some semblance of order in Iraq. I think only the United States can deploy the kind of resources that may make a difference.'","Hague holds talks with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif .
