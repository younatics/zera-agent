A couple of fast food addicts who ate every meal at McDonald's and Burger King have dropped 17 stone between them after ditching takeaway food. Emma and Dylan Smith gorged on three McMuffins each morning before returning for lunch where they would have two chicken wraps each. For dinner the pair, who have four children, would order burgers from Burger King. Emma Smith, left, weighed 22 stone, and her husband Dylan, right, weighed 17 stone when they were turned away from the rides at Butlins for being too fat and not being able to fasten the seatbelts . Emma now weighs 11 stone and has dropped to a size 14, while Dylan lost almost seven stone . Weighing nearly 40 stone between them, the couple, from Froome in Somerset, were shamed into losing weight when they found they were too fat for any of the rides during a family trip to Butlins. Emma, 28, said: ‘We would drop the children off at school and then go to McDonald's on our way home. We could easily munch our way through three McMuffins each every morning. ‘We lived on takeaway food. And we would snack on McFlurries and hot chocolates too. It was embarrassing as the staff at McDonald's knew us so well, they knew our order without us having to ask for it. ‘We weren’t getting any fruit or vitamins and we were anaemic because of it. I never used to cook at home, we would have McDonald's and Burger King for every meal.’ The couple kept piling on the weight . until they went to Butlins in June 2011 to celebrate their son's fourth . birthday but could not fit on any of the fun fair rides as the . seatbelts would not do up. Emma weighed 22 stone and Dylan, 41, weighed 17 stone. Emma said: ‘It wouldn’t click over my stomach. The . assistant saw me struggling and came over and told me that if I . couldn’t get it done up then I would have to get off the ride. They joined Slimming World and replaced takeaway meals with steamed vegetables and Weetabix . ‘Dylan couldn’t do his up either. We had to get off the ride with the children and they were crying. It was so embarrassing. 'It had upset the children so much. We had travelled all that way to go to Butlins and they were so excited about going.' Even playing with their children in the park was a problem because of their size. Emma said: ‘When we took the children to the park they would beg us to run around with them, but we just couldn’t. I’d have to stay sitting on the bench and Dylan’s stomach was nearly as big as mine, so he couldn’t either. ‘He couldn’t play football with the boys because he was so big and if we took them swimming I would wear T-shirts and shorts to hide my flab. I felt so guilty on the children as they were missing out.’ The couple joined Slimming World in January after struggling to lose the weight initially. Emma said: ‘We tried to lose the weight on our own, but we just couldn’t, so we decided that we would join Slimming World. That day at Butlins was so awful it made us realise that we had to take drastic action. Breakfast - 1,035 calories . Emma and Dylan would eat three bacon and egg McMuffins, right, each.Lunch - 660 calories . The pair would then return to McDonald's for two chicken wraps each. Dinner - 1,294 calories . The couple ate two KFC Zinger Burger Towers each, right. Snacks - McFlurries at 340 calories each and hot chocolate at 185 calories each . ‘We knew we had to ditch the McDonald's muffins and burgers - and not keep going to Burger King for tea either.’ By November last year, the couple had shed a staggering 17 stone between them. Emma now weighs 11 stone and has dropped from a size 28 to 14 and Dylan weighs 10 stone 10 and has lost ten inches from his waistline. To celebrate the family went straight back to Butlins - and this time they managed to get on all the rides. Emma said: ‘We got on the ride and I went to fasten up the safety harness - and this time it was no problem at all. The children were all thrilled. We had a great time. ‘We walk three hours a day and Dylan has taken up long boarding and we also are going to start swimming and running. ‘Dylan’s blood pressure is normal and I don’t have any more knee pain. We feel like two different people and it feels wonderful. ‘We don’t miss the burgers and muffins anymore - we enjoy eating healthily now.’","Emma and Dylan Smith weighed almost 40 stone between them .

Prospective jurors in the trial of the business partner of Maine's alleged 'Zumba prostitute' are being forced to answer personal questions about their views on sex and prostitution in open court. The questionnaire for potential members of the jury includes questions like, 'Do you have a personal or religious aversion to pornography?'; 'Are you of the opinion that prostitution should be legal?' and 'You may be shown explicit videos and photographs depicting individuals engaged in graphic sexual acts. Would viewing this evidence make it difficult for you to listen to?' On Friday, the judge in the case dismissed 46 of the 59 charges against Mark W. Strong, 59, who is accused of promoting prostitution and helping Zumba instructor Alexis Wright run a lucrative prostitution business out of her Zumba exercise studio in Kennebunk, Maine. Still on the hook: Mark Strong, right, is seen outside court with his lawyer Dan Lilley, left, last week. Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution . Sexually-charged: The prostitution charges against Alexis Wright, 30, and her business partner, Strong, have led lawyers to ask potential jurors numerous prying questions about their views on sex . Strong and Wright were both charged with invasion of privacy for allegedly videotaping Wright's encounters with the men who were paying her for sex. York County Superior Court Justice Nancy Mills ruled that the johns had no expectation of privacy when they  arrived at Wright's studio, allegedly intent on committing the crime of soliciting prostitution, the Portsmouth Herald reports. Wright's lawyer says she will fight to have the the invasion of privacy charge against her tossed, as well. However prosecutors have appealed the ruling to the Maine Supreme Justice Court, hoping to have the charges reinstated. Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution - all misdemeanors. Strong has admitted to having an affair with Wright, 30, and said he gave her a loan to fund her exercise studio. However, he denies that he knew about her alleged prostitution business or helped her promote it. Tossed: Justice Nancy Mills threw out the invasion of privacy charges against Strong, saying the johns who were allegedly videotaped by Wright had no expectation of privacy if they visited a prostitute . His lawyers say overzealous prosecutors and police have wasted valuable time and money to 'persecute' their client. The week the state supreme court also ruled that jury selection must be open to the public after the Portland Press-Herald sued, saying the media and the public should not have been barred from the proceedings. Now, prospective jurors in the close-night community must talk about their feelings about sex and sexuality in open court. Questions from a confidential jury selection sheet include: . 'Trumped up': Strong's lawyers argue that the state has spent an inordinate amount of time and money prosecuting the Kennebunk businessman and relatively minor charges . The Boston Herald speculates that lawyers might ask even more personal questions when they interrogate the jury pool - asking about domination fetishes and other sexual proclivities involved in the prostitution case. Prosecutors and Justice Mills argued that opening jury selection up to public scrutiny will make it even more difficult to find impartial jurors for the case that gained international attention and rocked the small Maine community.","Mark W Strong still faces 13 counts of promoting prostitution after the judge threw out the invasion of privacy charges against him .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 10:22 EST, 25 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:23 EST, 25 January 2013 . An elderly patient with suspected heart failure had to wait 18 hours for a bed after she was admitted to A&E. Kathleen Gummer, 76, arrived at a packed Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, south London, at around 6pm on January 20. But at 12pm the following day she was still in A&E, as staff had been unable to find a bed for her on a ward. Kathleen Gummer, who was rushed to A&E with suspected heart failure, had to wait 18 hours for a bed . Her daughter, Jacky Ware, 56, from Plumstead, south London, said she had called a doctor on January 20 when her mother started feeling unwell. Because of suspected heart failure, an ambulance was quickly called and Mrs Gummer was rushed to Woolwich. Ms Ware said: 'The initial assessment was done quickly and the wait for a doctor was a reasonable one. 'But then she was just left on a stretcher because they didn't have any beds in any wards anywhere. 'They didn't even have any pillows for her which was a surprise. The staff did their best they could by folding up blankets for her. 'Eventually, about 1.50am they got her off the stretcher and into a bed. She was in agony. 'By 2am I needed to go home and she was in a bed. But when I phoned the next day at about 11am or 12pm I was told that she was still in A&E. They still hadn't found her a ward. It's just appalling.' Ms Ware said her mother, diagnosed with pneumonia, was now well on the way to recovery. The hospital has denied reports that ambulances were being diverted away from Woolwich at the weekend. But Mrs Gummer's case will raise further concerns about proposals to close Lewisham's A&E, putting more pressure on neighbouring Woolwich which would serve 750,000 people across three boroughs. Ms Ware said: 'I have no complaint with the staff - it's the resources. They can't keep up with the current demand. For someone to sit there and say that it can cope if another A&E closes is just ridiculous. It can't.' Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, was swamped with patients suffering norovirus and the effects of winter weather . A spokesman for the South London Healthcare Trust said: ""We have apologised to Mrs Gummer for an unacceptably long wait in A&E last weekend. 'While the vast majority of our patients are treated in A&E within the four hour maximum waiting time period, there are times when patients wait longer due to the availability of beds if there are sudden surges in A&E attendances or if there are particular issues with discharging patients who are medically fit for discharge. 'In the small number of cases when a patient does have to wait in the A&E department before being admitted to a ward, it is normal practice for spare beds to be brought into the A&E patient bays where they are cared for in the same way as if in a ward. 'Last weekend there were unfortunately a number of patients who had to wait for longer than we would have wished and this was in part due to a smaller number of beds being available due to norovirus and a lower than usual number of discharges due to the severe weather conditions.'","Kathleen Gummer, 76, arrived at a packed Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, south London, at around 6pm on January 20 .

Fresh footage of the nightmare faced by drivers stranded during heavy snowfall has emerged as one of the UK's busiest motorways ground to a halt during a blizzard in the early hours of Saturday morning. Some drivers were stuck for as long as eight hours on the M6 between junctions 25 and 27 between Wigan and Chorley in Lancashire after a sudden deluge of snow. But as the footage shows, not everyone was willing to sit tight and wait for driving conditions to improve. Scroll down for video . In a hurry: While most motorists took the sensible option of sitting out the snow until driving conditions improved, some motorists, including the driver of this lorry, left, decided to speed through four inches of snow on the hard shoulder of the M6 . Impatient: The lorry is pictured flying up the hard shoulder spraying waiting cars with snow . Following suit: Seeing the progress made by the lorry, a white van follows suit flying up the hard shoulder of the M6 . Reckless: It's not just the hard shoulder that drivers are using to get ahead, a white van drives up the snow covered fast lane on the M6 on Friday night . Treacherous: A huge tailback of traffic pictured stranded on the M6 motorway late on Friday night after heavy snowfall . Chaos: The M6 motorway was blocked in both directions between junctions 25 and 27 in Lancashire when a sudden burst of more than a foot of snow brought drivers to a standstill around 8.30pm, the Highways Agency said . Jackknifed: A lorry is stranded in heavy snow on the M6 in the early hours of Saturday morning . The footage shows several drivers, including one in a heavy haulage vehicle flying down the hard shoulder of the M6 trying to beat the giant tailbacks. The motorway ground to a halt at around 8.30pm on Friday night after light sleet turned into a heavy snow drift which brought more than a foot of snow. Some drivers helped other motorists, while others took the time to have friendly snowball fights or build snowmen on the carriageway. But as the footage shows other people were a little bit more desperate to get to their final destination. Eye witnesses reported that a number of vehicles tried to drive around the blocked traffic using the hard shoulder but ended up crashing in the bad weather causing further tailbacks. Other drivers said that some drivers were so desperate to move that their cars were sliding from side to side, colliding with other vehicles. Bizarre: MP David Morris tweeted this picture of a snowman built on top of a car on the M6 during blizzard-like conditions on Friday night . Chief Inspector Mike Adamson said: 'We realised at about 11pm (on Friday night) that this was going to be a major incident. 'Some of the drivers and passengers have been stuck for hours - it has been a very difficult night for them. 'We have set up a command centre at Charnock Services, where officers have collected hot drinks and taken them to those who are stuck.' Mountain rescue workers walked along the four-mile stretch of the M6 in Lancashire overnight to check on the condition of drivers. A diabetic man was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital, while an ambulance taking a female patient to Royal Preston Hospital had to be dug out of the snow by Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue team. Phil O'Brien, team leader of Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue, said: 'It was potentially a very serious situation. The Highways Agency managed to get people moving at about 4.30 to 5am. 'There were hundreds of cars stuck but most people seemed in good spirits.' But while some drivers lightheartedly entertained themselves with snowball fights and building snowmen, one woman who got stuck on the M6 travelling home to Bootle from Wigan described the it as the 'scariest experience' she had had in 26 years of driving. Louise Jones, who spent five hours on the motorway making the 20 mile trip home, told ITV: 'We did not move at all, three lanes of cars were totally gridlocked. For the first three hours we left the engine running to keep warm, then turned it off and every car we could see was just sitting in the darkness, it was really eerie how silent it was. 'Eventually a snow plough drove along the hard shoulder at about 1am, then we saw nothing moving until a police car at 1.40am. Too dangerous: A car is left abandoned on a slip road beside junction 25 of the M6 in Lancashire . Abandoned: The driver of this car decided it was too dangerous to continue trying to drive and abandoned their car next to a slip road on the M6 . 'It really was horrendous. I can't understand why it took so long to clear enough space to direct traffic through. It was a total farce.' Lancashire Police also worked with Lancashire Mountain Rescue teams, the Highways Agency and neighbouring force Greater Manchester Police to clear roads and provide welfare assistance to those who were stranded. The Highway Agency worked throughout the night to clear the routes with snow ploughs. Kevin Collister, who was stuck on the motorway just past the M58 junction heading northbound, told Sky News: 'There is absolutely no movement whatsoever on my side of the carriageway, all the snow is squashed down into ice and there are wagons trying to move and sliding sideways.' He described how his 45 minute journey ended up taking right hours and claimed there were no emergency services in sight. He told the TV station: 'It was very heavy snow and absolute chaos. It was absolutely freezing. 'We saw one Highways Agency car drive past us and that was all. On the move: The M6 was moving again yesterday morning after some drivers were stranded for as long as eight hours overnight on Friday . Scene: The M6 was closed between junction 25 and 27 . 'It was only good Samaritans like us who went around to check on other drivers and make sure they were okay.' 'Everyone knew we were going to be there for a few hours so we all just made the best of it. People were having snowball fights over the central reservation and building snowmen to pass the time. 'I eventually got home at 6am this morning so was stuck for about ten hours.' Another person claimed a burger van stranded on the M6 started serving food to other drivers stuck on the M6. Paul Kingston tweeted: 'Motorists caught in M6 #uksnow storm in Lancs last night were saved from hunger, after stranded burger van opens up shop on carriageway.' Conservative MP for Morecambe & Lunesdale David Morris, who was stuck on the southbound carriageway, reported surreal scenes but a camaraderie among the drivers stuck in the snow. Deluge: It wasn't just the M6 that was affected by heavy snow. Pictured here is the B6479 in Horton, Ribblehead, North Yorkshire . Work cut out: A tractor with a snow plough attempts to clear some of the snow off the B6255 in Ribblehead, north Yorkshire . All white: Selside North Yorkshire, pictured in heavy snow on Friday . He told Mail Online: 'The snow just came out of nowhere -'I've never seen anything like it in my life. 'I set off around 8pm to go and pick up my son from Manchester and there was a little bit of sleet . 'But when I got on the M6 it just came down really suddenly. I'd already seen several gritters on the road but there was so much snow in such a short space of time there was little they could do. 'The traffic ground to a halt as the snow got heavier and we just started to get snowed in. 'The emergency services were fantastic and the Mountain Rescue Service and police were driving up and down the hard shoulder checking on people while they worked on getting the traffic flowing again. 'A few people have asked me if I don't think the gritters should have done a better a job but I don't think there's more they could have done. There was so much snow that the grit had little impact.'

A grandmother of a baby violently shaken by his father spoke out today about how the child will suffer a 'lifetime of hurt' and disability after the shocking attack. Patti VanOmmen, whose daughter, Kaylee Zalsman is the infant's mom, detailed the progress that her six-month-old grandson, Bentley, has made since his father repeatedly shook him and slammed his head against a laptop computer. 'Bentley is beautiful,' VanOmmen said following Justin McIntyre's sentencing to between 19-months and 10-years in a Michigan prison after being found guilty of second-degree child abuse. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mom, Kaylee Zalsman, plants a kiss on her special-needs son, Bentley . 'Bentley will be hurt the rest of his life,' VanOmmen told Michiganlive.com. She said her 19-year-old daughter is struggling with the hardships that come with the extra care Bentley now needs. 'Her dream, like any other young mother, of having the white picket fence is gone. 'Now, you know, to raise a special needs child, for the rest of her life, and his, is hard. 'It's tough on all of us,' VanOmmen added. Bentley recovers in a hospital room after being shook by his father . Bentley's struggles began on August 24 when McIntyre came home from work to take care of the baby. He later told cops that he grew enraged when the baby wouldn't stop crying and he threw him down on the bed. That's when Bentley hit his head against the corner of a closed laptop. McIntyre, 23, then picked him and shook him because he continued to cry. Bentley was rushed to the hospital, where he remained for three weeks with bleeding on the brain. He was initially unable to breathe on his own. He continues to see multiple doctors each week and experts won't know the extent of his health issues until he is older. 'We have no idea the significance of the brain damage,' VanOmmen explained. VanOmmen looks on as her daughter holds her grandson, Bentley . But there is reason to be optimistic. At just six-months-old, Bentley is making noises and attempting speech. The family created a Facebook page for people around the country who heard Bentley's heartbreaking story and wanted updates on his recovery. One relative posted a picture of Bentley sitting up on his own and smiling. 'Lil B full of smiles this morning!!,' said Autumn Green Ames. Justin McIntyre cradles his son, Bentley, days before he shook him and sent him to the hospital and towards a lifetime of health problems . After his sentencing Monday in Ottawa County Circuit Court, McIntyre only meekly said, 'I'm sorry.' He was convicted at a bench trial in December. His lawyer, Joseph Legatz, said after the conviction that McIntyre was a 'young, inexperienced father.' 'The kid suffers for what he did. He kicks himself every day for what he did in that split second,' Legatz said.","Six-month-old Bently will suffer health problems for rest of his life .

Nechemya Weberman, 54, who worked as an unlicensed therapist in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, showed no reaction to the judge's sentencing on Tuesday that followed an emotional testimony by his victim, now aged 18. ‘I clearly remember how I would look in the mirror.

Secrets: Weberman was a religious counselor in New York City's ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn before found guilty in December . The trial put a spotlight on the ultra-orthodox community in Brooklyn and its strict rules that govern clothing, social customs and interaction with the outside world. Both Weberman, 54, and the accuser belonged to the Satmar Hasidic sect. The teen and her family have been harassed and ostracized, reflecting long-held beliefs that any conflict must be dealt with from within. During the trial, men were arrested on charges they tried to bribe the accuser and her now-husband to drop the case. Others were accused of snapping photos of her on the witness stand and posting them online. She expressed hope that by coming forward, she could give strength to other victims of sexual abuse. Her school had ordered her to see . Weberman because she had been asking questions about her religion and . was dressing immodestly in violation of the sect’s customs, and it was . believed she needed to be helped back on the right path. Locked away: The victim testified that from the time she was 12-years-old until she was 15 Weberman abused her behind his locked office door . Reaction: Like Weberman, his wife Chaya Golda Weberman, seen arriving at the Brooklyn Supreme Court on Tuesday, showed no emotion to his sentencing . Weberman wasn’t a licensed counselor but spent decades working with couples and families in his community. There was no physical evidence of abuse. The court received dozens of letters from supporters of the defendant who described his life in the community as a counselor and a father. ‘Nechemya Weberman is innocent of the crimes charged,’ defense attorney George Farkas insisted at the sentencing. On Tuesday Weberman said ‘no thank . you’ when asked if he wished to speak. He and his wife had no visible . reaction to the sentence. The top charge carried a sentence of 25 years; . he got consecutive terms for some of the other charges. The . defense argued that the girl was angry that Weberman had told her . parents she had a boyfriend at the age of 15 which is forbidden in her . community. They claimed the girl went to police . only after Weberman and her parents set up hidden cameras to secretly . record the girl having sex with her boyfriend when she was still . underage. Weberman turned the tapes over to police in the hopes that the boyfriend would be prosecuted. The charges against the boyfriend were later dropped. Community support: Seen last May among other members of Williamsburg's community, the court received dozens of letters from his supporters who described his life in the community as a wholesome counselor and a father . Attorney Stacey Richman said the case boiled down to a simple ‘he said, she said,’ and the girl was a petulant, calculating liar. ‘The only evidence in this case of sexual abuse is the word of’ the accuser, Richman told jurors. ‘She’s making things up in front of you as they occur.’ Weberman's lawyers also claim that he had been business partners with the girl's parents and that the families had a falling out. But the jury took just hours in December to convict Weberman on all counts. The Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, rallied around the rabbi - sponsoring fundraisers to pay for his legal defense. The community numbers around 250,000 - the largest sect of its type outside of Israel. The group has its own ambulances, . volunteer police and rabbinical courts, and they are discouraged from . going to secular authorities. Weberman's supporters were so protective of him they disrupted the course of the trial when they allegedly photographed the accuser during her testimony. Four men were led out of a New York court room and arrested in late November after jumping up to take pictures of her on their phones while she gave evidence. Each was a  members of the strict Satmar sect in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, of which Rabbi Weberman is leader. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said he hoped the case would persuade other victims to come forward. Hynes has been accused of overlooking crimes in the community because he was too cozy with powerful rabbis, a charge he vehemently denies.","Nechemya Weberman, 54, was convicted on all .

Home: Prince Harry arriving at RAF Brize Norton after returning from a tour of duty in Afghanistan . Prince Harry has admitted he 'doesn't know what normal is anymore' after arriving back in the UK from his second tour of Afghanistan. The Apache co-pilot gunner has been on post-deployment 'decompression' at a British military base in Akrotiri, Cyprus, since leaving Helmand province on Monday night. Harry landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on a regular personnel flight but did not travel on with his unit, 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, to their base in Wattisham, Suffolk. The 28-year-old said a seven-year-old girl was shot down by insurgents on his final day on tour, adding: 'Normality is a very ambiguous thing.' He said: 'It was a hell of an experience. I’m really proud of the guys. It's very different to when I was last out there. I'm just thrilled to be back. A bit of blue sky in Cyprus, a bit of decompression, some comedy - and back to the snow. Four and a half months has gone very quickly. 'You get life experiences that you get nowhere else out there. The best thing about it is to be back. I'll be looking forward to getting back and seeing my family. Being away for four and a half months you forget what's happened in the news.' He told Sky News: ‘I don't know what . normal is anymore and never really have done. 'There's nothing normal . about what we've doing for the last four and a half months. 'In the last day that I was there a . seven-year-old girl got shot down by insurgents. Normality is a very . ambiguous thing. I will continue being myself. I will enjoy being a . soldier.'

Returning: Prince Harry walks down the steps of a Royal Air Force A-330 transport aircraft at RAF Brize Norton . Prince Harry’s Apache instructor will reveal tomorrow how the Prince once tricked foreign officials into thinking he was arriving on a later plane as they waited to meet him. Former Apache Squadron Commander Richard Youngs will praise him as a ‘very professional young officer’ who is ‘gregarious as all young officers tend to be’ and ‘absolutely dedicated’. He will tell ITV’s Tonight programme tomorrow at 8:30pm: ‘My favourite Harry moment is when we went mountain flying in France and landing at Le Touquet airport and a big entourage (was) coming out to meet him. ‘The French officer walks up to him – we were taking our immersion suits off and refuelling the aircraft – and the officer walked up to him and asked him when Prince Harry would be arriving. ‘He, quick as a flash, looked back at him and said “he's on the next aircraft in”, quickly smiled at me, gave me a wink, got back in the cockpit and we flew off. He's very quick.’ Harry added that he is hoping to carry out . more Royal duties and charitable work back in Britain. and said he is 'longing to catch up with . people behind closed doors - you guys (the media) aren't invited'. Harry didn't go with the rest of his 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, to their base. St James's Palace said he left Brize Norton privately, but did not say where he was headed. He said killing the Taliban is a job 'you would expect to do' as a soldier - 'a job for ourselves, a job for the guys left and right of us, and from my point of view, especially for the guys on the ground.' 'You get asked to do things that you would expect to do wearing this uniform, and it's a simple as that really.' The 28-year-old is . likely to have sunk his first beer in 20 weeks on the Mediterranean . island, as troops are given four cans of lager to help unwind after an . arduous tour in Helmand. Last night it emerged that Scotland . Yard chiefs are reviewing their protection for the 28-year-old after his . candid admission that he has killed enemy fighters while abroad. Returning: He flew on board a regular personnel aircraft - an Airbus A330 Voyager - and landed at the Oxfordshire base with his 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, at around 4.45pm . Interview: Prince Harry talked to Sky News after he arrived home at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire . The . prince revealed on Monday that he took Taliban fighters 'out of the . game' from the cockpit of Apache attack helicopters and admitted he 'let . himself down' by romping naked in Las Vegas just weeks before his . deployment. 'You get life experiences that you get nowhere else out there' Prince Harry . In an interview to mark the end of his . four-month tour of duty in Afghanistan, the third in line to the throne . confirmed he had been directly responsible for the deaths of one or more . insurgents as a co-pilot gunner. The prince said: ‘Yeah, so lots of people have. The squadron’s been out here. Everyone’s fired a  certain amount.’ He also suggested he was better at flying helicopters because of his experience at computer games. Candid interview: Last night it emerged that Scotland Yard chiefs are reviewing protection for the 28-year-old after he admitted he killed enemy fighters in Afghanistan . 'It's a joy for me because I'm one of those people who loves playing PlayStation and Xbox, so with my thumbs I like to think that I'm probably quite useful,' the prince told reporters. Former senior officers expressed surprise at his comments last night - and experts warned he had made himself 'a prime target'. The shadow defence secretary suggested that Harry had been overly 'candid' in discussing his role in the fighting. Dai Davies, former head of the Met’s . Royalty Protection Squad, said: ‘Purely from a protection point of view, . I think it was highly unadvisable for Prince Harry to draw attention to . himself.' Pilot: Prince Harry makes his early morning pre-flight checks in the cockpit on the flight-line at Camp Bastion . Another former senior officer, Glen . Smyth, ex-chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: ‘I think . it would have been better for Prince Harry to have simply said he had . been deployed in an operational capacity, and to have left it at that. 'The frank admission from Harry that he . had personally killed enemy fighters drew a backlash from anti-war . activists, some former soldiers and the Taliban themselves. 'He’s obviously a young and brave man. He was candid. Perhaps he may have been more candid than the Palace may have wished' Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy . A 'spokesman' for the Taliban described Harry as a 'coward', saying: ‘We have always wanted to capture or kill this prince, but he was mostly kept inside, safe, and in guarded places underground.' It is unusual for returning soldiers with any kind of profile to highlight their achievements in killing enemy fighters. Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy said: 'He’s obviously a young and brave man. He was candid. Perhaps he may have been more candid than the Palace may have wished.' But Prince Harry was also praised for his bravery during a debate in the House of Commons.","Scotland Yard reviewing protection for Prince, 28, after candid admission .

But the show has never been far from one man’s thoughts. Du Xin has opened a mini replica of the show’s Central Perk café in Beijing, China. Friends: Customers chat at a Beijing cafe modelled after the Central Perk cafe in the hit American sitcom Friends . Tucked away on the sixth floor of an office block, the café features the same orange couch, window and doorway and plays re-runs of Friends. Mr Xin, whose nickname is Gunther after the ‘Friends’ character who runs Central Perk, told National Public Radio: ‘I’m crazy about Friends. For me, it’s like a religion. It’s my life.’ The café serves the same snacks mentioned in the show and the menus are filled with fun facts and details from the series. And, it seems like Mr Xin’s idea has caught on, as a second Central Perk recently opened in Shanghai. His obsession doesn’t stop there, however. Obsessed: Du Xin, whose nickname is Gunther, owns the cafe and also has an apartment modelled on the character Joey's . Mr Xin has built a replica of the apartment that the character Joey lived in and it even has an identical foosball table, DVDs of the TV show Baywatch and an oversized cabinet similar to the one Joey made. The show is popular in China because it serves as a tool for learning English and is an introduction to American culture. People dream about the laid-back, friendship-filled lifestyle it portrays which is a far cry from the stressful and competitive world that young Chinese people inhabit. Mr Xin said: ‘That’s why we like Friends. We’re looking for this kind of life.’ He added: ‘I learned a lot from Friends: how to treat friends, girlfriends, my wife, how to be generous, how to be gentle.’ The real thing: The characters of Friends (pictured) used to spend a lot of time in the fictional Central Perk cafe in New York . Friends fans come from all over China to visit Central Perk. Qiu Yu, who lives in Beijing, took a friend visiting from Taiyuan, more than 300 miles away. For Ms Yu, the main attraction of the show is that six friends live on their own, away from the constraints of their families. She said: ‘I think their lives are very free, very happy. They can do whatever they like. For Chinese people the influence of our families is quite big. So we yearn for that lifestyle.’","Has same orange couch, window and doorway and plays Friends re-runs .

Actor Hugh Grant and writer Jemima Khan must be shown police information which indicates that their telephone messages might have been intercepted by a private investigator working for the press, a High Court judge ruled today. Mr Justice Vos ordered the Metropolitan Police to disclose information detectives had gathered during inquiries into alleged telephone hacking to Mr Grant and Ms Khan. The judge said Mr Grant and Ms Khan were entitled to see police documentation concerning messages allegedly intercepted by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and used in articles in 'the News of the World and other newspapers'. In a further development, News Corp announced today it is to terminate any arrangement to pay the legal fees of Mr Mulcaire 'with immediate effect'. Angry: Actor Hugh Grant and socialite Jemima Khan, seen at Westminster yesterday, now have the right to see messages allegedly intercepted by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and used in the News of the World and other newspapers . Four years ago private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were given jail terms after the Old Bailey heard that they plotted to hack into royal aides' telephone messages . At yesterday's hearing of the Commons . Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the media mogul's son James Murdoch . admitted he had been 'very surprised' to learn payments were being made . towards Mr Mulcaire's legal fees. Lawyers for Mr Grant and Ms Khan had . asked for the disclosure order during a High Court hearing in London. The application was not opposed by police.

Jonsson and ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, have launched damages claims . against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the News of the World. A civil trial at the High Court is due in January. Around 30 people, including jockey . Kieren Fallon, politicians Tessa Jowell, Chris Bryant and Mark Oaten, . interior designer Kelly Hoppen, sports agent Sky Andrew and former .

Phone hacking test cases brought by (from left) Jude Law, Kelly Hoppen, Chris Bryant and Paul Gascoigne are due to be heard in January . David Cameron making his statement on phone hacking to the House of Commons today . The development comes amid claims . that Rupert Murdoch's company was guilty of ‘deliberately thwarting’ the . criminal investigation into the News of the World, according to a . hard-hitting report published today. The Home Affairs Select Committee . study ‘deplores’ the behaviour of News International and condemns the . police for bungling their investigation and getting too close to the . Murdoch empire. The report raises questions about the . honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and . Andy Hayman, who oversaw the original 2006 police probe of the . newspaper. The Home Affairs Select Committee . said in its withering assessment today: ‘We deplore the response of News . International to the original investigation into hacking. ‘It is almost impossible to escape . the conclusion that they were deliberately trying to thwart a criminal . investigation. We are astounded at the length of time it has taken for . News International to co-operate with the police.’ The report points out that Mrs . Brooks’s denial of knowledge of phone hacking ‘is limited to her time as . editor of News of the World’, a small part of her career in News . International. And it also raises concerns about her . knowledge of illegal payments to corrupt police officers. ‘She did not . say that she had no knowledge of specific payments but that she had not . intended to give the impression that she had knowledge of specific . cases,’ the MPs conclude. The committee condemns the police, . singling out former assistant Met commissioner Mr Hayman,  criticising . his handling of the case, his social contacts with News International . executives and his decision to take a job with the firm after leaving . the police.

In another development it was claimed . today that Buckingham Palace was 'troubled' by David Cameron's decision . to hire Andy Coulson. Labour MP Chris Bryant made the . extraordinary revelation to the BBC. He said: 'Very senior people at . Buckingham Palace were very troubled by the appointment of Andy Coulson . and tried to make it absolutely clear to the Prime Minister. 'I am not sure whether this . information ever got directly to the Prime Minister, but it certainly . got to senior figures at Downing Street. 'The Queen's grandchildren had their . phones hacked.

'After all, Andy Coulson was the . editor of the News of the World when the royal princes' phones were . hacked. That is not in dispute.

Al Shabaab's social networking account, which has thousands of followers, was offline today with a message saying: 'The profile you are trying to view has been suspended'. It was not immediately clear why the account, which was created in 2011 under the HSM PRESS Twitter handle, was suspended. The account was still unavailable as of 1233 GMT.

'It's an emphatic no. We would not try to negotiate or have anything to do with the Al Shabaab. We didn't even know the account was suspended,' said government spokesman Muthui Kariuki. Al Shabaab posted on the account on Wednesday a link to a video of two Kenyan civil servants held hostage in Somalia, telling the Kenyan government their lives were in danger unless it released all Muslims held on 'so-called terrorism charges' in the country. 'Kenyan government has three weeks, starting midnight 24/01/2013 to respond to the demands of HSM if the prisoners are to remain alive,' the group said.

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men but is bottom of the league for research spending . Just £17million was spent by government and charitable sources in 2011, which works out at £417 for each of the 40,841 men diagnosed with the disease that year. In contrast, breast cancer has the highest research funding of any cancer at £41.6million, with leukaemia receiving the most per patient (£3,903). Prostate cancer kills one man every hour and the number of men with the disease is rising at an alarming rate. It is predicted to become the most common cancer in the UK by 2030.

The Tory Party is failing to win over ethnic minority voters because it remains tarnished by the legacy of Enoch Powell, a Conservative minister said yesterday. Treasury minister Sajid Javid – whose father emigrated to the UK from Pakistan in 1961 with just £5 in his pocket – said the Tories are still being hurt by their association with Mr Powell. In April 1968, Mr Powell, a member of Ted Heath’s shadow cabinet, delivered his hugely controversial ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech which was widely condemned as racist. Treasury minister Sajid Javid said the Tory party's image had not recovered from the anti-immigration speeches made by former minister Enoch Powell . Senior government sources say that David Cameron is so concerned that the issue of race is damaging support for the Tories that he is planning to address it head-on with a speech in the next two months. The Prime Minister chaired a Cabinet meeting last week at which ministers were shown evidence that the single biggest factor in voters not backing the Tories is race – far outweighing wealth, class or where someone lives. But Mr Javid’s intervention, in an interview with The Spectator magazine, will anger those Tories who bristle at any suggestion that the Conservatives are the ‘nasty party’. Mr Javid said that when his father’s friends were told that he had become an MP they assumed he must be representing the Labour Party. Mr Javid said David Cameron should give a major speech to improve the Tory party's image with ethnic minority voters . ‘I said to him, “Dad, why do you think that’s the case?” He said “I’ll sum it up for you in two words – Enoch Powell”.’ Mr Javid added: ‘The damage that was done to the party’s image in the 1970s, particularly by Enoch Powell, is something we still haven’t been able to shake off.’ He said this will ‘require the Prime Minister, someone of that standing’, to say Enoch Powell ‘doesn’t represent what the Conservative Party is today in any way and to set out what the Conservative Party actually  is when it comes to race relations, multiculturalism and so forth’. Mr Powell was sacked from the Tory front bench after his speech in 1968 but many right-wingers believe he was prophetic about the effects of mass immigration on British society. Mr Cameron has already asked for ideas for a speech to combat the idea that the spirit of Powell is alive in the modern Tory Party and is seeking ideas for policies which will dramatise the common values between Conservatives and non-white voters. Conservative research shows that many ethnic minority voters share Tory values on the promotion of family and hard work. Campaign bosses believe the Tories can boost their support with the Sikh community and middle class voters of Indian origin. But they have been told by pollsters that they will struggle to win more votes from the black community and among poor Muslim immigrants. Mr Cameron has already set up Conservative Friends of India and other groups to cement relations with the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. Enoch Powell was a senior Conservative politician in the 1950s and 1960s, serving as a Treasury minister and health minister under Harold Macmillan. But in 1968 he was sacked as shadow defence secretary by Tory leader Ted Heath for a controversial speech on Commonwealth immigration. He claimed that not all immigrants wanted to integrate in Britain, instead seeking to foster racial and religious differences 'with a view to the exercise of actual domination, first over fellow-immigrants and then over the rest of the population'. He added: 'As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"".' It became known as the Rivers of Blood speech. Heath said it was 'inflammatory and liable to damage race relations'. More than 40 years later, Treasury minister Sajid Javid said that damage has still not been repaired.

The infection is as grim as it sounds: 'Zombie bees' have a parasite that causes them to fly at night and lurch around erratically until they die. And experts say the condition has crept into Washington state. 'I joke with my kids that the zombie apocalypse is starting at my house,' said Mark Hohn, a novice beekeeper who spotted the infected insects at his suburban Seattle home. Zombie invasion: Mark Hohn, a novice beekeeper in Washington, holds up a plastic bag with a dead zombie bee and pupae - two at each end of the bag. Hohn returned from vacation a few weeks ago to find many of his bees either dead or flying in jerky patterns and then flopping on the floor. He remembered hearing about zombie bees, so he collected several of the corpses and popped them into a plastic bag. About a week later, the Kent man had evidence his bees were infected: the pupae of parasitic flies. 'Curiosity got the better of me,' Hohn said. The zombie bees were the first to be confirmed in Washington state, The Seattle Times reported. San Francisco State University biologist John Hafernik first discovered zombie bees in California in 2008. Hafernik now uses a website to recruit citizen scientists like Hohn to track the infection across the country. Observers also have found zombie bees in Oregon and South Dakota. The infection is another threat to bees that are needed to pollinate crops. Hives have been failing in recent years due to a mysterious ailment called colony collapse disorder, in which all the adult honey bees in a colony suddenly die. Life cycle of the zombie fly: The parasite attacks the creature, in a destructive circle of life . The life cycle of the fly that infects zombie bees is reminiscent of the movie 'Alien,' the newspaper reported. A small adult female lands on the back of a honeybee and injects eggs into the bee's abdomen. The eggs hatch into maggots. 'They basically eat the insides out of the bee,' Hafernik said. After consuming their host, the maggots pupate, forming a hard outer shell that looks like a fat, brown grain of rice. That's what Hohn found in the plastic bag with the dead bees. Adult flies emerge in three to four weeks. Mark Hohn, a novice beekeeper, checks out bees in one of the hives in the backyard of his Kent, Washington home. His are the firm zombie bee infections found in the state. There's no evidence yet that the parasitic fly is a major player in the bees' decline, but it does seem the pest is targeting new hosts, said Steve Sheppard, chairman of the entomology department at Washington State University. 'It may occur a lot more widely than we think,' he said. That's what Hafernik hopes to find out with his website, zombeewatch.org. The site offers simple instructions for collecting suspect bees, watching for signs of parasites and reporting the results. Once more people start looking, the number of sightings will probably climb, Hohn said.","Infected animals found in Washington for the first time as fears grow invasion is spreading .

TV star Martin Clunes today branded car insurance company Churchill ‘rude’ for dropping him from its adverts after he was disqualified from driving. The Men Behaving Badly and Doc Martin star featured in the lucrative television adverts alongside the company's trademark nodding dog for almost a year. But Churchill Insurance axed Mr Clunes in November after he accrued 12 points on his licence for speeding offences and magistrates banned him from driving. Adverts: Martin Clunes, who featured with an animatronic version of the Churchill dog travelling together on a motorbike and sidecar through the English countryside, said he had not expected to be dropped . Mr Clunes, 51, who featured with an animatronic version of the Churchill dog travelling together on a motorbike and sidecar through the English countryside, said he had not expected to be dropped. ‘I was very surprised by their reaction. It was neurotic and very heavy-handed,’ he told the Radio Times magazine. ‘Quite rude, actually. They never said goodbye. They never said thanks. 'They washed their hands of me completely.’ Mr Clunes lives with his family on a 135-acre Dorset farm with horses, dogs, cats, sheep, chickens and cows. He added: ‘I imagine there'll come a time when television withdraws itself from me. ‘I do love my job. But I'd really like the farm to wash its face. That's still a way off, because there's been a lot of investment in infrastructure. Shhh: Churchill Insurance axed Mr Clunes in November after he accrued 12 points on his licence for speeding offences and magistrates banned him from driving . ‘It wasn't really farmed before and it is now, so that's been an outlay, which will take a while to get back.’ 'I was very surprised by their reaction. It was neurotic and very heavy-handed. Quite rude, actually. They never said goodbye. They never said thanks' Martin Clunes . He said that he had been lambing for two years, adding: ‘It's a real effort to get up at 2am and go out into the cold and wet to check them, but once you get there, it's sort of a maternity ward. ‘I do quite like the ewes, especially when they're pregnant, and when you get that first bleat from the newborn lamb, it's pretty good.’ Mr Clunes admitted that working on the farm was a learning curve and that he had made some mistakes. He said: ‘There was one occasion when the . (newborn) lamb was already dead, and I went back in and pulled another . one out that was perfectly healthy. Magazine: The interview with Martin Clunes can be read in the latest issue of the Radio Times, on sale today . ‘I left the mother that night, but when I went back she was obviously poorly, and then she died, probably because there was another lamb inside that had died.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 04:25 EST, 25 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:48 EST, 25 January 2013 . The mistle thrush is fast disappearing from the UK's gardens, wildlife experts warned today as they urged people to take part in an annual survey to collect information about bird species. Results from the RSPB's annual Big Garden Birdwatch survey have shown that mistle thrushes are now being seen in fewer than half the number of gardens they were spotted in 10 years ago. The RSPB is urging the public to take part in this year's survey, which takes place this weekend, to help gather important information on how mistle thrushes and other garden bird species are faring. Under threat: Sightings of the mistle thrush are down 28 per cent between 1995 and 2010 and wildlife experts are asking the public to look out for them and other birds in the annual Big Garden Birdwatch survey . The event, described by the conservation charity as the world's biggest wildlife survey, is now in its 34th year. Since starting in 1979 it has helped highlight dramatic declines in some garden birds. Starling numbers have fallen from an average of 15 per garden in 1979 to just three in 2012, while house sparrow numbers have fallen by two-thirds in the same period, although the two species are still the most commonly seen. But some birds have seen their fortunes improve, with garden birds such as blue tits, great tits and coal tits on the increase since 1979. And goldfinches, which were absent from the Big Garden Birdwatch in its early years, have featured regularly in the top 15 species spotted since 2004. Fast disappearing: House sparrow numbers have fallen by two-thirds between 1979 and 2010 . Martin Harper, RSPB conservation director, said: 'Everyone that has ever taken part in Big Garden Birdwatch has helped to make us aware of huge changes in the populations of birds like house sparrows, starlings and song thrushes, leading us to do more work on the decline of these familiar birds. 'Mistle thrushes are already on the amber-list of conservation concern and are closely related to the threatened song thrush. The rate of decline we've seen throughout Big Garden Birdwatch suggest both these species are in need of help.' Named for their fondness for mistletoe berries, mistle thrushes are large, aggressive and powerful songbirds. They are also known as stormcocks after country legends that they are the last birds to be heard before a storm. Mistle thrushes sing throughout the winter to defend territories that are rich in fruit, making their song the easiest way to recognise them. They can also be identifed by their pale, black-spotted plumage and are most likely to be noticed at perched high atop trees. Early nesters, their mournful songs can be heard echoing across chilly gardens as early as February. 'It's a species that very often people will mistake for a song thrush. They're both medium sized, brown and white birds with large spots,' said the RSPB's Graham Madge. 'But mistle thrushes are great characters and they will very often give their presence away by their call.' Graham Madge of the RSPB told the BBC that there is still much to learn about just why mistle thrush numbers are in such a steep decline. 'It's reaching rates where as a community we should begin to develop some concerns because its population does seem to be haemorrhaging from our gardens, woodlands and countryside,' he said. 'Over the last six or seven years of Big Garden Birdwatch, the participants have been telling us that mistle thrushes have been declining - even over that short period.' Last year almost 600,000 people, including 90,000 pupils and teachers at schools, took part in Birdwatch activities, counting 9million birds between them. The survey, which sees volunteers count the bird visitors to their garden for an hour over the last weekend in January, is described as the largest citizen science project in the world. People can take part by spending an hour at any time this weekend counting birds in their garden or park, noting the highest number of each bird species seen at any one time and submitting the results to the RSPB. Schoolteachers and children will be doing the same thing in their school grounds as part of the Big Schools Birdwatch over the next week. Sarah Houghton, RSPB manager for the Birdwatch, said: 'No matter where people take part, whether at home with the family, with classmates at school or with friends in the beer garden of the local pub, we’re all joining forces to gather vital information about some of our most familiar garden birds. 'It’s a great way to get to know the creatures that live around us, and that’s especially important for children. 'Feeding garden birds can often be a child’s first encounter with wildlife and can spark a lifelong interest in nature.' She added: 'The declines of birds like starlings and sparrows over the last 30 years or so have been alarming, but Big Garden Birdwatch has helped us find out more about their numbers and distribution across UK gardens, and that has been the first step in helping to put things right.'

A recession-hit businessman who threw himself from a canal bridge was found with a note saying: 'No work, no money, no pension, no future,' an inquest has heard. Married father-of-two Raymond Hollingsworth had celebrated his 60th birthday only days before a dog walker found his body hanging from a bridge, the coroner was told. The keen gardener had taken out business loans and credit cards without telling his wife of 42 years after discovering his private pension scheme was not going to mature as planned. Raymond Hollingsworth had recently celebrated his 60th birthday when his body was found hanging from a bridge . The self-employed businessman's body was discovered hanging over Basingstoke Canal by father-of-three Philip Hinsley while he was out for a morning walk with his dog on November 27 last year, North East Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley heard. Mr Hollingsworth's distraught wife Linda, who chose not to attend the hearing, told police her husband was a family man who had shown no signs of being unhappy. The couple lived with their son Mark, 24, and their daughter, Ria, 27, is married and lives in Cambridge. Mr Hollingsworth also ran his own business as a window cleaner, working in Harrow, north-west London. A statement by Mrs Hollingsworth, 57, was read out during the hearing which described her husband as a keen gardener who would go running three of four times a week, running seven to eight miles. 'At weekends we would often go to visit our daughter in Cambridge or she would visit us,' she said. Happy family: Raymond Hollingsworth with his family including wife Linda who said he had shown no signs of being unhappy . On November 20, Mr Hollingsworth had celebrated his 60th birthday. 'In the lead up to his birthday he was a bit upset, saying he didn't want to be 60,' said Mrs Hollingsworth. The couple were joined by family and friends for a celebration meal on November 24 which they had enjoyed, she added in her statement. The night before Mr Hollingsworth's body was found, the couple had been at home and watched television together. 'Nothing that evening was any different from any other night,' his wife added. The following morning she believed her husband had gone to work and only learned this was not the case when the police visited the family home in Fleet, Hampshire, after Mr Hollingsworth's body was found. Mrs Hollingsworth told officers: 'Raymond was a very proud man who struggled to talk about himself or his problems but was very good at talking to people if they had problems. 'He loved his family and time spent with them. Mr Hollingsworth learned about four years before his death that a private pension he had set up in around 1989 or 1990 would not pay out as planned, his wife said. Since his death she had discovered he had taken out a number of loans and credit cards, including two business loans with Barclays which she did not know about. 'I think if we had discussed it we could have sorted it out but throughout our marriage Raymond had dealt with the finances and I never interfered,' she said. Mr Hollingsworth had shown no signs of being depressed in the days ahead of his death, according to Mrs Hollingsworth. Raymond Hollingsworth (left) who took out business loans and credit cards without telling his wife Linda (right) She added: 'We didn't argue and were a loving, caring family.' Dog walker Mr Hinsley said he had been out for a 25-minute stroll after leaving his home in nearby Crookham Road when he discovered Mr Hollingsworth's body. Giving evidence, Police Constable Kevan Wright said Mr Hollingsworth's body was discovered hanging from a metal fence running across the bridge. 'There was no sign of any struggle or foul play,' he told the court. Officers searching the pockets of Mr Hollingsworth's quilted black anorak and light-blue jeans discovered his keys and a passport. PC Wright told the coroner: 'Inside the passport there was a note saying ""no work, no money, no pension, no future"".' The note had been signed by Mr Hollingsworth, he added. Pathologist Dr Chris Smith carried out a post-mortem examination on Mr Hollingsworth's body. Coroner Mr Bradley recorded a verdict of suicide. Earlier this week, mental health charity SANE reported the damaging effects of the recession were blamed for the significant increase in the number of middle-aged men committing suicide. Latest figures revealed the suicide rate among men aged between 45 and 59 years old increased between 2007 and 2011 by 8.5 per cent to 22.2 deaths per 100,000 people - the highest level for a generation.

Every year a Remembrance Service is held at the central London monument to commemorate British and Commonwealth servicemen and women who died in the two World Wars and later conflicts . But to mark 100 years since the First World War, the names of every German soldier who died during the conflict could appear alongside the British dead.

Thomson told The Sunday Times: 'A soldier said to me, ""Once we are beneath ground, all men are equal. Only the men above ground create differences.""' The plans, which have the backing of Canada, include projecting the names of the war dead including Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, onto a wall behind The Cenotaph starting from 2014, a century after the year they died. The names of British servicemen and women would also be displayed for several minutes while overseas soldiers would be shown for 25 seconds each. It is believed the roll call would be made up of 9.5million names from all nations which took part in the Great War. Families would be able to look up the names of their relatives on a website to find out when they would appear. The roll call would begin a few weeks before Remembrance Sunday and would cost about £2.2m. Heritage Lottery Fund is expected to receive a bid for for about £150,000 which would cover Britain's share of the cost. But Major-General Mungo Melvin, an adviser to the Ministry of Defence on centenary events, said the public may not support the idea of German soldiers being remembered at The Cenotaph.

A parish council clerk helped herself to £28,000 of taxpayers money when she plunged into debt and took out a number of pay-day loans, a jury heard today. Lynne Turner, 50, is accused of regularly transferring money from the parish council’s bank account into her own after she amassed £90,000 of debt and then took out loans from Wonga.com. She was arrested after her successor at the council noticed £28,200 was unaccounted for. Turner, of High Wycombe, worked at Hughenden Parish Council in Buckinghamshire for 17 years before quitting in September 2011. She told police when she was arrested two months later she had taken a series of high-interest pay-day loans after spiralling into debt. She said in interview: ‘We didn’t have enough money saved. We got several loans to pay off each other. It was robbing Peter to pay Paul.’ But she said she did not know how the parish council money got into her account and said it was not done on purpose. Gavin Holme, prosecuting, told Oxford Crown Court, that Turner took the first sum of £300 from the council’s current account on August 28, 2010. He said £21,900 was taken in 2009-10 and six separate sums of £1,000 the following year. Mr Holme said: ‘During the period August 2010 to May 2011 Mrs Turner dishonestly, without any honest reason at all, transferred sums from Hughenden Parish Council’s account into her own account for her own use.’ He said as parish clerk, Turner had access to all the authority’s accounts and was able to transfer funds. When her successor Charlotte Watts took over the role she noticed the missing money, which had been labelled ‘correction and ‘cash in transit’ in the council books. But when she questioned Turner about what this meant she was not given an answer. It was only when Mrs Watts spoke to the council’s bank staff that she discovered it had been paid into Turner’s own account. Mrs Watts told the court: ‘Mrs Turner suggested there had been some sort of bank error, or a mistake and the figure should no longer be on the account and I should clear it from the account. ‘I didn’t feel at the end of our phone call that I understood it any better. ‘Once I established, to my great amazement, where the £6,000 pounds had gone I started thinking about whether that was the same case with the £21,900 pounds from the previous year.’ The court was told Turner had amassed about £90,000 in debt, on top of a £380,000 mortgage, and started to struggle financially when she and her husband Paul moved in 2004 and built an extension on their home. Her husband had left his job as an accountant to work as a gardener and she was also supporting her unemployed son. Turner has denied ten counts of fraud by abuse of position at the trial at Oxford Crown Court, pictured . Mr Holme said: ‘She was also helping her son who was causing considerable cost to her. ‘In January 2010 she got herself into a bit of trouble. She said she did not tell her husband about the trouble they were in and he did not know details of the financial position.’ Bank statements from the time show a number of loans of Wonga.com and Pounds to Payday before the first transfer from the parish council. When questioned by police Turner said she did not know how the transfers took place. Mr Holme said: ‘Clearly she was struggling financially at the time. ‘She, for whatever reason, thought this was the appropriate way to deal with it. ‘There is no indication she offered to pay back the money before she left Hughenden Parish Council in 2011.’ Turner denies ten counts of fraud by abuse of position.

The parents of a baby girl delivered brain dead after a series of 'critical failures' by hospital midwives want health bosses to ensure lessons are learned so the 'same tragedy won't happen again'. Imogen Skelcher suffered irreversible brain damage in the womb and her life support machine was switched off when she was just two days old. She died in the arms of her parents Samantha Hewings and David Skelcher in March 2011. The couple have been awarded a five figure sum after launching legal action against the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, following their daughter's death. David Skelcher (left) and Samantha Hewings (right) holding a photograph of their daughter Imogen who suffered brain damage in the womb . Legal firm Irwin Mitchell, which is acting for the parents, from Atherstone in Warwickshire, says the hospital trust has now settled the matter with an undisclosed payment to pay for grief counselling. An . independent report found staff at the hospital had not followed . guidelines, and failed to spot Imogen's heart rate was dangerously low. Miss . Hewings, 27, suffered a ruptured uterus during the birth in March 2011, . and Imogen was eventually delivered by Caesarean section.

Baby Imogen Skelcher died in the arms of her parents Samantha Hewings and David Skelcher, right, after she was born brain dead following a series of 'critical failures' at George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton . They already had a young son Jack born in 2009, and have since had another baby boy named Alfie. Miss Hewings said: 'After I was induced and went into labour the pain was far worse than anything I had experienced. 'I knew something wasn't right. I was so distracted with the pain I didn't notice the heart monitor and how low Imogen's heart rate was dropping. 'As soon as I realised, I called a midwife and she notified a doctor and I was rushed for a caesarean section. An independent report found staff at George Eliot Hospital, pictured, had not followed guidelines and failed to spot Imogen's heart rate was dangerously low . 'Nothing can turn back the clock, but . we just hope that the hospital trust has learned lessons so the same . tragedy won't happen again.' The trust offered its 'profound apologies for the failings in care provided' to the couple, saying lessons had been learned. The report found staff had failed to identify the pregnancy as high risk despite Miss Hewings's first baby Jack being delivered by Caesarean. It concluded staff had also failed to recognise and act on Miss Hewings's deteriorating condition, and failed to communicate the urgency of the situation, stating there had been a lack of communication throughout the labour and approved guidelines had not been followed. The report recommended educating labour ward staff on heart monitoring, improving communication between midwives and doctors, more thorough note-taking and a tightening of guidelines for natural births following a C-section. Imogen's parents later decided to donate their daughter's organs so others might avoid the trauma of losing a child. Sara Burns, partner at Irwin Mitchell's, said: 'An independent report highlighted a series of critical errors made by midwives and included recommendations to ensure the same mistakes cannot be made again. Samantha Hewings and partner David Skelcher with sons Jack (right) and Alfie (left).

'It is absolutely vital that the trust now proves these recommendations have been implemented to give peace of mind to current and future patients that their safety is the top priority.' A spokesman for the hospital said: 'George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family and offers its profound apologies for the failings in the care provided. 'Several lessons have been learned as a result of this case and changes implemented to improve processes as a result.

But when bailiffs arrived with bolt-cutters yesterday, Chrissie Hynde’s daughter stood little chance. Natalie Hynde, whose mother is the lead singer of the Pretenders, was arrested by police on suspicion of trespassing after tree-climbing experts pulled her down from her perch. Arrest: Natalie Hynde is led away from the trees by bailiffs who arrived at the protest in East Sussex today . The 28-year-old, whose mother is the . lead singer of the Pretenders, had spent weeks in a snow-covered . treehouse 15ft off the ground to try to prevent the development tearing . through a beauty spot. And on Monday night she bolted herself to a branch some 40ft off the ground in anticipation of a visit by bailiffs. However, the enforcement officers used . bolt cutters to free her before lowering her to the ground in a plastic . body bag yesterday afternoon. Miss Hynde, whose father is Ray Davies of The Kinks, was then given a medical check-up before being arrested. She has said her decision to join the . protest group was in part because of the ‘inspiration’ of her mother, . who was arrested in 2000 for protesting about animal rights outside a . New York branch of the Gap clothing chain. Environmentalist: Natalie Hynde moved to nearby St Leonards-On-Sea last year before she joined the protestors at Combe Haven Valley . Action: Miss Hynde has to be cut down from the tree after she bolted herself to a branch to try and prevent land clearing for the construction of a by-pass in the Combe Haven valley at Crowhurst near Hastings . Refusing: Miss Hyde had to be winched down before she was arrested for trespassing . Determined: Once on the ground Miss Hyde did not go willingly . Miss Hynde moved to St Leonards-On-Sea . in East Sussex last year, and joined protesters trying to protect the . nearby Combe Haven Valley beauty spot just after Christmas. Developers plan to build a link road . that will connect Bexhill with Hastings, concreting over a swathe of . ancient forest and rolling farmland in the process. Gabriel Carlyle, of the protest group Combe Haven Defenders, said: ‘I’m sure Natalie’s mother will be very proud of her. ‘She has been part of the protest group who have had to endure terrible weather conditions. ‘On Monday night she bolted herself onto the tree because she knew the bailiffs were coming the following day.' Cut down: Before her arrest Miss Hynde had spent the night 40ft up in a tree as a way of preventing the bailiffs from removing her . Not giving in: Miss Hynde appears to have laid down on metal barriers to prevent bailiffs from cordoning off the area . In vain: Miss Hyde is seen talking to bailiffs after she was forcibly removed from the tree which she had bolted herself to late Monday night . ‘She had to cope with driving rain and . winds of 44mph. She was 40ft above the ground and away from her food . and provisions.’ Mr Carlisle, 38, of St Leonards-On-Sea, added: ‘Some of . the protesters were so cold that they couldn’t physically climb down by . themselves. They had to be winched down.’ Yesterday police also . arrested a 29-year-old man from Leeds and a 54-year-old Hastings man. All three were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and obstruction of a High Court official. Campaigners say 26 protesters have been arrested since they set up camp on December 14. Activist: Nathalie Hynde, daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders, and Ray Davies of The Kinks, sits in a tree house during a protest . Family tradition: Natalie said her decision to join the protest, left, was inspired by her mother Chrissy, right, who was arrested in 2000 during an animal rights protest in New York . Last night six protesters were still thought to be attached to trees in the woods. Before her arrest Miss Hynde said her 61-year-old mother was ‘delighted’ to see her taking a stand. ‘She’s my mother so of course she’s anxious about my health and worried that I’m keeping warm enough,’ she said. ‘She’s concerned about things like . pneumonia, because it is bitterly cold. But she’s confident that I know . what I’m doing and sensible. She knows that we all take very good . precautions to make sure we stay healthy. ‘She’s been a great influence on me, . and one of the reasons we are so opposed to this road is because of the . impact it will have on animals in the area.' Fighter: Miss Hynde and fellow protestors say the construction of the road will destroy the unspoilt Combe Haven Valley . No-frills: Natalie Hynde spent several weeks in the makeshift camp before eviction day today . Plan: The proposed route of the new road between Bexhill and Hastings . Ms Hynde added: ‘This is a wildlife haven and the road will destroy much of that. My main concern is climate change and . the increased damage this will do to the planet by increasing . emissions.’ Many of those taking part in the protest are in their 50s . and 60s and choosing to take up activism rather than wind down to . retirement. Miss Hynde’s fellow protesters . included 58-year-old grandmother Hilda Stewart and Simon ‘Sitting Bull’ Medhurst, who dug a tunnel underneath the road building site in a bid to . stop the development.

A grandfather has been found guilty today of racially abusing two Premier League footballers in front of his wife, children and grandson. Everton fan William Blything hurled racist insults at Queen’s Park Rangers’ Korean captain Park Ji-Sung and Everton forward Victor Anichebe as his team drew 1-1 at Loftus Road on October 21. Blything, from Wavertree, Liverpool, denied a count of racially-aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress but was found guilty at West London Magistrates’ Court. However, he remained defiant after the verdict and said he is not racist and that his daughter has a 'coloured boyfriend.' Defiant: William Blything, outside West London Magistrates' Court, said he was not racist and that his daughter had a 'coloured boyfriend' The 42-year-old was arrested after two fellow Evertonians reported him to stewards as he watched the game with his wife, 16-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son and three-year-old grandson. Everton fan Neil Jordan told the court that he was 'outraged' by the abuse. He posted a picture of Blything on Twitter, referring to him as a 'racist t***' before reporting him to stewards at the ground. Mr Jordan said he first noticed Blything when he made one of his children cry by telling him to 'man up' when QPR scored a goal. He later heard the Blything refer to Anichebe, who is originally from Nigeria, as a 'f****** black monkey'. Mr Jordan said: 'At that point I realised that it wasn’t an isolated incident. 'There . was clearly some intent to target that player because, in my opinion, . of the colour of his skin, coupled with general agitation and abuse . aimed at the home end and abuse towards another opposition player.' Louise Thomas, prosecuting, told the court that Mr Jordan was left 'shaking and distraught' by the abuse. Also giving evidence, Everton fan John Murmame said he heard Blything shout 'Take down that chink' in reference to Park. Mr Murmame said: 'I go to a lot of football games but this was exceptional.' Blything was arrested after two fans reported him to stewards after hearing the abuse and posted this picture on Twitter referring to him as a 'racist t***' Everton fan Blything hurled racist abuse at his own player defender Victor Anichebe, left, and Queen's Park Rangers captain Park Ji-Sung, right, during the match at Loftus Road . Passing verdict, District Judge Jeremy . Coleman said the defendant would not face a custodial penalty when he . is sentenced on February 11. He said: 'If the players had heard these comments - and there is no evidence that they did - it would have caused them upset.' He added that he had taken into account that children had witnessed the abuse. 'This took place at a football match and we have a major problem as far as racist behaviour at football is concerned,' he said. Defending himself, Blything admitted he had used 'foul language' but said it had not been racial in nature. Originally from Southampton, he argued that both witnesses - who were at the game separately - had described the offender as having a Liverpool accent, whereas he does not. Wearing a grey suit and blue shirt, Blything posed for pictures with an Everton scarf after the hearing. Speaking outside court, he said: 'I have never used that kind of language in my life - never have done and never will. 'I was brought up in a black community and my 17-year-old daughter has a coloured boyfriend. 'There is something wrong with the justice system as far as I am concerned.'","Everton fan William Blything hurled racist abuse at his own team's player .

Addiction: The NHS has been dishing out nicotine patches to schoolchildren as young as 12, it has emerged (FILE PHOTO) Nicotine patches are being handed out to schoolchildren as young as 12 on the NHS without their parents' knowledge, it has emerged. Nurses employed by NHS South West Essex have been distributing patches to young pupils during fortnightly visits to schools, where they speak to children confidentially. One mother said parents should have been consulted on the decision to hand out the powerful substitute patches. Danielle Northcott, whose 13-year-old daughter attends a Basildon school where nicotine patches have been issued to pupils, said while they could help stop children becoming addicted, it was concerning that parents had not been informed. Ms Northcott also said she feared the patches could become a 'status symbol' among schoolchildren. 'As parents I do think we should have been consulted on it and the school should have been clear about it,' said the 39-year-old, whose daughter Amaris is a student at Woodlands School in Takely End, Essex. 'Woodlands is a good school and even though I didn't know the nicotine patches were available, I would rather have that than a cigarette in her mouth,' said Ms Northcott, adding that the service was likely to 'divide opinion' among parents. 'Some parents will not agree with the meetings between the child and the nurse being confidential and it will divide opinion,' she said. 'The only thing that worries me is that the patches will become a status symbol and children could want them just to look cool in front of their friends,' said Ms Northcott. Woodlands School: One parent said she feared the nicotine patches could become a 'status symbol' among young pupils . NHS South West Essex employs health group Vitality to run the service. Vitality, . which offers children advice on weight loss and wellbeing as well as . the dangers of smoking, also issues the patches to children at drop in . sessions across Basildon at the Laindon Health Centre, Pitsea Health . Clinic, and the Basildon Centre. NHS . guidelines say children as young as 12 can access nicotine patches from . chemists and GPs throughout the country, but that it is at the . discretion of individual primary care trusts which services they offer. Andy . White, headteacher at Woodlands School, admitted NHS nurses visited the . school, but denied the school was involved in dishing out the patches. 'I . know nothing about this and as a school we are not giving out nicotine . patches, it is not our policy, but it might be NHS policy,' he said. Advice: Encouraging young people to quit may help prevent them taking up smoking in the long term, the NHS says . 'We . have a nurse who comes into the school twice a month who is employed by . the NHS and pupils can talk to her if they wish to on an individual . basis. 'When pupils . see the nurse it is on a confidential basis and its a drop in session . type service. Parents should always know what is going on and our policy . is clear,' Mr White said. 'If . a pupil is found smoking on site then there will be consequences and we . will always let the parents know, and we believe the problem should be . dealt with by the parents,' he added. A spokesman for North East London NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Vitality service, said: 'Encouraging young people to quit smoking may prevent them from taking up the habit longer term, and so it is important they have somewhere to find confidential support for this. 'NHS stop smoking support is provided locally by GPs, community pharmacies and specialist stop smoking services, who are able to offer a range of advice and support on stopping smoking to people aged 12 and over, in line with NHS and NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) guidelines. 'Some local young people who smoke approach our Vitality stop-smoking advisors for advice and support to quit. 'This support is provided by healthcare professionals such as school nurses or health improvement practitioners, and may include nicotine replacement therapy provided the young person is assessed as competent to consent to using this product.' The spokesman said the use of NRT was always fully explained to any young person seeking help to quit smoking. 'We always encourage young people to inform their parents or carers if they are having support with quitting smoking or having NRT, but they are not obliged to do so,' he said.","The patches are available to pupils from NHS nurses making fortnightly visits to schools in Essex .

Vulnerable: Desperation sometimes drives poverty-stricken parents in India to sell their children (file photo) A mother has been arrested in India after allegedly selling her 11-year-old daughter to pay off a fine. The woman is thought to have sold her daughter for 650,000 rupees - or £7,611 - to settle the fine imposed on her by the council in her home village in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. Police also arrested a couple accused of buying the young girl. The mother told police she sold her child to pay a fine of 450,000 rupees - or £5,317 - imposed by the council as a penalty for violating a local tradition. The sale, which took place around a month ago, came to light when the woman's daughter tried to run away from the couple that allegedly bought her from her mother, police in Rajasthan told BBC News. The man and woman chased the girl, who managed to get to a restaurant where customers alerted the police. The young girl told officers she had been beaten by the couple, and claimed they had planned to sell her on to somebody in Mumbai. Rakesh Verma, head of the anti-trafficking unit in Tonk district, Rajasthan, said: 'We arrested the mother of the girl and the two buyers, Tarachand Jat and Santra Devi.

Known as Chand Baori to locals, the well is 1,200 years old . The well descends around 100ft into the ground, making it one of the deepest and largest step wells in the world . During the monsoon season the well has been known to fill up almost to the top, however water collects from the edges and the earth underground all year round . So deep is the well - known as Chand Baori to locals - temperatures at the bottom can be as much as five to six degrees cooler than on the surface. And during the monsoon season the well rapidly fills up, although no longer to the top. Photographer Florian Wizorek, 34, from Berlin, Germany, captured the mind-bending sight during a trip to India. Hindu designs decorate the ancient walls of the well giving the site a spiritual significance . A closer look at the well's design reveals picture stories of ancient Hindu mythology . He said: 'Due to being surrounded by dozens of stairs, people can access the well from literally every side and when having a closer look at its structures and design, you will easily and yourself not only stuck in a maze of thousands steps but also able to see Shivas beauty.' Classic Hindu architecture dominates the 1200-year-old well, which is a class one monument in India, the same as the famous Taj Mahal. Florian added: 'The wells sheer endlessly appearing geometric complexity made of stairs and steps ensures that Rajput people have access to water at any time of the year. 'Despite its open architecture the well has its own microclimate as at the bottom its always about 5-6 degrees cooler than on earth level and in the sun.' The well is made of dark porous volcanic stones meaning water seeps through from the sides and bottom, as well as rain water from above.","Man-made, 1,200-year-old well is 100ft deep .

Dressed in a pink tutu with a matching satin hair bow, and surrounded by a mountain of designer baby clothes, it is hard to believe this smiling little girl spent the first weeks of her life fighting for survival in intensive care. Doctors warned would-be glamour model Charley Bradshaw, 19, to prepare for the worst when her daughter was born with just one lung and one kidney, and with her heart in the wrong place. But Princess Tiiaana went on to make an incredible recovery, and her thrilled mother has celebrated by splashing out thousands of pounds on a fairytale wardrobe for her 'little miracle', from fur coats and Baby Dior ballet slippers to romper suits designed by her idol Katie Price. Little princess: Relieved Jordan fan Charley Bradshaw has been showering her baby daughter Princess Tiiaana, who has made an incredible recovery since being born with one lung and one kidney, with designer goodies . Princess Tiiaana - whose name was inspired by that of Katie Price's daughter Princess Tiaamii - weighed just six pounds when she was born at Warrington Hospital, and doctors suspected the little girl would need surgery on her heart as well as a donor lung and kidney. But after eight days in intensive care Princess was coping without her missing organs, and stunned doctors concluded she would not need an operation after all. Now aged nine months, the baby girl is the picture of health and Miss Bradshaw and her boyfriend Michal Majewska, also 19, have been told that while their daughter may be more susceptible to chest and kidney infections, she should go on to lead a normal life. 'I'm so proud of my daughter after what she has endured in her short life, she deserves not only to be given the name Princess but also to be treated like one too,' said her mother, who added that she is 'addicted' to splashing out on designer goodies for her daughter. 'She . is my little miracle and whilst I know I may be spoiling her rotten I . just cannot believe how blessed we are to have her home after all that . she has been through,' she said. 'Little miracle': Baby Princess Tiiaana surrounded by some of her clothes, which include Baby Dior ballet flats and KP sleepsuits designed by her mother's idol Katie Price . Shoe collection: Baby Princess has a separate wardrobe to house her growing shoe and hat collection . At just nine months old Princess Tiiaana already has a wardrobe worthy of her namesake, along with a second to house her growing collection of shoes, which includes Ugg-style baby boots, sparkly trainers and diamante ballet pumps. 'We must have spent hundreds if not thousands of pounds on her buying clothes, shoes, headbands and toys,' full-time mother Miss Bradshaw said. 'She deserves not only to be given the name Princess but also to be treated like one too' Mother Charley Bradshaw . 'Her wardrobe is already full to the . brim with designer goodies - she even has a wardrobe just for her little . shoes and hats. It really is just her her, her, her in our lives. She . is adorable. She is so smiley and looking at her you would not know . anything had been wrong with her. 'Baby . things can be expensive anyway but I think we do go overboard with . spoiling her, and obviously we'll make sure she doesn't get too demanding. 'We are living with my parents so we don't have much outgoings to pay . for, so we do spend quite a lot on her,' she added. 'We've . spent possibly around £2,000 on clothes, her fur coats can cost from . £40 upwards and her crystallised shoes cost a fortune, around £80. 'By . October last year we had already spent nearly £250 on her Christmas . presents and we didn't stop there. I would say it's like an addiction, I . just can’t stop buying for her,' said the teenager, who estimates she and her boyfriend have spent around £8,000 on their pampered daughter when taking into account essentials like nappies and prams. And Miss Bradshaw said their spending spree is unlikely to come to an end any time soon, as Princess Tiiaana is already outgrowing her sizeable designer wardrobe. Dark days: Doctors feared Princess Tiiaana would not survive after she was born with her heart in the wrong place . 'We feel so lucky to have her': Princess Tiiaana's mother says her growing girl will soon need a whole new wardrobe . Princess Tiiaana's doting mother had been planning to follow in the footsteps of her idol Katie Price by embarking on a modelling career, and was intending to undergo breast enhancement surgery when she unexpectedly fell pregnant. When Miss Bradshaw had her second scan, it revealed that Princess Tiiaana's heart was on the wrong side and doctors feared she wouldn't survive. One theory was that she had a hole in her diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the ribs), which was causing her organs to be pushed up and to one side, known as congenital diaphragmatic hernia. This is a life-threatening condition that results in the baby’s abdominal organs moving up into the chest cavity, compressing its lungs and heart. But a scan after she was born revealed there was no hole - the organs simply weren't there. Instead, she had pulmonary hypoplasia - her right lung hadn’t developed - and she was also missing a kidney. But incredibly, she didn’t need surgery. Miss Bradshaw said: 'Doctors told me her other lung and kidney were good sizes and accounted for the missing ones and she was coping fine. ‘Her heart was a good size and was working normally. 'They were amazed and said then and there she wouldn’t need an operation - and after 10 days we were sent home. I've been told everything is working fine and that there is no need for us to worry. 'The only warning doctors had was that Princess may be more susceptible to chest infections and asthma when she is older.' But when she and mechanic Michal, her boyfriend of five years, went to find out the gender of their baby, they were given the devastating news that her heart was growing on the wrong side of her body. The young couple were even given information on termination procedures by doctors who warned the chances of their child surviving were slim. Miss Bradshaw was referred to Liverpool Women's Hospital for specialist care, but when Princess Tiiaana was born her parents were told her condition was even worse than initially feared. A scan revealed the little girl had pulmonary hypoplasia, meaning one of her lungs had failed to develop and she was missing a kidney. 'When she was born it was one bombshell blow after another,' said Miss Bradshaw. 'I couldn't think straight and I was thinking the worst. My mind raced and I wondered if it was it my fault. But I'd been so careful, eaten healthily, I didn't drink and I didn't smoke. 'The doctors had told me that if she was strong enough to survive 24 hours by herself then they would want to perform an operation to move her heart but of course there were risks attached. That in itself was a waiting game to see if she'd pull through.'But she fought through and the doctors said the lung and kidney that were present were good sizes and accounted for the missing ones. Because she was missing one from each side they balanced each other.' Miss Bradshaw said doctors were 'amazed' to observe her daughter's recovery. 'Her . heart was a good size and was pumping blood to the arteries and after . 10 days we were sent home,' she said. 'They were amazed.' Incredibly, Princess . Tiiaana will never need surgery and doctors have told her proud parents . that they should expect their daughter to grow up to be a healthy . little girl. Now Miss Bradshaw is hoping it is her . daughter who will enjoy a modelling career, and has already sent . photographs of her adorable little girl to a host of agencies. 'Katie . Price has always been my idol since I was a young teenager and . obviously she has her little girl Princess Tiaamii so that's why we . called our daughter Princess Tiiaana. 'I'd love for my Princess to have a lifestyle like Jordan's children have and for her to never do without. 'We want to get her into modelling and have sent pictures off to agencies.'We . just spoil her to bits and we want to give her everything. We never . thought that she would pull through and we feel so happy to have her. 'It's . amazing, you hear about people who have just one lung or one kidney but . rarely missing both as well as having the heart in the wrong place.

Then and now: Father Michal, 19, cuddling baby Princess in hospital, left, and the now nine-month-old surrounded by her array of pink dresses and shoes, right . A spokesman for Warrington Hospital said: 'It's great to hear that Princess is doing so well. This is a condition that can be very complex depending on the severity.

Blunder: Vice principal Mark Willimott described charity Chelsea's Angels' sponsored pyjama day as a 'paedophile's paradise' in an e-mail . A school has been forced to apologise to a children's cancer charity after the vice principal branded its sponsored pyjama day a 'paedophile's paradise'. Chelsea's Angels, which helps children diagnosed with neuroblastoma and other rare cancers, had e-mailed schools in Northamptonshire inviting them to take part in the event - which would see pupils attending lessons in nightwear - as a fun way to raise money. But the charity was stunned to receive a reply from Brooke Weston Academy in Corby which implied the fundraiser could encourage paedophiles. Vice principal Mark Willimott had intended to forward the charity's invite - along with his critical comments - to a colleague, but inadvertently copied the e-mail to Chelsea's Angels co-founder Michelle Tompkins too. Mr Willimott had written: 'AM I MISSING SOMETHING??? 'FYI although are they aiming for a paedophile's paradise????' The incredulous teacher had added: 'Loads of kids walking to school in pyjamas?', punctuated by dozens of question marks. Chelsea's Angels was set up by the parents Chelsea Knighton, who suffered with aggressive neuroblastoma and died aged just three in August 2009. The charity had hoped to raise thousands of pounds by encouraging schools and colleges to take part in its sponsored pyjama day this Thursday. 'Am I missing something?': The inadvertent response from the vice principal at the Corby secondary school (pictured) left charity organisers 'angry' and 'shocked' Event organiser Michelle Tompkins, who sent out the invitation to Brooke Weston, said reading Mr Willimott's remarks had left her 'angry' and 'shocked'. 'I was angry when I got the e-mail,' she said. 'It wasn't like we were asking children to come in in their underwear' Michelle Tompkins, of charity Chelsea's Angels . 'I felt he was accusing us of attracting paedophiles to children. When my colleague rang up later to ask them about it and told them what happened the person on the end of the phone seemed to snigger at them,' said Mrs Tompkins, before adding: 'They reacted as if it was just ""oh, that's exactly what I'd expect him to do"".' Mrs Tompkins said Chelsea's Angels had run sponsored pyjama days several times in the past to raise funds. 'Regrettable': Trish Stringer, left, principal at Brooke Weston Academy, right, has apologised over the e-mail, but added that the school does not support pyjama days . 'It wasn't like we were asking children to come in in their underwear,' she said. Chelsea's Angels was set up in memory of Chelsea Knighton (seen left in 2009) who died after being diagnosed with neuroblastoma - her cousin Zach Knighton-Smith (right) is also battling the condition . 'The last time my daughter went to one of these she was wearing more clothes than she does in her uniform. 'The headteacher was very apologetic on the phone but I have still heard nothing from the man himself,' said Mrs Tompkins. Brooke Weston's principal Trish Stringer has apologised and described the incident as 'regrettable'. But she added that the school does not support pyjama days because it is not 'appropriate' for students to attend in nightwear. 'This was a private, internal email which was sent to the charity inadvertently,' the principal said. 'This was regrettable and I have apologised to the charity personally and also discussed the issue with the member of staff. 'We have offered to hold a mufti day to raise funds that will generate in excess of £1,000,' Ms Stringer added.'However we do not support pyjama days, primarily because we do not think it appropriate for students to come to school in night attire. 'We constantly reinforce the message that they should stay safe, both online and in the real world, and we are confident that our staff and parents understand and support this view,' she said. Ms Stringer said Brooke Weston Academy had raised thousands of pounds for charities including the Teenage Cancer Trust and Myeloma UK in recent years. 'Therefore we look forward to presenting Chelsea's Angels with a charity cheque as we appreciate the important work that they carry out,' she said.","Vice principal of Brooke Weston Academy criticised the fundraiser, which would see pupils come to school in nightwear, in an e-mail to a colleague .

The RSPCA came to the aid of the trapped bird after Jacky Weaver, 50, spotted the swan sitting on her neighbour's balcony at their building in Poole, Dorset. The nurse said she had initially mistaken it for a tasteless garden ornament until the 'stressed' swan began flapping its wings and she realised it was real. Stranded: The swan had to be rescued from the third floor balcony at a block of flats in Poole, Dorset . RSPCA inspector Graham Hammond arrived at the block of flats to rescue the bird, but the swan still had a wait in store, as Mr Hammond couldn't get to it until the owner of the flat got home an hour later to let him in. The creature was said to be a little 'stressed', but otherwise unharmed. Ms Weaver said: 'I thought someone had a new ornament on their balcony and thought it was a bit naff, but then it suddenly moved. 'I couldn't fathom how on earth it ended up there and was quite surprised. 'They need quite a lot of room to land and take off, yet there was a swan on the balcony of the third floor.' Stuck: The swan was eventually released back into the wild after it was rescued from its perch three storeys up . 'I called the RSPCA at about 2pm and at about 5pm the owners came home,' said Ms Weaver. The RSPCA inspector walked straight up to the swan, picked it up and carried it out. Mr Hammond said: 'I think the swan must have crash landed. 'They . are quite good at hitting power lines. Although they are very elegant . and serene on the water they are not so graceful in the air. 'It was very healthy. I put it in the van and it looked fine so I took it to an open space nearby and released it there.'David .

A teacher who was taunted for looking like 'a zombie from Shaun of the Dead' because of a rare condition has had an operation to let her smile for the first time in ten years. Vicki Hand, 26, was tormented by ignorant strangers after she developed a tumour which pressed down on her facial nerves causing her features to distort into a fixed grimace. Doctors initially diagnosed her with Bells Palsy at the age of 16 when she was unable to move the left side of her face which meant she could not close her mouth. Before and after: Vicki has struggled with a paralysed face for 10 years, but a correct diagnosis and surgery have helped to balance her features . But eight years later an MRI scan revealed she actually had a benign tumour in her face which was causing the nerves to spasm - a condition known as Facial Palsy. The condition, which affects around 100,000 people in the UK, also caused Vicki's eyes to be permanently blood-shot. Last July she had an operation to remove the growth and has now successfully undergone an operation - including grafting muscle from her leg into her face - to correct her features. Surgeons, led by Dr Fazel Fatah at Birmingham City Hospital, also operated on her eyes to make them symmetrical and placed gold weights in her eyelids to help her blink. Today Vicki, a primary school teacher from Worcester, was able to smile for the first time in a decade. She said: 'I went back for the results on my own and it was dreadful. 'The doctor showed me the MRI scan and pointed out my facial nerve with something pushing against it. ""That's a tumour"", he said. I really didn't contemplate anything like that - I couldn't believe it. 'It was disgraceful that no one picked up on it given the number of specialists I'd seen, including physiotherapists. 'My eye was affected the most and caused big problems, as it would be red and bloodshot, and sore. 'After I had the tumour removed the facial palsy was slightly worse for a while. 'I had a muscle taken out of my leg and implanted in my face. 'It would have been good to talk to someone before my operation, as it's not something anyone else I know has had done. 'But now I can smile again - it's amazing. Plastic surgeon Charles Nduka from the charity Facial Palsy UK, said: 'Patients face delayed diagnosis and a lack of awareness of suitable treatment' 'People don't know about facial palsy and they need to be more aware. I was in a chip shop after a night out and a lad said 'What's the matter with you? 'You look like one of the zombies from Shaun of the Dead, your eye's so red and veiny. 'I told him I'd had a brain tumour and he said, ""Haven't we all?"" People can be idiots. 'I'd much rather people just ask me about it politely. 'Now, as a teacher, the kids in my class have never really said anything about it, but sometimes when I'm walking down the corridor and I smile at the little kids, they'll ask ""What's happened to your face?"" 'I'm lucky that I got it at 16 rather than 13. I was just starting sixth form and I did a presentation on it for everyone and explained what it is, and that made a big difference.' Vicki has a reduced field of vision in her left eye which sometimes causes her pain but she is expected to make a full recovery. Since her operation she has vowed to raise awareness of facial palsy and has organised a fundraising gig in aid of Facial Palsy UK. Charles Nduka, from the charity, said there are still misunderstandings about the condition. He said: 'Patients face delayed diagnosis, a lack of awareness of suitable treatments among some health professionals, and a poor appreciation of the implications of losing the ability to smile and the use of one side of the face. 'Facial palsy is not a 'cosmetic' but a functional problem affecting important activities such as eating, drinking and protecting the eye.'","Vicki, 26, was misdiagnosed with Bells Palsy when she was 16 .

Board brothers: Princes David Kahalepouli Kawanaankoa and Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole set a UK first when they went surfing in Bridlington, Yorkshire, of all places, in 1890 . One's a tropical paradise in the Pacific with long, hot summers, crystal blue waters - and high-rolling waves. The other is rather more chilly and somewhat lacking in the 'crystal blue' department. But that didn't stop two 19th-century Hawaiian princes taking to the North Sea off the coast of Bridlington, East Yorkshire, in what is believed to be the first instance of surfing in Britain. A long-lost letter, published for the first time, reveals the two young royals and their English guardian went surfing at the resort in September 1890. The document, possibly the earliest report of the sport in Britain, was uncovered after research into Victorian surfers. Pictures of the trio and details of their escapade - which stunned locals - have gone on display at Europe’s only dedicated surfing museum, in Braunton, North Devon. Museum founder Peter Robinson has now called for a statue of the princes to thank them for bringing surfing to Britain. He said: 'This is the most wonderful discovery and a massive revelation in terms of British surfing heritage. 'The fact that not only do we now know that Hawaiian royalty surfed while being educated in England in the late 1800s, but also that they chose a relatively obscure surfing destination like Bridlington on the east coast to paddle out and catch a few slides is just fantastic. 'This is the earliest proven instance of surfing in Britain so far - previously we had thought it was the 1920s in England and the Channel Islands - but this blows our history right out of the water. 'The Victorian locals must have been incredulous at the sight of these Hawaiian Princes paddling out, and riding back into shore most likely standing on large wooden planks - their dark skin and hair glistening in the North Sea waters. 'I only wish I could have been there to see it.' Blown out of the water: This picture taken in 1890 shows how Bridlington beach may have looked when the princes amazed holidaymakers with their surfing skills . The letter, to Hawaiian consul Henry Armstrong from Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole Piikoi, was discovered by Hawaiian author and historian Sandra Kimberley Hall. The prince wrote that he and his brother, Prince David Kahalepouli Kawanaankoa Piikoi, were allowed by their tutor - believed to be John Wrightson - to holiday in Bridlington. The pair were given the reward for good work in their studies in schools at colleges around Britain. They had been in England furthering their education for almost a year. Expert surfer: The princes' cousin, Princess Victoria Ka'iulani (above), may have been the first female to hit the waves in Britain . On September 22, 1890, a joyful Kuhio could not restrain his enthusiasm in his letter to Consul Armstrong. He said: 'We enjoy the seaside very much and are out swimming every day. 'The weather has been very windy these few days and we like it very much for we like the sea to be rough so that we are able to have surf riding. 'We enjoy surf riding very much and surprise the people to see us riding on the surf. 'Even Wrightson is learning surf riding and will be able to ride as well as we can in a few days more. He likes this very much for it is a very good sport.' The two Hawaiian royals were no strangers to surfing in chilly waters like the North Sea. In 1885, they surfed in Santa Cruz on 15-foot redwood planks weighing 100lbs in similar temperature waters - making them the first to do it in California. It is thought the Hawaiian princes, the orphaned nephews and heir to Queen Kapiolani, would have made their surfboards from timber acquired from a Bridlington boat builder. They would have bought or hired neck-to-knee swimsuits made of cotton or wool. The north east coast of England is home to some world class surfing waves - but Bridlington has never been a particularly popular beach for surfers. The two princes were cousins of expert surfer Princess Victoria Ka’iulani, the half Hawaiian - half Scottish heir to the Hawaiian throne who was educated in the south coast resort of Brighton in 1892. Sandra Kimberley Hall said: 'Her time in England was deliberately below the radar of the newspapers of the day. 'She may have been the first female surfer in Britain, but the only tangible evidence - so far - is a letter in which she wrote that she enjoyed ‘being on the water again’ at Brighton. New generation: Surfing is now extremely popular around the UK, particularly in Newquay (above) where major competitions are held . 'She may have meant a walk on the West Pier, or a walk on the promenade. Ka’iulani liked swimming and surfing. 'She was a high-spirited girl, who when she returned to Hawaii, liked to sneak out past midnight to go swimming in the moonlight with girlfriends.' The Museum of British Surfing recently published the only known photo of the young princess in a watersports setting - seated in an outrigger canoe at Waikiki. By coincidence the latest Government-backed TV advert to encourage Britons to holiday at home features Harry Potter star Rupert Grint - surfing at Bridlington. In Santa Cruz a statue descendants of the Hawaiian princes unveiled a plaque to commemorate their surfing ‘first’. Peter Robinson added: 'We would love to commission a sculpture to honour their achievement and say thank you to Hawaii for giving the world the fantastic gift of surfing.'

Over the years it has boasted a membership of presidents, world leaders and celebrities such as Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks and offers fine dining in decadent surroundings at the heart of Disneyland - at a hefty price. As such it has operated as one of the worlds most-secretive members-only clubs allowing famous Mickey fans to enjoy the park in comfort and privacy. However, new photographs have, for the first time, revealed the luxurious surrounds behind the scenes at Disneyland's highly secretive Club 33. Don't tell anyone: Some rare photographs have revealed the secret world behind Disney's top secret Club 33 . Exclusive: Reportedly there are fewer than 500 members of the club. Stars rumored to have dined there include Elton John and Christina Aguilera . Photographer Pete Hottelet was able to visit the club and take a sneak-peak displaying the pictures on his website. The members-only restaurant and club is reportedly open to less than 500 . VIP patrons and costs a whopping $25,000 to join with an additional fee . of $10,000 a year - if you are lucky enough to make it on the waiting . list. It is highly private and nearly impossible to find in the California theme park's New Orleans Square - marked simply with a understated brass plaque saying '33'. And the images reveal what is on offer for the price tag. Decadent dining rooms with chandeliers and silver cutlery - a world away from the fast food stands below. The setting looks like an old-fashioned New Orleans mansion with antique furniture, ornate decorations and an old-fashioned glass elevator with a leather banquet to admire the view. Fine wine: Club 33 is the only place in Disneyland where you can buy alcohol and has an extensive wine list . Decadent: The club offers fine dining at the center of Disneyland and costs $25,000 to join plus $10,000 annual fees if you are permitted to join the waiting list . Antiques: Many of the club's furnishings were bought by Walt Disney and his wife from New Orleans' French Quarter in the Sixties . The food though haute cuisine has a nod to the theme park and its famous characters. It is also the only place in the park where alcohol is served with a barman on duty and a large wine list available. The club opened in 1967 when Walt Disney was inspired by the VIP . lounges on offer to corporate sponsors at the New York World’s Fair. Its website states Disney 'felt that a special place was needed where he could . entertain visiting dignitaries and others in a quiet, serene atmosphere . where superb cuisine and distinctive decor would complement one another'. It was designed by artist Dorothea Redmond and finished by decorator . Emil Kuri. Disney and his wife purchased many of the antiques themselves in New Orleans. Original sketches: As well as being furnished with antiques purchased by Walt Disney, the lounges in the club have many original sketches by Disney artists .

Scientists discovered 'significant' numbers of living bugs in the middle and upper troposphere, the airy layer five to nine miles above the Earth's surface. The microbes could have a previously unrecognised impact on cloud formation, according to the research. Georgia Tech graduate student Natasha DeLeon-Rodriguez shows an agar plate on which bacteria taken from tropospheric air samples are growing. Researchers say there are far more bacteria above the clouds than previously thought . Terry Lathem, a graduate student in Georgia Tech's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, takes notes aboard a NASA DC-8 gathering samples of microorganisms in the atmosphere . Long distance travel by the airborne organisms may also help spread infections around the world. The bugs were discovered in air samples scooped up by a DC-8 aircraft flying over both land and sea across the US, Caribbean and western Atlantic. Samples were collected at altitudes of eight to 15 kilometres (five to nine miles) before and after two major tropical hurricanes in 2010. Scientists are still unsure whether the bacteria and fungi they found routinely inhabit the sky, living off carbon compounds, or are continually borne aloft by winds and air currents. Lead researcher Dr Kostas Konstantinidis, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, said: 'We did not expect to find so many micro-organisms in the troposphere, which is considered a very difficult environment for life. 'There seems to be quite a diversity of species, but not all bacteria make it into the upper atmosphere.' DNA analysis revealed that bacteria made up 20% of particles previously thought to consist of nothing but sea salt or dust. The findings appear today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Marine bacteria were mostly found over the ocean, while their terrestrial cousins tended to occupy the air above land. Georgia Tech researchers study microorganisms gathered from air masses in the middle and upper troposphere. Shown are Natasha DeLeon-Rodriguez (seated), Kostas Konstantinidis, Athanasios Nenes, and Michael Bergin. There was strong evidence that hurricanes affected the distribution and dynamics of microbial populations. Around 17 different families of bacteria were detected. The bugs can help trigger cloud formation by supplying the particles around which ice crystals form. 'In the absence of dust or other materials that could provide a good nucleus for ice formation, just having a small number of these micro-organisms around could facilitate the formation of ice at these altitudes and attract surrounding moisture,' said co-author Professor Athanasios Nenes, also from the Georgia Institute of Technology. The scientists now want to look more closely at how the bugs survive so high above the ground. 'For these organisms, perhaps, the conditions may not be that harsh,"" said Dr Konstantinidis. 'I wouldn't be surprised if there is active life and growth in clouds, but this is something we cannot say for sure now.'","Find made in the middle and upper troposphere, the airy layer five to nine miles above the Earth's surface .

Frail: Agency nurse Kirsten May gave Norman Betchley (pictured) the tablet even though an A5 sign above his head stated 'nil by mouth' A frail elderly patient died after choking to death on a tablet he should never have been given, an inquest has heard. Norman Betchley, 81,  was given the tablet even though an A5 sign above his head stated 'nil by mouth' -  a medical instruction for patients who may not take any substances orally. The nurse who gave him the tablet then  ran through the hospital ward crying:  'I've killed him'. Even though Mr Betchley was seriously ill, the coroner at Chelmsford Coroners Court decided the tablet probably caused his death. Mr Betchley was at Colchester General Hospital, Essex, when agency nurse Kirsten May gave him the heart drug furosemide with a glass of water. He started choking, coughing and vomiting when he tried to take the tablet. Nurses used suction equipment to clear Mr Betchley’s airways but he died soon after. Coroner Tina Harrington told the inquest Mr Betchley suffered from asbestosis and his overall physical condition was sufficient to cause death at any point. However, it was likely administering the medication would have caused his death. She said: 'He immediately began to cough and choke, which caused obstruction to his airways, which I find on balance precipitated Mr Betchley’s death.' Miss Harrington said she was satisfied Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, had made strides since Mr Betchley's death and she did not make any recommendations. Ms May claimed not to have been told during the morning handover that Mr Betchley was 'nil by mouth' - a medical instruction for patients who may not take any substances orally. Mr Betchley died on April 9, 2009 having been admitted on February 10, 2009 suffering with breathing difficulties. Mr Betchley started choking, coughing and vomiting when he tried to take the tablet . The former guillotine operator was due . to be assessed for the Liverpool Care Pathway, which dictates patients . should not be resuscitated, on the day he died. Two post-mortem examinations found his cause of death to be lung disease due to exposure to asbestos. Det Chief Supt Liam Osborne investigated Mr Betchley’s death and found nine members of staff, including Ms May, had been briefed properly. He decided neither Nurse May nor Colchester General Hospital had a criminal case to answer. A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust extended its condolences and sympathy to Mr Bletchley’s family and friends. He said: 'We fully accept we failed in our duty of care to him and apologise unreservedly. 'The nurse involved in this case, who was not our employee, had not followed Nursing and Midwifery Council or our own guidance relating to the administration of medicines and was suspended immediately. Mr Betchley's children, Linda and Stuart, have criticised the inquest system after it took four years for the inquest to be concluded . 'We immediately notified the authorities and a matron met Mr Betchley’s son and daughter on the day of his death to tell them about the investigation the trust was about to start. 'She met them again to share the outcome of the investigation and resulting action plan which contained eight recommendations. They were all implemented.' Senior staff told the hearing of the measures taken to minimise the risk of a repeat, including an improved handover between shifts and more conspicuous nil by mouth signs. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Betchley’s son Stuart said: 'This whole thing should not have to happen to anyone. Mr Betchley was at Colchester General Hospital (pictured) when agency nurse Kirsten May gave him the heart drug furosemide with a glass of water . 'Two reports into dad's death said the tablet contributed to his death and we heard how the nurse herself screamed when she realised what she had done . 'It was an unfortunate mistake and I do not blame anyone in particular, but the system is lacking. 'If you go to hospital and there is no clear diagnosis, as was the case with my dad, you are just passed from pillar to post. 'I hope the hospital has taken this seriously and implements all the changes it has stated.' He also criticised the inquest system. It has taken nearly four years for the inquest to be concluded. He said: 'I would like to think someone would not have to wait four years for this as we have, and for what? 'No one will argue my dad was not in good health but I know he would not have died that particular day if this had not happened.  It seems we will never get a straight answer'","Kirsten May gave Norman Betchley pill despite 'nil by mouth' sign over bed .

Online: Internet retailer Amazon has made £14billion in worldwide sales in just three months - with one tenth of that coming from UK shoppers . Amazon is set to announce record Christmas trading as it continues to ‘lay waste’ to the beleaguered high street. In just three months the internet store made £14billion in worldwide sales – with one tenth of that from UK shoppers. But Amazon has been under attack for avoiding millions of pounds in taxes. Critics say this enables the company to slash prices and undercut rivals. An estimated 17,500 high street jobs are at risk after 1,400 stores closed down over the Christmas period. And industry experts warn more retail failures could see one in five shops boarded up. Household names including HMV, Jessops, Blockbuster and Comet have all collapsed into administration during the past two months. Yet Amazon’s expected sales rise is an increase of almost a third compared with 2011. Waterstone’s founder Tim Waterstone previously said Amazon had a ‘rude, contemptuous, arrogant and subversive’ attitude to competitors. And John Lewis boss Andy Street has called for a ‘level playing field’ to stop it ‘out-trading’ rivals. Amazon was also dubbed ‘immoral’ for avoiding tax by funnelling revenue to Luxembourg. In 2011, the most recent year where figures are available, Amazon paid just £1.8million despite raking in sales of £3.35billion in the UK – a figure the firm tried to keep secret until it was exposed by MPs. Forecasts from Morgan Stanley, one of Wall Street’s largest banks, show the company is expected to report global sales of more than £14billion between October and December, compared with £10billion the year before. For the full 12 months Amazon is forecast to have made almost £40billion. That is projected to rise to £86billion in 2015. ‘Amazon is uniquely positioned to be a disruptive force to the traditional retail channel for years to come,’ said analyst RJ Hottovy from US brokers Morningstar. He added: ‘Amazon has played a prominent role in the structural shift away from bricks-and-mortar retail and it may lay waste to several other retailers in the years to come. In trouble: HMV, which is currently in administration with some 4,500 jobs at risk, was the latest in a long line of entertainment and electronics stores which have collapsed since the financial crash in 2009 . ‘Without the cost burden of physical retail stores, Amazon can price below traditional rivals and drive recurring traffic online.’ Since launching, Amazon has expanded from selling books to include DVDs, CDs, household appliances, garden tools and even car parts. Sales of cheap CDs and DVDs helped hasten the decline of HMV, which is currently in administration with some 4,500 jobs at risk. The group was the latest in a long line of entertainment and electronics stores which have collapsed since the financial crash in 2009, including Woolworths – once the UK’s biggest seller of DVDs. A further 4,190 jobs were endangered when video rental service Blockbuster collapsed earlier this month.

A fixated woman has been warned that she will be jailed if she continues to bombard a married vicar with cards, letters and gifts. Maureen Peace, 50, was given a 12 month community order and an indefinite restraining order last August, banning her from contacting the Rev Keith Rengert after she stalked him for two years. But Norwich Crown Court heard how she broke the restraining order within days by writing to Mr Rengert, 45, who is rector of Spixworth, Norfolk. Maureen Peace, 50, (left) was given an order of restraint after she became obsessed with the Reverend Keith Rengert (right), sending him messages and turning up at his house in Norfolk over a two-year period . She was due to be sentenced for the offence in October, but sentencing was adjourned for three months to see if she kept away from him. The court heard on Friday that her behaviour had been 'positive' since her earlier breach and she had made no further contact with the vicar. Judge Mark Lucraft gave her a new 12-month community and supervision order with a mental health requirement, with the restraining order left in place. But he warned her that she would go to jail if she breached the order again. The offence has a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. Ms Peace, who is from North Walsham, Norfolk, admitted a charge of harassment without violence between July 1 2010 and June 2 last year at an earlier hearing before Norwich magistrates. The court heard how Ms Peace became 'fixated' with the vicar and sent him messages saying that she loved him after he conducted her mother's funeral. But her persistent approaches were not appreciated by Mr Rengert when he was in his earlier post as curate at 14th century St Nicholas church in North Walsham. He asked her to stop contacting him and later complained to police who issued her with a warning, but her harassment continued. The court heard how she even turned up at the vicar's home that he shared with wife Helen and two children in North Walsham. She also declared her love for him in four Valentine's day cards on February 14 last year, describing him as 'the love of my life' and saying, 'I will be your sweetheart if you will be mine'. Ms Peace who is jobless and lives on income support and Disability Living Allowance was also banned from going to any church service in which Mr Rengert is taking part or officiating. The court was told how Nr Rengert first became concerned about Ms Peace's 'over familiarity' when she started writing to him and calling him by his first name. He told her to contact another priest instead of him after she asked him to 'cleanse' her home, but she ignored the request and carried on writing to him and leaving messages on his phone. Ms Peace sent a birthday card to the curate's wife in October 2010, and sent another card to his family in January 2011. Two months later in March last year she turned up at his house with flowers. Peace continued to phone the curate and write him letters which were 'full of sexual innuendo', prompting him to write back to her asking her to stop after taking advice from a community psychiatric nurse. A few days later she sent him a letter of apology, but she continued to send cards and letters including letters mentioning his wife and son. One card mentioned wanting to give him 'a mental cuddle'. She also sent the curate's son a birthday gift of a DVD and a book. Peace was given a notice by police in November 2011, requiring to stop harassing Mr Rengert, but three months later she sent him the four Valentine's Day cards, signing them, 'Love from M'. She continued to send other letters 'in the same vein', even referring to the Mr Rengert's wife as his sister. Mr Rengert opened a letter received last May in the presence of police officers. He said it had left him feeling 'pretty disgusted and really stressed out' The Ven Jan McFarlane, the Archdeacon of Norwich, said after an earlier hearing: 'Anyone who has ever suffered from such a high degree of unwanted and unwelcome attention will know just how distressing and exhausting it is. 'Keith and his family have endured such persistent attention for nearly two years and are hopeful that it will all soon come to an end. Keith is an excellent priest who simply wants quietly to get on with his ministry.'

Slipping through his grasp: Was the feather to blame for Andy Murray's defeat to Novak Djokovic in today's final of the Australian Open? Down it came like a voodoo omen, floating from the skies like malevolent thistledown, the tiny white feather that actually did bring the thistle down. When Andy Murray stopped playing to move a feather that drifted onto court, millions of fans back at home shuddered in horror. BBC tennis commentator Andrew Castle thought it was a good omen – he's obviously never seen The Birds. However, seasoned Andy-watchers all knew what that ominous bit of feather dusting meant and it wasn't that Tippi Hedren was about to get pecked to death by crows. It meant that Murray's concentration had cracked open, like a fault-line coursing through a granite dam. It meant that once more, the end was nigh for the pride of Scotland as the runner-up spot beckoned. For when things start going badly for Murray, there is something in the psychological disposition of the world's number three tennis player that makes him blame something else, rather than his own performance. It is a coping strategy, sometimes a desperate one. Hecklers, sore feet, bad line calls, the man in the Melbourne crowd with the wobble board (I'm not joking) singing Rolf Harris songs or an innocent feather? Feather! That'll do it! Murray picked up the offending fluff with a housekeeper's zeal and it turned out to be his moment of doom. Even watching on television thousands of miles away, we could feel the momentum shift as the power inexorably moved across court from Murray to iron-man Djokovic. And stay there. Consider the evidence. Murray misses first serve, picks up feather, carries on to serve his third double-fault of the match and everything goes downhill from then on. Flapping somewhere out there on the Melbourne winds, a slightly balding pigeon has a lot to answer for. Bad sign: Commentator Andrew Castle thought it was a good omen - he's obviously never seen The Birds . Pain barrier: British tennis star Andy Murray was hindered by severe blisters, which needed treatment . Yet to be honest, after four hours of intense tennis in the Australian Open final, Murray's unravelling was kind of a relief. Andrew Castle kept going on (and on) about how he is convinced that Andy Murray really should be world number one, but I'm not sure that we Scots could cope with that; we are pre-programmed to cheer on the national underdog. It is what we do best. We can deal perfectly with sporting defeats. We've had decades of practice at that game. It is the hope, the terrible hope of victory, which is so crushing. And this is only the first of the grand slams in what is meant to be Andy's year – how on earth will we survive? After some big wins last year, Murray has been playing and behaving more like a champion; managing to deal with the pressure and expectations of others in a graceful way. Real nail-bitter: Today's final in Melbourne did not make for easy viewing for Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears . Despair: The look on Miss Sears' face said it all as her boyfriend fell at the final hurdle earlier in Australia . He's even shaved off that dreadful gingery furze on his face, so it's a love-all from me. Yet he still has his moments and watching him play can be a sweet kind of torture, especially when his confident, early promise gives way to a gradual erosion of temper and he starts getting a bit, well…. Scottish. Under the power of the flying, silver-shoed Serb with the bear hair, our Andy got his disgruntled grunt on – and promptly lost. When things start going badly, he does his tell-tale snarly face, lowers his head like a wounded stag, starts limping about as though someone had put tin-tacks in his trainers. One minute he is spinning glorious aces over the net and looking untouchable, the next he is his own bad ass; doing the fist pump, turning the air blue, doing that snuggle-toothed grimace that suggests there should be a claymore in his hand, not a tennis racquet. Blistering pace: The hard fought encounter with Novak Djokovic took its tool on Andy Murray's body . Best foot forward: The foot injury hampered the young Scot throughout the intense four hour final . Blame game: He blamed his hamstrings, he blamed the feather, he blamed hecklers, he blamed his blisters . Painful viewing: Watching Andy Murray play Grand Slam tennis can be be a sweet kind of torture . After the match he blamed his hamstrings, he blamed the feather, he blamed hecklers, he blamed his blisters. However, in the latter instance, we certainly shared his pain. Earlier in the match, television viewers were rewarded with a horrendous close-up of the naked Murray foot when a physio applied some court-side first-aid. We saw Murray's battered chipolata toes encased in their individual pods of bandage, all bound up like a ballerina's. His livid skin looked pink and flayed as yellow iodine was painted onto his raw and weeping blisters. If that didn't put you off your Sunday morning bacon and eggs, nothing could. Struggling: Andy Murray repeatedly showed signs that he was uncomfortable during the men's singles final . Full stretch: Murray reaches for a return following a powerful shot from his Serbian opponent . What a racket: Djokovic shows great technique as he makes a forehand return in front of millions of viewers . Loyal support: Fans of the Scotsman attempted to lift his spirits from the sidelines inside the arena . The torture just kept on coming. The terrible squeak-squeak-squeaking of the players' trainers as they played on the blue Plexicushion surface. The oofy grunts when they hit a big shot. Andrew Castle saying 'unbelievable' every five seconds. In the end, the BBC's main man concluded: 'Djokovic would literally walk through a brick wall to win this title.' For her part, presenter Sue Barker thought that Andy's 'spirit had been broken'. More like his blisters, darling. But never mind. There is always the next tournament. Come back and be unbelievable, Andy. That's all we ask. Adversaries: Novak Djokovic proudly holds the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup alongside runner-up Murray . Victorious: Djokovic cannot hide his emotion as he wins his third successive Australian Open crown . Game, set and match: Murray congratulates Djokovic on his famous victory over the net . Champion: The Serbian has once again proved his quality by seeing off his rivals to lift the coveted trophy .","Andy Murray's concentration is cracked by an ominous bit of feather .

It is a far cry from the days of Elizabeth Bennet’s pursuit of Mr Darcy - and his substantial wealth. Securing financial stability through marriage is today seen to be more important for young men than for young women, research claims. Parents of girls now believe their financial security relies more on a good education and career than on marriage. Pursuit: Mr Darcy (left, played by Matthew MacFadyen) and Elizabeth Bennet (right, played by Keira Knightley) in the 2005 film Pride and Prejudice, based on Jane Austen's novel . Research into attitudes towards marriage, carried out to mark the bicentenary of the publication of Pride and Prejudice, found that 38 per cent of parents of sons believe their boy’s financial security is dependent on them having a rich wife. In comparison the poll of 1,000 parents, carried out by the insurers Scottish Widows, found that 32 per cent of parents with daughters thought they needed to marry for financial reasons. Unlike the period described in Jane Austen’s novel, which was published on January 28, 1813, parents today clearly think that women can make it on their own. Changing: An economic historian said women 'no longer need dowries and settlements to attract husbands, they need down payments and student loans to get them on the property ladder and through higher education' Nearly eight out of ten parents with daughters think doing well at school and university and getting a good job is the answer to achieving the greatest financial security for the future.

Gold-plated pensions in the private sector are being shut down 'at the fastest rate on record', a report by the National Association of Pensions Funds warns today. In 2005, 43 per cent of 'final salary' schemes allowed new recruits to a company to join. Today the figure has collapsed to just 13 per cent following the biggest-ever drop last year. A 'final salary' pension promises to pay a worker a percentage of their earnings on retirement for the rest of their life, and is guaranteed and inflation-proofed, unlike other types of pensions. Warning: NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars has highlighted the pension apartheid in Britain . As a result, millions of workers face the prospect of working into their 70s and still retiring with a paltry pension, unlike their parents who retired young on a gold-plated deal. To make matter worse, soaring numbers are shutting down completely, putting up the 'Closed' sign to existing workers as well as new recruits. The report, published today, reveals nearly a third of 'final salary schemes' have closed to both types of workers, compared to just three per cent in 2008. In 2005, the hygiene firm Rentokil make front page news after axeing its gold-plated pension scheme to existing workers. Today there is a steady stream of companies deciding to scrap their pension scheme, and replace it with an inferior, cheaper alternative. The findings highlight the pensions apartheid in Britain as the vast majority of State workers continue to enjoy a guaranteed, gold-plated pension, unlike those in the private sector. Joanne Segars, chief executive of the NAPF, said: 'Those starting a new job in the private sector have next to no chance of getting a final salary pension. What was once the norm is now a very rare offer. 'And those who are currently saving into one may find it gets closed. We are in the midst of a pension regime change.' Record: The number of new recruits getting final salary pensions is down from 43 per cent to 13 per cent . The NAPF report says the 'record rate' of closures has been fuelled by the Bank of England's £375billion money-printing scheme, known as quantitative easing. This has put extreme pressure on pension funds because it has made their liabilities - the pension promises that they have made to their workers - much bigger. Their liabilities are calculated using the interest paid by Government bonds, known as 'gilts', but gilt yields have fallen sharply as a result of the controversial quantitative easing policy. The NAPF said it has prompted 'a barrage of fresh closures.' And bosses will continue to close down their pension schemes, according to today's report, which polled more than 1,000 pension funds with nine million members and assets of £628billion. Over the next five years, nearly half said they are 'planning to close the pension to new staff'. The Department for Work and Pensions estimates around 11 million people in Britain have 'inadequate pensions.' This means they either do not have a pension, or have a pension which is worth too little to pay for a comfortable retirement. Since October, new rules forcing bosses to pay into a pension for the first time for their workers, who are automatically signed up to the scheme, are aimed at solving the pensions crisis.","Only 13 per cent of new recruits at companies will get a 'final salary' pension .

A mother whose jeweller lover was cleared of assaulting her in a Fifty Shades-inspired sex game has told how he lashed her with a knotted rope if she didn't address him as 'Sir' or 'Master'. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had agreed to take part in a slave sex session with Steven Lock but said he went too far, forcing her to say 'Yes Sir, Yes Master', and whipping her if she didn't, leaving her screaming in pain. Last week Mr Lock, 43, from Ipswich, was cleared of causing her actual bodily harm after a jury heard that the woman had written to him promising to be his 'slave' and accepting that she might suffer 'pain'. But today his former lover, a divorcee who met him through a dating website, said the pain she suffered at his semi-detached home was worse than that she felt giving birth. She told how Mr Lock tied her to an eyelet on the floor of his bedroom and lashed her with a knotted rope that made a whistling sound as he cracked it through the air. The woman, who met him on plentyoffish.com and agreed to the sex session after they both read the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, said that the first and last of the 14 strokes he administered hurt the most. She said: 'I screamed after the first one then I tried not to, as I knew this would only encourage him - he seemed to get off on my screams... 'He counted out the lashing, relishing every one, but apart from the counting he was silent.' The woman, a brunette, told The Sun that Mr Lock, who had previous convictions for domestic violence, stood sideways on to her to administer the excruciating strokes, using his full force with each one. She said she was whipped once for each occasion on which she had 'failed as a slave', adding: 'I'd have to say ""Yes Sir, Yes Master"", and if I didn't, I'd get lashed.' Lonely hearts: Mr Lock and the woman met through the dating website plentyoffish.com . Ipswich Crown Court heard during the trial that Mr Lock agreed he had put a chain around her wrist and tied her to the floor. After the whipping, the couple had sex and then Mr Lock went off to the kitchen to make a chicken wrap, the woman said. Left manacled to the floor, she sent a text to a friend asking them to call the police. The court heard the text read: 'He has got me chained up like a dog. 'He is whipping the s*** out of me.  I need your help bad.' Police found her in a 'distressed' state outside Mr Lock's home, and the court heard that he had released her after she refused to share his bed. She said they had had a codeword, 'red' to use if either of them wanted to stop the sex session, but said it all happened so fast, she didn't even think of using it. The woman said Mr Lock angrily gave her the key to the padlock and she fled to the bus-stop, while he sent her an angry text message. The inspiration: Erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey . She said she'd been attracted by his online profile which showed him to be attractive, responsible and in a job. She fell under his spell, like the heroine Anastasia Steel did with Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades books, and although never having been into alternative sex before, soon realised her lover wanted to be more adventurous. The woman, who had a tattoo in an intimate place saying 'This is the property of Steven Lock', said Mr Lock enjoyed tying her up and getting her to dress like a young Britney Spears - with over-the-knee socks, pigtails and short skirt. The court cleared Mr Lock after hearing how the woman had agreed to take part in 'master and slave'-style sex session. Echoing the contract in the Fifty Shades erotic trilogy, she sent him a letter on August 5 last year, the day before the slave session took part, agreeing 'to allow Steven Lock to use me and my body as a slave'. The letter went on: 'I am willing to do anything my master sees fit for me to do.  This may include pain if my tasks are not completed to his satisfaction.' During the trial Mr Lock admitted chaining and whipping the woman but said: 'It was supposed to be kinky fun'. The court also heard that Mr Lock had four previous convictions for domestic violence against three former partners. Outside court he said he was 'disgusted' the case had been brought to court, saying: 'I didn't do anything wrong'.

Schoolfriends Nathan Wilkins and Kyle Robson have always been close - but their latest escapade brought them closer than ever. Medics had to free the two friends who 'bonded' during class when they accidentally superglued their hands together in an arm-wrestling contest. Nathan, 13, and Kyle, 14, both of Hartlepool, were in a music lesson at High Tunstall College of Science when another student brought out a tube of pink glue. The substance was squirted onto Kyle's hand, who then challenged Nathan to an arm wrestle. But within seconds, the Year Nine pupils found themselves in a sticky situation. Nathan Wilkins, 13 (right), and Kyle Robinson, 14 (left), had to be separated by medics when they superglued their hands together during an arm-wrestling contest at High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool . Nathan and Kyle both of Hartlepool, were in a music lesson when another student brought out a tube of pink glue. The substance was squirted onto Kyle's hand, who then challenged Nathan to an arm wrestle . At first their teacher did not believe them but soon realised the pair could not be freed. School staff contacted the boys' parents at 10am, with Nathan's mother, Chris Coxon, 46, arranging for transport to take boys to the One Life Hartlepool out of hours health centre. Once there, staff and nurses giggled as they tried to un-stick the teenagers. Staff at the centre tried nail varnish initially, but when it did not work, a medical guide was consulted and they tried hot soapy water. After steeping their hands in the water for about half-an-hour, Nathan, 13, and Kyle, 14, both of Hartlepool, managed to pull their hands apart. The pair were back at school by lunchtime the same day. Ms Coxon, a carer and cleaner, said: . 'I couldn't believe it when the school rang to say they were glued . together and could I drop everything to go and get them. 'I . didn't believe what I was hearing at first.  I thought surely not, but . then when I saw them they were completely stuck together! After trying to free the boys from each other with nail varnish remover, medical centre staff used the simple, old fashioned method of hot soapy water to do the trick . 'I couldn't get over it. I was saying to them, 'are you sure you're not lying?' but they weren't . They couldn't take their hands apart. 'Some girl had stuck some pink glue on one of their hands and then as lads do, messing about, they had an arm wrestle and the next thing you know they were stuck together. 'My dad drove me to the school to get them and take them to the One Life. I had to help them in the van and put the seat belt right across the pair of them because it was both of their right hands that were glued.' The mother-of-five said Nathan has always been accident prone after splitting his chin open, breaking his heel and then his arm in separate incidents over the years. She added: 'The staff had a right laugh at them and they had to read to find out what would take it off. 'Then they put their hands in scalding hot water with soap for a good 30 minutes before they were eventually freed.' Mark Tilling, headteacher of High Tunstall College of Science, said: 'Two Year 9 students had to be taken to the One Life Centre on Tuesday after their hands were glued together following a prank in school. 'Medical staff were able to free their hands and no injuries were sustained. The school dealt promptly with the incident and has taken appropriate action.'","A prank saw Nathan Wilkins, 13, and Kyle Robson, 14, stuck together .

Jailed: History teacher David Timmins, 41, was jailed today for three counts of sexual activity with a child aged under 16 . A teacher has been jailed for more than two and a half years after repeatedly groping a 15-year-old girl in his office. David Timmins, 41, who was in charge of child protection at Ercall Wood Technology College in Telford, Shropshire, bombarded the schoolgirl with emails and showered her with gifts. The history teacher even offered to give her money for hair dye and talked about eloping with her before luring her into his office at break times where he kissed her and touched her inappropriately. Timmins even turned up at the girl's work experience placement where he kissed and hugged her. When he was caught and arrested on child sex charges, Timmins initially tried to blame the school for 'over promoting' him. He was jailed for two years and eight months at Shrewsbury Crown Court after admitting three counts of sexual activity with a child under 16. Sentencing him, Judge Robin Onions told Timmins: 'You will know that as a teacher you were in a position of trust. 'In your particular case the position of trust was particularly important because you were also the pastoral manager. 'The victim in this case was only 15-years-old. She was vulnerable because you were in a pupil-teacher relationship where all the power lay with you. 'You claim you were over-promoted as pastoral manager but that's no reason, no excuse for you to turn your feelings into an emotional response to this pupil. 'You were in fact the one who was making all the running, it was cloud cuckoo land because you were talking of a future that you could never have together. 'The victim was vulnerable due to her age, due to the fact that she had been bullied and she had little sexual and emotional experience. 'It's perfectly clear as a teacher you had talent and you had a career until you threw it all away with this particular behaviour.' The court heard Timmins had worked at the school - which caters for 660 pupils aged 11-16 - for 14 years before he was put in charge of child protection. The court heard he initially spoke to the victim about their shared interest in history, music and being bullied at school but soon the relationship developed. Position of responsibility: Ercall Wood Technology College in Telford where David Timmons worked . Timmins began seeing the girl before and after school as well as at break times where he would kiss her on the lips. When . she was questioned, the victim told police that Timmins had touched . her, both over and under her clothing, while they were in his office at . the school. He was eventually caught after he accidentally emailed a former pupil instead of the girl in May last year. He was arrested when the woman, who was at university, contacted the headteacher in September after discussing rumours about the teacher with her friends during the summer. Prosecutor Robert Edwards said: 'This matter first came to light when she received two emails from the defendant. It was immediately obvious to her there had been a mistake. 'Later that day she received an email asking her to delete the emails. 'She was away at university at the time and when she returned she met up with some friends and these friends discussed a rumour about the defendant and a pupil. 'On . September 10 she contacted the headteacher, she disclosed to him the . existence of the emails and he realised they related to this defendant . and a pupil at the school. 'The . defendant was working as a history teacher and perhaps more worryingly . he was also the school's pastoral manager dealing with students' personal problems. 'Later that day the girl, who was aged 15 at that time, was spoken to by police. 'Things had progressed to exchanging emails out of school hours and from there things developed to the defendant and the young lady seeing each other before school, at break times and after school. 'Things first became physical when the girl was on work experience. 'The defendant visited her placement and during that visit he hugged her and he instigated them kissing each other on the lips. 'She said they talked about eloping together, what sort of house they would live in when she left school and that they loved each other.' Timmins was arrested and initially given bail but was re-arrested and remanded in custody after officers discovered he was trying to contact the girl via Facebook. Mr Edwards added: 'During a second interview the complainant made further disclosures. 'She began by saying it was very much the defendant who was the driving force behind the relationship. 'She said it was the defendant who had instigated the first physical contact between them and he had discussed moving away together on more than one occasion.' Michael Sherwood-Smith, defending, said: 'Mr Timmins accepts total responsibility for this relationship. 'He has great respect for her intellectual and emotional responsibility but clearly he's over estimated the latter.' Timmins was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register and barred from working with children for life.","David Timmins, 41, was jailed for two years and eight months today .

A woman has been arrested for allegedly conning her Port Charlotte church with claims her four sons had been killed in action - soliciting donations and support from the well-meaning congregation. Shirley Duncan, 49, of North Port, Florida was arrested on Thursday after allegedly dressing in black to attend the Community Life Center Church in Port Charlotte, claiming her boys had all been killed while fighting for their country. In fact she is a mother of two and only one of her sons serves in the armed forces. Arrested: Shirley Duncan, left, has been arrested on suspected fraud of the Community Life Center Church, Port Charlotte, right. She told churchgoers that her four sons had been killed in war to allegedly solicit gifts . Nicanol 'Nick' Collazo stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, is alive and well and alerted local police to his mother's alleged scam in which she is claimed to have raided his Facebook account as well as using random soldier pictures from the internet to make her story seem real. She even held a memorial service using pictures of her armed forces son following his 'death' in Iraq in October. Senior pastor Mark Coffey told the ABC News: 'This really takes the cake. When you come up and you are dressed in black and you literally have tears flowing in the church service. Coming up after and saying pastor please pray for me.' She allegedly told Pastor Coffey and church members that he was her fourth son killed on the front line. She told them she was struggling to make ends meet following her youngest son's death and needed help with bills, members of the church told the channel. Stolen from Facebook: Nick Collazo, left, was one of the soldiers 'remembered' at his mother's memorial service at Community Life Center Church, right, but he isn't dead and is based in a camp in Kentucky .

'She asked for a bill to be paid. We did, just like we would for anybody else,' Pastor Coffey said. It total parishioners gave Duncan more than $1,000 in cash and goods to help her make ends meet including clothes and furniture. The church asked Duncan for documentation related to the deaths. She presented them with a letter supposedly from the secretary of war signed by an Adjutant General J.A. Ulio -detectives later discovered he had died 50 years ago. Parishoner Anne Soloduk said they thought something was unusual in her case but they felt they couldn't accuse her of wrongdoing given the subject matter. 'In our gut we felt that something just wasn't right but you hate to accuse any mother of lying about dead children,' she told ABC. Eventually her son suspected the deception and contacted the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office. The church tried to contact Ms Duncan to say they would forgive her if she came to them to explain but she never returned. Police say she may have used a similar scam at other churches in the area. In a statement Sheriff Bill Prummell commented: 'It really sickens me when someone pulls at the heartstrings of people who want to help, and yet take advantage of them and our military men and women by profiting from her actions.' She is being held at Charlotte County Jail on charges of fraud and reportedly denies any wrongdoing.","Shirley Duncan, 49, of North Port, Florida has been arrested accused of conning her fellow church-goers .

Charged: Peggy Sue Thomas was accused of plotting with her then-boyfriend to kill a man named Russ Douglas in December 2003 . A former Ms Washington and hairdresser who had been implicated in the 2003 death of a man found fatally shot in Washington state, has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. Island County authorities say Peggy Sue Thomas will spend four years in prison after she is sentenced in February after her charges were reduced to rendering criminal assistance. Thomas, who was crowned Ms Washington in 2000 and has had a string of failed marriages since, had faced a first-degree murder charge until the plea deal that was struck on Thursday. She was accused of plotting with her then-boyfriend, James Huden, to kill a man named Russ Douglas, of Whidbey Island, who was found shot to death in a car on December 27, 2003. Huden, who was arrested in Mexico in 2005, was convicted of first-degree murder last summer and sentenced to 80 years. He could have been faced a much slimmer sentence if he had testified against Thomas, but he refused. Her trial was due to begin next week. A motive for the murder was never established, but reports suggested the duo had planned to kill Douglas out of revenge because they suspected him of abusing his wife and children. Thomas knew Douglas' wife Brenna, who owned the salon where the former beauty queen worked. 'It was some weird karmic revenge thing. I’m not sure if that was the motive or the only motive. There were a . lot of theories about what the motives were,' prosecutor Greg Banks told The Seattle Times. Couple: Thomas' boyfriend James Huden (right) was arrested in 2005 and pleaded not guilty to the murder, but he refused to testify against Thomas, left . In addition, Banks said that a key prosecution witness was gravely ill. Defense lawyer Craig Platt said Thomas maintains her innocence. Victim: Russ Douglas, a father of two from Whidbey Island, was found shot to death in a car just after Christmas in 2003 . Platt told the Seattle Times: 'What she’s guilty of is getting in with the wrong guy. She's guilty of having poor taste in men.' He added that the plea she entered on Thursday gives her much-needed relief from a case that has dogged her for nearly a decade. After her 2000 pageant victory, Peggy Sue got married - a few times. One of those nuptials was a short-lived marriage to Alaska oil tycoon Mark Allen. Allen's horse Mine That Bird, won the Kentucky Derby in 2009 - the same year the couple divorced, according to a 2011 profile in Seattle Weekly. Thomas was arrested in July 2011 on her houseboat, called Off the Hook, near Farmington, New Mexico. But after posting $500,000 bail, Thomas made headlines for her post-jail travels. She was allowed by a judge to take a two-week, five-state road trip so she can attend her half-sister's memorial service, go to the dentist and pick up winter clothes, after her release. The trips took her to New Mexico, Utah and Nevada to take care of a few chores - preparing to sell a house and picking up her winter clothes, among other things.","Peggy Sue Thomas, 47, who was crowned Ms Washington in 2000, implicated in 2003 death of Russ Douglas .

Crystal Morrison, 31, was last seen on August 23, shortly after she called a friend at 12.41 p.m. to pick her up from her customer services job in Concord, saying she felt sick. But before the friend arrived to collect her 20 minutes later, Crystal took off on foot. Colleagues said she did not tell them she was leaving. A co-worker later told police they . had seen Crystal at about 1.00 p.m., walking on the road leading away . from their workplace, though where she may have been headed remains . unclear. Mystery: Crystal Morrison, pictured, was last seen on August 23 after she walked from work, but relatives say she would not have run away as she was devoted to her eight-year-old son Kyson, right . Family members insist Crystal would not have left her eight-year-old son Kyson behind, and said the mother also requires daily medication and an inhaler for her asthma. They added that she has no . known enemies. She has been divorced from her husband for several years and he now lives in another state. 'The $30 million question is, why did she . walk out? Why did she leave after she made the phone call?' Kevin . Ryan, the private investigator hired by the family, asked the  Charlotte Observer. 'Based on the interviews I've done, I can almost say for certainty that she definitely did not run away. Someone out there . knows where she's at and what’s going on. I honestly believe that.' This weekend, the CUE Center for Missing Persons in Wilmington partnered with the Concord police to search  a four-square-mile area near Connextions Recruiting, where Crystal worked. Hunt: Search teams look for clues in a four-square-mile area near to the place she vanished . Committed: More than 100 people used ATVs, cars, dogs and horses to search the area this weekend .

Crystal Morrison was seen walking around three miles from her workplace on August 23 . No one has reported seeing Crystal since she was seen walking past the Mistletoe Ridge neighbourhood, and her bank account and credit cards have not been used since.

She added that she is concerned for her nephew, Kyson, but that the family has rallied around him.

Troubled: A childhood friend says Jason Smith, who is charged with murder, had behavioural problems as a child . A rodent exterminator charged with the murder of a paediatrician suffered from behavioural problems as a child, according to a family friend. Jason T. Smith, 36, an exterminator of Levittown, Pennsylvania, last week confessed that he had strangled, bound and burned Dr Melissa Ketunuti in her apartment after an argument where she 'belittled him'. The family friend from many years ago, speaking on condition of anonymity, told ABC News that Smith had behavior and anger issues and liked to set things on fire. Smith faces charges of murder, arson, abuse of a corpse and causing/risking a catastrophe. Smith told investigators he committed . the crime because he felt like Ketunuti was disrespecting him and belittling him when he performed work on her home. Smith went to the doctor's home originally because of a rodent problem in her basement. An argument ensued, he struck her, she fell to the ground and he started to strangle her with a rope and set her alight, police revealed in a press conference last week. After he killed her, he went straight to another job in New Jersey. Smith's neighbors spoke of their shock over his confession. Meghan Fenstermaker said: 'It's crazy . because...he's outside always playing . with his children. I mean, he doesn't seem like that kind of guy. 'So, . that's why I'm really shocked at what's going on right now, because he . does seem like a family man. He doesn't seem like that kind of guy. So, . that's why this is very shocking.' Smith . lives at his home with girlfriend of six years, her mother and . daughter. He has one son who does not live with him, according to Levittown Patch. Dr Ketunuti, 35, was found in the basement of her home on Monday afternoon by her dog walker. Police said she was still smoldering when they arrived and the rope was still around her neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Victim: Melissa Ketunuti, who worked at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was only 35 when she was hog tied, strangled and set on fire . Home: Police searched Smith's house on Wednesday night and took away his car for investigation . Evidence: Police believe there is crucial evidence in the silver truck belonging to the 'person of interest' which they have taken away as part of the investigation . Remains: Police officers carry the charred body of Melissa Ketunuti from her home to the police van so it can be taken to the coroner's office for an autopsy . Crime Scene investigators examined a silver Ford truck that police . sources say was caught on several surveillance cameras around the . victim's home at the time. This and other footage of Jason Smith following the victim home and then walking around the area after the attack led police to taking him into custody. Police narrowed down the time of her killing to between 10.50am - when she returned home after running a few errands - and 11.50am. Smith's mother and girlfriend - who he lives with - are being questioned and said to be cooperating with police. Neighbor Meghan Fenstermaker said: 'It's crazy because...he's outside always playing with his children. I mean, he doesn't seem like that kind of guy' Melissa Ketunuti had been a pediatrician for five years before her gruesome murder in Philadelphia . Capt James Clark said of Melissa: 'She dedicated her whole life to being a . doctor and helping kids with cancer. It's very, very unfortunate that . she died in this manner.' He said Smith had nothing more than traffic offenses on his record and noted that he and Ketunuti had never met before, and Monday was the first time Smith had been at the home. Melissa's dog walker and her doctor boyfriend - who lives in New York - were cleared as suspects and police do not know how - or if - the doctor and exterminator know each other. According to Philly.com, members of the Homicide Task Force collected surveillance from a . coffee shop, drug store and hospital overlooking where the doctor lived on Tuesday, and also removed more evidence from the house. Smith's silver truck has been taken away which police believe contains crucial evidence. Captain James Clarke said in a press conference today: 'An argument ensued between them, he struck her, she fell to the ground and he started to strangle her with a rope and set her alight' Chief Inspector Scott Small said: 'Fire department puts out the fire and pronounces her dead. At this time we don't know the cause of death' Melissa . Ketunuti, 35, lived alone with her dog in the quiet, residential area of . Philadelphia. Firefighters responded to the call around 12.30pm and . discovered the bound body in her basement. Authorities say she was fully clothed and there were no signs of sexual assault. There were no signs of forced entry and nothing was taken which led police to believe she knew her murderer. Mellisa worked at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and was an avid blogger. The hospital revealed today she was a second year infectious diseases fellow and researcher at CHOP. 'Melissa . was a warm, caring, earnest, bright young woman with her whole future . ahead of her,' said Paul Offit, MD, chief of the Division of Infectious . Diseases, in a written statement. 'But . more than that, she was admired, respected and loved by those with whom . she worked here at CHOP. Her death will have a profound impact on those . who worked with her and we will all miss her deeply.' Pet: Melissa's body was found by her dog walker and friends say she lived for the pit bull/lab mix named Pooch and would often be seen walking him around the area .

The boys were 'best buddies,' she said, 'and we're concerned about Logan, and how he will handle this.' Chamberlain said she is a longtime friend of Logan's mother and has been offering help to the family.

Piercing: The pencil Olivia Smith fell on traveled across her brain to the back of her scull next to her left ear, pictured. Doctors managed to remove it without surgery helping to ensure no further injury to the toddler . An x-ray at the hospital revealed the pencil's path. It entered through her right eye diagonally across the brain to her left ear. She suffered three strokes during her ordeal but doctors were somehow able to remove the pencil without surgery. Following their amazing procedure, Olivia began to return to being her energetic self. She spent eight days in hospital and a week in rehabilitation, aiding her return to full movement following the strokes which affected her right side. She returned home on Wednesday and is now expected to make a full recovery without any damage to her sight, brain or movement. She is already up and running around as usual. Grateful: Olivia Smith's parents Tyler and Susie expressed their gratitude to the local emergency workers, pictured with Susie and Olivia, who helped rush their daughter to hospital two and a half weeks ago . Concerned: Olivia Smith's parents, Susie and Tyler, pictured, were terrified about what would happen to their daughter following the accident. However, she has fully recovered . Full health: Doctors say Olivia Smith, pictured, is expected to return to full health after the accident last month . 'For two days she didn't really have any progress. She was opening her eyes but she wasn't talking or responding or smiling or anything,' her father Tyler Smith told the New Hampshire Union Leader. 'She started to crack a bit of a smile, very small, only on that one side, then a little later I got her to laugh and she said, 'Daddy,' which was an amazing moment.' Her mother, who is 20 weeks pregnant and cares for the couple's two other daughters as well, added: 'She is so strong. She's a fighter. If she wants to do something. she's going to do it. She's amazing.' 'The neurosurgeon said if you were to sit down and map out a way you would want a pencil to go through the brain, that's what you would have happen, because it missed everything,' she told the local newspaper. Emergency workers dubbed it a 'miracle'. 'These things don't happen,"" said New Boston Fire Chief Dan MacDonald, who was first to respond to the call said in the report. 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.'","Orange coloring pencil was poking two inches out of 19-month-old Olivia Smith's eye following the incident .

A Las Vegas teacher has sparked controversy for letting two students dress in Ku Klux Klan costumes for a class presentation on U.S history. The two Las Vegas Academy of the Arts juniors, who haven't been named, were given the go ahead to dress in white robes and hooded masks on January 9 for an assignment, which involved either writing a research paper or expressing their knowledge through art, dance or a first-person narrative. The students were allegedly told not to wear the KKK costumes outside the classroom but one did and a photograph taken of him by shocked peers was posted on social media and quickly spread through the school community. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Picture: A photo taken of a Las Vegas Academy student dressed in a Ku Klux Klan costume, pictured, for a class presentation on U.S history caused controversy . According to the Las Vegas Sun, school officials received several complaints after the image was posted online. Clark County School District officials investigated and the Las Vegas Academy principal Scott Walker sent parents a letter calling the incident 'unfortunate.' 'While the presentation was designed to highlight the atrocities committed by the Klan, and there was no intention to harm or offend on the part of the students, it was in poor judgment and inappropriate for students to go to such lengths to convey their message,' he said. The social studies teacher hasn't been identified and the teacher, nor the students, have been disciplined after the incident. District communications officer, Amanda Fulkerson, called it a personnel matter. School officials and community members in Las Vegas said they don't fault the educator and several students, parents, teachers and one school board member backed the teacher at a meeting. School: The incident happened on Jan. 9 at the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts, pictured . 'This teacher has my support,' said Clark County school Trustee Linda Young, the only black and minority school board member. Young noted that she didn't receive complaints from the public, and said she believed the teacher meant no harm. Esther Langston, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, professor emeritus with the Delta Sigma Theta black sorority and educational organization, said the teacher needed the academic freedom to educate students in a creative fashion. Clark County School District equity and diversity chief Greta Peay said teachers must prepare carefully before and after a potentially controversial lesson to avoid misunderstandings. The Sun reported the same performing arts magnet high school came under public scrutiny last year after theater students used the N-word during a production of 'Big River: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.' The same teacher who let students wear KKK costumes also permitted students to dress as Adolf Hitler in other assignments, the newspaper said. Officials said that since August 2012, more than 6,500 of the district's 18,000 teachers have taken voluntary diversity training classes, mostly after school and on weekends.","Two juniors at Las Vegas Academy of the Arts wore white robes and hooded masks for a class presentation on Jan. 9 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 09:25 EST, 28 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 28 January 2013 . Professional counsellors are being drafted into a rural village to offer advice to residents after seven people, including five teenagers, killed themselves in less than two years. The victims, who all either lived in or had close connections to East Leake in Nottinghamshire, committed suicide between February 2011 and October 2012. Now, in a bid to halt the 'suicide contagion' sweeping through the community, the bereaved mother of the most recent victim is setting up a self-help group to try to prevent more deaths. Jamie Johnson, 19, left, was found hanged seven months after his friend Louis Way, 19, right, killed himself . Called the Tomorrow Project, it will work with NHS counsellors on advising those most at risk in the large village. The Tomorrow Project has been set up by Penny Johnson whose son Jamie, 19, died on a family holiday to Turkey last October. Jamie had been struggling to get over the death of his friend Louis Way, 19, who hanged himself seven months earlier. Mrs Johnson, 39, said: 'People are worried about . the alarming rise of suicides in the village: we are 1,200 per cent . above the national average for suicides in East Leake. 'I don't want Jamie's death to be in vain.  People are worried there could be more deaths and we have to do everything we can. 'The Tomorrow Project is aimed at trying to support young people through difficult times in their lives.' Chloe Hayden, 17, was the first of seven suicides around East Leake, followed by her friend Daniel Raynor, 18 . Mrs Johnson, who has two other sons, . Ross, 16, and Johnny, ten, told how her eldest son had been affected by . the death of his friend. She said: 'Jamie was best friends with Louis and was with him the night he died. 'They'd been in the pub for a couple of drinks on a Sunday night and when they'd left the pub, Jamie said to Louis ""See you tomorrow mate"" and that was the last time he saw him. East Leake, pictured above, is at the centre of a spate of suicides that have devastated the community . The Nag's Head pub in East Leake is run by the mother of one victim, 19-year-old Jamie Johnson . 'The next day Jamie was walking to the bus stop to go to work when Louis' brother rang him and told him he'd taken his own life. 'Jamie took it very badly and went into a deep depression for a while.  He was withdrawn and drank a lot and on one occasion said he wanted to take his own life.' Mrs Johnson said she rang the NHS and a counsellor talked to Jamie on the phone, but she said that because her son was over 18 they were 'powerless' to do anything. She said: 'Jamie told the NHS counsellor I was overreacting and he hadn't meant what he had said.' Her son appeared to get his life back together and got a job as a kitchen porter in Corsica before working in Lineker's bar in Cyprus. She said: 'When he came home he seemed happy and was loving life.' 'We went on holiday to Turkey and three days after we got there he went up to his hotel room and after three hours, his uncle went up and found him hanged. 'He didn't leave a note and we might never know if he did it because of Louis' death but what I strongly believe is that because of what happened to Louis, suicide became an option for Jamie. 'The Tomorrow Project is aimed at all people who want to talk about their concerns or for parents who want advice. 'If the Tomorrow Project had been around before Jamie died I might have been able to recognise some of the warning signs which I missed.' Mrs Johnson, who runs the village's Nag's Head pub, has converted its back room into a drop-in centre for worried residents. She launched the Tomorrow Project at the weekend, and it will be funded for the first six months with help from the self-harm charity Harmless, as well as monies raised by village fundraisers. As part of the project, there will be therapy sessions - funded by the NHS - with counsellors in East Leake for anybody who might be affected by suicide or have concerns about difficulties in their own lives. The spiral of suicides began in February 2011, when talented singer Chloe Hayden, 17, was found hanged in her bedroom in the Nottinghamshire village of Chilwell. A week later her best friend, Daniel Raynor, 18, who went to school with Jamie Johnson and Daniel Raynor, was found dead. At their inquests, Nottinghamshire Coroner Dr Nigel Chapman was so alarmed he called for the police to investigate the deaths to prevent a 'cluster' of copy-cat suicides. Rural village: Residents in East Leake want to prevent a 'suicide contagion' sweeping through the community . All of those who died had either lived in or had strong connections to the village near the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border . But on January 9 last year Louis Way, who had gone to the same school as Daniel, was found dead at his home in East Leake. The promising footballer, who 'lived for sport' had hanged himself. Just a few months later in August 2012, another teenage girl in the village was found dead, and last October Louis' best friend Jamie Johnson killed himself on holiday. According to Harmless, other people with close links to the village committed suicide recently, including a teacher on placement at the local school and another middle-aged man from the village who drank in the Nag's Head. Caroline Roe, a director of Harmless which is leading the Tomorrow Project, said: 'We are trying to engage people and encourage people, of all ages, to talk about their concerns. 'What happens is that people can be affected by behaviours in people living in their communities and in this situation there is a risk of a suicide contagion.' Natalie Way, 24, the sister of Louis Way, said: 'I think about Louis every day, nothing can take away the pain. 'I remember my dad telling me what happened and I just didn't believe it; I went numb. 'Young men sometimes bottle up a lot of things and often don't want to talk to anyone. We need to try and change this.'

It's already been dubbed ‘space grave robbery’, but it’s not quite as sinister as the name suggests. Defunct communication satellites are being scavenged for their valuable parts and recycled to reduce the cost of building new ones in the latest pet project from the Pentagon's research wing. When satellites retire, certain parts such as antennas and solar panels often still work - but there is currently no routine effort to salvage and reuse satellite parts once they are launched into space. Old to new: This Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency graphic shows a satellite used for its programme scavenging defunct communication satellites for their valuable parts and recycling them to build new ones . The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency is spending £114million ($180million) to test technologies that could make this possible and thinks it can save money by repurposing in orbit. ‘We're attempting to essentially increase the return on investment (and) try to find a way to really change the economics so that we can lower the cost’ of military space missions, a spokesman said. Work on DARPA's Phoenix programme - named after the mythical bird that rose from its own ashes - has begun. The agency awarded contracts to several companies to develop new technologies. Now it is seeking fresh proposals from interested parties next month. A key test will come in 2016 when it launches a demonstration mission that seeks to breathe new life to an antenna. DARPA wants the antenna to come from a yet-to-be-determined decommissioned satellite and the agency has identified about 140 retired satellites that it can choose from for its first test. New idea: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (based in Arlington, Virginia, pictured) is testing technologies that could make this possible and thinks it can save money by repurposing in orbit . The vision is to launch a robotic . mechanic fitted out with a toolkit that can rendezvous with defunct . satellites and mine them for parts. The plan also calls for the separate . launch of mini-satellites. DARPA is used to funding blue-sky research and a few projects are slowly becoming reality. In 2011, it dangled seed money to jump-start a way to rocket people to a star within a century in what's known as the 100-year Starship programme. Long before Google tested self-driving cars, DARPA sponsored a robotic road race in which university-designed autonomous vehicles eyed for the finish line without human help. The robotic mechanic would then string . together the mini-satellites and old satellite parts to create a new . communication system. The concept is essentially to perform robotic . surgery in zero gravity. DARPA said one way to keep costs down is for the mini-satellites to take a ride in available space on commercial rockets. Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, who tracks the world's space launches and satellites, called it ‘an interesting idea’ that may reduce costs in the long-term. ‘The first few times you do this, it'll definitely be more expensive than just building the new antenna on your satellite from scratch,’ he said. ‘But in the long run, it might work out.’ Dr McDowell said the biggest challenge in the upcoming demo test is separating the antenna from the retired satellite without breaking it and then successfully integrating it with the mini-satellites.","Research project costing £114m launched by Pentagon's research wing .

A defamation case involving two of Tampa Bay's best known DJs has taken a bizarre turn after one of the shock jock's attorneys was arrested for DUI - in what he claims was set up by the other side. Charles Campbell is representing Todd 'MJ' Schnitt, who is suing on-air rival Bubba 'The Love Sponge' Clem for comments he made about him and his wife while on the radio. On Wednesday night, Campbell was stopped by police near the Malio's Prime Steakhouse in Tampa, Florida and was arrested after he refused to take a blood alcohol test. The 64-year-old had met 30-year-old Melissa Personius, who turned out to work as a paralegal for Clem's legal team, at the restaurant and they had drinks together. Scroll down for video . 'Honey trap': Paralegal Melissa Personius, pictured in court on Friday, was accused of buying drinks for a rival attorney and then calling the police to have him arrested for DUI . Police testified in court on Friday that a member of Clem's defense team called them to have Campbell arrested for DUI, ABC News reported. 'She lied to Mr. Campbell when... asked where she worked,' fellow Schnitt attorney Jonathan Ellis said in court Friday morning, as the team asked for a mistrial. 'She bought him drinks, she specifically, we believe, . asked him to move her car and we believe that she or had somebody else . call Tampa police to have Mr. Campbell pulled over.' Schnitt's lawyers said the other side . could have achieved a legal advantage because Campbell had left his briefcase . with important documents in the paralegal's car when he was stopped by police. Arrest: Charles Campbell, left, met Personius, who has had her own DUI arrests, right, at a restaurant . Scene: She allegedly bought him drinks at this Tampa Steakhouse before asking him to move her car . Personius, who has worked for the firm representing Clem for five years, said in court Friday that she had not opened the briefcase. She repeatedly invoked her right to remain silent while on the stand, and would not say whether the firm sent her to the bar or whether she was told to buy Campbell drinks while there. Personius has her own criminal record that includes a DUI arrest in 2009 and an arrest in 2011 for driving with a revoked license, WTSP reported. The trial is expected to resume as normal on Monday, as it enters its third week. Schnitt and his wife Michelle are suing Clem claiming he made 'false, highly . offensive and defamatory' statements about them on air. Court: The arrest comes after Campbell's clients, DJ Todd Schnitt and his wife Michelle, are suing fellow Florida DJ . Bubba the Love Sponge Clem (pictured) for defamation after comments he made on-air . Claims: Incidents include when Clem called former Assistant State Attorney Michelle Schnitt, right, who often appeared on her husband's, left, show, a 'whore . The spat began when Clem accused Schnitt of accepting favours and gifts from businesses in exchange for plugs on the air. He then accused Mrs Schnitt, a former assistant state attorney, of conspiring with State Attorney Mark Ober to bring animal cruelty charges against him after in 20001 after he presided over the slaughter and barbecue of a wild boar on-air. Although Clem was later acquitted of animal cruelty, he vowed revenge against the Schnitts for being prosecuted. Last week, Clem said the accusations and name-calling were all just an act and that he only attacked the Schnitt's alter ego, MJ Kelli. Controversial: Bubba The Love Sponge Clem, pictured returned to the radio in 2008 after a hiatus . Defense: Clem said the comments were directed at MJ the radio personality (pictured), not the man . The campaign, Clem's attorney, Joseph Diaco, told jurors, 'was juvenile, offensive, maybe even disgusting, but wasn't personal'. He was backed up by Brent Hatley, a 'Bubba' executive . producer and cast member, who said: 'MJ Kelli is not a real person. It's a character. Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger is not the terminator.' In the suit, the Schnitts claim Clem took a battle for ratings too . far, encouraging his fans, known as Bubba's Army, to target . the Schnitts, reported the Tampa Bay Online. He told how he was . with his children at WestShore Plaza in 2008 when a man walked up to . him in the food court and yelled obscene comments and how a similar incident happened later at a restaurant. He said that eggs were thrown at his house with a note reading 'Bubba army Rulesssssss!!!!!!' Obsessed: Hulk Hogan (pictured with ex-wife Linda) made a sex tape with . Heather Clem, pictured right with her former husband and the Hulk's best . friend Bubba The Love Sponge . On tapes heard by the jurors the voice of Bubba the Love Sponge said 'Fight back. … Be a man. I'm calling your wife a whore.' When discussing why Mrs  Schnitt was called a whore, Clem's former co-host Matt 'Spiceboy' Loyd said it was 'just a general term to try to stir it up' and was not to accuse her of being promiscuous. The past few months have been difficult for Clem as in October Hulk Hogan settled his lawsuit against him. The wrestler has dropped charges against his former best friend over his leaked sex tape, but is still suing Bubba's ex-wife Heather Clem - who stars in the saucy video alongside Hulk - and website host Gawker Media for allegedly violating his privacy.

Carole Mudie, 68, had her bag snatched and was pushed into a hedge in her garden as she returned home from a night playing bingo with friends on January 6. She underwent surgery for a broken hip but developed complications, and died on January 22. Today West Midlands police hunting for her attacker said they had now launched a manslaughter investigation after the incident in Hawkesley, Birmingham. Mrs Mudie's devastated daughter Carey Healey, 43, said: 'Our world has been blown apart and we can't believe that she has gone.' 'Mum was bubbly, happy and had a great sense of humour. 'She lived for us and the children; she was selfless like that and she had so many friends. 'The whole family is devastated that she has been taken from us in this way.' Mrs Mudie was returning from a night out at 11.10pm and had got out of her lime green Ford Focus when she was attacked in front of the home she had lived in for 30 years. Neighbours found her collapsed in a privet hedge in her front garden and she was taken by ambulance to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth II hospital. Detective Sergeant Andy Bradley, from the force's Criminal Investigation Department, said: 'We now really need the public's help as we progress this inquiry, following the tragic turn of events. 'A man is currently in custody on remand having been charged with separate matters and has been spoken to in relation to this offence. 'But what we desperately need is for anyone who witnessed the robbery of Carole Mudie to come forward.

'Regardless of how irrelevant you think it may be, the smallest piece of information could be all we need to be able to get justice for Mrs Mudie.' Neighbours of Mrs Mudie, who lived on her own on the Hawkmoor Gardens estate, spoke of their shock at what happened to the well-known grandmother. Janet Oxley, 52, said: 'Just as I was getting back from walking my dogs two of the lads who live next door were helping Carole up off the ground and back in to her house. 'She looked in a bad way but I asked if they needed help and they said everything was OK. 'That was the last time I saw her.' Neighbour Jessica Sellars, 59, said: 'She was a wonderful woman with a big personality. 'She wouldn't have given up without a fight but she was obviously no match for a big burly bloke. 'It is a close-knit area but there have been problems with crime. You don't feel safe leaving your own home. 'But what has this world come to when you're attacked on your own front doorstep?' Another neighbour, Janet Murphy, 67, added: 'I don't leave the house after dark anymore after this happened. It's such a tragedy.' A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and officers are awaiting further test results to confirm the exact cause of death.  They are also trying to establish whether Mrs Mudie was the victim of a targeted attack or opportunists.

McGarry's signature food is described as 'progressive American' and offers experimental fine dining. Dishes on offer on Wednesday will include a sunchoke confit with dehydrated grapefruit followed by smoked sturgeon and beef with wild mushrooms, celery root, black vinegar and coffee. Rather cheekily the teenager says he was inspired to take to the kitchen because he didn't like the food his mother, Meg McGarry, cooked. Thankfully she didn't take offense and bought her son cookbooks and showed him internet recipes to see if he could do any better. Hard at work: Flynn McGarry runs a regular pop-up restaurant from his family's San Fernando Valley home in California. He attends school via the internet . Experimental: The young chef tries out unusual dishes and cooking techniques in his old bedroom which has been converted into a professional kitchen . And it turns out he could. 'It was after looking at all these cookbooks and going on the Internet and looking at these dishes that I thought, ‘I could achieve that one day,'' McGarry told the website. 'I thought, every time I try it, I hope to keep getting better and better. I just fell in love with it.' 'My mom didn’t really like cooking, and when she did cook I didn’t really like her food. And I was watching something on the Food Network, and I thought, ‘I could do this''. 'I went to the bookstore and I looked for the thickest, biggest cookbook. And I found ‘The French Laundry’ by Thomas Keller. “I’ve always been very creative, and I wanted to create my own dishes, and I didn’t know too much about it – but I would do variations from ‘French Laundry’ and other cookbooks and would cook them for my family.' 'Then, I started liking the creative part of it, and I started to cook for more people then just my family.' $160-a-head: Beverly Hills Restaurant BierBeisl will host Flynn McGarry in its kitchen on Wednesday. Customers will pay $160 for the meal . Progressive American: The McGarry family say they are not in the restaurant business to make money but to allow their 14-year-old, left, to follow his passions for his food, pictured right . The mother and son duo decided to test his skills with the public and launched Eureka - a supper club that hosts monthly dinner parties inside their home. Mrs McGarry now describes herself as: 'general manager and reluctant dishwasher'. They even built a test kitchen in the teenager's bedroom so he could reach all the utensils he needs. 'It started off as two tables with some gas burners, my desk and my bed,' he explained. 'But the problem was that I need more space for more things, so I downsized my bed, got rid of my desk. And I was living in there for like a year, and I would sleep on my bed, pop it up, do my schoolwork at my work space table.' 'It was difficult because I was 13 and pretty much living and sleeping, and then the rest of the time it was a kitchen. And when my sister went to college I moved down to her room. Then we went full out with the kitchen.' Now the room has induction burners, a 10 foot plating area and four cooking stations. His pop-up club costs $150 per head but the family insist it was never a money making project. 'It is not a moneymaking thing. We lowered the prices and we are doing more food and more expensive ingredients. We are thinking of it as a fun night,' he said. McGarry is still in education but is . taught via Laurel Springs' online private school which means he can organize lessons around his cooking. McGarry's mother says they backed her son in his ambition because he exhibited such early passion for cooking. 'He is progressing so fast and it is super overwhelming, but it is also exciting,' she told ABC. 'You are always proud of your children’s accomplishments. He showed such passion for this that it was an obvious choice to allow him to do what he loves to do.'","Flynn McGarry started cooking in his family home in San Fernando Valley at the age of 11 .

Dropped bank cards, nut shells and even pens have been enough to warrant on-the-spot fines of £80. A staggering 63,883 tickets were issued in England last year compared with just 727 back in 1997. The surge follows ‘payments for penalties’ deals between 15 councils and Xfor, which typically takes £45 from each ticket. Scroll down for video . Fines: Nearly 64,000 tickets were issued in England last year compared with 727 in 1997 following 'payments for penalties' deals between 15 councils and Xfor. Picture shows the firm's enforcement officers at work in Abertillery, South Wales . Major offences: Civil liberties group the Manifesto Club has said . councils are spending more time investigating and prosecuting people for . dropping cigarette butts (right) than for fly-tipping (left) 'Booming business': The firm, which is run by former soldiers, pocketed £1.6million in commission last year . Freedom of information requests reveal the firm, which is run by former soldiers, has pocketed £1.6million in commission. It is expected to issue around 40,000 penalties this year. Councils insist the fines are popular with residents tired of litter-strewn streets. But campaigners say a ‘private police force’ is targeting pedestrians over the most trivial offences. Patrols have been known to hide in bushes waiting for smokers to drop cigarette butts. One woman in Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, says she was targeted by Xfor for accidentally dropping a cotton thread from her glove. Another was given a £75 ticket for walking her dog in a field she had used for 30 years. She was not aware it had been turned into a no-dog zone because warning signs had been stolen. Other people fined up to £80 a time had dropped a match stick, orange peel and a banana skin. In 2010-11, just seven litter fines were issued by Blaenau Gwent council. But when Xfor was contracted on a commission basis in October 2011 that figure shot up to 1,147 within six months. In the Vale of Glamorgan fines went from 22 in a year to 500 within two months. Wales accounted for 10,000 tickets on top of England’s 63,000. Litter: Dropped bank cards, nut shells and even pens have been enough to warrant on-the-spot fines of £80. Picture posed by model . And the London council of Bromley saw its £80 fines leap from just four to 618 last year. Two councils, Birmingham and Blaenau Gwent, pay Xfor by the hour. Basildon council in Essex has ended its association with the firm after just ten months saying it had lost at least £34,000 when hundreds of offenders failed to pay their fines. The authority promised to give Xfor £45 for every properly issued ticket even if the offender did not pay up. Research by the Manifesto Club, a civil liberties group, predicted almost half of all litter fines would be issued by Xfor in the coming year. Josie Appleton, who founded the group, said: ‘It is a booming business. People are not being fined for the most serious offences but for the most trivial. The people who work for Xfor have the power to fine like a private police force but they do not behave in the way a police force would. Many of them are ex-armed forces personnel, when they are on the streets they wear black fleeces and they appear to deliberately blend into the crowd to catch people littering. ‘We have had reports of them hiding in bushes watching a group of people smoking before leaping out to fine people who have dropped butts. ‘Many councils are spending more time investigating and prosecuting people for dropping cigarette butts than for fly-tipping.’ Those who receive fines can take their case to court but risk being fined £2,000 if they lose. John Fassenfelt, who is chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, warned against the use of private firms. ‘Magistrates' court is much more transparent and consistent,’ he said. Colin Smith, deputy leader of Bromley Council, said the litter scheme was not a money-spinner, adding: ‘It’s a hard line policy. We’re keen to drive the message, residents are sick to death of littering.’ Hillingdon council in West London issued 3,048 litter fines last year. Clamping down: Councils have insisted the fines are popular with residents who are tired of litter on their streets . A spokesman said: ‘Our residents told us they wanted us to take a tougher stance on littering in Hillingdon and we responded. The council does not aim to make a profit and the income from penalties received helps to fund the running costs of the scheme.’ Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Those who harm the environment by shamelessly littering and fly-tipping should be brought to book. ‘But councils shouldn't be using residents as cash cows and shouldn't be persecuting people for petty or insignificant breaches.’ A spokesman for Xfor last night said: ‘We understand concerns raised with regard to alleged incentivising private enforcement services. We offer a menu of payment options. ‘This includes daily rates as well as a percentage of the revenue from each appropriately raised fixed penalty notice. ‘The vast majority of clients choose the second option to maximise cost effectiveness and achieve cost neutrality. The only people affected by our presence are individuals that leave litter.’ A young woman who dropped a salt sachet in a car park is facing a bill of more than £400. Laura Howells, 24, was eating a KFC takeaway in her car when she was approached by a council official who handed her a £75 on-the-spot fine. But she was then ordered to pay £316.85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge after she appeared in court for failing to pay up. ‘I felt sick when I found out how much the fine was,’ said Miss Howells, of Kidwelly, West Wales.","A firm, run by former soldiers, pocketed £1.6million in commission last year .

A barber who used a megaphone to warn motorists of traffic wardens near his shop has been silenced after being put on a council ‘blacklist’. Andy Blackwell was popular with those he saved from a possible parking fine. But he says that after issuing one of his warning cries recently, two ‘angry’ wardens confronted him and he was later visited by police. Warning: Andy Blackwell, claims he has received a warning letter from Cornwall Council, after warning locals in Liskeard when traffic wardens were approaching using his loudspeaker . Now Cornwall Council has put him on . its ‘cautionary contacts list’ which is designed to prevent risk to its . employees – and he has decided to hang up his megaphone. Mr . Blackwell, 51, who runs a barber shop called Blackie’s, in Liskeard, . said his original aim was ‘to warn people that traffic wardens were in . the area, so they had a fair chance of moving their cars’. He added: ‘As far as I was concerned I was doing a public service. It’s a little bit of fun, and people have thanked me.’ Public service: Mr Blackwell said the council had placed him on their 'cautionary contacts list' but described his warnings as a public service . Of the recent incident, he recalled: . ‘There were two of them booking a repeat offender so I decided to warn . the public and went out with my loudhailer. 'The traffic wardens came hurtling . round – one of them tripped over. One said they were going to tell the . police. I realised then they were getting very angry. ‘I never threatened or cursed or . swore or offended anybody. As far as I was aware I was just having a bit . of fun and doing a public service. 'When I told the police what had gone . on they gave me plenty of advice and said be careful because the council . take a dim view of this.’ Three days later he received a letter from the council saying he’d been placed on the ‘cautionary contacts list’. He was told he would remain in the files for a year for ‘verbally abusing’ two wardens who suffered ‘extreme distress’. Deterrent: The hairdresser has long campaigned against parking fares in the town, claiming they deter shoppers from coming to the town centre . Warnings: Mr Blackwell said the warning letter referred to an incident when he had warned the public about two traffic wardens operating in an area . Mr Blackwell said he did not want to . ‘antagonise’ the council further so would no longer use the megaphone, . although customers would still be allowed to. He added: ‘The traffic wardens don’t move people on, they just issue tickets and generate income.’ He has now started a petition for free parking in the town. Last year he began dishing out his own . ‘tickets’ on cars – which contained £1 in cash as a contribution . towards drivers’ parking costs, to help local businesses. He said the £1 gift was designed to . encourage visitors back to the town, adding: ‘Even if you do pay, the . traffic wardens are on your case if you’re five minutes late. ‘If they were to back off, people would come in to town. They don’t want to be given a parking fine. ‘The council might as well put barbed wire fencing and dogs around to stop people coming in.’ Mr Blackwell has won support from . other Liskeard residents. Shopkeeper Rosie Harmsworth, 32, whose husband . is a customer of Mr Blackwell, said: ‘I hear the siren and I chuckle. Abuse: A Cornwall Council spokesman said the cautionary contacts lists is 'an internal system which aims to protect council staff from potentially harmful situations, including physical assault and verbal abuse' 'The traffic wardens appear from nowhere and I spend most of my wages on parking. ‘Fines are about £50 or £60 and that . is really expensive. Andy has been great and he even puts pound coins on . people’s windscreens.’ She added: ‘The traffic wardens are a bit sad. They need to chill out and take a joke.’ Grocer Andrew Beddow, 47, said: ‘The wardens are very aggressive. They pointed their fingers in Andy’s face and it is not on. ‘No one can afford the fines they give out. They are out of order for reporting him when they could have had a quiet word. ‘They need to see the funny side of it and leave him alone.’ Cornwall Council said in a statement: . ‘The cautionary contacts list is an internal system which aims to . protect council staff from potentially harmful situations, including . physical assault and verbal abuse. ‘Many local authorities around the country have similar schemes in place. ‘This information is only used within . the council and is only available to those employees who may potentially . be exposed to such risks.’","Andy Blackwell, 51, campaigned against parking fares in town of Liskeard .

Less than half of Britain's rail passengers think the railways are value for money despite train operators celebrating 'record' satisfaction poll results. The damning verdict comes after passengers were hit with inflation-busting fare rises in January of up to 10 per cent. Satisfaction with ‘value for money’ averages a paltry 47 per cent – dropping to just 29 per cent for the lowest scoring train company. Rated joint worst for value for money are South West Trains (pictured) and Greater Anglia . Up to one in five passengers of the worst performing train companies remain dissatisfied with the overall service they get. On individual routes, up to a quarter of passengers are unimpressed with services according to the latest satisfaction survey by consumer watchdog Passenger Focus. Despite this, train companies were celebrating ‘record’ satisfaction ratings overall – although they do admit they ‘must do better.’ Passenger Focus chief executive, Anthony Smith, welcomed improvements but said ‘more needs to be done.' Mixed opinion: Passenger Focus chief executive, Anthony Smith (left) said 'more needs to be done' to improve the railways but rail minister Norman Baker said the survey was 'encouraging' First Great Western had one of the lowest satisfaction results among customers in London .

Express (40 per cent), Southern (42 per cent), c2c (46 per cent), First . Capital Connect (49 per cent) and Chiltern Railways (50 per cent). But when broken down to individual routes, the figures are even more shocking. How services fare in the survey by Passenger Focus . Just 29 per cent of passengers on the Greater Anglia mainline are satisfied it is value for money. On South West Trains’s Reading and Windsor service, the figure is just 33 per cent while London services stand at 35 per cent. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘There is no room for complacency. 'Far too many passengers remain frustrated at spiralling ticket prices, overcrowding and delays. 'The Government must end above inflation fares hikes.’ Thirty . five per cent of customers believe Southern's Gatwick Express is value . for money while Southeastern’s mainline services rates just 36 per . cent. Fewer than 48 per . cent of passengers on First Great Western’s London Thames Valley . services think they get value for their ticket price. But it is even worse on First Capital Connect’s Thameslink North services at just 34 per cent. North . of the border, only just 52 per cent of ScotRail passengers were . satisfied with the value for money – dropping to just 40 per cent for urban . services. Satisfaction . levels for value for money from individual operators also dropped for . Grand Central, Heathrow Connect and ScotRail seeing the largest . falls of six per cent - down to 73 per cent, 52 per cent and 52 per cent . respectively. Overall . satisfaction on individual routes ‘still varies widely’ for the worst . performing Northern’s Manchester & Liverpool route (76 per cent) to . the top rated Island Line on the Isle of Wight (97 per cent), operated . by South West trains. However, . the survey says passengers across Great Britain have reported ‘record . levels’ of overall satisfaction with train services – 85 per cent . overall with no operator scoring less than 80 per cent. Lowest . ratings for overall satisfaction were given to Northern Rail (80 per . cent), First Capital Connect (81 per cent), Southern (82 per cent), . Greater Anglia, First Great Western and London Midland (all at 83 per . cent). Highest ratings for . overall satisfaction were achieved by Grand Central (96 per cent), First . Hull Trains (95 per cent), and Heathrow Connect (94 per cent). Heathrow Express, c2c, and London Overground all scored 93 per cent satisfaction rating. Nationally, some 83 per cent of passengers were satisfied with punctuality, up from 81 per cent in the autumn of last year. But there were wide differences with the worst performers London Midland, Southern and Northern Rail and First Great Western. Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) said the findings were ‘further evidence of the success of today's railway’ saying: ‘Overall passenger satisfaction is at a record high and people are taking the train in growing numbers.’ But he added: ‘We recognise there is still much to be done.’ Rail Minister Norman Baker added: ‘It is very encouraging that satisfaction levels are at a record high of 85 per cent. ‘But there are areas where satisfaction is lower such as on fares, which is why we are determined to end the era of above-inflations increases as soon as we can.’","Passengers were hit with fare rises of up to 10 per cent in January .

A married man who killed his lover, hid her body and kept up a charade that she was still alive for nearly 18 years was jailed for 12 years today. Kevin Doherty made two sham calls to himself claiming they were from Jane Harrison. He told police he thought the 32-year-old had gone off with another man, the Old Bailey was told. Doherty, 57, of South Woodford, east London, was found guilty of manslaughter after a jury could not reach a verdict on murder. Jane Harrison, left, was killed by Kevin Doherty, right, who went on to hide her body and pretend she was still alive, a jury at the Old Bailey was told . Father-of-three Doherty had a volatile three year affair with Miss Harrison after they met in a nightclub in 1992. They frequently split up but Doherty who was eight years older than Miss Harrison told detectives 'he was besotted with her' adding, 'It was not as if he was in love with her, it was a purely sexual relationship'. Judge Christopher Moss told Doherty: 'On June 15, 1995, Jane Harrison disappeared following a holiday shopping trip in your company in Wood Green. 'She was never seen again. On the jury's verdict, the reason she has never been seen alive again is because you killed her. 'Why it is her body has never been found is known only to one person. Only you know what truly occurred all those years ago, how she died and where her remains lie. 'You have kept that dreadful secret for 17-and-a-half years. Only you can decide whether anyone will ever know that which you have kept to yourself.' CCTV shows Kevin Doherty and Jane Harrison together at Wood Green Shopping City 18 years ago . He added: 'You took the life of a much-loved daughter, sister and mother and have caused those who survived her to agonise over the years between then and now about what came to be of her. 'That is a heavy and wicked responsibility to bear - not only in the past but also in the future if you choose to keep it yourself.' Miss Harrison was last seen shopping with Doherty for a Florida holiday they were due to take two days later in June 1995. But the prosecution said Doherty killed her, took her body to a lock-up garage and reported her missing the next day. 'Only you know what truly occurred all those years ago - how she died . and where her remains lie.' Judge Christopher Moss . The body of the mother of two boys . has never been found and the evidence against Doherty was only . circumstantial, said Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting. A few hours after she disappeared, Doherty secretly used his mobile to ring Miss Harrison’s flat in Highbury, north London. He picked up her phone and was heard to say: 'Where are you now?' Her babysitter said Doherty looked . 'sweaty and panicky' and claimed it was Miss Harrison on the phone, . saying she would be home later. Mr Rees said: 'This purported phone call was nothing more than a continuation of the charade the defendant had embarked upon. 'This call was not made by Jane Harrison. The call came from his mobile. He was pretending to speak to Jane.' Shortly afterwards, the phone rang again when Miss Harrison’s teenage son Ryan had returned home and asked where his mother was. He heard Doherty say: 'Don’t worry, come home.' Never found: Ms Harrison's body has not been found by police, a jury at the Old Bailey (pictured) heard . Mr Rees said: 'This was the second . sham telephone call the defendant made to the flat using his mobile . phone, pretending to be Jane Harrison. Essentially, he was trying to . manufacture an alibi.' Doherty was questioned about her abduction in 1995 but was arrested last year after a murder inquiry was launched. He told officers he and Miss Harrison . had an on-off relationship during the three years they were together, . with him sometimes living with his wife. Kevin Doherty, 57, hid his lover's body and kept up a charade that she was still alive for 18 years . Mr Rees said: 'He said he was not a jealous person even though they had split up on a number of occasions. 'He said he kept going back and was besotted with her. It was a sexual thing and he was not in love with her.' Mr Rees said Miss Harrison was last seen at Wood Green Shopping City, north London. Doherty told police he dropped her off near her mother’s house in Stoke Newington before going to her flat nearby. She was a devoted mother to Ryan and . Taylor, the baby she had with Doherty. It would be inconceivable that . she would not contact them if she was still alive, he added. Mr Rees said Doherty, who had three . children from his marriage, was working as a warehouse manager at the . time and often hired vans. Miss Harrison liked going on holidays and he would pay for her and her family to travel to countries such as Portugal. 'The defendant and Miss Harrison maintained that volatile on-off relationship until her disappearance,' he said. Detective Inspector Dermot Carroll said later: 'At last Jane’s family have got the justice they have sought. 'Doherty has kept his lie for almost . two decades. He has persistently lied to police, Jane’s family and to . his own family and friends. 'I only hope now he has the decency to tell us what happened to Jane.' Earlier, the court heard Doherty, along with his three adult children, had been acting as a carer for his disabled wife, who suffers from arthritis and was in hospital on the day he was arrested last year. Mr Rees said Ms Harrison's family were 'strong Catholics' who had been denied the right to give her a proper burial.","Married Kevin Doherty, 57, killed lover Jane Harrison, 32, 18 years ago .

'Made to feel like a criminal': Comedian Freddie Starr has cancelled his Back From The Jungle Tour show in Swindon so he can focus on defending sex abuse allegations against him . Fans were expecting to see the comedian perform his Back From The Jungle Tour at the Wyvern Theatre in Swindon, Wiltshire, tomorrow, despite his arrest on Thursday. Only around 300 tickets - costing £19.50 - out of 635 had been sold for the event, which was due to start at 7.30pm.

Bonus: Antony Jenkins, who took over from Bob Diamond as chief executive of Barclays, is set to receive a bonus of £1 million . Barclays triggered outrage last night as it emerged it plans to pay its new boss a £1million bonus despite being engulfed in scandal last year. Antony Jenkins, who took over from Bob Diamond as chief executive at the end of August with a brief to clean up the bank’s image, is being lined up for a seven-figure payout on top of his £1.1million salary. However, critics say Barclays should not pay such big bonuses for 2012 – a year when its name was dragged through the mud. In total, it is thought the bank is preparing to pay up to £2billion in bonuses for the last financial year. But Barclays was forced to cough up £290million over its involvement in the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal – a humiliating episode which cost Mr Diamond his job. It has also been accused of aggressive tax avoidance and mis-selling products such as payment protection insurance to unsuspecting customers. The row over bonuses at Barclays came a day after it emerged that RBS was planning to pay its investment bankers £250million for 2012, despite being more than 80 per cent owned by taxpayers. Critics reacted with anger to the prospect of another round of bumper bonuses following a year of shame for the industry. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: ‘Recent scandals have decimated consumer confidence, and the public will be rightly outraged if senior bankers get huge bonuses despite their failings. Cleanup: Mr Jenkins, who previously ran the Barclays retail banking arm and the credit cards division Barclaycard, was appointed chief executive to clean up the bank's tarnished image . Mega pay: Mr Jenkins's pay pales in comparison to Diamond's, who earned £17 million in 2011 . ‘Excessive bonuses shouldn’t even be . contemplated where there is evidence of mis-selling or rate-rigging. Past bonuses should be clawed back from those who presided over . wrongdoing.’ Mr Jenkins was appointed as a ‘new . broom’ after the bank plunged into crisis under Mr Diamond. As chief . executive, his total package will be up to £8.6million, including a . salary of £1.1million, a bonus of up to £2.75million, shares in an . incentive plan worth up to £4.4million and a cash allowance of £363,000 . instead of a pension. Labour MP Chris Leslie, a shadow . Treasury minister, said: ‘While our economy is shrinking it looks set to . be another bumper bonus round for bankers. 'There should be fair rewards for performance, but these bonuses follow the Libor fixing and mis-selling scandals.’ Reward: It is thought the bank is preparing to pay a total of between £1.5 billion and £2 billion in bonuses to its staff for 2012 . Barclays sources insisted no decisions on bonuses have been taken and insisted pay is ‘something we want to bring down’. The bank paid out a total of £2.2billion in bonuses for 2011. MPs were told yesterday that a . generation of young people are being put off saving because of the . record-low base interest rate of 0.5 per cent.

We're becoming a nation of sluggards walking 80 fewer miles a year than just a decade ago, experts have revealed. The lack of exercise is leaving Britons at risk of dying early from chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. Today the  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) has published new guidance to try and tackle this 'silent epidemic.' Gridlock: Cars are choking up our towns as more people than even drive even for short trips . The controversial advice includes urging town halls to 'restrain' car use with restrictions and higher fees, thus forcing people to walk. However, a professor of exercise at Edinburgh University said action did need to be taken as being inactive was the fourth leading cause of premature deaths around the world, and the problem was getting worse. 'In the past decade we have lost about 80 miles per person per year in terms of walking for transport,' she told the Daily Telegraph. In the late 1990s we each walked around 250 miles, however by 2008 that had dropped to 170miles. At the same time the number of journeys we went by foot rather than by car plunged from 44 per cent in 1975 to 22 per cent today. Strategic and scientific adviser to the National Obesity Observatory Dr . Harry Rutter, said new guidance was thus essential to try and reverse the trend. He said: 'Only a minority of . people in England get enough physical activity to improve their health. 'This creates a huge and often invisible burden of illness and reduced . quality of life, but most people seem unaware of that burden. 'Across the population, lack of physical activity causes roughly the same level of ill health that smoking does. On the hoof: Walking to the shops can save or parking costs and is better for your health, say experts . 'We all face barriers in changing our lifestyles and many of us feel we . don't have the time or the inclination to add regular physical activity . into our lives - it can be very difficult to break old habits and change . behaviour. 'But walking and cycling to work, to school, to the shops or elsewhere can make a huge difference. 'This guidance aims to help people in local authorities, public health . professionals, schools, workplaces, the NHS and many others to make the . changes that are needed to support this safe, healthy and mostly . enjoyable physical activity.' Other suggestions to encourage activity include creating special signs showing distances and walking times. However, some of the guidelines such as raising parking charges have met with strong opposition. Chief executive of the Tax Payer's Alliance Matthew Sinclair said the 'meddling health bureaucrats' were out of touch with struggling families. He said: 'Things are tough enough for taxpayers already without meddling health bureaucrats trying to make parking more expensive. 'For more people using the car is a necessity, not a luxury. 'Parking charges damage the high street, place an unnecessary burden on struggling businesses and make life harder for households just trying to make ends meet. 'Nice's boneheaded attempts to interfere demonstrates how out of touch they are with the pressures faced by hard-pressed families.'","In the late 1990s we each walked around 250 miles, however by 2008 that had dropped to 170miles .

Hilary Mantel booked a place in history by becoming the first author to win both the Costa Book Award and the Man Booker Prize in a year . Hilary Mantel made literary history last night by becoming the first author to win both the Costa Book Award and the Man Booker Prize within a year. The author picked up the £30,000 Costa Book Award for her novel Bring Up The Bodies - three months after winning the Man Booker prize with it. The book is the second in a planned trilogy about the turbulent life and relationships of King Henry VIII’s advisor Thomas Cromwell. The first book in the trilogy, Wolf Hall, was awarded the Man Booker in 2009, making Miss Mantel, 60, the first UK author to win the Booker Prize twice. Last night chair of the judges, Radio 4 presenter Jenni Murray, said the panel had been unanimous in its decision to select Bring Up The Bodies from the shortlist of five books. She insisted Mantel’s previous success had not affected the decision, but that it was ‘simply the best book’. ‘One book stood out on head and shoulders - more than head and shoulders, on stilts above the rest and that was Hilary Mantel,’ she said. She praised the author’s writing style, saying her words were ‘poetry’. ‘It is so poetic, so beautiful, it is set in its time but it is also incredibly modern,’ she added. Dame Jenni said she had read every book on the shortlist on both her Kindle and in published form and that old-fashioned books were full of ‘pleasures’ missing from new technology. Other books on the shortlist included a comic-style graphic memoir about James Joyce’s daughter, Dotter of her Father’s Eyes, by husband and wife team Mary and Bryan Talbot, and children’s book Maggot Moon by dyslexic writer Sally Gardner.

Families should help to feed and wash patients according to a new report to be presented to Jeremy Hunt . Families should take on the role of nurses by helping to feed and wash patients to ease pressure on busy hospital staff, a new report has said. As well as basic nursing duties, relatives should also be on hand to help patients to the toilet, it was claimed. The report, created by think-tank 2020health, says such duties should be mandatory in the same way as jury service. 'Too Posh to Wash', which will be sent to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, claims that nurses are finding it impossible to meet all patients needs as the number of elderly people with complex  conditions, such as dementia, rises. Julia Manning, founder of 2020health, said the rules should be laid out in the NHS Constitution, making it compulsory for relatives and friends of patients to help unless they have a reason they are unable to - in much the same way as jury service. She said that many stories of substandard care stem from patients not having help with basic needs such as assisting to the toilet, feeding and drinking. She said: 'If you have 20 patients all being served lunch as the same time and 15 need help with eating, it is an impossible task.' She added: 'There is an opportunity here for the government, society and the NHS. 'The financial reality is that we simply can’t afford to employ ever more NHS staff to meet the needs . of older people in hospital, who make up two thirds of inpatients with 30 per cent of them having dementia. 'The NHS of today has completely different demands upon it compared to sixty years ago, and we have to adapt to this. 'The cultural reality is that we need to encourage caring –as a common good and as a responsibility.' It comes after figures reveal that in 2011 43 patients starved to death in hospital and a further 287 died malnourished. Office for National Statistics also show 558 cases where patients died severely dehydrated. The report has been welcomed by the Royal College of General Practitioners. Chairwoman Clare Gerada said it should be 'mandatory that relatives and friends help where possible'. Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nurses agreed the family should be at the heart of care planning. But patients' groups do not agree. Katherine Murphy of the Patients' Association said: 'The first duty of the NHS is to provide safe care to patients and not to depend on relatives who may be frail or elderly or unable to visit as regularly because they have to work.' As well as basic nursing duties, relatives should also be on hand to help patients to the toilet. The report, created by think-tank 2020health, says such duties should be mandatory in the same way as jury service . The report calls for a proper training and accreditation system for healthcare assistants, following the Winterbourne View Care Home scandal in Bristol, in which care home staff were filmed abusing adults with learning difficulties . It said it is possible to apply for a job in a care home with no experience and added that the bulk of care given outside acute hospitals is to the elderly and frail who 'deserve as much right to protection as the young.' A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Having the support of a loved one or family member can be of great help and comfort to patients. We recognise that, where appropriate, allowing them to assist with basic care can be beneficial. 'However this can be no substitute for proper nursing care. There are sufficient nurses across the NHS and we expect managers to ensure that staffing levels are sufficient to deliver an excellent standard of care at all times. 'We are keeping the situation under review, but we currently believe health support workers can be effectively supervised by professionally qualified staff, and by experienced nurses. We expect care providers and employers to ensure proper performance management processes are in place, and that every effort is made to deliver safe, high quality care.'","Relatives should help feed and wash patients to ease pressure on hospital staff .

'Deal,' said Tancredo, with the pair shaking on it.

A newly-restored classic World War II Spitfire has taken to the British skies for the first time since being found in a scrapyard a decade ago. The iconic Second World War fighter plane has been restored by a businessman who spent £1m building it back up to its former glory after it was rescued from a South African scrapyard. Yesterday the gleaming Spitfire took off from the soon-to-close Filton aerodrome outside Bristol for the first time since the 1940s. Restored classic: The rebuilt Spitfire took to the skies above Bristol yesterday after a painstaking £1m renovation . Flying through British skies for the first time since the 1940s: The restored Spitfire over Bristol . Taking off: The gleaming aircraft attracted large crowds to Filton airfield near Bristol yesterday . Filton has been synonymous with aviation development since before World War One when the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company set up a flying ground there in 1911. The firm developed the iconic Bristol Fighter and the airfield was used by the Royal Flying Corps during the war. Between the wars, the firm became Bristol Aeroplane Company and built aero engines, while Hurricane fighters were based at Filton. During World War Two, BAC expanded massively, producing the Bristol Blenheim and Beaufighter, two medium-range twin-engine bombers. Spitfires were also based at the grass airfield for a time following heavy bombing of Bristol. After the war, Bristol continued to develop planes, by now branching out into commercial aviation and extending the concrete runway to cater for larger airliners. Filton's crowning glory was arguably its role in the development of Concorde, in the 1960s and 1970s, by now under control of the British Aircraft Corporation. Pictured above is the famous supersonic passenger jet visiting the airfield for the last time in 2003. In 1977 BAE acquired the airfield and it was recently used to produce the Bae 146 small airliner. The occasion was a poignant one as Filton aerodrome, is to be decommissioned by BAE after more than a century of aviation there, and will close on December 31. BAE Systems, which said the site was no longer economically viable, is selling the airfield for housing and business development. Crowds of aviation and history enthusiasts lined the A38 road which borders the airfield to watch the Spitfire take off, while BAE staff watched from beside the runway. They were also there to see the last visit to the airfield from the Airbus A380 superjumbo, which was developed at Filton and is the world's largest commercial aircraft. Exeter businessman Martin Phillips, 51, who owns the Spitfire, said the expensive and painstaking restoration project had been worth it. He said: 'To see her take to the skies today has been extraordinary, and for it to happen at the same time as an A380's final visit to Filton, has made this a sad but historic day. 'I think it's a terrible shame that this famous old airfield is to close.' Former Rolls-Royce engineer John . Hart, who has worked as chief engineer on the Spitfire restoration for . the last two-and-a-half years, said seeing the Spitfire and the A380 . together on the runway that is also still overlooked by Concorde was . 'quite a sight' for aviation enthusiasts. He said: 'It's funny to think the last aeroplane to be put together here at Filton has turned out to be a Spitfire.' Filton . aerodrome, which has one of the longest and widest runways in the . country, witnessed the first test flights of Concorde and was where . American soldiers injured in D-Day were taken to before being treated at . Bristol's Frenchay hospital.

Devoted owner: Exeter businessman Martin Philips spent £1m restoring the Spitfire after it was found 10 years ago in a junkyard . Preparing for take-off: Aeroplane enthusiasts lined the runway to watch the WWII fighter plane take to the skies . Painstaking work: The Spitfire has a fully rebuilt Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . Race to finish: Engineers worked long hours to finish the Spitfire's restoration in time for it to fly from Filton yesterday . During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vulcan bombers were stationed there, and the last Concorde to fly, Concorde 216, is parked there. There are plans for an aviation museum on the site, hosting both Concorde and the Bristol Aero Collection of British-designed aeroplane memorabilia from the last century. The final flights from Filton will take off on Friday, before the aerodrome is decommissioned.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:50 EST, 28 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:48 EST, 29 January 2013 . The Boy Scouts of America is discussing ending a longstanding ban on gay members and allowing local organizations to decide their own policy, a spokesman revealed today. Lifting the ban would mark a dramatic reversal for the 103-year-old organization, which only last summer reaffirmed its policy amid heavy criticism from gay rights groups and some parents of scouts . Monday’s announcement comes after years of protests over the policy, including petition campaigns that have prompted come corporations to suspend donations to the Boy Scouts. Change: The Boy Scouts of America announced it is considering a dramatic retreat from its controversial policy of excluding gays as leaders and youth members . The BSA, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010, has long excluded both gays and atheists. Smith said a change in the policy toward atheists was not being considered, and that the BSA continued to view ""Duty to God"" as one of its basic principles. Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's right to exclude gays. Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies, and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy. More recently, amid petition campaigns, shipping giant UPS Inc. and drug-manufacturer Merck announced that they were halting donations from their charitable foundations to the Boy Scouts as long as the no-gays policy was in force. 'The BSA is discussing potentially removing the national membership restriction regarding sexual orientation,' spokesman Deron Smith said in an email to Reuters. Unfair? Jennifer Tyrrell, pictured last June, hugs her son Cruz Burns, 7; she was ousted this summer after they discovered she was a lesbian . 'The policy change under discussion would allow the religious, civic or educational organizations that oversee and deliver Scouting to determine how to address this issue,' the spokesman said. The organization, which had more than 2.6 million youth members and more than 1 million adult members at the end of 2012, 'would not, under any circumstances, dictate a position to units, members, or parents,' Smith said. The Boy Scouts won a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the organization to ban gays in 2000, but has come under increasing public pressure in recent years from activists. They include Zach Wahls, an Eagle Scout with two lesbian mothers, and Jennifer Tyrrell, a lesbian mother from Ohio who was ousted as a Scout den leader and treasurer. 'This is absolutely a step in the right direction,' said Wahls, who is founder of Scouts for Equality, a group that includes 3,151 other Eagle scouts. Wahls said he would turn to persuading local councils to enact nondiscrimination policies if the change is approved. Tyrrell said she looked forward to a day when she and her family might participate in scouting again. 'An end to this ban will restore dignity to countless families across the country, my own included, who simply wanted to take part in all Scouting has to offer,' Tyrrell said in a statement. Outrage: Jennifer Tyrrell, right, was ousted as a den mother because she is a lesbian . GLAAD, an anti-discrimination advocacy group, began to press for a reversal of the Boy Scouts policy after Tyrrell was removed from her son's den and more than 1 million people have signed petitions on Change.org seeking an end to the policy. More than 462,000 people signed a petition on Change.org calling for the Boy Scouts to grant an Eagle Scout application for Ryan Andresen, a California resident who is openly gay. Andresen's scoutmaster refused to sign the application because of his sexual orientation. A review board for the California chapter recommended he receive the rank, but its recommendation was never forwarded to national headquarters. The organization has faced pressure from board members - Ernst & Young chairman and chief executive Jim Turley and AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson have spoken out against the ban - and some corporations withdrew support over the policy . Patrick Boyle, whose 1994 book 'Scout's Honor' was among the first to examine sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts of America, said on Monday the 'striking reversal in policy' was likely the result of growing pressure from corporations. The Boy Scouts of America signage is seen on the Cushman Watt Scout Center, headquarters of the organization for the Los Angeles Area Council, in Los Angeles . This is a safe way out of this mess for the national organization, which takes the fight back to the local level, and says to a local leader, 'you make the choice that's right for you',' Boyle said. 'It's essentially the Boy Scouts' version of states' rights.' However, critics of the Scouts suggest that its recruitment efforts have been hampered by high-profile controversies - notably the court-ordered release of files dealing with sex abuse allegations and persistent protests over the no-gays policy. The BSA's overall ""traditional youth membership"" - Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers - totaled 2,658,794 in 2012, compared to more than 4 million in peak years of the past. There were 910,668 Boy Scouts last year, a tiny increase from 2011, while the ranks of Venturers - a program for youths 14 and older- declined by 5.5 percent. In addition to flak over the no-gays policy, the Scouts have been buffeted by multiple court cases related to past allegations of sexual abuse by Scout leaders, including those chronicled in long-confidential records that are widely known as the ""perversion files."" Through various cases, the Scouts have been forced to reveal files dating from the 1960s to 1991. They detailed numerous cases where abuse claims were made and Boy Scout officials never alerted authorities and sometimes actively sought to protect the accused. The Scouts are now under a California court order, affirmed this month by the state Supreme Court, to turn over sex-abuse files from 1991 through 2011 to the lawyers for a former Scout who claims a leader molested him in 2007, when he was 13. It's not clear how soon the files might become public. The BSA has apologized for past lapses and cover-ups, and has stressed the steps taken to improve youth protection policy. Since 2010, for example, it has mandated that any suspected abuse be reported to police.","Policy has been in effect since Boy Scouts was founded more than 100 years ago, and also excludes atheists .

Then someone went to Italy and discovered it was cheese. It was instantly rebranded Parmigiano, quadrupled in price and we had to grate it ourselves. Q is for  .  .  . Queuing (and Tutting): The Middle Class are good at both, but you can’t have a queue without a tut. You can, however, have a  tut without a queue. R is for  .  .  .

Shop owner Ian Donald was stunned when an officer turned up at his store in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and accused him of selling pornography next to buckets and spades. The cheeky postcards, featuring women on the beach displaying their bottoms or breasts, shocked Ashley Steinschauer, an assistant minister at the local church, but the complaint has left some bemused. Police called for postcards: Shop owner Ian Donald was stunned when an officer turned up at his gift shop after a complaint was made about 'saucy' postcards he sold . Mr Donald has owned his shop on Eastbourne Pier for 25 years and said the light-hearted postcards are popular with all ages and were just part of the ‘seaside tradition’. He said: ‘People would see worse than these postcards if they just walked along the beach. ‘They are not obscene they are just cheeky humour. ‘I couldn’t believe it, I was really shocked. ‘The police officer saw the funny side of it though when I showed him the postcards.’ But . Mr Steinschauer from Elim Family Church was not laughing when he made his complaint to the . local council, arguing that the postcards were 'damaging' the . town's image. 'Obscene': Ashley Steinschauer, an assistant minister at a local church, complained about some of the postcards Mr Donald sold (including this one) saying they damaged the town's image, 'making it look sleazy' See the funny side: Mr Donald said that the postcards are just 'cheeky humour' and that the police officer saw the funny side of it when he saw the postcards . He told a local paper: ‘I was shocked to see the postcard on sale right outside the shop. ‘It’s damaging the image of the town and making it look sleazy. ‘I think it shows a real shift in morality and it’s got to stop.’ ""My only concern was that postcards were being sold 'outside' the shop at an eye level of very young children. I also did not contact the police"" The complaint made to the council was passed on to Trading Standards who told police that obscene images were on sale on the pier. In response to the incident some took to micro-blogging site Twitter. One posted: ‘Charge the complainant with wasting police time.’ Very popular: Mr Donald has owned the gift shop on Eastbourne Pier for 25 years and says the postcards in question are popular 'with all ages'. He sells some 600 a year . On the website of local paper The Argus, readers also commented on the police visit. One wrote: 'Some people do really need to get a life and a sense of humour.' Another posted: ‘So the country is going down the toilet, Police are being murdered and there is a sense of general dissatisfaction but some person has taken the time to call the Police about a postcard at a seaside stall? Grief.’ Mr Donald, who sells other postcards including scenic shots, said: ‘I sell 600 of these every year and I’m not going to stop now. ‘We get loads of elderly people buying them, although they do tend to turn them face down when they come to the counter because they are a bit embarrassed.’ Neil Stanley, the council’s lead member for tourism, said: ‘Visitors to Eastbourne expect wholesome good fun and the saucy postcard is a vital part of our seaside heritage.’ A Sussex Police spokesman said they could not find any record of a complaint being made to them about ‘saucy postcards’.","Shop owner Ian Donald was visited by a policeman after a complaint was made about postcards he was selling .

The homeless man who had 80 per cent of his face chewed off in a horrific attack along a busy Miami highway is now 'awake and alert', according to doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center. A photograph shown to reporters today portrayed Ronald Poppo walking down a hospital hallway, supported by hospital staff on either side of him. The man had his left eye removed but doctors are hoping to restore vision in his right eye, which was also severely damaged in the attack. Recovery: Ronald Poppo, the Miami Cannibal victim, is pictured for the first time in hospital after the horrific May 26 attack which left most of his face eaten off . 'He's pleased to report to all of you . that he's feeling well, he's eating, he's walking around with physical . therapy, he's talking with us,' said Nicholas Namias, a University of . Miami trauma surgeon' A photo released by the hospital shows the upper two-thirds of Poppo's face covered in scabs. He's missing his nose and both eye sockets were covered, one with gauze and one with what appeared to be a skin graft. His grey beard was trimmed, leaving a moustache over his upper lip. Doctors at the hospital said the homeless man also has holes in his chest that may be from bullets fired by the police officer who killed his attacker. Nicholas Namias, head of trauma, and Popp's physician, told the Miami Herald that Poppo had two 'mysterious' punctures in his chest. In youth: Ronald Poppo as a student . Then: Ronald Poppo before the brutal attack . Now: Poppo is recovering in hospital . Doctors added that the victim lost his left eye but are trying to save his right eye, which was severely damaged. Poppo also suffered a brain injury during the attack, like that suffered by a car crash victim, the Herald reported. Despite these problems, the medical team said Poppo, who has been in the hospital since the attack on May 26, is doing much better. He has talked about swimming, which he used to enjoy, and he has asked for pizza, orange juice and Italian food. He's asked for the television to be switched off in his room, except when the Miami Heat basketball games are on, Namias said. The doctor said Poppo has not once complained about his pain. Attacker: Rudy Eugene, 31, the naked cannibal, pounced on Poppo as he slept on elevated train tracks in Miami and was shot dead by police officers . 'He's really just sort of living in the moment and just wants to talk about routine things,' he said. Mr Poppo will have to undergo a number of skin grafts to rebuild his face. Doctors have revealed that Ronald Poppo is doing 'well' but has sustained a number of injuries: . Social workers will try to help him find a place to live as he has been homeless for nearly 30 years. A fund set up by the Jackson Memorial . Foundation to assist Poppo has raised $15,000. Poppo also qualifies for . Medicaid and Medicare. 'If he doesn't get his vision back . then it becomes, is he concerned about how he looks or is it more about . how the world sees him? Those are things to think about,' plastic . surgeon Wrood Kassira said. 'I've talked to him about reconstruction and he's said we'll take it one day at a time. He's very logical.' Poppo has been at Jackson Memorial Hospital since he was attacked on May 26 by Rudy Eugene. Emergency callers reported seeing a . naked man swinging from a light pole on Miami's MacArthur Causeway a few . minutes before the attack. Surveillance video from a nearby building shows Eugene stripping Poppo and pummeling him before appearing to lie on top of him.

After arriving on the scene, officer Jose Rivera shouted at Eugene to stop but he simply got up and growled and continued eating at the man's face. Eugene was then shot and killed . by the Miami police officer. Initial tests revealed that Eugene had a number of undigested pills in his stomach, according to the Miami Herald. Marijuana was also in Eugene's system at the time of the attack. It is believed that Eugene may have . been on ‘bath salts’, a potent hallucinogenic drug, when he carried out . the gruesome assault.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:59 EST, 5 August 2011 . A portable blood test that can diagnose an infection within minutes has been hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against HIV and AIDS in the developing world. The size of a credit card, the mChip has proved almost 100 per cent accurate in testing for HIV in Rwanda. Hundreds of tests using a prototype were carried out in the town of Kigali and returned a 95 per cent accuracy for HIV and 76 per cent for syphilis. How it works: The mChip (right) has proved almost 100 per cent accurate in testing for HIV in Rwanda. It comes with a cheap detector (left) if clarification is needed . The plastic device, manufactured in the U.S. and developed by scientists at the University of Columbia in New York, costs just $1 (60p) to make. Lead researcher Professor Samuel Sia said: 'The idea is to make a large class of diagnostic tests accessible to patients in any setting in the world, rather than forcing them to go to a clinic to draw blood and then wait days for their results.' The mChip uses optics to read fluids by taking a single pin-prick of blood. Lead researcher Samuel Sia and his team set out to make a cheap, portable device . It contains ten detection zones which the blood passes through and then returns a positive or negative result for HIV/AIDS or syphilis in about 15 minutes. The result is presented in a simple colour-coded manner similar to a pregnancy test, making it extremely easy to use and understand. An alternative is to use a cheap detector box - the 'lab' - to check the results. The mChip's low cost and efficiency has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the fight against HIV in the developing world. Drugs to place HIV in remission have long been available but have been deemed too expensive to use on a widescale basis. The mChip, on the other hand, is extremely cheap, can fit in an aid worker's pocket and produces a result with a high degree of accuracy within 15 minutes. Researchers are now hoping to increase testing for sexually-transmitted diseases in pregnant women in Africa .",The mChip takes less than 15minutes to test with near 100% accuracy .

Fortunately no one was injured when the entire top section of the bus was taken off as it tried to go under a railway bridge near Porchester Railway Station, Hampshire. An identical incident happened in September when another double decker, worth up to £300,000 when bought new, crashed into the bridge.

Fortunately, the 45-year-old driver was the only one on board at the time and he was treated by paramedics for shock at the scene. The roof came crashing down onto the road when the bus collided with the bridge at 9.41am. Police closed Station Road, Portchester, after local fire crews were sent to the scene. The brick and metal bridge is clearly signed as being 3.6 metres high - a double decker bus measures four metres. Local resident Mrs Pat Tiller said: 'The top of the bus has gone and they have put a white cover over it. The trains have been stopped and traffic is diverted.

The two students, nevertheless, did reportedly complain to the school's cafeteria staff after seeing the blood-stained bagels - and it was later determined that a lunch lady had cut herself while slicing them. Ghastly find: Two northern New Jersey elementary school students learned the bagels they bought from their school's cafeteria were blood-stained earlier this month . Quick action: Food service officials at Central Avenue elementary school in Madison quickly fired the lunch lady responsible for the blood-covered breakfasts . Pomptonian Food Services, which provides cafeteria services to the Madison school district, later said the employee had used a knife to cut the bagels, rather than a bagel guillotine, according to NJ.com. Bad news: Mark Vidovich (pictured) heads the company that provides cafeteria services to the Madison school district . The employee, who was fired the same day as the bagel brouhaha after 14 years of service with Pomptonian, did not report the accident - but kept on cutting bagels. 'Pomptonian's dedication to safety and well being has always been our highest priority,' Kathy Penna, director of client services for Pomptonian Food Services, told NJ.com. 'We constantly train our workers and reinforce that training. This employee disregarded all of the training sessions that she had received.'

Vidovich reportedly said the employee voluntarily agreed to a blood test to calm parents' concerns. Vidovich told Patch he has seen the results, and there do not appear to be health concerns about which the district would need to notify parents, according to the report.","Two New Jersey children made the ghastly find Jan. 9 at Central Avenue elementary School in the Borough of Madison .

A new flag has been designed in Australia in a bid to 'move on' from the country's colonial past. Military historian Dr John Blaxland, of the Australian National University, came up with the idea because he says the current one does not embrace all aspects of Australian culture. Rather than just a straightforward nod to the country's British heritage, he says he wanted a flag that acknowledge Australia's Aboriginal communities as well as its growing multiculturalism. 'People can identify with various parts of it and see that Australia is actually a multicultural place with a rich history that reaches back for generations,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Multicultural: Dr Blaxland's flag contains 250 dots to represent the many Aboriginal dialects as well as the immigrant languages spoken on the streets of Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and other towns and cities across the nation . His flag contains 250 dots to the left to represent the many Aboriginal dialects as well as the immigrant languages spoken on the streets of Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and other towns and cities across the nation. There is also a red section in the shape of a boomerang, and a traditional representation in green and yellow of the Southern Cross constellation, made up of five stars – one small five-pointed star and four, larger, seven-pointed stars. How it looks now: The current Australian flag has a Union Flag in the top left corner and the Southern Cross constellation, made up of five stars - one small five-pointed star and four, larger, seven-pointed stars . But he says he did not want to completely disregard modern Australia's British roots and added a white stripe to 'echo' that on the Union Flag. 'We can move on, we can reflect on our history but also acknowledge in . the design... that we can't completely trash the British heritage,' he added. 'I . get the significance of the current flag, I get the significance of the . Union Jack. I also get that a lot of people don't like it. I think we . need to find a compromise, something that is going to be inclusive and . appeals to all Australians.' Australian author and former rugby union player Peter . FitzSimons backed . calls for a new flag, saying the current one 'is no longer a symbol . that unites us (but) it divides us'. 'Why on earth, in the 21st century, do we still have a flag that reserves . 25 per cent of its acreage proclaiming our allegiance, first and foremost, . to Great Britain!?' he wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald. 'You can't believe in multiculturalism and support a flag that asserts . the primacy of the Anglo race. We need a flag that reflects the equality of . our citizens, not vaunts one lot over other.' Anger: The new flag offering comes two days after a group of Aboriginal protesters set fire to the Australian flag outside the country's Parliament in Canberra as the rest of the nation celebrated Australia Day . The . new flag offering comes two days after a group of Aboriginal protesters . set fire to the Australian flag outside the country's Parliament in . Canberra as the rest of the nation celebrated Australia Day. A . video captured showed protesters outside Parliament setting light to . the flag and spitting on it while chanting, 'Always was, always will be . Aboriginal land.' A day . before that, riot police were called to form a human shield around . Prime Minister Julia Gillard and escort her out of a Canberra restaurant . after hundreds of angry protesters surrounded the building. Australia's national flag has remained a controversial issue ever since its invention in 1901. Australia's 460,000 Aborigines make up two per cent of the 21 million population, most living in remote communities or towns. Contentious: The Australian and Aboriginal flags are held by dancing Aborigines in traditional decorations from the urabalan area in the Great Sandy Desert . But for around 50,000 years, prior to . the arrival of British Settlers in 1788, the country was occupied . exclusively by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Both tribes have their own flags. Protests: On Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan reignited the debate around whether Australia should become a republic, saying the 80-year-old Bodyline cricket scandal had shown that the British could be ruthless, self-serving and mean-spirited . The aboriginal flag is red and black with a yellow sun at its centre while the Torres Strait Islander's flag is green, blue and black with a white star at its centre surrounded by a white dhari (dancer's headdress). Both were finally recognised by the Australian government in 1995 when it granted them Flag of Australia status, under the Flags Act 1953. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan reignited the debate around whether Australia should become a republic, saying the 80-year-old Bodyline cricket scandal had shown that the British could be 'ruthless' and self serving. He said the English cricket team's 'life-threatening' bowling tactics during the 1932 Bodyline series 'woke Australians up' to renounce Britain's self-serving 'gentlemanly values'. 'What the Bodyline series showed.' he wrote in a newspaper piece to coincide with Australia Day, 'was that while we refuse to put on airs . and graces, Aussies are not a ruthless, 'whatever it takes' people,' he . wrote. The push for Australia to become a republic has fallen out of the spotlight since the loss of a referendum on the issue in 1999. However some polls show a possible resurgence in the idea. A 2010 Morgan Poll that asked: 'Do you think Australia should have a new design for our National Flag?' was supported by 29 per cent of respondents and opposed by 66 percent, with 5 per cent uncommitted.","Designed by Dr John Blaxland of the Australian National University .

'I looked out my window and saw a lady standing there,' said party guest Ricky Gugliotta.

'She was begging him not to shoot her, but then he shot her twice and she went down.' Both were pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services, according to the New York Daily News. Kernizan fled the scene in a blue or green sedan, sources said. Motel guest Augustine Mawugbe, 45, said he was asleep in his room when he heard gunshots. He said he looked outside and saw a tall man in a brown polo shirt firing a pistol. He said . the man fired about ten times, and then got into a light green Toyota Camry . or Ford Taurus and drove away at speed. Bennett had been dating Hamilton for five years, friends said, but had struggled to leave Kernizan, the father of two of her three children, a 12-year-old girl and seven-year-old boy. Her oldest child, daughter Dajahnae, 18, rushed home from the University of Baltimore after learning her mother was dead. 'He was so obsessed with her,' said her friend Bella. The 38-year-old even took out an order of protection against Kernizan, making him even more enraged, said others. Crime scene: The cold-blooded murders took place in the parking lot of Holiday Motel in The Bronx . Her neighbours said they often heard her and Kernizan, nicknamed 'Country', . screaming at each other and police were regularly called to their tidy . two-storey home. 'We always heard them fighting,' said Carolina Manzano. Neighbors described Bennett as a sweet woman who was seen . leaving her house every morning for her job as a nurse at Winthrop University Hospital, while Kernizan stayed out late and often returned in flashy cars. Tenants at a house he owned in Brooklyn said he also owned a nearby barbershop, opened a club and owned four different cars. Hamilton's . friends said he was . originally from Jamaica but was now living in Milwaukee with his wife Mavis, who knew nothing about his affair with Bennett. ‘I saw him last night at Memories playing dominoes,’ said Oneil Taylor, referring to a Bronx nightclub. Another . friend, an shuttle driver, said he had picked up Hamilton - best known for his 1996 hit Go Go Wine - on Friday from . the airport and brought him to the Fenton Avenue club. His wife, who had dropped him off at the airport on Friday for his trip to New York, left worried messages for him when she did not hear from anything. The 48-year-old said: 'Now that he’s dead, what can I do? The memories that I’ll keep is the man that I know that loved me. 'He was the funniest, kindest, most loving person you would ever meet.' Other guests reported seeing the couple several hours . before the murders with their arms around one another. One patron said they saw Bennett holding a bottle of champagne in a celebratory manner.

Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold is being sued for libel after suggesting that the company’s founder had an ‘adulterous relationship’ with Princess Margaret. Michael Caborn-Waterfield, a former boyfriend of 1950s film star Diana Dors, sets the value of his claim ‘in excess of £500,000’. The 83-year-old, who is said to have founded the Ann Summers chain in 1970 ‘for a laugh’ before it was bought out by Miss Gold’s family in 1972, is suing over statements made in her autobiography, Please Let it Stop. Miss Gold, daughter of controversial businessman David  Gold, is said to be Britain’s 16th richest woman, worth an estimated £180million. Mr Caborn-Waterfield said the 52-year-old’s book had alleged he ‘had an adulterous relationship with Princess Margaret’ and ‘was in the habit of illegally landing his helicopter in Hyde Park’. In a writ lodged at London’s High Court, Mr Caborn-Waterfield also complains that other statements made in the book ‘meant and were understood to mean’ that he ‘was a dissolute and profligate dilettante’. The businessman, who lives in Fulham, South West London, goes on to say he was made out to be  ‘habitually irresponsible and incompetent in the conduct of his business and private affairs’ and ‘did not honour his personal debts’. The writ adds: ‘Mr Caborn-Waterfield has been and is being gravely injured in his personal credit and reputation, has  suffered and is suffering acute distress and anxiety, and has been and is being brought into public scandal, odium and contempt.’ As well as damages, Mr Caborn-Waterfield is seeking an injunction restraining further publication of the book. His relationship with Miss Dors began while she was filming Diamond City in 1949, and he is director of a business called Dors Productions. She died from ovarian cancer in 1984, aged 52. Mr Caborn-Waterfield is also suing the publishers, Random House Group Ltd, and author Wendy Holden, who ghost-wrote another book about Miss Gold’s life, Good Vibrations.

David Haye has laid the blame for the ugly brawl with Dereck Chisora in Munich last weekend squarely at his opponent's feet and said he'll talk to police to resolve the inquiry. In a statement issued today from his hiding place somewhere in the UK, Haye claimed Chisora 'caused' the fight and 'some members of his entourage also encouraged the ruckus'. He also said his departure from Germany with his trainer on a late-night flight before he could be arrested was an attempt to defuse the tension brewing between the two heavyweight fighters.

Clash: Dereck Chisora exchanges blows with David Haye during the post fight press conference . Raging bull: His face a mask of hatred, Haye squares up to his rival . Enemies: Chisora and David Haye get up close and personal during the brawl . In the remarkable statement, . reminiscent of the explanation for a schoolyard scrap, Haye said: . 'Chisora climbed down from the top table, removed his robe and then . walked towards me, entourage in tow, in an aggressive manner. 'I held my ground, but, unfortunately, . he caused a serious disturbance to occur, something which threatened to . damage the reputation of the sport we both love. 'Regrettably, some members of his . entourage also encouraged the chaos. Nevertheless, Chisora and I soon . separated, brushed ourselves down and moved in opposite directions. 'The confrontation then reignited, . however, and both Don Charles and Adam Booth became involved in the . mess. Adam suffered a cut to the head. 'Thankfully, it didn't take long for . the ruckus to again settle down. It was then that I heard Chisora say he . planned to ""shoot me dead"".' Laying the blame: Haye arrives at his home in Beckenham, Kent, tonight . The pair came to blows following . Chisora's points defeat in a world title fight against Ukrainian Vitali . Klitschko in Munich on Saturday night. Cameras captured the moment Haye . lashed out with a fierce right hook while holding a bottle which . appeared to catch Chisora on the jaw. Chisora, who threatened Haye by saying . he would 'track him down and shoot him', was arrested and released . without charge but German police could not find Haye to question him. Injury: Adam Booth, trainer of David Haye, bleeds from a nasty gash on his forehead. He claimed to have been 'glassed' during the brawl . It subsequently emerged that, after . the fracas, Haye and his trainer, Adam Booth, rushed to their five-star . hotel in Munich, packed their bags and set off for the airport before . 4.30am. Haye returned briefly to his home and then left for a secret location, believed to be a country club. According to Haye's statement, he and Booth's departure from the hotel was part of his efforts to 'diffuse (sic) the situation.' He said: 'Chisora's team were staying . at the same hotel as me and, in light of the threats Chisora had made in . front of the world's media, it seemed far more appropriate for me and . Adam to leave the hotel as quickly as possible.' Haye added that he was prepared to help boxing authorities with any investigation into the incident. The scenes were described as 'ugly, . horrible and disgraceful' and 'an embarrassment for British boxing' by . Frank Warren, who represents 28-year-old Chisora. But there were inevitable suspicions . that the whole incident was a publicity stunt to whip up interest in a . lucrative fight between the two Britons. It happened on Saturday night, . after Chisora lost on points to Ukrainian Vitali Klitschko. Haye, who had been commentating on the . bout for a boxing cable channel, became involved in a slanging match . with Zimbabwean-born Chisora as they poured scorn on each other's . record. After Haye apparently hit Chisora . while holding the bottle, catching him on the chin, Chisora shouted: 'He . glassed me!' The two men then grappled and their entourages became . involved in the melee. Haye was seen trading punches with . Chisora's trainer Don Charles before swinging a camera tripod over his . head. Adam Booth, Haye's trainer-manager, suffered a cut forehead and . also claimed to have been 'glassed'. Chisora reappeared clutching a . bottle but was wrestled under control. Tension: David Haye shouts at the direction of Dereck Chisora shortly before the brawl started . Weary: Chisora can be seen after the press conference brawl with blood on his T-shirt . Chisora and Charles were yesterday . arrested at Munich Airport on suspicion of grievous bodily harm as they . attempted to fly back to London, but were freed without charge. Haye had left his hotel in Munich by . 4.30am, minutes before police arrived to question him. He returned . briefly to his Beckenham, Kent, home before leaving for a secret location. A . spokesman for Munich police said: 'Given the events of Saturday evening, . a criminal investigation is required.' Officers will present a file to prosecutors today recommending Haye be charged with affray, assault and threatening behaviour. If prosecuted he could face a jail . sentence or a hefty fine, as financial penalties in Germany are levied . according to income. When former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher was . involved in a punch-up at a Munich hotel in 2002, he was fined a total . of £170,000. Chisora has already been ordered to . pay £31,500 to a charity for slapping Klitschko at the weigh-in, and . spitting water at his brother Wladimir moments before the fight. Claims of the post-bout brawl being a . publicity stunt were fuelled by a comment from Frank Warren when Haye . began to goad Chisora at the press conference. Warren was heard to say: 'I've got a . great idea. If Dereck fights David, the winner fights Vitali.' Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente responded: 'Sounds like the perfect . plan.' Asked yesterday if the clash was a . set-up, Warren said: 'If you think somebody wants to wind up getting hit . with a bottle and wind up in a police station while the other guy can't . be found... you've just got to be a complete moron to come up with a . suggestion like that.' Where it should have stayed: Vitali Klitschko had earlier beaten Dereck Chisora on points . Spit storm: Chisora was caught on camera blasting Wladimir with water before the fight . Temperatures rising: Chisora continued to goad his opponent, even after the defeat . 'It wasn't me': David Haye pictured in training last summer ahead of his fight against Wladimir Klitschko . It is with regret that I feel I have to issue this statement to clarify certain matters, following an unfortunate incident that occurred on Saturday night (February 18) in Munich, Germany at the Vitali Klitschko vs. Dereck Chisora post-fight press conference. I was in Munich to watch the WBC world heavyweight title bout between Klitschko and Chisora and provide punditry for BoxNation, and accredited as such. During the post-fight press conference, I was stood at the back of the room. It wasn't until Bernd Bonte said my name and involved me in the press conference that I commented. I was then happy to banter back and forth with Bonte and Klitschko, keen to ascertain whether he (Vitali) would stay true to his word and reiterate his desire to do what his younger brother couldn't do - knock me out. I felt as though the public would want to hear more information about this potential bout and that we could both start beating the drum ahead of a showdown later this year. However, at this point Chisora began firing insults at me from his position on the top table. In fact, he has recently made a habit of saying derogatory things about me in the press. Moments before declaring he wanted to go face-to-face with me, Chisora assured the gathered media that he would give me 'two slaps'. Chisora had, of course, already been shrouded in controversy that weekend. Despite this, Chisora climbed down from the top table, removed his robe and then walked towards me, entourage in tow, in an aggressive manner. I held my ground, but, unfortunately, he caused a serious disturbance to occur, something which threatened to damage the reputation of the sport we both love. Regrettably, some members of his entourage also encouraged the chaos. Nevertheless, Chisora and I soon separated, brushed ourselves down and moved in opposite directions. The confrontation then reignited, however, and both Don Charles and Adam Booth became involved in the mess. Adam suffered a cut to the head. Thankfully, it didn't take long for the ruckus to again settle down. It was then that I heard Chisora say he planned to 'shoot me dead'. I decided to leave the venue and return to my hotel, a move which I hoped would diffuse the situation. However, Chisora's team were staying at the same hotel as me and, in light of the threats Chisora had made in front of the world's media, it seemed far more appropriate for me and Adam to leave the hotel as quickly as possible. Consequently, I left Munich on an earlier flight on Sunday morning and have been thinking about what happened ever since, as well as replaying the incident many times via YouTube. It goes without saying, I am bitterly disappointed to have been a part of what transpired on Saturday evening. I realise I am no angel - and don't mind a bit of professional trash-talk to help raise boxing's profile - but, during my 21 years in the sport, I have never been involved in, or even witnessed, such a serious fracas. If requested, I shall happily assist the boxing authorities with any investigation they wish to launch and, ultimately, hope that all lessons learned from this incident will be implemented.","Haye and trainer Adam Booth caught 4.30am flight to London .

Officers arrested him there on Saturday, according to NBC station WCNC in Charlotte. One of the victims, a 17-year-old girl who was not named, told the station that she had met Percival four or five times to discuss joining the Marine Corps. She said she had gone to his apartment for a party in September and that she also stayed overnight at his place last Saturday, while his family was there, since she and other recruits were unable to get a ride home. She said that early Sunday morning Percival forced her to have oral sex with him and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. ‘He said, “If you don't let me, I'm going to rape you,”’ she told WCNC. ‘And I said, “No you're not, just go away, just stop.”’ She said that Percival approached her again later that morning and asked for sex. Another recruit, a friend of the first alleged victim, said that Percival had asked her to show him her breasts and give him oral sex when she visited the recruiting office he worked at.

New stress: Middle age used to be a time to enjoy leisurely pursuits, but a study has found that an increase find themselves caring for two generations of family members instead . Middle age used to be a time to throw off the shackles of parenthood and hit the golf course or go on that dream holiday you could never afford because of the commitment of having children. But that longed-for time to yourself has been replaced by a new set of worries according to a new study. Gone is the 'empty nest' of past generations, the homes of the middle-aged are still full to the rafters with grown-up children who can't afford to move out and can't get a job. But it's not just the children of the so-called 'boomerang generation' that are proving a burden to the middle aged. An increasing number are also taking in their elderly parents to provide care for them. A study, carried out by researchers at the Oregon State University in the US, blames the recession for making it harder for young people to start their career and family and flee the nest. And it says that living longer adds unanticipated needs to care for elderly parents. While putting 'empty nest' plans on hold is not a problem for most when it comes to helping their offspring, it can be a little more frustrating when  according to the study. Karen Hooker, director of the OSU Center for Healthy Aging Research said: 'We mostly found very positive feelings about adults helping their children in the emerging adulthood stage of life, from around ages 18 to 30. 'Feelings about helping parents weren’t so much negative as just filled with more angst and uncertainty. 'As a society we still don’t socialize people to expect to be taking on a parent-caring role, even though most of us will at some point in our lives. 'The average middle-aged couple has more parents than children.' The study focused on six sample groups in 2009-10 and the results have recently been published in the Journal of Aging Studies. Care: The Oregon State University study found that middle-aged people had mixed feelings about having to care for elderly parents . It concluded that most middle-aged parents with young adult children are fairly happy to help them out, and they understand that getting started in life is simply more difficult now. Some research has suggested that age 25 is the new 22; that substantially more parents now don’t even expect their kids to be financially independent in their early 20s, and don’t mind helping them through some difficult times. But the response to helping adult parents who, at the same time, need increasing amounts of assistance is not as uniformly positive, the study found – it can be seen as both a joy and a burden, and in any case was not something most middle-aged adults anticipated. Many middle-aged people said it was difficult to make any plans, due to anxiety and uncertainty about a parent’s health at any point in time. They are being forced to re-evaluate their own lives say the researchers. Most said they we’re willing to help their aging parents, but a sense of being time-starved was a frequent theme. Tough: Many middle-aged people surveyed said that they found it difficult to make plans and were re-evaluating their lives because of caring for elderly parents and supporting grown-up children . One participant in the study said: 'It brings my heart joy to be able to provide for my mom this way. 'There are times when it’s a burden and I feel resentful.' The university research appears to be backed up by UK statistics. Office for National Statistics figures released in 2012 said that nearly a quarter of 20 to 34-year-olds were still living with their parents in 2011. That total had shot up around 20 per cent since 1997. Nearly two million men and more than a million women were still living at home. But previous studies have suggested that instead of fearing the 'empty nest' many parents are now dreading having to work until the age of 80 to afford to look after elderly parents as well as children who can't, or won't, leave the family home. A report from insurance firm LV said that some 900,000 people in the UK expect to work well into the 70s or 80s before they can afford to retire.","A study by Oregon State University found that middle-aged parents are facing new stress .

A mother whose daughter mysteriously vanished 30 years ago has revealed that she has kept her home's porch light on every night since in case the woman returns. Darlene Webb was 20 years old when she failed to return to the family home in Ormond Beach, Florida after an evening out with friends at a local bar in 1983. Now, as her family marks three decades since that night, her mother Frances Webb, 74, has revealed she has never given up hope that Darlene is alive and well, and will someday return. 'The front porch light still burns, and it's on every night because the last child is not home,' she told the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Missing: Darlene Webb was 20 when she failed to come home after a night out with friends in 1983 . 'If she's passed on, then I'll close . the book on it, but until then I'm not closing the book. Mother's gut instincts? She's alive somewhere, and I know she is. I just gotta find her.' Darlene, who would now be 50, was a student at Daytona Beach Community College and was working at a Chick-fil-A restaurant in the Volusia Mall at the time of her disappearance. On January 22, 1983, she went out with friends but told her mother she would not be having a late night as she was opening the restaurant the next morning. But the next day, Frances received a call from the manager to say the Chick-fil-A had not opened on time, and asked where her daughter was. Fighter: Her mother, Frances Webb, says she believes Darlene is still alive and lost her memory . The concerned mother raced to where Darlene's friends said she had parked her car, and there she found her daughter's coat, purse, money and glasses, but no sign of her daughter or her car keys. The front passenger-side window was also . halfway down, the front passenger seat was leaning back and the ashtray . was full of cigarette butts - even though Darlene did not smoke. There were no signs of any struggle at the scene. Friends said that after leaving the bar at 1.30 a.m., they had parted ways and left Darlene, whom they called Dee Dee, to walk to her car alone. '(Police) think, which I agree with, . whoever took her probably, maybe drugged her enough that she lost her . memory and she doesn't know who she is,' Frances Webb told the News-Journal. Detectives turned up only a few leads - . but they never amounted to anything. Her Social Security number and . birth certificate have not been used since 1983, and the case remains . unsolved. Search: A drawing, left, shows how Darlene might look. She is pictured right before her disappearance . One tip came from a woman who worked at a beer garden close to where Darlene had parked. She told Frances that she heard screams and saw a car driving away with its lights off. Police admit that the case was complicated by the fact Darlene was an adult, and could have chosen to leave. The family said they often wonder what the outcome of the investigation would have been if Darlene had vanished today, rather than 30 years ago. 'What bothers me the most is the amount . of things that have changed over 30 years,' Darlene's older sister Karen Webb, 51, said. 'Back then, . police wouldn't even take a report for 72 hours because at that point, . you were an adult, you had a right to disappear. Nowadays, if somebody . disappears, you see it on TV immediately.' Waiting: Frances Webb leaves the porch light on every night outside her Ormond Beach home, pictured . They also believe social media could have played a part in tracking her down, and regularly scour Facebook for any users resembling Darlene. They also regularly update a page they have made for Darlene and their ongoing search to find her. But they still employ traditional tactics too, putting up posters across the country. 'We still put up pictures and stuff . and hope that maybe someday either she or somebody who has seen her will . go ""oh wait a minute, isn't that you?""' Karen said. Whatever their method, the family has no plans to give up their search. 'As far as I'm concerned she's not gone,' Frances said.","Darlene Webb vanished after night out with friends in 1983 .

Seattle police are working with Army officials to find out the origin of a missile launcher that turned up at a gun buyback event and determine whether it was legal or possibly stolen from the military. A man standing outside the event on Saturday, identified by Reuters as Mason Vranish, bought the military weapon for $100 from another person there, according to Detective Mark Jamieson. The single-use device is a launch tube assembly for a Stinger portable surface-to-air missile and already had been used. One of these things is not like the others: A missile launcher was among the items handed in at a gun buyback event in Seattle on Saturday . Heavy artillery: The missile launcher was bought by a man standing outside the buyback event . Closer look: Seattle Police Department Sgt Paul Gracy seizes a missile launcher from a man who had purchased the weapon outside the event . As a controlled military item, it is not available to civilians through any surplus or disposal program offered by the government, according to Jamieson. Seattle police have contacted Army officials at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma to deputy chief Nick Metz said Monday. 'Once it's brought on base and investigators have a chance to look at it, they'll see what they can determine,' Army spokesman Joe Kubistek said on Monday. 'It's too early to give any information on it until we have hands-on access to see it and take a look at it.' Police witnessed the private exchange of the military launch tube near the gun buyback event, where gun buyers tempted those standing in long lines to turn in their weapons with cash. 'It was absolutely crazy what we saw out there,' Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn said at a news conference on Monday where officials announced they had collected a total of 716 weapons, including four that were confirmed as stolen. Weapon of war: Police say they will determine if the weapon can be legally owned by the public . Transaction: Mason Vranish pays $100 cash for a used missile launcher outside a Seattle Police Department gun buyback program . Officers saw guns changing private hands without knowing whether the person buying the gun had the legal right to buy it, and those transactions are occurring all the time, McGinn said. He added that the private sales of the missile launch tube and other weapons illustrate the need for comprehensive background checks as proposed by President Obama, as well as other regulations at the state level. While there were private gun buyers at the periphery of Saturday's event, Metz said a large majority of people chose to wait in line and get less money because they wanted to make sure they got the weapons off the streets. 'These are very dangerous weapons,' Metz said. 'They may not have looked very pretty, but (they're) definitely operable.' Investigation: Seattle police officers inspect the missile launcher that was seized from Mr Vranish on Saturday . One man's trash: A Seattle police officer carries a garbage can filled with guns during the gun buyback event . The firearms collected included 348 pistols, 364 rifles and three so-called street sweepers, or shotguns that include a high capacity magazine capable of holding twelve 12-gauge shotgun shells. The program allowed people to anonymously turn in their weapons for a shopping gift card worth up to $200 - $100 for each handgun, rifle or shotgun turned in, and $200 for each gun classified as an assault weapon under state law. Officials distributed about $70,000 in gift cards at Saturday's event. McGinn said he wanted to plan another buyback event soon and urged more donations to the program. Meanwhile, police said people who wanted to turn in guns could do so at any time outside a buyback program, though they wouldn't be compensated for it.

Vets in Zimbabwe braved crocodile-infested waters to give medicine to a two-tonne hippo, one of the most fearsome animals in the world. The pictures show the extraordinary lengths the medics will go to ensure the welfare of the powerful and dangerous mammals. Dr Michael Kock, 60, oversaw the risky operation, where experts were trying out a new dosage of drugs on the beast. Risky business: A dangerous lesson in how to safely give medicine to a two-tonne hungry hippo has been captured on camera by a vet . Deadly: Hippos kill more people than any other animal in Africa . While veterinary students looked on and took notes, a team of 12 people set about bringing the thrashing animal under control. The hulking hippo was first shot with a sedation dart, allowing the vets and gamekeepers to pull the blindfolded beast by rope towards the riverbank to carry out the procedure. The exercise was held to teach pupils how to safely give medicine to sick animals without putting themselves or the creatures in harm's way. The vets used a new mixture of drugs to make the beast docile enough for people to get up close, but not so sleepy that the hippo would drown, a common problem in the past. They showed the students how to top-up the drug combination - to avoid the hippo regaining its senses and attacking the group - how to . administer antibiotics and the method for injecting reversal drugs into the muscles . under the hippo's tongue to wake it up. Air support: First the vets shoot the Hippo with a tranquiliser from a helicopter . A brave vet then carefully blindfolds the sedated animal . Caution: The blindfolded beast is roped ready to be led to the shore . Dr Kock, a senior lecturer at the . faculty of veterinary science at the University of Pretoria, in South . Africa, said: 'Hippos can be extremely dangerous and their teeth are . lethal. 'During the night they leave the water and travel up to 20 miles to feed. 'People and communities who live by . the riverbanks and who go to the water to wash and bathe can often bump . into them as the hippos return in the morning. The team carefully guides the hippo to the riverbank for treatment . 'Hippos can be very aggressive and they are capable of chomping a person in half.' Hippos are among the most dangerous animals in the world and are responsible for more deaths in Africa than any other species. 'On this occasion we had to be very careful. Although the hippo was sedated it was still awake and could give you a nasty bite,' Dr Kock added. 'There were also other hippos in the water and a few crocodiles about in there so we had to exercise extreme caution. Treatment: The antibiotics are injected into the hippo . Wake up call: Reversal medicine is injected into the animal's gums . 'You can see from the pictures it is still awake and watching us. 'We had to approach it from behind and put straps around its jaw. Once this had been done we had a bit more freedom to move around. 'By doing this it should help us treat the hippos without putting their lives in danger and it can help us to lead hippos away from situations where they come into close contact with humans. 'This new combination of drugs is fantastic because it means we can safely treat the hippos without harming them and causing them to drown.'

One of Britain's biggest frozen food makers has been partly blamed for a massive new landslip which has brought homes within feet of crumbling cliffs. The coastal community of Knipe Point - 500ft above sea level - has been besieged by landslides since 2008, when the first wave led to three homes having to be bulldozed before they fell down the cliffs into woodland below. But new papers have revealed the latest slip at the North Yorkshire sea town has been partially blamed on McCain's, the frozen food manufacturer, thanks to leaks from a burst pipe seeping 'oil and grease' into the land. The scene at Knipe Point near Scarborough where further landslides on the cliff overlooking Cayton Bay have led to fears more houses could be condemned. New papers seem to suggest food manufacturer McCain's could be partially responsible . The coastal community has been besieged by landslides since 2008, when the first wave led to three homes having to be bulldozed before they fell down the cliff . On Monday, residents woke to find that hundreds of tons of earth had again crashed down from the settlement overlooking Cayton Bay, North Yorkshire, into Cayton Woods. A strip of land measuring six foot by 40ft long disappeared, bringing artist Kane Cunningham’s home within four foot of the cliff edge. The decking of his neighbour’s home – which was already abandoned and being cleared out by a removal company yesterday – is almost overhanging the cliff edge, above a 70ft drop into the woods. Mr Cunningham said: 'This is an environmental disaster. On Monday there was a massive landslip at the rear of my home which has now been condemned by Scarborough Council. 'I have been given three weeks to knock my house down or the council will do it. But what really hurts is this is not a natural disaster – it’s a man made one.' Just weeks before the latest slip, the residents had obtained a consultant’s report linking the instability of the cliff to leaks from a Yorkshire Water pipe used to discharge effluent from the McCain’s oven chip and frozen food factory two miles away on the outskirts of Scarborough. McCain Foods have a potato chip manufacturing plant at Havers Hill, Scarborough, and excess water based effluent is discharge from the plant via an underground pipeline that runs away from the site parallel with the coastline and eventually discharges the water into the sea. The southern section of the pipeline is operated by McCain however the pipeline becomes part of the Yorkshire Water network to the north of the site. Artist Kane Cunningham outside the house he bought to use as a studio. He has been told the property is now dangerous and has three weeks to have the property demolished . Ashton Bennett who are engineering geologists and environmental scientists have completed a study over the last year. Laboratory testing showed the McCain discharge contained a variety effluent including metals, calcium, chloride, iron, potassium, sodium, ammonia, nitrate, sulphate, fluoride, phosphate, oil and grease, according to the report. It states: 'The test results suggests that the water issuing from the cliff face is sourced (or mainly sourced) from leaks in the McCain / YW pipeline that transports effluent from the McCain Plant to the sea. 'The elevated levels of several compounds in the McCain outflow and the water issues are consistent with effluent from a plant with potato waste which would be expected to contain high levels of calcium and potassium, magnesium and natural phenols in addition to sodium and starch. 'The test results of the water issues and the effluent from McCain’s factory within YW pipes indicates that leakage of effluent within YW pipes is the most likely source of the water issues. Just weeks before the linked the instability of the cliff to leaks from a McCain's effluent pipe . 'This is confirmed by the lack of water issues since the relaying of YW pipework north of Knipe Point. 'The slips that have occurred are considered to be due to water leaks finding flows through the sand of the Skipsea Till and emerging at specific points on the south and east points of Knipe Point. 'The stability of the sand is reduced due to the pore water pressure created by the water which locally reduces the angle of repose causing a slip.' Mr Cunningham, 51, an artist acquired the property for £3,000 when it was written off as an insurance loss three years ago. The previous owner had paid £120,000 for it before the first landslips five years ago. He added: 'There seems to have been a conspiracy of silence from two massive corporations and that when the house finally goes over the cliff, its screams will be heard across the world. 'McCains is a world famous brand with a strong ethical and environmental policy on protecting the environment. 'I . feel they have many questions to answer and indeed should act fast and . responsibly, to meet the residents and to help resolve the crisis. 'My house is now at the centre of drama, It is likely to go over the cliff and to be demolished soon. 'However, . it offers me exciting creative opportunities as an artist, for I intend . to use the rubble to make sculptures and new artworks, all of which . will live on as constant reminders of corporate neglect. 'I intend to remind people worldwide through my work that these homes owned by the retired, elderly and disabled are slipping into a river of chip fat and onto the rocks of despair below the cliff.' Residents’ Association Chairman Malcolm Pirks, who lives next door but one to Mr Cunningham, said: 'We can’t believe it’s happening again. 'Hundreds of tons went down the cliff around ten o’clock on Monday morning and we never heard a thing. 'A neighbour came and knocked at my front door to say they had seen a tree fall over. We had also noticed cracks appearing.' Residents have been negotiating for years with Scarborough Council to rebuild the homes on land at nearby Crossgates. It had been hoped a big insurance payout would fund the relocation but much now depends on what the houses will be valued at. Mr Pirks added: 'The average age of residents around here is 70 so you can imagine the stress it is causing. 'People are losing their homes. We could all be gone soon. There are 55 to 60 houses still here and half of them are occupied.' A Yorkshire Water spokesman said: 'We have been in contact with some residents of Knipe Point Drive and we're aware of the independent report commissioned by the Knipe Point Residents Association, dated December 2012. 'Due to the length and high level of technical information in the report we have not yet been able to fully consider it. 'We will however look closely at the findings and respond to the residents as soon as possible.' A McCain’s spokesman: 'Like everyone else in Scarborough, we are well aware of the longstanding geological issues at Knipe Point. 'We employ around a thousand people in the area and throughout the four decades we have been here we have always played an active and responsible role in the community. 'As part of this commitment we have participated constructively on a voluntary basis in past authoritative studies which have concluded that inherent and unstable geological conditions at Knipe Point are the most probable reason for the issue. 'We have only received a copy of the new document from the Knipe Point property owners in the last few days and, as we always take community representations seriously, we have asked geological experts to assess the document’s contents before commenting further.'","North Yorkshire community of Knipe Point - 500ft above sea level - has suffered landslides since 2008 .

A Lothario lorry driver who wooed two women with marriage proposals then stole their life savings has been jailed for 20 months. Derek McMaster, 64, got engaged to both victims - one a kidney patient on dialysis - then plundered their bank accounts leaving them 'permanently scarred'. These women only realised they were being two-timed as they plucked up courage to give evidence during his trial at Warrington Crown Court in Cheshire. Divorcee Jean Antrobus thought she had found the perfect gentleman, who behaved like an ‘angel’, buying her flowers every week and taking her away for romantic trips by the sea. But all the time he was stealing her money. Victim: Divorcee Jean Antrobus, pictured left, was one of the two women targeted by conman Derek McMaster, right, who was jailed for 20 months for his scam . McMaster of Falcon Hey, Liverpool, exploited his victims through lonely heart adverts in local newspapers and posed as a police officer, putting on a uniform and pretending to go to work. He changed his plea to guilty minutes before a jury was about to be sworn in. Recorder Andrew Long said: 'This case involved the deliberate exploitation by you, of two vulnerable women. 'It's clear both women have been scarred, I suspect permanently. 'You then gave self-pitying excuses for what you had done.' Prosecuting, Andrew Green described how McMaster first targeted kidney dialysis patient Margaret Dickinson. The 64-year-old has renal failure, Chron's disease and chronic arthritis. The 'perfect gentleman' moved in and became her carer, gaining trust to use her bank card and steal £3,150 between March and June last year. Elaborate: Warrington Crown Court (pictured) found that McMaster's victims did not know they were being two-timed until they arrived to give evidence . McMaster then moved on to Runcorn mum-of-two Jean Antrobus, aged 64, who the court heard desperately wanted 'a companion to stop feeling so alone'.. She 'trusted him immediately', with McMaster claiming to be a semi-retired Merseyside Police officer, and even leaving the house in uniform. The fraudster asked her to marry him, then used her bank card to steal £5,275. He used the cash to pay for a ring, meals out and holidays to Rhyl. His deceit was uncovered when his victim attempted to pay for plastic surgery but found her card was over its limit. She needed counselling as a result and now feels 'so guilty over my own stupidity'. The former shop worker said earlier this month: ‘I had been married for 38 years. I’d never answered a lonely . hearts advert in my  life before, but I was feeling a bit fed up so I . decided to ring the number. ‘He was an angel at first, he bought me bouquets of flowers every week and took me away for weekends, a real gentleman. ‘He . said, “Let’s get married. I never loved anyone like you”. He was . convincing and I loved him, but now I realise I was paying for it all . along.’ Last June the . couple held  a big engagement party, but  by that time McMaster had . already been stealing from her on a regular basis. ‘He said he was a . retired police officer and worked part time,’ she added. ‘He . had a full uniform and handcuffs and used to come home with tales of . how he had arrested drug users, but now I know he had simply bought the . outfit over the internet.’ She said: 'It was terrible because I had got to love him. 'I've had to have anti-depressants to get through it. 'He's a rotter, a horrible man. I don't want him to break someone else's heart.'","Derek McMaster jailed for 20 months after stealing £6,500 from them in elaborate scam .

For most people scrap wood means little more than an improvised door stop or a replacement paper weight, if not just rubbish for the bin. But not for artist James McNabb, who sees a miniature home, office or skyscraper in every wooden off cut that falls onto his studio floor. The Philadelphia-based sculptor has carved thousands of pieces of scrap wood and carefully placed them together to form a vast city skyline. The wooden skyscrapers, made in different shapes and sizes, look remarkably like the Manhattan skyline in New York City. Big Apple: The wooden skyscrapers, made in different shapes and sizes, look remarkably like the Manhattan skyline in New York City . Skyline of sight: Growing up in Montville, New Jersey, McNabb says he would stare at the city skyline from hilltops as a child . 'You could see the New York City skyline from the hilltops . The collection, totalling a staggering five thousand individual buildings also includes a huge ‘city wheel’ - which is almost five feet high. And the artist explained how the idea came about. The 28-year-old said: 'I grabbed a piece of scrap wood from the bin, and without thinking, made some cuts. 'In a few minutes the piece started to look strangely familiar, like a screwdriver or a mini skyscraper. Wood you believe it? Philadelphia-based artist James McNabb even made a table out of these unique pieces of wood . Big Wheel: The collection, totalling a staggering five thousand individual buildings also includes a huge 'city wheel' - which is almost five feet high . 'I grabbed another piece of scrap wood, and made another object - this time, it looked like wrench, or a table leg. 'In the next hour I made 15 more - I stayed up that night and worked until morning. 'In 24 hours I made more than 200, all intricately different from the next. Scrapping the rules: McNabb says his habit of using scrap wood is 'my reference to the idea that in order to be successful in the city, we must be willing and able to make something out of nothing' Connections: The artist, who has 10 years of woodworking experience, was able to create this collection as he gets his own supply from his father, the owner of a wood mill . 'When I stood them next to each other, I discovered I was making a small city of objects that were all distinctly different and unique.' And the artist, who owns his design studio in Philadelphia, said his fascination with skylines started when he was a child. He added: 'I’ve loved city skylines ever since I was a child, growing up in Montville, New Jersey. 'You could see the New York City skyline from the hilltops - I always liked to stare at it. 'Growing up, I experienced an outsider’s perspective, always viewing the city from the distance. But from that viewpoint, its very captivating. 'I’ve always been inspired by New York City, but mostly for the culture, the fast-paced environment, and the notion that it’s the place people go in search of freedom, fortune and fame.' The artist says: 'To date, I¿ve made roughly 5,000 skyscrapers. I have been cutting a handful or two every day lately - the total number is still growing' And the artist, who has 10 years worth of woodworking experience, was able to create this collection as he gets his own supply from his father. He continued: 'My dad has a small wood mill in New Jersey - he has provided me with most of the wood I use to make furniture.

'I put my headphones in, listen to my favourite music, and start cutting - I have worked through the night on several occasions. 'To date, I’ve made roughly 5,000 skyscrapers. I have been cutting a handful or two every day lately - the total number is still growing.

Horrific: Dr James Bridges and his professor wife Olga were repeatedly stabbed just minutes after arriving at a £1.3million villa in Barbados . A leading British professor has told how he fought to save his wife as she was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder at their villa on the Caribbean island of Barbados. Dr James Bridges, one of the country’s leading experts on toxicology, and his professor wife Olga were repeatedly stabbed just minutes after arriving at a £1.3million villa. Dr Bridges, 72, of Guildford, Surrey, was stabbed three times while his wife suffered grievous wounds, including a punctured spleen and diaphragm. The 62-year-old underwent emergency at a hospital in the Barbados capital of Bridgetown, where she is said to be in a stable condition. Speaking from the hospital Dr Bridges described the ‘sheer terror’ of being attacked soon after they arrived at their luxury beachfront villa. He said: ‘We had only just let ourselves into the villa. I was downstairs and my wife was upstairs. I heard screaming and rushed upstairs and saw her being stabbed by a masked man with a knife. ‘I tried to pull him off, but he just started stabbing me. It was awful, just terrifying. After he stabbed me he just went back to stabbing my wife who was lying on the floor. It was just sheer terror. I still have a picture in my mind of him standing over here and repeatedly stabbing her.’ Dr Bridges was stabbed three times while his wife suffered a total of seven wounds. Popular area: The attack on Friday evening took place in the Speightstown Parish on the west coast of the island that is often visited by tourists from Britain. A file photo of a local pub in the area is pictured . ‘She was in a much worse way than me,’ he added. ‘Her diaphragm was ruptured and her spleen was also ruptured. She also has a broken rib. ‘She had to undergo emergency surgery, but fortunately she is quite tough and will pull through.’ Dr Bridges, who is chairman of the European Commission’s Committee on Emerging Health Risks, said they had only been in the villa for 40 minutes when the attack took place last Friday evening. He believes the masked intruder scaled up the back of the beachfront house and entered through the balcony. The couple had been loaned the villa by a friend and had planned to stay two weeks on the island. Dr Bridges said the masked intruder stole all their money and credit cards as they lay bleeding on the bedroom floor. ‘The intruder took every penny that I had before getting away,’ he said. ‘To make matters worse I was robbed of the only money I had left when I got to the hospital.’ He added: ‘We are regular visitors to . Barbados and usually stay in an apartment in Speightstown. On this . occasion a friend said we could stay in his villa. We were here part on . business and part holiday.’ Idyllic setting: Barbados is one of the most popular Caribbean destinations with British tourists as it is considered one of the safest.

But according to Ben Fogle, being posh is more of a liability than a help if you want to succeed in television. The 39-year-old has revealed he was told to change his accent when he started out as a presenter 12 years ago because he was too well-spoken for the small screen. Mr Fogle said he even turned down elocution classes to change his upper-class accent because he wanted to stay ‘true to who I am’ He became host of BBC1’s Countryfile in 2001 after finding fame on reality show Castaway, in which he was marooned on the Scottish island of Taransay for a year. However, the former magazine picture editor claims ‘the class thing’ threatened to derail his career almost as soon as it began. He said: ‘The class thing is interesting. I’ve lived with it for 12 years.When I started in television I was told I wouldn’t get anywhere unless I changed my accent, because I was too posh.’ After more than a decade hosting BBC programmes including Animal Park, Wild in Africa and Crufts, the presenter will star in a new ITV series about fishing later this year. He also plans to film a ‘desert-based challenge’ with former Olympic rower James Cracknell before attempting to swim the Atlantic next year. He said: ‘I beavered on for 12 years. I’ve just started a new series for ITV which is a first for me. ‘I’m breaking away from the BBC and I’m hoping that I’ve proven that your accent doesn’t define you. ‘I’ve spoken to lots of people and they say how they talk affects what work they get.

Its detractors try to portray it as a cold, wet and sometimes insular place. But Manchester is actually one of the most exotic cities in the world, researchers claim. This is due to its cultural diversity, with at least 153 languages spoken. Two-thirds of Mancunian school children are bilingual, with the number of languages likely to increase, according to the study by Manchester University. The city is more diverse than London, and rivalled only by New York and Paris for its ethnic and linguistic mix, claims Professor Yaron Matras, who carried out the research. ‘Manchester’s language diversity is higher than many countries in the world,’ Professor Matras said. ‘It is very likely to be the top of the list in Europe, certainly when compared to other cities of its size.’ With a population of 500,000, Manchester is much smaller than London, where more than 300 languages are spoken by eight million inhabitants. Professor Matras said: ‘There are certainly a greater number of languages spoken in London but these are by people who are passing through – diplomats, businessmen, etc – but in Manchester, the foreign language speakers are residents. ‘Around two-thirds of Mancunian school children are bilingual – a huge figure which indicates just how precious its linguistic culture is. As immigration and the arrival of overseas students to the city continues, it’s fair to say that this already large list is set to grow.’ Manchester’s rapid growth began during . the Industrial Revolution, with the city’s textile trade attracting . workers from across the empire, setting the pattern for diversity. The policy of recruiting from abroad . for public services, such as the NHS, has helped bring in some of the . more obscure languages, the professor says. Manchester is famous for its football teams, United and City, managed by Sir Alex Ferguson (left) and Roberto Mancini (right) respectively, but now has a new claim to fame . Manchester is also known for producing stars like former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher . These include more than a dozen . Indian languages, ten from West Africa, three Kurdish dialects, various . forms of the Romany language of Eastern European gypsies, Uyghur – which . is spoken by the Muslims of north-west China – and even Nahuatl, the . tongue of the ancient Aztecs of Mexico. Professor Matras said the Census data . released last week underestimated the number of multi-lingual households . in the UK, as respondents were asked to name their main language. ‘Most multi-linguals speak a language . other than English at home, but use English at work, in their place of . study, so they will answer that English is their main language, even . though this is not strictly accurate.’","Rivalled only by New York and Paris for ethnic and linguistic mix .

'Revenge': Bryn Chittenden, 46, had his attempts to build a barn on his field repeatedly blocked due to opposition from neighbours . A man who claims his neighbours have made his life 'hell' is threatening to exact revenge by selling his field to travellers. Bryn Chittenden, 46, says his attempts get planning permission for a barn on his field in Essex have been blocked time and again due to opposition from residents living on a nearby estate. Now the bitter former print manager intends to sell the 20-acre plot to gypsies, sparking fears the site in St Lawrence Bay could become 'a new Dale farm'. Mr Chittenden has said he would not sell the land to any of his neighbours for 'a million pounds', but would accept a fraction of that amount for the 'satisfaction' of seeing gypsies move in. He warned residents on the neighbouring Scarletts estate: 'If you think I'm a problem, wait 'till a hundred travellers turn up in their caravans'. Mr . Chittenden, a terrier man for the Essex Farmers and Union Hunt, has . advertised the sale online and even told residents he plans to take out a . full page advertisement in a quarterly magazine aimed at gypsies and . travellers. Much of the row . has been played out on Facebook, with Mr Chittenden making his threats . on a local community page for the St Lawrence Bay area. He warned: 'The land will also . be advertised outside of Facebook, including a full page advert in the Travellers’ Times, a magazine for gypsies and travellers which I doubt . many of you will get. 'I have . had a couple of offers for the land already but some things in life are . more important than money so I will end up taking less just for the . satisfaction of watching travellers take over,' he said.

Aerial view: The field Mr Chittenden plans to sell is highlighted in red on the aerial image, the Scarlett estate is highlighted in blue . Mr Chittenden's plans have left residents living on the Scarletts estate afraid the land could end up resembling the notorious Dale Farm, the six acre plot in Crays Hill that was Europe's largest illegal traveller camp until residents were evicted in 2011. 'If you think I'm a problem, wait 'til a hundred travellers turn up in their caravans' Bryn Chittenden . 'It's a real concern because by publishing the land on the internet and in traveller magazines there's a real chance that people will turn up and start to live on the land illegally,' said one woman from the estate, who did not want to be named. 'Once they get here it is almost . impossible to get them to move on. It’s happened here before and it’s . happened in Essex many times. 'We don’t want to live next-door to another Dale Farm.'

A U.S. Navy minesweeper that ran aground on a Philippine reef is taking on water through holes and will have to be lifted off the rocks in an operation that could last another fortnight. Before the USS Guardian can be removed from the Tubbataha Reef, about 56,000 liters (15,000 gallons) of fuel will be siphoned off to avoid spills. The ship, which is based in Japan, crashed into the reef before dawn January 17 while on its way to Indonesia after making a rest and refueling stop in Subic Bay, a former American naval base west of Manila. Investigation: U.S. Navy salvage assessment team members boarding the stern of the USS Guardian in the area of Tubbataha Reef, western Philippines . Aground: The USS Guardian ran aground in the Tubbataha National Marine Park, a World Heritage Site, on 17 January . Problem: The US Navy said it needed to remove thousands of litres of oil from a minesweeper stuck on World Heritage-listed coral in the Philippines, warning it was too badly damaged to be towed away . All of its 79 officers and crew were transferred to two other U.S. vessels the following day for safety reasons as the 68-meter (74-yard) long, 1,300-ton ship was unable to maneuver on its own and buffeted by strong winds and waves. Rear Adm. Thomas Carney, commander of the Navy's Logistics Group in the Western Pacific, told reporters the ship is hard aground about 30 meters from the edge of the reef, a marine sanctuary that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 'It's got hull penetration in several places, and there is a significant amount of water inside the ship right now,' he said. Surveying: A Philippine coast guard diver investigating the damage to corals . Fine: The Philippine government said it wants to fine the Navy for the damage and illegal entry into the marine sanctuary . Attempt: Philippine coast guard chief Rear Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said efforts to remove the fuel have been hampered by the rough waters . Operation: Mr Carney said heavy items aboard the ship will be taken off to lighten it before the vessel is loaded on another ship or barge . Philippine coast guard chief Rear . Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said efforts to remove the fuel have been hampered . by the rough waters and another attempt will be made again today. Mr Carney said heavy items aboard the ship will be taken off to lighten it before the vessel is loaded on another ship or barge. He said the operation could last a week or two. Location: The US Navy ship was minesweeping in the Sulu Sea, 400 miles southwest of Manila, in the Philippines . 'I want to express my deepest regret for the circumstances that we are all in right now,'  Mr Carney said. He said an investigation will look into all the factors that may have led to the grounding, including a reported faulty digital chart, sea conditions, weather and the state of the ship's navigational equipment. The Philippine government said it wants to fine the Navy for the damage and illegal entry into the marine sanctuary. Calls: Earlier this week activists protested against the presence of US military in the country, and called for authorities to investigate the USS Guardian which ran aground . Anger: Filipino protesters march with a banner carrying a message against US military forces during a demonstration in Manila, Philippines . Dismay: Protesters display placards, including a mock model of the USS Guardian . Scuffle: Police push back protesters as they attempt to hold a rally outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila . Angelique Songco, head of the Protected Areas Management Board, which is in charge of the reef, said the government imposes a fine of about $300 per square meter of damaged coral plus about the same amount for rehabilitation and other violations. Carney said that after the ship is removed, the damage to the reef would be assessed and the two governments, which have close military and political ties, will discuss any claims. Earlier in the week Filipino protesters scuffled with anti-riot police during a protest rally in front of the US embassy in Manila. Protesters also set fire to a mock model of the USS Guardian as they protested against the presence of US military presence in the country, and called for authorities to investigate.","The ship, which is based in Japan, .

He said that eggs were thrown at his house with a note reading 'Bubba army Rulesssssss!!!!!!' On tapes heard by the jurors the voice of Bubba the Love Sponge said 'Fight back. … Be a man. I'm calling your wife a whore.' When discussing why Mrs  Schnitt was called a whore, Clem's former co-host Matt 'Spiceboy' Loyd said it was 'just a general term to try to stir it up' and was not to accuse her of being promiscuous or a prostitute. The past few months have been difficult for Clem as in October Hulk Hogan settled his lawsuit against  him. The wrestler has dropped charges against his former best friend over his leaked sex tape, but is still suing Bubba's ex-wife Heather Clem - who stars in the saucy video alongside Hulk - and website host Gawker Media for allegedly violating his privacy .

Thousands of historic pre-war posters were seized on the orders of Hitler’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels in the summer of 1938; months later during the Kristallnacht program against Jews, the poster’s owner, Hans Sachs, was arrested and thrown into Sachsenhausen. Though Sachs and his wife managed to secure British visas and eventually escape to the U.S., Hans Sachs never saw his beloved posters again, even after discovering that many of them existed behind what was then the Iron Curtain in Communist East Berlin. Now, after a seven-year battle with the German museum that held them after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hans Sachs’ son, Peter, has 4,300 of his father’s prized posters in his possession. After searching in vain for a museum to house the priceless artifacts, the 75-year-old heir to his father's posters is selling them at auction, where they are expected to fetch $6million to $21million. Rare: A woman looks at some of the collection of more than 4,300 pre-World War II posters, looted by the Gestapo during the WWII . Impressive: Hans Sachs' collection of thousands of rare posters is previewed on Thursday at the Bohemian National Hall in New York . Unparalleled: The thousands of rare posters collected by Hans Sachs include iconic Art Nouveau pieces . The 75-year-old, who lives in Las . Vegas, is now auctioning off many of his father’s impressive collection . of posters, which include one designed by Edvard Munch and another by . Gustav Klimt. Goebbels wanted the entire collection . for a museum; it was well-known that Hans Sachs had the most complete . collection of posters, which he had started collecting in high school. Mr Sachs had an eventual total of 12,500 posters, many displayed in a . specially built gallery in his home. After the war, Hans Sachs assumed the . collection had been destroyed and accepted compensation of about . 225,000 German marks (then worth about $50,000) from West Germany in . 1961. Five years later, he learned that . part of the collection had survived the war and had been turned over to . an East Berlin museum. It is not known what happened to the other . posters. Sachs wrote the communist authorities . about seeing the posters or even bringing an exhibit to the West to no . avail. He died in 1974 without ever seeing them again. The posters became part of the German Historical Museum's collection in 1990, after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall. Peter Sachs only learned of the existence of the collection in 2005, and began fighting then for their return. Classic: Edvard Munch's 1922 poster is one of thousands of Hans Sachs' collection of rare posters on preview; they were seized by the Nazis in 1938 from a Jewish man on the orders of Hitler's Propaganda Minister . Proud: Peter Sachs holds up a book with some of his father, Hans Sachs' favorite posters at his home in Sarasota, Florida in 2005 . Legal battles went all the way to . Germany's top federal appeals court, which ruled last March in favor of . Sachs, saying that if the museum kept the posters it would be akin to . perpetuating the crimes of the Nazis. Since being returned the posters . Sachs has repaid the 1961 restitution payment, and said he was relieved . that the ordeal was now over. 'I don't really feel a sense of . victory as much as I do of vindication,' he said. 'I think it's absurd . that this should have occurred in the first place; I think the museum . simply should have relinquished them in the beginning on moral grounds.' After the seven-year battle for their . return from a German museum, Peter Sachs told The Associated Press he . hopes auctioning off the majority of the posters will mean they will . finally be on display for those who love them like his father did, after . he failed to find a museum willing to take the whole collection on. 'There's of course no practical way . that I could frame and hang 4,300 posters, so I just didn't see any . other alternative than to do what we're doing,' Peter Sachs, 75, said by . telephone from his home in Las Vegas. Haul: The collection will be auctioned on Friday, and is estimated to fetch millions of dollars . Assumption: After the war, Hans Sachs assumed the collection had been destroyed and accepted compensation of about 225,000 German marks (then worth about $50,000) from West Germany in 1961 . 'But . I don't feel guilty in any way whatsoever - even with them being . auctioned I think it's far preferable that they will wind up in the . hands of people who truly enjoy them and appreciate them rather than . sitting in a museum's storage for another 70 years without seeing the . light of day.' 'There's of course no practical way . that I could frame and hang 4,300 posters. But I don't feel guilty in any way...I think it's far preferable . that they will wind up in the hands of people who truly enjoy them and . appreciate them rather than sitting in a museum's storage for another 70 . years without seeing the light of day.' The auction . at Guernsey's in New York runs Friday through Sunday and features 1,233 . of the posters, including one designed by Edvard Munch to advertise an . exhibit of his own works in Zurich in 1922, an 1898 poster by Austrian . symbolist painter Gustav Klimt, and even James Montgomery Flagg's 1917 . famous 'Uncle Sam' recruiting poster 'I Want You For U.S. Army.' They include advertisements for . exhibitions, cabarets, movies and consumer products, as well as . political propaganda - all rare, with only small original print runs. The value of the 4,300 poster collection is estimated at between $6 . million and $21 million. There is no reserve price set for the . auction, but the individual posters being sold range in estimated value . from about $500 to $40,000, said Arlan Ettinger, president of . Guernsey's. They date back to 1885, and many are the only known . surviving copies, and are in excellent condition, Ettinger said. 'Posters . were created to be ephemeral, to be temporary things, to last an . average of six weeks because they were designed to be posted up on a . wall, whether it was to announce a show at a cabaret club or a political . event,' said Ettinger. 'That . we're even talking about things that are so fragile is miraculous, and . despite the incredible journey these posters have been through ... in . some cases they look as vibrant as the day they were printed; the colors . are so vivid.' Uncle Sam: James Montgomery Flagg's 'I want You For The U.S. Army' is one of thousands of Hans Sachs' collection of rare posters . Two further auctions are envisioned . for September and likely next January, but Sachs said he also plans to . hold onto about 800 posters that he will donate to a museum or museums . that show an interest in putting them on display for the public. Right now the focus is Jewish museums, specifically with Holocaust related exhibits, though other establishments would also be considered, said Gary Osen, the New Jersey-based attorney who represented Sachs in his fight for the return of the posters from Berlin's German Historical Museum. Osen said talks are also under way for a possible special exhibition of some of the posters at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial - the former Nazi camp on the outskirts of Berlin where Sachs' father was briefly held before he fled Germany for the United States. 'The net result will be that a substantially larger number of the posters from this collection will be on public view than would have been had they remained in the German Historical Museum,' Osen said. Sachs is also going to hold onto four of the posters for himself - including an advertisement for Manoli cigarettes by artist Lucian Bernhard. He said it has special significance to him because Bernhard co-founded the art publication Das Plakat, or The Poster, with his father in 1910 and was a family friend. Master: By 1905, Hans was Germany's leading private poster collector and had a total of 12,500 displayed in a gallery in his home . 'As a child I knew Lucian Bernhard. He used to come and visit at the house, so that one had a personal meaning to me,' he said. Born in 1881, Hans Sachs began collecting posters while in high school.

A former Los Angeles elementary school teacher who taught for more than 35 years has been arrested on accusations he sexually abused 20 students. Police say Robert Pimentel has been charged with 15 felonies, and he is expected to be charged with misdemeanors for the remaining incidents at George De La Torre Jr. Elementary in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. Pimentel's bail has been set at $12 million, and an arraignment date hasn't been set. Police and school officials also said Pimentel is also suspected of the sexual abuse of one adult, but did not say what role if any that person had at the school. Pimentel, 57, left his fourth-grade teaching position last March when allegations arose from several girls who told their parents he inappropriately touched them during school and police opened an investigation. District officials immediately removed him from campus and parents and state credentialing authorities were informed, school district spokesman Daryl Strickland said. Parents and guardians will be told of the arrest by letter and phone, he said. 'Due to the number of victims . involved in this case, that's what took so long for it to culminate,' said Det.

Charged: Police say Robert Pimentel, 57, has been charged with 15 felonies at George De La Torre Jr. Elementary in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles . 'Can you go back and fire someone who's already retired? No, you can't,' LAUSD Superintendent John Deasy told the Los Angeles Times. Deasy said the school's principal was also immediately removed because the superintendent was 'dissatisfied' with how the incident was handled. Length: 'Due to the number of victims involved in this case, that's what took so long for it to culminate,' said Det. Gus Villanueva with the LAPD . Court records obtained by the Times show the allegations covered a period between Sept. 2011 to March 2012. LAPD Capt. Fabian Lizzaraga told the newspaper Pimentel is suspected of inappropriately touching the children over and under their clothing. The Los Angeles teachers' union issued a statement calling the incidents described in the allegations 'horrific' and saying that Pimentel was no longer a member and the union would not be involved in his defense. The Police Department said the teacher's name was spelled 'Pimental,' but the school district and public records give the spelling as 'Pimentel.' Police did not know if he had hired an attorney. A woman who picked up the phone at a number listed for Pimentel hung up when asked about a lawyer or comment from family. There have been several high-profile recent cases of Los Angeles teachers accused of sexually abusing students. More than 225 parents and students are involved in various claims for damages against the district after Miramonte Elementary School teacher Mark Berndt was arrested a year ago and has pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of lewd conduct. In December, a jury ordered the district to pay a boy molested by an elementary school teacher $6.9 million - among the largest awards in the history of the school system. The jury found the district liable for the repeated molestation of the 10-year-old student in 2008 and 2009 by teacher Forrest Stobbe at Queen Anne Elementary School in the city's mid-Wilshire district.","Police say Robert Pimentel has been charged with 15 felonies .

The first soldier to survive after losing all four limbs in the Iraq war has undergone an experimental double-arm transplant it was announced today. New York resident, Brendan Marrocco, 26, underwent the operation on December 18th at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, according to his father who confirmed the operation to the Associated Press. He also received bone marrow from the same dead donor who supplied his new arms - a new approach aimed at helping his body accept the new limbs with minimal medication to prevent rejection. Brendan Marrocco has become the first quadruple amputee injured in Iraw to have a double arm transplant . The military is sponsoring operations like these to help wounded troops. About 300 have lost arms or hands in the wars. 'He was the first quad amputee to survive' from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and there have been four others since then, said Brendan Marrocco's father, Alex Marrocco. 'He was really excited to get new arms.' The Marroccos want to thank the donor's family for 'making a selfless decision ... making a difference in Brendan's life,' the father said. Surgeons plan to discuss the transplant at a news conference with the patient on Tuesday. The 26-year-old veteran is recovering at Johns Hopkins Hospital . He also received bone marrow from the same dead donor who supplied his new arms. That novel approach is aimed at helping his body accept the new limbs with minimal medication to prevent rejection . The 13-hour operation was led by Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, plastic surgery chief at Johns Hopkins, and is the . seventh double-hand or double-arm transplant completed in the United States. Lee led three of those earlier . operations when he previously worked at the University of Pittsburgh, . including the only above-elbow transplant that had been done at the . time, in 2010. Marrocco's 'was the most complicated . one' so far, Lee said in an interview Monday. It will take more than a . year to know how fully Marrocco will be able to use the new arms, Lee . said. 'The maximum speed is an inch a month . for nerve regeneration,' he explained. 'We're easily looking at a . couple years' until the full extent of recovery is known. While at Pittsburgh, Lee pioneered . the novel immune suppression approach used for Marrocco. The surgeon led . hand transplant operations on five patients, giving them marrow from . their donors in addition to the new limbs. All five recipients have done well . and four have been able to take just one anti-rejection drug instead of . combination treatments most transplant patients receive.

Brendan Marrocco pictured around 10-months after he was injured in a roadside explosion in Iraq - clearly visible is the scar running along his carotid artery . It was on Easter Sunday of 2009 in Iraq that Brendan Marrocco lost all four of his limbs when his vehicle ran over a roadside bomb. 'It just took both arms, my left leg off completely and my right leg was still attached a little bit,' Marrocco said to CBS News, 'and killed my gunner - my best friend.' 'I severed my carotid artery,' Marrocco said. 'That alone should have killed me.' Indeed, the cruel irony of the gruesome incident meant that Marrocco did not bleed to death within minutes because the heat of the blast cauterized the same wounds it had caused. 'I was barely bleeding from them,' Marrocco said. 'I wasn't expected to live,' Marrocco recalled. 'I died three times and came back.' No pulse. 'Flat-out dead.' Despite his best friend Michael Anaya dying in the blast, Marrocco felt himself lucky to survive, even with his terrible injuries. 'I will not sit down and let my injuries take over my life,' said the quadruple amputee to CBS News. During his rehabilitation, Marrocco often commented that missing his arms was worse, 'by far'. 'Without legs you can still be independent. You know, without arms there's so much more you can't do,' Marrocco said. During his recovery, Marrocco became an inspiration to others, meeting sportsmen such as Tiger Woods and Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees.

Brendan Marrocco relaxes on duty in Iraq before his devastating accident in April 2009 . Minimizing anti-rejection drugs is important because they have side effects and raise the risk of cancer over the long term. Those risks have limited the willingness of surgeons and patients to do more hand, arm and even face transplants. Unlike a life-saving heart or liver transplant, limb transplants are aimed at improving quality of life, not extending it. Quality of life is a key concern for . people missing arms and hands - prosthetics for those limbs are not as . advanced as those for feet and legs. Lee has received funding for his work . from AFIRM, the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, a . cooperative research network of top hospitals and universities around . the country that the government formed about five years ago.

Marrocco expects to spend three to . four months at Hopkins, then return to a military hospital to continue . physical therapy, his father said. Before the operation, he had been . living with his older brother in a handicapped-accessible home on New . York's Staten Island built with the help of several charities. The home was heavily damaged by Superstorm Sandy last fall. Despite being in a lot of pain for some time after the operation, Marrocco showed a sense of humor, his father said. He had a hoarse voice from a tube in . his throat during the long surgery, decided that he sounded like Al . Pacino, and started doing movie lines. 'He was making the nurses laugh,' Alex Marrocco said.","Brendan Marrocco lost all four of his limbs in Iraq in April of 2009 .

Sgt Brandon Niles, 35, who has been serving in Afghanistan for 10 months, was met in the airport by his fiancee, Janell Mosley, and their first child Braeden - who was born just three days after his father was deployed,  the Sacramento Bee reports. The family had a tender moment in Terminal 5 of the International Airport as a delighted Brandon held his son for the first time. First meeting: Sgt Brandon Niles meets his son, Braeden, for the first time. Janell Mosley, Sgt Niles's fiancee, gave birth to the 10-month-old 3 days after he was deployed . The blond baby was happy for a few moments but, perhaps unsurprisingly, soon wanted to go back to the arms of his mom, who has been raising him for the past 10 months with the support of both parents' families. 'I can't get that time back,' Brandon told the Sacramento Bee of his time away. 'I wanted so badly to see him when he was smaller, like the size of a football. Hopefully, he won't even remember that I was gone.' 'It was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be,' he added. The family kept in touch via the internet and Brandon tried to watch Braeden's progress online. Family reunion: Sgt Niles was met by his fiancee and baby at Sacramento International Airport, pictured, as well as his mother and brother yesterday. He was returning from 10 months in Afghanistan . However it proved difficult for the National Guard unit sergeant as the connection was inconsistent. His fiancee, who has a 4 year-old son, Joshua, from another relationship and stayed with family for much of the time Brandon was away, agreed it had been difficult. . 'It's been a really, really hard year, definitely tough,' she said, before adding: 'It's exciting to watch them get to know each other.' Sgt Niles' mother and brother also greeted him home - expressing their relief he had been returned safely.

What it will presumably not address is her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky as she already covered it in her 2003 book, 'Living History.' Over two pages she wrote how she was 'gulping for air' when President Bill Clinton came clean about his infidelity. 'I could hardly breathe. Gulping for air.

Britain could become bogged down in a Vietnam-style conflict in Mali for years, MPs and military experts warned last night. As David Cameron ordered 330 troops to the troubled West African state to support the French-led assault on Al Qaeda-affiliated insurgents, alarmed military commanders raised fears of a ‘mission creep’. The Prime Minister’s decision, reached after top-level talks with Paris, represents a major escalation of British efforts to tackle Islamists behind the uprising in Mali and the massacre at the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria. Deployment: A Malian soldier tries to disperse looters in the streets of Timbuktu. The UK announced it was sending 330 troops to the troubled West African state . Guarantee: Fears have been expressed about British involvement despite Defence Secretary Philip Hammond saying there was 'no intention' of UK units being involved in combat . Mr Cameron will offer British support . to track down the terrorists behind the Algerian hostage crisis in . which six Britons died, as he travels there to ‘pay his respects’ to . those killed. He will also hold talks with the . Prime Ninister Abdelmalek Sellal and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on . dealing with the growing threat from Al Qaeda in the region, and attempt . to smooth over diplomatic relations which were severely strained in the . initial phase of the crisis. Mr Cameron went public with his frustration that Mr Sellal launched a rescue attempt without telling the UK. But the British PM will use the trip . to step up support for defeating terrorists in the region, including . offering up to 330 military personnel. Ministers insisted the troops’ role . would be limited to training African soldiers and providing experts in . intelligence, surveillance and logistics, while Defence Secretary Philip . Hammond said there was ‘no intention’ of UK units being involved in . combat. But it fuelled fears that UK forces could be sucked deeper into another open-ended conflict in a Muslim country. The former Armed Forces minister Sir Nick Harvey said the number of British troops involved could ‘begin to climb quite rapidly’ if the situation on the ground changed, and warned they would be needed for ‘a good many years’. The latest deployment comes as the Government continues withdrawing troops from Afghanistan which has left 440 British servicemen and women dead and thousands more wounded in 12 years of fighting. Raising the grim prospect of being . dragged into yet another military quagmire, ex-Labour cabinet minister . Frank Dobson said: ‘The American catastrophe in Vietnam started off with . a deployment of troops in a training capacity.’ General . Sir Mike Jackson, the former head of the Army, warned that the . intervention could lead to ‘protracted guerilla warfare’ with . insurgents. Being sent: One Sentinel R1 spy aircraft (pictured) operated by 70 RAF personnel from Senegal, west Africa . Helping out: Two C-17 Globemaster transport planes (one pictured) supported by 20 RAF personnel to fly French troops, equipment and supplies . In a statement to the Commons, Mr Hammond outlined the UK’s deployment to the region. Rather than waging war directly, the British mission will involve: Up to 40 military personnel under EU command training local soldiers or establishing a logistics HQ in Mali; a contingent of 200 soldiers and a £5million donation to a separate UN effort to raise an African force capable of fighting the insurgents; around 70 RAF personnel operating a Sentinel R1 spy aircraft from nearby Senegal; one C-17 Globemaster transport plane supported by 20 RAF personnel on standby for three months to fly French troops, equipment and supplies to Mali. Warning: Former Armed Forces minister Sir Nick Harvey said the number of British troops involved could ¿begin to climb quite rapidly¿ if the situation on the ground changed . Action: Malian soldiers throw a suspected Islamist extremist into the back of an army truck in Gao, northern Mali . The UK will also allow US air-to-air refuelling tankers to operate from bases in Britain and provide a Merchant Navy roll-on, roll-off ferry to help France shift equipment into landlocked Mali. Military advisers are expected to be in Mali ‘fairly urgently’. Defence sources said Army troops could be in the warzone as early as next month. Islamist extremists have destroyed priceless artefacts in Timbuktu. They destroyed thousands of Islamic manuscripts dating back to 1204. As part of their hard-line interpretation of Islam, anything considered idolatrous or pagan is destroyed. The story is all too familiar as the Taliban have committed similar acts in Afghanistan. Mr Hammond told the Commons: ‘We are very clear about the risks of mission creep and we have defined very carefully the support that we are willing to provide to the French and the Malian authorities.’ But Labour’s defence spokesman Jim Murphy said: ‘The UK commitment to Mali has grown from lending the French two transport aircraft to the deployment of perhaps hundreds of troops to the region. ‘The public are wary and weary of conflict. There will be worries about mission creep and the safety of UK trainers. It is essential you allay those fears.’ It comes after the French and Malian military entered the historic city of Timbuktu as Islamist fighters fled rather than fight.","MPs and military experts expressed concerns about Britain's involvement .

'Shocking': The Right Reverend Justin Welby has spoken of his distress at children going without food in Britain . The new Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday claimed that parts of Britain are in some ways as badly off today as they were in the 1930s. In an intervention that would have embarrassed David Cameron, the Right Reverend Justin Welby said: ‘Whether we go into a triple-dip [recession] or not, whatever does happen, it’s going to go on being pretty dark economically.’ In a farewell service as the outgoing Bishop of Durham, he said: ‘Children are going without sufficient food which I found particularly shocking and distressing. ‘This was something I had thought would have been eradicated by now.’ He added: ‘We are seeing things we thought had disappeared in the Thirties. Not on remotely the same scale but traces here and there.’ Dr Welby, who takes up his new post on Monday, said churches were organising food distribution centres to help those who could not feed themselves. The warning is likely to remind Tory ministers of the impact of a previous Bishop of Durham, Dr David Jenkins, a fierce critic of Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s, who maintained that some schoolchildren in his diocese were without shoes. His comments also echo remarks made in 2008 by the then Chancellor, Alistair Darling, who came under fire from allies of Gordon Brown for saying the economic conditions facing Britain were ‘arguably the worst they’ve been in 60 years’ and would be ‘more profound and long-lasting than people thought’. Government ministers had hoped for an easier ride from the Church of England following the departure of the liberal-minded academic Dr Rowan Williams from Lambeth Palace and the arrival of Dr Welby, who has wide business experience as a former oil industry executive. Dr Welby is taking the leadership of the Church of England at a time when debate is raging over same-sex marriage and women bishops. Embarrassing: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, would have been hoping for an easier ride from the Church of England after the departure of Dr Rowan Williams, right . He made clear his determination that the Church of England should move to appoint women bishops. ‘It’s about finding a way forward for these massive challenges,’ he said. ‘The Church at a national level has to be outward looking and a body that is engaging, not looking inwards and consumed by its own problems. I am optimistic that we can make progress.’ He added: ‘Everyone is aware that there are significant divisions within the Anglican Communion over issues such as how we go about consecrating women bishops and issues of sexuality, and finding the way forward in those issues is a massive challenge. ‘The Church is a centre of peace and hope which is completely independent of the circumstances around it so church communities everywhere have to be  consciously seeking to be that peace  and hope – welcoming and loving,  ministering to people, letting them come and experience church life, making it easy for them to do so.’ Bishop Welby will take office following a service at St Paul’s Cathedral on Monday. He will be enthroned at Canterbury on March 21.","The Right Reverend Justin Welby 'shocked' that children go without food .

The bus — with 18 aboard — was going between 25 to 30 mph hour when driver Kevin Prendergast, who had been driving for 30 years, slumped over the wheel. The quick thinking commuter managed to ease the unconscious driver’s foot off the accelerator and bring the bus to a halt at around 85th street.Mr Praisler told the New York Post he was not trying to be a hero - he was just 'trying to stop the bus'.

Republican dissidents are plotting a terrorist outrage in the run-up to the G8 summit in Northern Ireland this summer, British sources have warned. Ministers are said to be alarmed by the resurgence in hardline republicanism in recent months, with hundreds of youngsters signing up to join the shadowy 'New IRA', which has vowed to continue the armed struggle to create a united Ireland. Two recent attacks also indicate that extremists have now obtained access to former IRA weapons, which were meant to have decommissioned as part of the peace process. At risk: The recent terrorist attacks linked to IRA means that violent action in the run-up to the meeting of G8 leaders, pictured in the U.S. last year, cannot be ruled out . Semtex plastic explosive supplied by Libyan dictator Colonel Gadaffi in the 1980s was used in a failed car bomb attack on an off-duty Northern Ireland policeman last month. And a rifle used in the murder of prison officer David Black in November has been linked to previous IRA attacks more than a decade ago. The planned arrival of world leaders for the G8 summit in June is posing a major headache for security forces dealing with the upsurge in republicanism and the recent outbreak of loyalist violence in the Belfast flags protests. Ministers are confident that the venue for the summit at the Lough Erne resort, near Enniskillen, is secure, and insist there is no consideration being given to changing the venue to the mainland. But they acknowledge there is a growing risk that republican extremists will attempt to mount a terrorist 'spectacular' in the run-up to the event, when the eyes of the world are on Northern Ireland. Possible target: The G8 leaders will gather at Lough Erne Resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, this June for the summit . Planning ahead: Two recent attacks also indicate that extremists have now obtained access to former IRA weapons, which were meant to have decommissioned as part of the peace process . A British source said: 'The venue is secure - we are absolutely confident about that. But we cannot rule out a cowardly attack beforehand. The republican threat is growing.' Any attack would raise questions about the decision to stage the G8 in Northern Ireland, which was meant to show the world that life in the Province had been transformed for good. Dissident republican groups have never entirely gone away, but until recently they were comprised mainly of veteran hardliners who were never reconciled to the peace process. The so-called New IRA was formed last year from a loose alliance of hardline republican groups. Unlike former groups it is enjoying success in attracting fresh support from the Province's disaffected youth. Sources claim the group has attracted up to 700 new members and is 'actively recruiting'. Like previous groups it operates on fear, doling out punishment beatings and shootings on a weekly basis, as well as plotting attacks on the security services and other British targets. Sources acknowledge that its leaders are beyond the control of Sinn Fein. There are fears that the group also has ambitions to mount a new campaign on the mainland. Recent events suggest it may have access to the equipment needed to conduct a campaign, but there are doubts about whether it yet has the logistical and organisational skills to sustain a series of attacks on the mainland.","Security 'cannot rule out' an IRA attack on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .

He may have been stopped in his tracks as a globe-trotting trade ambassador after a string of scandals. But Prince Andrew, it seems, has high hopes for his two daughters instead. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are, remarkably, to represent the British Government this week as part of a high-profile trade delegation to Germany. High hopes: Prince Andrew (centre) wants his daughters Princesses Beatrice (right) and Eugenie (left) to carry out public duties on behalf of the country . The sisters, aged 24 and 22, will be driving a Union Jack-branded Mini – reminiscent of Michael Caine in the Italian Job - through the streets of Berlin to launch the GREAT Britain campaign in the country. Although they have no formal role as yet, a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office indicated yesterday that the princesses could now be seen more and more on the international stage. ‘The princesses are fifth and sixth in line to the throne and are now part of that group of royals who are willing to go out and lend their support to the UK. ‘This is their first official international event but it has been made clear that they are willing to do this in the future which is great news for us. ‘They are young, interesting and cool and this particular event has a young, fashionable flavour. We are delighted they are taking part.’ A source close to the sisters stressed, however, that both had made clear their intention to become ‘modern royals’ – having their own jobs and incomes but taking part in charitable or national initiatives when required. Role: The pair will drive an eye-catching and iconic Mini from Brandenburg Gate through Berlin before attending a fashion fair as part of the launch of the GREAT Britain campaign in the country . The Mail understands that although . they were asked by the Government to take part, Prince Andrew is funding . the cost of their trip personally. The girls will be flying out on standard economy tickets. It is an unlikely pairing as neither . of the girls carry out on public duties on behalf of the country, . despite being fifth and sixth in line to the throne. But . the Mail understands that their father has been fighting something of a . ‘rear-guard’ action for them to represent the Royal Family in the . future, despite Prince Charles’s plans for a slimmed-down monarchy when . he eventually accedes to the throne. This . week’s event, which starts in Berlin on Thursday, will be the first . time that the sisters have actually represented the nation in any . official capacity. A Buckingham Palace . spokesman said they were hand-picked by the Prime Minister’s office at . Downing Street to attend, saying: ‘Number Ten asked them to take part.’ The pair will drive their eye-catching and iconic Mini from the historic Brandenburg Gate through the German capital before attending a fashion fair entitled ‘Bread & Butter’, featuring home-grown brands such as Superdry. Thursday also marks the 50th anniversary of the signing o f the Élysée Treaty, signed on January 22nd, 1963, which marked a new era of friendship between France and Germany and therefore Britain. Afterwards the princesses will pop into the KaDeWe department story to learn how British companies are exporting to Germany and beyond. The textile industry contributes around £20billion to the UK economy each year and employs some 816,000 people. They will also visit the headquarters of German online shop Zalando, which recently set up an office in London, where they will ‘discuss the latest trends in e-commerce and expansion strategies’, according to the British Embassy in Berlin. Unlikely pairing: Neither Beatrice (left) nor Eugenie (right) carry out public duties despite being fifth and sixth in line to the throne. A palace spokesman said Number 10 had asked them to take part . The following day the princesses' focus . will shift to ‘heritage and knowledge’ with a visit to Hanover, where . they will, perhaps more appropriately, attend the re-opening of . Herrenhausen Palace. The . UK’s links with Hanover date back to the 18th century when . Prince-Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover succeeded Queen Anne to become . King George 1 of Great Britain and Ireland. Just how and why the Government feels that Beatrice and Eugenie are qualified for their new role is not entirely clear. The GREAT Britain campaign is a cross-department initiative designed to use the platform of the Royal Wedding, Olympic Games and Queen’s Diamond Jubilee to showcase Britain’s capabilities abroad, promoting it as a country to visit, live, work, study, invest in and do business with. No-one would comment on whether the Prince lobbied for his daughters to take centre stage at the Berlin event, but Andrew’s old colleagues at UK Trade and Industry are heavily involved and the entire campaign is being co-ordinated by officials at Downing Street. Aides said the Princesses' visit was designed to highlight Britain’s capabilities in the areas of fashion, technology and tradition. But while Princess Beatrice has certainly won praise from fashionistas after losing about two stone in weight and overhauling her wardrobe with the help of a stylist in recent years, she was, nevertheless, ridiculed for her choice of Philip Treacy hat to the 2011 royal wedding which was variously likened to a toilet seat and a pretzel. While Prince Andrew is reportedly keen for his daughters to take a more active role, their mother has also indicated that they would be taking on more public duties . The princess had the last laugh, though, when it was sold for a staggering £81,000 for charity. She . is currently working for a venture capital firm in London and has taken . two days annual leave to undertake this week’s engagements. Eugenie has yet to find a full-time job after graduating from university last year. A . Buckingham Palace spokesman said yesterday: ‘It is something of a one . off but when Number Ten asked they were delighted to attend’. Last year their mother, Sara, Duchess of York, indicated her daughters would be taking on more public duties. 'The girls are going nice and slow, they're coming out, they're doing great works with charity,’ she said. 'I think eventually people will realise that they're taking mini steps and they're doing a great job for Britain.' Their father, Prince Andrew, repeatedly waded into controversy during his tenure as the UK’s Special representative for International Trade and Investment, an unpaid position he took on in 2001. Not only was he accused of wasting taxpayers money on chartering private jets and other five star luxury travel trappings, the prince was also the subject of scrutiny amid fears he was ‘cashing-in’ on connections he developed with wealthy trading partners. The sale of his home, Sunninghill, for £3million over the asking price – despite it languishing on the market for more than five years -  to a controversial Kazakhstan tycoon was particularly controversial. The buyer of the £15million property was Timur Kylibayev, son in law of the oil-rich region’s controversial president, whom Andrew met with several times through his official role and even joined on goose-hunting expeditions. The prince has always denied any impropriety. The final nail in the coffin came when he was photographed walking through Central Park New York with his close friend, financier Jeffrey Epstein, after the billionaire was released from jail for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. The resulting furore so tarnished Andrew’s reputation that in July 2011 he announced he was standing down as an official trade ambassador.","It is an unlikely pairing as neither of the girls carry out public duties .

PepsiCo Inc. is removing a controversial ingredient from its Gatorade sports drink in response to customer complaints. Molly Carter, a spokesperson for the company, said Friday the removal of brominated vegetable oil was in the works over the past year after the company began 'hearing rumblings' from consumers about the ingredient. She said it wasn't a reaction to a recent petition on Change.org by a Mississippi teenager. Decision: PepsiCo says it is going to remove a controversial ingredient from its Gatorade sports drink formula after concerns were raised about associated health risks . Heavy hitters: PepsiCo has recruited a number of high-profile athletes, like Eli Manning (left) and Serena Williams (right), to market Gatorade . Ubiquitous: Gatorade owns, at last count, 69 per cent of the U.S. sports drink market with rival Powerade in possession of about 30 per cent . The ingredient is also used in other drinks, including some flavors of Powerade made by rival Coca-Cola Co. The Atlanta-based company did not say whether it would remove the ingredient from Powerade, but noted that it heeds customer concerns when looking for ways to improve its drinks. Ingredients in food and drinks have come under greater scrutiny in recent years, helped by the ability of consumers to mobilize online. The petition on Change.org noted that brominated vegetable oil has been patented as a flame retardant and is banned in Japan and the European Union. It had more than 200,000 supporters Friday. For Gatorade, Carter said the ingredient is used as an 'emulsifier,' meaning it distributes flavoring evenly so that it doesn't collect at the surface. Denial: PepsiCo says the removal of brominated vegetable oil from Gatorade is not in response to an online petition begun by 15-year-old Mississippi teen Sarah Kavanagh . Widespread: The controversial ingredient that PepsiCo is removing from Gatorade is also used in other sports and soft drinks, like Powerade (left) and Fanta (right) USDA approved: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has found no health risks associated with brominated vegetable oil, but it's banned in other countries . She said it was used only in select varieties including orange and 'citrus cooler.' Other drinks that use brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, include Coca-Cola's Fanta and PepsiCo's Mountain Dew. A spokesman for competitor Dr. Pepper Snapple Group said Sun Drop and Squirt are among its drinks that have BVO. Carter noted that the ingredient is not banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and that PepsiCo's decision wasn't the result of any health or safety concerns. She said it was specifically a response to concerns expressed by Gatorade customers. The company's decision was first reported by the trade journal Beverage Digest. Pulin Modi, a spokesman for Change.org, said the move reflects the 'shift in power we're seeing between businesses and their customers.' You won't even know it's gone: PepsiCo is replacing the BVO in Gatorade with an ingredient called sucrose acetate isobutyrate, which will reportedly maintain the flavor and taste of the drinks . Sarah Kavanagh, the 15-year-old who posted the petition in November, said she's 'very, very happy' that Gatorade is making the change. Kavanagh said she used to drink Gatorade frequently before she checked the ingredients to see if it was in line with her vegan diet. When she looked up brominated vegetable oil online, she didn't like what she found. Now that the ingredient is being removed, she said she'll likely go back to drinking Gatorade. Kavanagh also taped a segment on the topic for The Dr. Oz Show this week that is set to air Wednesday. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., is replacing the BVO in Gatorade with an ingredient called sucrose acetate isobutyrate, which Carter said will maintain the flavor and taste of the drinks. Although Americans have been drinking less soda since 1998, sports drinks have remained a growth area for PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Gatorade remains the dominant player with about 69 per cent of the market, while Powerade has 30 percent, according to Beverage Digest.","PepsiCo, Inc. said Friday it is removing brominated vegetable oil .

Zambia has banned the hunting of lions and other endangered wild cats because of the dwindling number of big cats. The country’s tourism minister said there is more value in game viewing tourism than bloodsports. 'Tourists come to Zambia to see the lion and if we lose the lion we will be killing our tourism industry,' Sylvia Masebo said. Ban: Zambia has become the latest African country to ban the hunting of lions and other endangered big cats . The estimated £2 million that Zambia earned from safari hunting of all its wild animals annually was too little to merit the continued depletion of Zambia’s wildlife, she said. 'Why should we lose our animals for £2 million a year? The benefits we get from tourist visits are much higher,' she said. The leopard population for the sprawling southern African country is unknown, while lion numbers are not believed to exceed around 4,500. Estimates for Africa’s total lion population vary from around 20,000 to 30,000, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Dwindling: Estimates for Africa's total lion population vary from around 20,000 to 30,000, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Trend: Zambia's decision to ban lion hunting follows a similar move by neigbouring Botswana . The population on the continent is falling in the face of numerous threats, including conflict with livestock farmers and loss of prey and habitat. Zambia’s move follows neighbouring Botswana’s decision to ban all sport hunting from 2014 as it also works to promote itself as a game viewing destination. Wildlife-rich Kenya set this trend when it halted trophy and sport hunting decades ago. Lions and leopards are the feline pair of the so-called 'Big 5' group of dangerous African animals coveted by some trophy hunters. The others are elephant, rhino and Cape buffalo. But there are growing concerns about Africa’s big animals in the face of a surge in poaching of elephants for their ivory and rhino in South Africa for their horns to meet soaring demand from Asian countries.

Here’s one cub reporter who could bear-ly contain herself as she watched a wildlife photographer at work. As Dean Swartz took pictures of a black bear family in Minnesota, in the American mid-west, he noticed one young bear watching him very closely. After about 45 minutes the bear decided to have a go as well and ambled over to the tripod. Picture perfect: This bear decided it wanted to have a go at being a photographer for the day and seized the opportunity when it saw a man taking photos . Backing off, Mr Swartz used another camera on his shoulder to carry on taking pictures as the animal tried to focus his camera and make sure the scene was set. Photographer Mr Swartz said: ‘While photographing a black bear sow and her three spring cubs near Ely, Minnesota, I noticed a young bear watching me from the nearby trees. ‘After about 45 minutes, its curiosity could not be contained. As it approached my tripod-mounted camera, I began talking to her in a firm, but calm voice and began waving my arms to make me look bigger. ‘She was not deterred and continued to walk slowly toward me in a very unthreatening way. Generally, black bears are quite shy and easily discouraged under circumstances like this. What's this? As the black bear approached the camera, photographer Dean Swartz backed off and took photos .

Most people would find juggling two adolescent children, a Harley Street therapy practice and just one relationship time consuming enough. But 38-year-old widow Louise Van der Velde, from Camberley, Surrey, is not most people, and after the death of her doctor husband nine years ago the mother-of-two decided she wanted more than one man in her life - and that marriage was for 'mugs'. Now the sex therapist maintains relationships with three men - a property tycoon, a multimillionaire who runs a solar panel company in Dubai, and her 'bit of rough' electrician - and has written a book telling others how they could do the same. Louise Van der Velde practices as a sexual and relationship expert in Harley Street and her own retreat in Marbella, Spain . 'There are simply far too many great men out there for me to settle for just one,' said the middle-class mother, who says each man she is dating knows they are not in an exclusive relationship with Louise, but are still perfectly happy with the arrangement. Louise, who practices as a sexual . and relationship expert both in Harley Street and at her own . retreat in Marbella, Spain, says her model won't work for everyone, but . it has brought her happiness. She said: 'If you are having great sex and great relationships all areas of your life are impacted positively. Some people find happiness in a relationship with one person. I have it with three.' Insisting she doesn't feel cheap sharing her body with more than one lover, Louise added: 'The . fact is, I have a deep connection with all three men. 'Yes I have sex with all of them but not at the same time. I wouldn't . say that I have a ridiculously high sex drive. The average person has . sex two or three times a week - I might be a little bit more than that, . but not much more.' Louise says she is completely happy with her three lovers, as are they . Maintaining that she shields her two children - a daughter aged 11 and a son of 16 - from her private life, Louise explained how she has been seeing the 40-year-old Dubai-based solar panel tycoon for the past six years after meeting by chance at an airport. 'He is aware that I see other men and is quite happy with the situation,' she said. She . was introduced to lover number two - a London-based property tycoon in his 30s who appeared on Channel 4's Secret Millionaire  - . by mutual friend, and they have been seeing each other for a year. 'He is very sexy and dynamic - I have always been attracted to high-achieving men,' she said. Lover number three is a young electrician who lives near her in Surrey - and is happy to pop round when she asks. 'He . is great - we met quite by chance after we got chatting on the train to . London. He is quite young and completely different to my other two . lovers.' Louise claims the arrangement works because she has always been completely honest with her partners. 'I . have counselled numerous people and have seen how it can work for them . too. We are all on a different journey. You have to follow . your gut feelings to achieve happiness.' Louise also believes many people are 'deluding themselves' when they say are happily married. She saidl: 'The controversial truth is that the . state of marriage - and, more importantly, the monogamy it entails - . isn't really working for most people in today's society. 'Okay, it works for some, and that's wonderful when it does bring happiness. I've got the utmost respect for their choice. 'But the sad reality is that many people simply cannot live up to the expectations of life and sex with a single partner. 'And that almost inevitably causes cheating, marital breakdowns, recriminations, divorce, spousal abandonment and misery.' Louise has outlined how her new model for relationships in a new book, Decent Proposal. She explained: 'What if the fairytale version of love and marriage we stumbled upon in storybooks when we were kids, is simply incompatible with the modern world? 'Look around you. How many friends are now on their second - or even third - marriages? Be honest. Count them. 'The sad fact is that too many relationships are coiled with deceit, insecurity or just plain apathy, as the foundations at their core were wrong from the start. 'So why in the 21st century do we still keep trying to make an outdated model of relationships work? Why don't we have the honesty and integrity to admit we all want a bit more out of life?' Saying that 'many people simply don't have time for the old model of relationship', Louise feels many people are instead choosing to spend time with lots of people they like. Louise Van der Velde has now written a book, left, explaining how other people can use her 'relationship model' 'Opening the door to your heart so wide it's okay for people to come and go as they choose isn't always easy and it's not for everyone. I understand that. 'That way we can make ourselves and others happy, without the pressures or expectations that arise from a traditional, and, I would argue, outdated, one-man, one-woman relationship. It seems so obvious to me now. 'I'm living the new model of relationships, and I can assure you, it not only works, it'll help you reach new heights of intimacy, that you may not have ever previously dreamed possible.'

Harm Shilder, a priest in Tilburg, Netherlands, 'names and shames' those intending to quit his church, but insists it is not blackmail.

Mr Schilder said he had received four requests from people wishing to leave the church over the Christmas period. Around 28 per cent of the Dutch population is Catholic, while roughly 44 per cent is not religious.","Priest 'name and shame' parishioners wanting to leave .

Married life is enough to drive you to drink – if you are a woman, that is. Wives tend to consume more alcohol after they wed, while their husbands actually cut down, a study suggests. But men are more likely to hit the bottle after a divorce. The survey into marriage and alcohol was conducted by sociologists at four universities in the US. Lead researcher Corinne Reczek, professor of sociology at the University of Cincinnati, said: ‘Stable marriage curbs men’s drinking yet is associated with a slightly higher level of alcohol use among women. 'Our findings suggest that being married to a man who is more likely to drink creates a new social environment that may promote drinking among women.’ The study found that while husbands drank less alcohol than bachelors and widowers, their consumption increased sharply if the marriage ended. Professor Reczek added: ‘Some research suggests that men are more likely to cope with stressors in “externalising” ways such as alcohol. Women are more likely to cope in “internalising” ways such as depression.’ Men who cut back on drinking  are more likely to have a happier marriage. The professor insisted: 'Men who fail to converge with their wives’ drinking habits in marriage may set a trajectory towards divorce and continued heavy drinking.'

Crackdown: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, seen leaving a Cabinet meeting this week, says that the prize for cracking down on problem families is potentially huge . A single family cost the state more than £345,000 in bills for social service interventions, police and ambulance call outs in just 12 months, it has emerged. The unnamed family, who live in Barnet in North London cost £375,718 in a year - a bill thought to be the largest ever seen by Whitehall officials. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles published the staggering figure after the Government pledged to crackdown on 120,000 families who cost the taxpayer £9billion a year between them. In Barnet alone 18 families cost the public purse some £1.7million in a year in benefits, prison services and policing. Another family in the south west cost local authorities an astonishing £400,000 in two years, with just one member of that family racking up a bill of £290,000 in 12 months. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to give local authorities nearly £450million to help them tackle problem families and get them to turn their lives around. The money will be used to help family members to find work, go to school more regularly and look to reduce the costs councils incur as a result of their behaviour. Local authorities will list problem families and enlist the help of private firms and charities to help them change their ways. Councils will be paid £4,000 per problem family - but only if their intervention is a success. Families who do not co-operate could either be evicted or have their benefits withdrawn. The Department for Communities and Local Government report revealed that Solihull Council in the West Midlands used 18 per cent of its overall budget on just 3 per cent of its families before it started tackling troubled families . Greater Manchester councils have made an overall saving of £224 million from spending £138 million more effectively on 8,000 families. In West Cheshire, the council estimates that the average family costs around £7,795 to the local authority alone, while the average troubled family costs an estimated £76,190.

Mr Pickles said: 'The prize here is potentially huge, both in terms of reducing the financial cost on the public purse and the human costs on families and communities. 'The savings we can make for the taxpayer would far outweigh the extra money we are putting in. 'Momentum is building behind this work and we will do much more in 2013. 'We will start showing the communities around these families that things are changing for the better, with kids back in school, crime coming down and parents sorting out their problems and getting back towards work.

Pope Benedict tweeted in Latin for the first time today and drew a blank response from many followers. 'Unitati christifidelium integre studentes quid iubet Dominus? Orare semper, iustitiam factitare, amare probitatem, humiles Secum ambulare,' the pontiff wrote. The pope’s tweet meant: 'What does the Lord command to those wholly eager for the unity of those following Christ? 'To always pray, to continually do justice, to love uprightness, to walk humbly with Him,' according to University of Cambridge scholar Tamer Nawar. Baffled? So were many Twitter users. 'Benny, nobody understands a word of Latin!' read one response on the online messaging service. The message was shorter and, arguably, more elegant in its original language - one of the reasons why Latin-lovers want to conserve the tongue of ancient Rome, Pope Benedict foremost among them. The Holy See, where even ATM bank machine transactions are available in Latin, is one of the last bastions of the language that gave rise to Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian. In November the pope set up a new Vatican department charged with promoting the study and use of the language within the Roman Catholic Church and beyond. Known for his traditionalist leanings, the 85-year old pontiff has also allowed a partial return of the old-style Latin Mass that was phased out more than four decades ago. The message is the first the pontiff has posted in Latin on his Twitter account . Once the international language of science and learning, Latin has declined in use among priests since the Church began allowing them to hold masses in vernacular languages in the mid 1960s. To keep the language updated, Vatican produces a dictionary of modern words in the ancient tongue. 'Inscriptio cursus electronici' is the vital word 'email', while 'brevissimae bracae femineae' means hotpants. With just over 5,000 followers, the pope’s Latin-language Twitter account is the smallest of his eight profiles, through which he communicates with more than 2 million followers in languages including Arabic and his native German.","The message was posted on Pope Benedict's Twitter account on Sunday .

The damaging effects of the recession have been blamed for the significant increase in the number of middle-aged men committing suicide, a charity has warned. Latest figures have revealed the suicide rate among men aged between 45 and 59 years . old increased between 2007 and 2011 by 8.5 per cent to . 22.2 deaths per 100,000 people - the highest level for a generation . Overall UK suicides hit 6,045 in 2011, according to the figures released by the Office for National Statistics, with deaths among men accounting for a majority of more than 4,550. Driven to despair: An eight per cent rise in the number of UK suicides has been blamed on the effects of the recession . The increase was blamed on the recession by leading UK mental health charity SANE. SANE chief executive Marjorie Wallace said: 'These figures reveal the profound human consequences of the economic downturn, in which unemployment, debt and the relationship breakdowns that often follow can push people who may be already vulnerable to take their own lives. 'It is worrying that the group most at risk should be middle-aged men who are not usually seen to be at risk.' More than a quarter of men who took their own life in 2011 were aged between 35 and 55 according to the statistics, with the rate among men generally peaking at its highest for a decade with the female rate its highest for six years. The figures were released at the same time as a report from researchers at the University of Brighton which claimed that irresponsible lending and intimidating debt collection is driving more people to depression and suicide. The report said that many people already struggling with wage freezes and benefits cuts during the recession are unable to cope with threatening letters and persistent phone calls. On the rise: The suicide rate among men is at its highest for a decade according to figures from the Office for National Statistics with the sharpest increase among men aged between 45 and 59 . It said: 'Debt clients frequently feel humiliated, disconnected and entrapped, with the process of debt collection having a clear impact on people’s mental health. 'The Government must take urgent action to tackle the problem of irresponsible lending and intimidatory collection tactics which have left thousands of people trapped in a spiral of debt and at risk of depression and even suicide.' According to the report there were cases of individuals not eating properly and asking their children for money to tide them over. One individual who owed money described the effect of his wife’s credit card debt and the card issuer chasing her for the money. The man was quoted in the report as saying: 'I was very close to calling the doctor to her because she is that close to breaking because of these continual phone calls.' A 48-year-old, who almost attempted suicide before a call to the Samaritans stopped him, has said he is not surprised at the sharp rise in suicides among men of his age. Mr Shepherd told The Times how during the previous 12 months he lost his job as an online casino's operations manager, witnessed the breakdown of his relationship and had left his Portsmouth home, forcing him to sleep on the sofa in his son's one-bedroom flat in Colchester. After writing suicide letters he visited a car park with the intention of killing himself, according to the report. But after looking through the contacts in his phone to see who would miss him, he came across the Samaritans helpline, which he phoned the night before but hung up before speaking. He said: 'I don't quite know why I did it, but I called the number and the person on the line was really friendly, very understanding when I said where I was. 'They said their office was close to where I was and I could come in for a coffee, and that's what I did.' Unemployment, debt and relationship breakdowns that can follow in an economic downturn can push vulnerable people to take their own lives, a charity has warned (file picture) Mr Shepherd's life has since improved after re-training as a support worker to help people with learning difficulties. Meanwhile, Stephen Platt, professor of health policy research at the University of Edinburgh and a trustee for the Samaritans, has warned middle-aged men losing their jobs were being particularly badly affected by the economic downturn. He said: 'Men judge themselves against a gold standard of masculinity set by society and when they can't meet these expectations they can feel worthless, unvalued, a deep sense of shame and that there is no reason for them to live.' He has also urged the Government to alter its suicide prevention strategy, which remains focused on young people despite the rise in suicides among middle-aged men.","Recession blamed for sharp increase in suicide among middle-aged men .

Lindsay Sandiford, 56, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was convicted of taking 10.6lb (4.8kg) of the Class A drug into the country. The court said she had shamed Bali’s tourism . reputation by smuggling the cocaine in the lining of her suitcase . through the island’s international airport. Distraught: Lindsay Sandiford of Britain reacts inside a holding cell after hearing her sentence to death, which she is due to appeal . She received the sentence despite prosecutors only asking for a 15-year jail term. A court official confirmed his office had received the appeal request through the head of Kerobokan Penitentiary where Sandiford is being held. Earlier it was announced that the British government is to be challenged over its failure to fund legal representation for Sandiford, who is presumed not to be able to afford legal representation for the appeal. Law firm Leigh Day, which is working with the charity Reprieve, said it would cost around £2,500 to pay for an adequate lawyer to take on her case, but the Government will not pay. The firm said Sandiford had not been properly represented since her arrest at Bali airport in May last year. A spokesman said: ‘We strongly object to the death penalty and continue to provide consular assistance to Lindsay and her family during this difficult time. Death sentence: The court told the grandmother she had shamed Bali's tourism reputation by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island's international airport . ‘We have made repeated representations to the Indonesia authorities and the Foreign Secretary raised Lindsay Sandiford's case with Dr RM Marty Natalegawa, Indonesian foreign minister, during the recent November State Visit of the Indonesian President. We understand that, under Indonesian law, Lindsay has at least two further avenues of appeal through the courts as, well as an opportunity to apply for presidential clemency should these be unsuccessful. ‘HMG does not provide legal representation for British nationals overseas. However, we assist British nationals in identifying potential legal representation, including by working closely with NGOs. We will continue to raise this case on diplomatic channels.’ Following the call for a judicial review into Sandiford's case, Cheltenham MP Martin Horwood has urged the Foreign Office to rethink its policy on support for Britons sentenced to death abroad. Caught: Sandiford was arrested at Bali's international airport with 10.6lb of cocaine in her possession . The British grandmother is being kept in Kerobokan jail in Bali, Indonesia. A court official confimed his office had received the appeal request from the prison . He said: ‘Indonesia itself now pays for lawyers to represent its migrant workers facing the death penalty in countries like Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and China. ‘I don't think it's unreasonable for Britons abroad to expect the same kind of support from their own government in this kind of extreme and unusual situation.’ The MP met Foreign Office officials last week to ask them to support her search for urgent legal representation, and he is due to meet the Indonesian ambassador today to discuss the legal process in Indonesia.

But it seems even Donald Trump cannot defeat Mother Nature. The US billionaire’s controversial Aberdeenshire course, Trump International Golf Links – Scotland, was battered by North Sea storms last month, causing a large chunk of pathway to fall away. The collapsed path, near the fourth tee, had been covered in neatly trimmed turf but now lies exposed to the elements with pipes running out of the ground. Folly: Suzanne Kelly, who discovered the damage while out for a walk, said it was 'beautifully ironic' The area of collapsed path is around 5ft deep and 15ft wide. Mr Trump’s spokesman confirmed the damage, explaining a burn had overflowed because of  the heavy rainfall. However, the spokesman claimed to be ‘very pleased with how the course endured such an extreme weather situation’. TV gold: Mr Trump's battle with the locals over his plan for the course featured in a BBC2 documentary . Last night, Suzanne Kelly, a local resident who discovered the damage, said it was ‘beautifully ironic’. She added: ‘The amount I know about golf would fit into a teaspoon. However, I do know when I’m walking on a pathway and come to a big chasm, that’s not the best. ‘I’m just glad the light hadn’t gone by the time I got to that point on the course otherwise I’d be talking from a hospital bed with a broken leg. ‘There’s no fence, no sign, no warning you’re about to fall into a hole, just a few traffic cones.’ The 51-year-old secretary, a volunteer at community website Aberdeen Voice, continued: ‘I know there are all sorts of drainage issues across the site and it certainly doesn’t look like a bang-up job of drainage construction to me.’ Mr Trump’s spokesman claimed the pipes were simply for ‘diverting surface water’. The golf course, which opened last July, has been beset by controversy. US Apprentice star Mr Trump has been accused of bullying local people into accepting his plans. Last October, You’ve Been Trumped, a documentary by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter chronicling the tycoon’s battle against residents, was shown on BBC 2. Last month, severe weather battered the East Coast, as a ‘perfect storm’ caused extensive damage. An unusual combination of tidal forces, strong winds and atmospheric pressure led to huge waves and high tides. Dented: Four foot of earth was washed into the North Sea after unprecedented rainfall in December . Botched job? Campaigners say there are all sorts of issues with poor drainage systems at the site . Mr Trump’s spokesman said: ‘The burn that runs through that part of the course was overrun with water and caused some damage. It’s easy to correct and we’ll certainly be prepared now. ‘When you have any kind of links course, occasionally you have devastating storms. I think we can all agree that the storms that hit the North-East three weeks ago were unprecedented situations of extreme volumes of water. ‘The course held up very well. There was some surface damage but actually we were very pleased with how the course endured such an extreme weather situation. There are two sections impacted because the burn burst its banks. ‘We have a 600-acre golf course which is sand-based and we have exceptional drainage. The pathway has collapsed into the burn.’","The 'bullying' businessman infuriated locals when building the course .

A journalist is facing financial ruin after he blew up the engine of a £1.3million Porsche he had borrowed from a former Formula One driver. Mark Hales was testing the powerful vehicle belonging to David Piper for a magazine article when he accidentally over-revved the engine. He claimed that the veteran driver had agreed to cover the bill for the damage, but a High Court judge ruled yesterday that Mr Hales was responsible for the breakdown and ordered him to pay more than £100,000 in damages and costs. The writer has complained that the huge bill will bankrupt him - though it would hardly make a dent in the fortune of Britain's best-known motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson, who earns more than £1million a year thanks to his work on Top Gear and multiple books. Lawsuit: Journalist Mark Hales, left, has been forced to pay out more than £100,000 after blowing up the engine of a vintage car belonging to racecar driver David Piper, right . Damaged: This £1.3million replica of a Porsche 917 had its engine blow up after being over-revved by Mr Hales . Mr Hales, 62, who is himself an experienced race driver, borrowed Mr Piper's Porsche 917 replica for a feature comparing it with a classic Ferrari owned by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. He took the two cars to Cadwell Park in Lincolnshire in April 2009 in preparation for the article which was set to appear in Octane and Auto Italia magazines. But as he was changing gear he revved the engine too much, causing it to break down entirely. Mr Hales is adamant that he had a deal with Mr Piper, 82, who raced for the Lotus F1 team in 1959 and 1960, and that as a rule owners take care of mechanical problems while drivers pay for crashes. He said he had been having difficulties with the car, and claimed that as he changed from second to third gear it 'popped out', causing the engine to over-rev and blow up. Experience: Mr Hales was comparing the car to a Ferrari owned by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason . Legend: Mr Piper, now 82, drove for Formula One team Lotus in 1959 and 1960 . 'The Porsche 917 is a tough car to drive and it is a matter of fact that the engines blow up,' he said. 'Everyone has done it and I knew this was the case. 'I had a conversation with David Piper and he asked me what happens if the engine blows up. I told him I couldn't be responsible and he said OK, but then chose to forget the conversation. 'If you crash the car you repair it but if it is mechanical you don't. It was a gentleman's agreement and I didn't write it down. I had a similar agreement with Nick Mason for the Ferrari of his which I was driving.' Mr Piper had the Porsche repaired by a German specialist at a cost of £37,000, before selling the replica race car last year for £1.3million. He also owns an original 917, valued at £5million. Article: The journalist was comparing the Porsche with a Ferrari owned by Pink Floyd's Nick Mason, pictured . The Porsche 917, pictured, first entered competition in 1969, and quickly became one the German company's most iconic models. With a top speed of more than 240mph, the car was driven to victory at the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1970 and 1971. The car was powered by a five-litre engine, and could accelerate from 0-62mph in just 2.3 seconds. The 917 was brought to wider audience beyond petrol-heads after it appeared in the film Le Mans, released in 1971 starring Steve McQueen. Most of the film is taken up with footage of the 917 racing alongside other classic cars, showing off the model's smart design and innovative mechanics. In his findings, judge Simon Brown blamed Mr Hales for failing to 'properly engage gear having been expressly told to do so and specifically warned about the risk of serious damage to the car if this was not done'. He added: 'His level of driving - on this particular occasion - fell below the standard of care, albeit high, required of him.' Mr Piper's lawyers said their client was pleased at the decision and intended to recoup the £48,000 in damages and £63,000 of other costs which the court ordered Mr Hales to pay. The journalist said: 'I've sold everything to pay my lawyers and if he chooses to enforce the findings it is bankruptcy for me.' He added: 'It was clear he wanted his day in court and the judgement was an absolute disgrace. 'This isn't what happens when you lend your race car to someone with no money but the judge didn't accept it.' Mr Hales spoke of his gratitude at readers of a motoring website who are planning to set up a fund to help meet his costs. 'I have been left overwhelmed with the kindness from people planning on setting up a fund,' he said. 'I am very grateful and I may have to use it. If he drops the judgement then any money would go back to the people who donated or given to charity.'","Mark Hales forced to pay £111,000 after breaking David Piper's car .

Kenneth Compton, 80, managed to stumble from his Renault Scenic after the quarter tonne metal gate crashed down on the bonnet of his car at the Gala Bingo hall in Erdington, Birmingham just moments after he had dropped his wife off at bingo. The 23-ft-wide barrier speared the car with such force that it bent the roof out of shape, completely shattered the windscreen and left Mr Compton with a head injury and fractured eye socket. Bingo player's luck: Kenneth Compton is lucky to be alive after a heavy metal barrier crashed down on his car which bent the roof out of shape, completely shattered the windscreen and left Mr Compton with a head injury and fractured eye socket . At Birmingham Magistrates Court, parent company Gala Leisure Limited was fined £25,000 last Friday after it was found that Gala Bingo had not secured the barrier with a padlock at its Kingsbury Rd branch. Investigators found that locks had been . used previously but may have rusted and been removed in the lead-up to . the near-fatal incident on June 3, 2011. Mr Compton, of Great Barr, Birmingham, said he suffered dizzy spells since the incident. He said: ‘It was absolutely terrifying but I'm OK now. I just want to move on now and forget all about it.' His wife Ada, 82, added: ‘When I saw the picture of the car I was horrified. ‘He is very lucky to be alive. ‘He still has had a few dizzy spells but we're just glad he's still here.’ Health and safety: Gala Leisure Limited was fined £25,000 because it had not secured the barrier with a padlock at their bingo hall in Erdington (pictured) The court heard that the company had . failed to take the barriers into account in their risk assessments and . were fined for two health and safety breaches. Councillor Barbara Dring, chair of . Birmingham City Council's licensing and public protection committee, . said after the case: ‘The failure to assess the risk and secure the . barrier put members of the public at risk. ‘As a result of the company's irresponsible actions a person was hospitalised with serious head injuries. ‘Gala .

Birmingham City Council's head of environmental health Mark Croxford said: 'I think everybody was surprised that it wasn't much worse, even at five miles per hour being hit by that sort of barrier could be fatal. 'Mr Compton was lucky in that he only received a glancing blow, if it had hit him square-on it would be a different story, you can see what it did to the roof of the car in the pictures. 'Apparently people in the car behind his just saw his car deforming as the barrier went into it. 'I know that the crews who attended the scene were expecting the worst when they arrived. 'To be fair to Gala Bingo, they held their hands up and admitted they'd made a very big mistake from the off. 'They've taken the experience and learnt from it to make sure it never happens again.

Beach ball sized spiked rovers could soon be rolling around the surface of Phobos, if a groundbreaking new design for rolling rovers if given the go-ahead. Stanford researchers, in collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have designed the 'hedgehog' probes. Dropped from a mothership, each rover would hop, tumble and bound across the cratered, lopsided . moon, relaying information about its origins, as well as its soil and . other surface materials. The rovers would drop from a mother spaceship, and then be able to 'hop' across the surface, before tumbling to their final locations and take measurements from the surface . An entire mission would last two to three years, and just flying to Phobos would take the Surveyor about two years. Then the initial reconnaissance . phase, during which the Surveyor would map the terrain, would last a few . months. The mothership would release each of the five or six hedgehogs . several days apart, allowing scientists enough time to decide where to . release the next hedgehog. Developed by Marco Pavone, an assistant professor in Stanford's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the system consists of a mother spacecraft, known as the Phobos Surveyor, and the rovers it houses, called 'hedgehogs'. The Phobos Surveyor, a coffee-table-sized vehicle flanked by two umbrella-shaped solar panels, would orbit around Phobos throughout the mission. The researchers have already constructed a prototype. The team say the hedgehogs could be the first step to exploring Phobos . 'It's a piece of technology that's needed . before any more expensive type of exploration is considered,' Pavone . said . 'Before sampling we need to know . where to land. 'We need to deploy rovers to acquire info about the . surface.' The Surveyor, or mother ship,  would release only one hedgehog at a time. Together, the mothership and hedgehogs would work together to determine the hedgehog's position and orientation. Using this information, they would map a trajectory, which the mother craft would then command the hedgehog to travel. The hedgehogs do not have wheels, as do . the current Mars rovers. Instead they rely on three rotating discs . enclosed within each hedgehog, with each disc pointing in a different . direction. The rover is controlled via three flywheels, and is powered by solar panels on its exterior . A prototype of the hedgehog the team has already built. they plan to test future versions on parabolic flights to simulate zero gravity . The spiky explorers would relay scientific measurements back to the Phobos Surveyor, which would forward the data to researchers on Earth. Based on their analysis of the data, the scientists would direct the mothership to the next hedgehog deployment site. An entire mission would last two to three years, and just flying to Phobos would take the Surveyor about two years. Then the initial reconnaissance phase, during which the Surveyor would map the terrain, would last a few months. The mothership would release each of the five or six hedgehogs several days apart, allowing scientists enough time to decide where to release the next hedgehog. For many decisions, Pavone's system renders human control unnecessary. 'It's the next level of autonomy in space,' he said. An image of Phobos made with NASA's Mars Global Surveyor . An early example of the mission the spiky rovers could take . To confirm Phobos' origins, Pavone's group plans to deploy most of the hybrids near an area known as Stickney Crater. Besides providing a gravity 'sweet spot' where the mother craft can stably hover between Mars and Phobos. The crater also exposes the moon's inner layers. The team has already built two prototypes, and plans to test the hedgehogs in a reduced-gravity aircraft, also known as a 'vomit comet,' essentially an airplane flying a parabolic path. The plane climbs and then pitches downward, at which point it begins a low-gravity free-fall lasting about 25 seconds before pulling up again. During each parabola, the researchers will test a different hedgehog maneuver. A test of the Phobos Surveyor will likely take place in two to four years. Pavone hopes that a Phobos Surveyor mission, which could occur within the next 10-20 years, will bring scientists closer to a human mission to Mars. 'The bottom line is that there is a growing interest in the exploration of small bodies,' he said.","Stanford University and Nasa developing programme to send the round rovers to Phobos .

This is the fragile 'real life China doll' who survived against the odds despite being born with 30 broken bones. Millie Simpson, from Cheshire, has such a rare form of brittle bone disease that her bones were broken in the womb every time her mother moved during pregnancy. Doctors picked up the condition on pregnancy scans. They could see that she had broken every bone in her body - and told her devastated parents that it was unlikely that she would survive the birth. Millie Simpson has such a rare form of brittle bone disease that she broke her bones in the womb every time her mother moved during pregnancy . Before she was born doctors could see she had broken every bone in her body - and told her devastated parents that it was unlikely that she would survive the birth . Mrs Simpson was offered a termination - but she refused and told doctors she wanted to give her baby a chance. Amazingly Millie, who has just celebrated her second birthday, was born alive and was able to breathe, despite her ribs being broken, and she is now going from strength to strength. But she is so fragile that she still cannot stand on her own feet - because they would break with her weight. Mrs Simpson said: ‘She is like a real life china doll. Her bones are so fragile that they break with just the slightest touch. ‘But she is getting stronger each day with the calcium treatment she is having. And she has such a huge personality. Millie's mother Stevie was offered a termination - but she refused and told doctors she wanted to give her baby a chance . ‘We are so proud of her. She has defied the doctors to have survived like this - she is such a little fighter.’ Mrs Simpson was 34 weeks pregnant when doctors first noticed a problem with her unborn baby. They were concerned that she was small and wasn’t growing properly, so she was referred to Chester Hospital for a scan. The scan showed that her arms and legs were small and initially doctors thought Millie was suffering from a form of dwarfism. Mrs Simpson, 23, a warehouse assistant, who lives in Ellesmere Port with husband Tyler, 27, a chemical plant technician and their other daughter Lottie, also two, said: ‘Initially the doctors thought she had dwarfism which was a shock. 'I knew that my pregnancy bump wasn’t as big as it had been with my first pregnancy, but I had never imagined anything could be seriously wrong.’ Mrs Simpson was referred to the Liverpool Women’s Hospital four days later where another scan revealed the breaks all over her tiny body - in her back, arms and legs. She was diagnosed with a case of brittle bone disease that was so severe that it had begun in the womb. Doctors broke the devastating news to her parents that it was life- threatening as it was likely that Millie wouldn’t be able to breathe on her own when she was born because of her broken ribs. Mrs Simpson said: ‘We were devastated when we were told what Millie had. It was such a severe case that she had broken every bone in her body. ‘The scan showed that some of the breaks had healed, and some of them hadn’t. And in some of the bones, there were several breaks at a time. ‘It was so upsetting to know that every time she had moved around in my womb, it had caused her bones to break.’ Mrs Simpson was 34 weeks pregnant when doctors first noticed a problem with her unborn baby. They had originally thought it was dwarfism . The family, including mother Stevie, father Tyler, and Millie's big sister Lottie (right), now call her their 'little miracle' The doctors then offered to carry out a termination as Millie’s case was so severe. She had broken ribs, which would mean she would be unable to breathe on her own. But her brave parents refused, determined to give their unborn daughter a chance at life. Mrs Simpson said: ‘There was no way that we were going to end our daughter’s life like that. We had to give her a chance.’ Millie was born by caesarian and amazingly despite her broken ribs, she was able to breathe. Mrs Simpson said: ‘She let out a cry when she was born, and it was the most amazing thing. She came out fighting, and we were just so relieved that we had given her that chance to live. There was no way that she was giving up.’ Millie continued to make progress and after three weeks she was allowed home from hospital. She has had to have calcium treatments every few weeks and intensive physiotherapy to strengthen her bones. She could not sit up until she was eight months old, and since her birth she has broken her arms and legs several times and broken her jaw. She has broken bones just by rolling over, or by someone lightly touching her. Mrs SImpson said: ‘Her bones are extremely fragile and she can’t stand up as she can’t put her weight on her feet. It’s a daunting task for her but we are hoping that she will be able to walk one day. ‘Watching her improve each day is so rewarding. She has such a huge personality and we are so proud of her. ‘She may be a real life china doll but she has such a fighting spirit. She could have given up with all those broken bones in the womb, but she didn’t. She’s our little miracle.’","Millie Simpson has a rare form of brittle bone disease and doctors said it was unlikely she would survive the birth .

'If I had not sat the exam now, I would have had to wait until May - I just had to get in. I also picked up one of my friends. His mum could not get far in the car, so I collected him at the A66 Motel and brought him in as well.' Will lives with his parents John and Christine on a 1,300-acre farm in Hutton Magna with 200 beef cattle and 150 sheep.

'The snow was about six to eight inches deep and it's getting up the driveway that's the main problem - the roads themselves are quite clear and we live quite a distance from the school. 'Will heard one of his friends was . stranded who lives in Barton, so he picked him up from the roadside on . the A66 on the way over.' Barnard Castle is among the minority of schools in County Durham which have remained open as normal during the cold snap.

After finishing sixth form, Will hopes to study agricultural engineering at Harper Adams University, in Shropshire. He said: 'I want to take over the farm eventually and this will give me some idea of how to fix the machines. 'For the past three months, dad has been off because he had an operation so I have been doing a lot of the work around the farm. 'It's mainly feeding the stock.

He caved in. ‘At the time he was very hot and his lawyers said, “Give her something just to shut her up”.’ Stallone was 18 years old when Miss . Filiti was born. His mother had re-married after her first marriage, to . Stallone’s father Frank, ended in divorce after nine years. Despite Miss Filiti’s allegations, . Stallone remained on good terms with his sister. He even cast her son .

He alleged that his mother ‘screamed about’ abuse . at the hands of her brother ‘over and over’ while in a Florida hospital . last year. A spokesman for Stallone said: . ‘Unfortunately, celebrities, politicians and athletes frequently find . themselves the targets of blackmail efforts by family members and . associates who fabricate claims in order to extort payments from them.’ Clan: The action star and his former model wife Jennifer Flavin, 43, have three daughters together, Sophia Rose 15, Sistine Rose 13 and Scarlet Rose nine . Stallone’s film career took off in 1976 with the release of Rocky, which he wrote and starred in. Family life: Stallone was left devastated when Sage, his son with ex-wife Sasha Czack, was found dead in his Los Angeles home on July 13 2012 . He went on to become one of the . highest-paid stars in Hollywood, playing Vietnam veteran John Rambo in . First Blood which, like Rocky, spawned several sequels. He is said to be . worth more than £160million. His son Sage, 36, died of a heart . attack at his Hollywood home last July. He was found days before he was . due to marry his long-term girlfriend. The only picture reported to have been . found in his apartment was of Sage, aged 14, with his father. His . lawyer and close friend George Braunstein said Sage ‘idolised’ his . father and that the pair were ‘close’. According to sources, he led a . hermit-like existence and was living in a property littered with junk . food wrappers, cigarette butts, empty cans and prescription drug . bottles. He could have been dead for up to four days before his body was . discovered. Sage was the second of two sons . fathered by Stallone with his first wife Sasha Czack, whom he divorced . in 1985 after ten years of marriage.

Harry, still wearing his baseball cap, low-slung jeans and a checked shirt with the sleeves rolled up, did not leave until 10.30 yesterday morning. Looking slightly weary, but otherwise remarkably unscathed, the prince walked to a waiting car being driven by his detectives and was presumably taken back to his flat at Kensington Palace.

Africa has its first female billionaire Isabel Dos Santos, daughter of Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos. The 40-year-old studied engineering at King's College, London, before opening her first business at the age of 24 - a restaurant called Miami Beach. She has come a long way since then, currently sitting on the boards of several companies in Angola and Portugal and owning large stakes in wealthy corporations including a bank and a cable TV company. Her assets include a 19.5 per cent share of Banco BPI, one of Portugal’s largest publicly traded bank worth an estimated $465 million and a 25 per cent stake in the Angola's Banco BIC worth a conservative $160 million. Last year she reportedly increased her share in Portugal’s largest cable TV company ZON Multimedia from 4.9 per cent to 28.8 per cent worth around $385 million. Those stakes combined with other assets push her net worth over the $1 billion mark. However according to Forbes business magazine sources within Angola say she also owns a 25 per cent stake in Unitel – one of the country’s two mobile phone networks which according to analysts is worth a minimum of a billion on its own. Angola, a country of 18 million people, lies on the western coast of southern Africa and is rich in diamonds and oil.

A schoolboy has been left with a broken back after being knocked off his motorcycle by a driver who then swore at him and drove way from the scene. Steven Smith was nearly paralysed in the hit-and-run smash, and his parents are appealing for help in bringing the driver to justice. The teenager has recalled how the driver who hit the back of the bike walked over to him and said, 'serves you right' before leaving him bleeding in the road. His father Paul said: 'Accidents do happen - but I would not have left a dog like this. He left my son in the road to die.' Shock: Steven Smith, pictured in hospital with his mother Celia, sister Shirene and father Paul, broke his back in three places after being hit by a car while riding his motorbike . Steven was given the bike as a birthday present in November last year, and was riding round Old Whittington in Derbyshire on January 6 when he was hit by a black people-carrier. After the driver sped off, a passer-by who knew first aid found him lying in the road and put him in the recovery position while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. Doctors at Sheffield's Northern General Hospital believe her quick thinking may have saved Steven from being paralysed for life, and say that the teenager will eventually be able to walk again. Two of the three breaks he sustained to his back are set to mend on their own, but the third, which is close to his spine, could require surgery. Steven is currently recuperating in the hospital's spinal unit, where he will remain for the next two months, and is unable to stand or sit up. He has had to put his plans to leave school and become a bricklayer on hold while he recovers from the crash. Callous: The driver got out of his car and laughed at the victim before speeding off again . Recounting his ordeal, he said: 'All I remember is a black people-carrier clipping the back of my bike - he kept speeding up behind me before hitting me and I went flying into the air. 'The driver got out of the vehicle and walked over to me. I was in terrific pain but he just stood there effing and blinding, he said, ""Serves you right"", then he laughed and drove off. 'It was obvious I was badly injured but he thought it was funny.' Steven continued: 'Luckily a woman with first aid experience found me. She realised I had a serious back injury and knew exactly what to do. 'If it hadn't been for her I could be spending the rest of my life in a wheelchair.' Scene: The accident happened while Steven was riding in Old Whittington in Derbyshire . His mother Celia said she had been almost unable to process the horror of her son's accident. 'I got the phone call every parent dreads,' she said. 'It was one of his friends who told me Steven had been involved in an accident. 'I screamed and dropped the phone. My daughter picked it up and found out where Steven was. 'We drove to the accident scene and found Steven covered in the blood and being treated by emergency services in the road. It was a terrible sight - a paramedic was cutting off his clothes and told us he had spinal injuries. 'We can't believe that anyone could be so heartless and cruel. The man even got out of the vehicle and swore at him. We are all devastated and just want Steven home and whoever did this caught.' Mr Smith added: 'To leave a lad in the road without calling for help is callous. We just hope the appeal jogs someone's memory and they come forward.'

Beyonce was widely praised for her live rendition of the National Anthem at the inauguration ceremony but now it appears that her performance may have been lip synched. A spokesman for the Marine Corps Band who provided the musical accompaniment for the song said midday Tuesday that she did not in fact sing in real time, instead opting for a pre-recorded track of the song. Hours later, a Marine spokesman backed off the claim and insisted he didn't know one way or the other, 'no one in the Marine Band is in a position to assess whether it was live or pre-recorded. Earlier Tuesday Master Sgt. Kristin duBois said the band was notified at the last minute that Beyonce would use a pre-recorded voice track. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'She did a beautiful job with the pre-record': Beyoncé has yet to comment on reports she mimed during her performance of the Star Spangled Banner at President Obama's second inauguration ceremony, but Aretha Franklin has made her feelings clear . Officials stated that Beyonce decided to use the version of the National Anthem that she pre-recorded with the Marine Corps Band in the days prior to the Inauguration, but later backtracked . Does it matter if Beyoncé lip-synched at Obama's Inauguration ceremony? But later Marine Corps spokesman . Capt. Gregory Wolf said that because there was no opportunity for . Beyonce to rehearse with the Marine Band, it was determined that a live . performance by the band was ill advised. Instead they used a pre-recorded track for the band's portion of the song. 'Regarding Ms. Knowles-Carter's vocal . performance,' Wolf's statement continued, 'no one in the Marine Band is . in a position to assess whether it was live or pre-recorded.' A representative for Beyonce did not respond to requests for comment. DuBois declined to answer further . questions. Earlier in the day, she told The New York Times that the rest . of the inaugural performance was live and they did not know why a . recorded track was used for the national anthem. 'It's not because Beyonce can't sing. We all know Beyonce can sing. We all know the Marine Band can play,' she said. The news that Beyonce may been lip synching comes as a shock since she went to such an effort to pretend as if she was singing live. Hints of a lie: Beyonce posted multiple pictures to her blog of the process by which she recorded the track . Better inside? It was revealed today that it was Beyonce's choice whether or not to use the recorded track . Behind the scenes: The track was recorded with the Marine Corps Band, and even they did not actually play at the ceremony . The most dramatic moment came when . the Grammy-winner ripped out her earpiece mid-song- a move that many . singers do when the bounceback in the sound system goes haywire and they . are unable to hear themselves correctly. Members . of the Marine Corps Band confirmed that Beyonce did not spend more than . one night preparing for the event, as she only spent the night before . the Monday performance in the capital. By contrast, Kelly Clarkson flew . in several days earlier- and she ended up performing live rather than . using the pre-recorded track that she made with the band. 'We . had Kelly in over the weekend to rehearse and record. Beyonce, she's . getting ready for the Super Bowl, so we didn't have a chance to do . anything with her until last night so it's a very, very tight window of . opportunity,' Marine Corps Band director Colonel Michael J. Colburn told . Buzzfeed. 'As soon as we get information from . the presidential inaugural committee who the guest artists are going to . be, we make contact with them, find out how we can prepare arrangements . that will really kind of flatter their voices — of course in the right . key.' Beyonce did not stay around to soak in . the immediate praise from the performance either, as she reportedly . flew back to New Orleans on Monday evening to return to Super Bowl . preparations. Though the millions of people who . watched the inauguration were kept in the dark about the fake . performance, many in the audience apparently knew that something was . awry. Raw talent: Kelly Clarkson, who performed My Country Tis of Thee, sang live during the ceremony and opted against using the pre-recorded track that she also had as an option . Friendly competition: Kelly Clarkson posted this picture to Twitter, being very complimentary of Beyonce . Lip synching songs is tool that strikes a controversial chord among performers.Though it is generally accepted at certain large outdoor events (like the Inauguration, say) because weather conditions can be contentious and techincal difficulties could ruin the show. That said, many performers consider it to be 'cheating' as fans expect that to hear a live performance. Elton John and Madonna have an infamous, long-standing fued started when he was repulsed by the fact that she won the Brit Award for best live act in 2004. 'Since when has lip-synching been live?' he said in response to her win. That same year, Ashlee Simpson famously flubbed when it was revealed that she was lip-synching because she pretended to sing when the wrong track was playing. After initially blaming her band, she later admitted that she had acid reflux and had been advised by her doctor not to use her voice. The Washingtonian . reports that many members of the press- who were seated directly below . the podium where Beyonce was 'singing'- observed that the musicians in . the Marine Corps Band were not actually playing their instruments during . the song. Instead, they were pretending blow . into their instruments, even as their conductor carried on by visually . directing the band. His performance, however, was mostly for the . cameras. Even Beyonce . hinted that she would not be performing live as she posted a series of . pictures of herself singing the Star Spangled Banner in a recording . studio with the Marine Corps Band in the days leading up to the . ceremony. The Times of London confirmed the rumor and spoke directly to an unnamed spokesman for the . band who said that inaugural performances are always pre-recorded as a . precaution, but it is left up to the artist themselves if they would . like to use the safety net or go live. Beyonce apparently chose the . former. 'We did pre-record it and it was . Beyoncé’s decision at the last minute to go with the pre-recorded . version,' the spokesman said to The Times. 'This is our 54th inauguration… There . is no question of there not being any music – it’s not because the . performer cannot do it.' That is certainly the case when it comes to Kelly Clarkson, who performed before Beyonce and decided to forgo the prepared back up by actually singing live. The prospect of using pre-recorded music is not unusual: at President Obama's first inauguration in 2009, famed cellist Yo Yo Ma opted to have the recorded version of the song blasted on the speakers down the Mall and played in television broadcasts. What was the point: If Beyonce was not actually singing at the time of the broadcast, then she would not have needed to rip out her earpiece as she did so dramatically in the middle of her performance . Nerves: The singer is a strong supporter of President Obama and has performed at a number of events for him in the past, most notably she sang the First Couple's first dance at the 2009 inauguration . That said, he still performed live in addition to using the back-ups. 'A broken string was not an option. It was wicked cold,' he said to The New York Times following the performance. This is not the only time that Beyonce has been haunted by claims that she did not actually sing when she claimed to: in the 2009 Academy Awards, she starred in a musical number with the show's host, Hugh Jackman, and many believed that she did not actually sing. The event's organizers did not clarify, either, saying only: 'As is the case with any live event of this scale and scope, there are always elements of the show that are pre-recorded. But I will not go into detail about which elements were on this show.' Calls to Beyonce's press representatives from MailOnline were not immediately answered. The singers' next major live performance will be at the Superbowl in New Orleans on Feburary 3.","Midday Tuesday Marine Corps Band spokesman said Beyonce opted to use a pre-recorded track and the band was also mimicking .

Keeping it real: Hollywood actress Gemma Arterton tries to stay true to her working class roots despite her success on the big screen . She has a life that most people can only dream about, rising from humble beginnings to become a Hollywood star. But despite her fame and fortune, actress Gemma Arterton has claimed that she is constantly trying to understand how less privileged people feel in a bid to keep in touch with her working-class roots. The 27-year-old star said she has a need to understand the lives of ‘doormen and waiters’ so she doesn’t get carried away with her success. The former Bond Girl, who was brought up on a council estate in Kent, said that she would never succumb to the ‘superficial life’ of the film industry. She said: ‘I see my working-class background as a gift. There’s so much superficiality in the work I do and my upbringing helps me to remember that’s exactly what it is – superficial. ‘Don’t get me wrong, I have a very nice life. I have a nice house, I don’t have to worry about food, I drive a nice car and for this trip to Los Angeles I’m staying at a hotel that is so nice that when I arrived there, I almost cried. ‘But that sort of thing is never going to become the norm for me – and I never want it to. I always want to understand everybody’s aspect of life – not just the Hollywood people, but the waiter’s and the doorman’s too. ‘I get very uncomfortable when I see someone having a life of privilege and not appreciating it.’ Arterton, who stars alongside Jeremy Renner in upcoming film Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, was born in Gravesend, Kent, the daughter of Sally, a cleaner and Barry, a welder. Her parents broke up when she was five and Arterton went to live with her mother and younger sister on a council estate. She eventually left school at 16 to go to acting college. Stephen Frears, who directed Tamara Drewe, even sent Arterton to a vocal coach to tone down her thick Kent accent. Speaking to Hello! Magazine, she added: ‘You should have seen me a couple of days ago. I’d just got back from a trip to Spain, where I didn’t really wash for a week. My hair was in dreadlocks and my nails were filthy. That’s the real me.’ Star: Gemma Arterton is perhaps most famous for her role as Strawberry Fields in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. She is pictured with Bond actor Daniel Craig . Shortly after graduating from drama school in 2008, Arterton beat 1,500 other hopefuls to land the role of Bond girl Strawberry Fields in 007 film, Quantum of Solace. She has since gone on to star in the Boat that Rocked and Clash of the Titans. In 2010 she married Italian sales manager Stefano Catelli and the pair currently live in London. She has admitted that being with someone who is not an actor helps to keep her ‘grounded’. She has also previously admitted that she has no desire to become as famous as other leading ladies in Hollywood, such as Angelina Jolie. ‘Absolutely not,’ she said. ‘I’m really happy as I am. I’ve had a small taste of that sort of thing over the last two years and it’s not really where my heart lies. 'I’m really happy doing these films, and doing theatre, and living in London, and spending time with my friends. I’m doing the job I love, and if it got any bigger than that, I wouldn’t enjoy it any more.’","Bond actress Gemma Arterton keeps in touch with her working class roots .

Mexico City has a serious stray dog problem, with an estimated five million wild and unwanted animals roaming the streets. The life of a stray dog in the city is cheap and many are subjected to terrible torture by cruel owners and are helpless against violent attacks from gangs. A lucky few get a second chance at happy life if they are fortunate enough to find their way to  Milagros Caninos, a sanctuary for abused and abandoned dogs. Patricia Ruiz plays with some of the animals at her sanctuary for abused and abandoned dogs in Mexico City . Sanctuary owner Ruiz gives some attention to Pay de Limon, who has been fitted with prosthetic front legs . The sanctuary, which claims to be the first in Latin America, was opened in 2006 by Patricia Ruiz on the grounds of her family’s country home, 15 miles south of the center of the city. She felt compelled to do something to help abused dogs after she and her daughter stumbled across a Jack Russell terrier mix that had nailed to a tree by its ears. They managed to save the dog, called Bobby, although sadly his ears had to be partially amputated. Bobby now lives a happy and healthy life at the sanctuary which has grown to become home to 128 abused dogs. There are dogs in wheelchairs, blind dogs, deaf dogs and even ones suffering from serious illnesses including cancer. The animals are finally safe and free to run around the large grounds of the sanctuary. After gradually spent more time wearing his prosthetic legs Pay de Limon now has a new lease of life . Other dogs at the sanctuary include Menta who has been equipped with a dog wheelchair . All have been subjected to horrific acts of cruelty. One of the worst cases is a Belgian shepherd mix called Pay de Limon (Lemon Pie) who had to be fitted with prosthetic front legs. Pay de Limon was found last February in a trash can where he had been left to die after having his two fronts legs surgically removed. ‘Pay de Limon had the misfortune of running into an organized crime group, in Fresnillo, Zacatecas, Mexico, and they used him to practice cutting off each one of his paws, like they do when they cut fingers off human beings that have been kidnapped,’ said Ruiz. ‘Unfortunately, Pay de Limon had to live through that, but thanks to a few good people who rescued him, Pay de Limon was able to come to Milagros Caninos and here we try to give him the best life possible.’ The Milagros Caninos sanctuary near Mexico City is home to about 128 abused dogs . A dog equipped with a dog wheelchair stands next to a metal pail at the Milagros Caninos sanctuary . Ruiz raised over $6000 in donations to pay for Pay de Limon to receive his two prosthetic legs. Because no facilities exist in Mexico . for fitting dogs with prosthetic legs, moulds of the dog’s legs were . sent to OrthoPets, a company based in Denver, Colorado which specializes in animal prosthetics. ‘What we did was take a kind of mold with a cast called an orthocast, which is a made of plaster,’ said Dr. Osvaldo Vital Reyes, Medical Director at Milagros Caninos. ‘We made the mold, which includes the entire anatomical structure of the limbs. This was sent to the United States. In the United States, they calculated the size they (the prosthetic limbs) would be, based on x-rays we sent and other measurements.’ Another of the dogs at the sanctuary is Capuchino, who uses a dog wheelchair to walk . Ruiz currently pays for nearly everything at the sanctuary with what she describes as 'personal resources' After gradually spent more time in his new legs, Pay de Limon has became used to them and now has a new lease of life at the sanctuary along with other dogs including Capuchino and Menta, who both use doggie wheelchairs. It remains is a constant battle for Milagros Caninos, which translates as Canine Miracles, to find the resources it needs to continue to help dogs like Pay de Limon and pay for the food and medical supplies needed to care for 128 dogs. Ruiz told Outside that she currently pays for nearly everything, including her ten staff, with what she calls 'personal resources.'

Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson decided to donate his brain for medical research after realising the . drugs he was taking to treat his Alzheimer's disease were having little effect. The celebrated television director who . died on Boxing Day at the age of 83 was determined to help other . dementia sufferers after being diagnosed with the condition in 2011. After lengthy discussions with wife . Mary and son Jamie, the family contacted the Alzheimer's society . and were put in contact with the Brains for Dementia Research project. Alzheimer's sufferer Gerry Anderson, pictured with son Jamie,  decided to donate his brain to medical science after realising the drugs he was taking were not having any effect . Pulling the strings: Gerry Anderson with some of his famous Thunderbirds creations . Son Jamie revealed his father had hit . upon the idea after completing a fundraising walk saying: 'This . Alzheimer's business, it really is terrible isn't it?' Jamie told the Telegraph: 'He kept saying it over and over again. I have to say I had to agree with him.' His father then added: 'The quicker they can find a cure the better, so they are welcome to my brain.' Jamie said his father continued to raise the subject over the next few months and on one memorable occasion he . announced loudly to couple they had met on holiday: 'Well I'm . donating my brain to medical science'. Proud creation: Sylvia and Gerry Anderson on the set of Thunderbirds in the Sixties with Lady Penelope . 'Yes m'lady': Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson with two of his most famous puppets, Lady Penelope and Parker, at Planet Hollywood in London in 2001 . Mr Anderson, who insisted on being . cremated because he did not want to 'waste space' had been taking the . drug Aricept to treat his condition. It is designed to slow the advance of the disease but the effects are limited. At first Mr Anderson was not sure about donating his organs but changed his mind as he realised the drugs weren't having any effect. Just months before his death Gerry Anderson spoke of his passion to continue writing despite suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Talking in June at his home in Nuffield, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, he said: 'I'm not worried about forgetting my career. It's an odd thing this, losing one's memory. ‘Not everybody is affected in the same way and it's no good going around everyday worrying about it. I can remember clearly things that happened 60 or 70 years ago. ‘I can remember conversations with friends and the actual words we used. My career is like an encyclopaedia. I made so many shows, worked with so many crew members that I cannot pick out specific memories. ‘I can still write stories though - I can continue. So many people have told me that my work is instantly recognisable because within three seconds I've blown a city apart.’ Son Jamie said: 'Despite the fact he was very confused he was obviously thinking about it. It mean't something to him.' Mr Anderson made his name in the 1960s . with a series of hit sci-fi puppet shows including Captain Scarlet and . Joe 90, but is best known for Thunderbirds which followed the adventures . of International Rescue and the Tracy family. The series - which used a form of marionette . puppetry dubbed 'supermarionation' - became hugely popular around the . world. Talking about his condition at the . launch of the Alzheimer’s Society’s Memory Walk, Mr Anderson said 'the . bitterest blow' was not being able to drive. He said: 'It meant that I couldn’t go . to Pinewood studios where I worked, and this depressed me enormously . because my film work was my life. 'Suddenly my life was cut off. Since . I’ve had Alzheimer’s I’ve realised how debilitating it is. It can affect . your life in so many ways that you don’t think about.' Asked how he came to realise he was suffering the condition, he said: ‘I don’t think I realised at all. It was my wife Mary who began to notice that I would do something quite daft like putting the kettle in the sink and waiting for it to boil.’ She became concerned when, in early 2010, he took hours to return to their Oxfordshire home in Henley-on-Thames after forgetting his route from Pinewood Studios, a journey he had made for decades. His wife persuaded him to visit a doctor, where he was asked to copy a series of simple geometric drawings. He thought it would be a simple task — only to realise he was hopeless at it.",TV director died aged 83 after long battle with Alzheimer's .

Facebook is testing a system which charges users to send messages to people that they aren’t already connected to, with a premium to be paid for contacting very popular people. The company confirmed Friday that trials have already begun for the new service, but that only a small number of Facebook users currently have access to the option to pay to send a direct message. Every user currently has the ability to send a message to any other user for free, however unless being sent to a friend or friend of a friend the message goes directly to the receiver's 'other' folder. Described by Facebook as the place 'where less relevant messages go,' this little known option was introduced in 2010. Communication at a cost: Facebook is trialing a new service which enables users to send messages directly to people they don't know at a price . The new service offers direct access to the receiver's inbox, provided the sender is prepared to pay the fee . Facebook initially floated the idea of paying for messages prior to Christmas, when it was suggested that the service might cost $1 per . message. However a technology journalist at Mashable was surprised when they attempted to send a message to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and received an option charging a hefty $100 fee to send a message directly to the social network's CEO. Zuckerberg has more than 16 million followers on the site and without paying for a direct message to his inbox, any message would go straight to his extremely overcrowded ‘other’ folder. The company admits it is experimenting with ‘extreme price points' to reduce incoming spam for Facebook users with large subscriber counts and big online presences. Users are also limited to sending one of these kinds of messages per week. Facebook is confident that imposing a financial cost on the sender will be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and best ensure the delivery of messages that are relevant and useful to the receiver. Would you pay $100 to contact this man? Facebook is charging some users a hefty fee to send a message directly to the social network's CEO . ‘Today we’re starting a small experiment to test the . usefulness of economic signals to determine relevance,' read a Facebook statement. 'This test will . give a small number of people the option to pay to have a message routed . to the Inbox rather than the Other folder of a recipient that they are . not connected with.’ Several commentators and researchers . have noted that the company may be considering a sliding scale of fees . depending on the perceived importance of the person being messaged. The concept could become an important new revenue stream for the company which held its initial public offering in May last year. Facebook could soon be providing a paid service to all users which enables them to send messages directly to the inboxes of VIPs .","Facebook has confirmed is it testing a service which charges users to send messages directly to another user's inbox .

Thousands of people, many holding signs with names of gun violence victims and messages such as 'Ban Assault Weapons Now,' gathered in front of the Capitol on Saturday for a March on Washington for Gun Control. Marchers were led by Mayor Vincent Gray and other officials Saturday morning, and the crowd stretched for about two blocks along Constitution Avenue. Police blocked off half the road. Participants held signs reading 'Gun Control Now' and 'Stop NRA,' among other messages. Other signs were simple and white, with the names of victims of gun violence. Thousands of people walked from U.S. Capitol to the Washington Monument with a range of placards supporting greater gun control . Actress and anti-gun violence activist Kathleen Turner addressed the crowd during the march . The rally was organized in response to the school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. Around 100 Newtown residents attended the march . About 100 residents of Newtown were expected at the march. It was organized in response to the December shooting there that killed 20 first-graders and six teachers. Kara Baekey of Norwalk, Conn., said she immediately thought of her two young children when she heard about the shooting. She said she decided she must take action, and that's why she joined Saturday's march. 'I wanted to make sure this never happens at my kids' school or any other school,' Baekey said. 'It just can't happen again.' James Agenbroad, 78, of Garrett Park, Md., carried a handwritten sign on cardboard that read 'Repeal the 2nd Amendment.' He called it the only way to stop mass killings because he thinks the Supreme Court will strike down any other restrictions on guns. 'You can repeal it,' he said. 'We repealed prohibition.' Washington Mayor Vincent Gray (pictured third from right) attended the rally . Molly Smith, the artistic director of Washington's Arena Stage, and her partner organized the march. Organizers said that in addition to the 100 from Newtown, they expected buses of participants from New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. Others are flying in from Seattle, San Francisco and even Alaska. A rally was planned on the monument grounds at noon. While she's never organized a political march before, Smith said she was compelled to press for a change in the law. The march organizers support President Barack Obama's call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines as well as for universal background checks for gun sales. They also want lawmakers to require gun safety training for all buyers of firearms. 'With the drum roll, the consistency of the mass murders and the shock of it, it is always something that is moving and devastating to me. Colin Goddard, a survivor of the Virginia Tech mass shooting, also spoke to the crowd during the protest for greater gun control . Protestors carried a number of messages. Some held signs with the names of gun violence victims . 'And then, it's as if I move on,' Smith said. 'And in this moment, I can't move on. I can't move on. 'I think it's because it was children, babies,' she said. 'I was horrified by it.' After the Connecticut shootings, Smith posted something on Facebook and drew more support to do something. The group One Million Moms for Gun Control, the Washington National Cathedral and two other churches eventually signed on to co-sponsor the march. Organizers have raised more than $46,000 online to pay for equipment and fees to stage the rally. Lawmakers from the District of Columbia and Maryland were scheduled to speak Saturday. Actress Kathleen Turner was expected to appear, along with Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund and Colin Goddard, a survivor from the Virginia Tech massacre. Smith said she supports a comprehensive look at mental health and violence in video games and films. But she said the mass killings at Virginia Tech and Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., all start with guns. 'The issue is guns. The Second Amendment gives us the right to own guns, but it's not the right to own any gun,' she said. 'These are assault weapons, made for killing people.' Organizers expected buses of participants from New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. Other marchers were flying in from Seattle, San Francisco and even Alaska .","Rally organized in response to Newtown school shootings in December draws thousands of protestors from all over the U.S.

"By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 15:36 EST, 25 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:24 EST, 25 January 2013 . Ex-music teacher: Convicted peado Michael Crombie was today found guilty of further offences against 30 girls . A London secondary school repeatedly ignored warnings that a music teacher was sexually abusing young female pupils, a court heard today. Convicted paedophile Michael Crombie, 75, was accused by a series of girls and their parents whilst working at Wanstead High School, yet head teachers refused to take action. Crombie was was jailed for five years in 2010 after being convicted of charges relating to the systematic abuse of 29 young girls whilst working as a music teacher in East London. Today he was given a further three years after another 30 victims stepped forward following his last trial in 2010. The latest case emerged after one former pupil, whom Crombie abused whilst teaching her in sixth form, was outraged by his request for a character reference during his last trial in 2010 and stepped forward. The Old Bailey heard she taught at his home, where he regularly kissed her, asked her to turn up to lessons naked, and told her to imagine how she would react to him raping her. 'She replied she would run out screaming, and he said no-one would believe her,' said Sandy Canavan, prosecuting. A further victim, who was groped and kissed by Crombie, was told chillingly by the abuser: 'if you sing the notes right this wouldn't be happening.' Jailing him for three years, Judge Wendy Joseph QC slammed the two schools where Crombie had worked for failing to take claims of abuse seriously. She said: 'It is clear that complaints were made to schools by a number of girls on a number of occasions, but nobody took any, or any adequate, steps to ensure that this defendant was stopped from preying on girls in his charge. 'For many years Mr Crombie was not brought to book, either because a complaint was not made or because those in authority, who could have pursued matters, did not.' The latest charges relate to a period when Crombie worked first at Beal Grammar School, in Redbridge, east London, from 1964 to 1974, and then at Wanstead High School, also east London, until 2007. His victims were all girls aged between 11 and 17. Disregarded: Head teachers at Wanstead High School repeatedly ignored warnings that paedophile Crombie sexually abused their pupils . Crombie, who will serve the three-year . term after finishing his current sentence, was arrested in prison after . the fresh allegations were made, but denied them until barely a . fortnight before his trial was due to begin. Ms Canavan said the paedophile 'selected his victims with . care, groomed them, and made them feel they were responsible for what . was happening.' 'He would . use his status and position to deny the charges and offer innocent . explanations for what had happened,' she said of his tactic for staying . out of trouble. While at Beal Grammar School, Crombie . began a sexual fling with a 14-year-old girl whom he was teaching . bassoon, eventually being trusted by her parents to babysit her at their . home, and to let her stay with his family. Crombie manipulated her into performing sex acts on him in the school's music room cupboard, and also while he was driving. Bad move: Michael Crombie was jailed in 2010, but made the mistake of asking a woman he abused for a character reference during the trial, after which she and another 30 victims came forward . Scene: Mr Crombie abused young girls at Beal High School in east London, one 14-year-old victim called him 'possessive . Looking back, she told police he was a 'possessive control freak.' 'I wanted him to want me, and he obviously did at the time,' she said. 'It made me feel good - I was his chosen one.' She told police that his sexual interest in her was 'common knowledge' at the school, but no action was ever taken to stop it. After . getting a job at Wanstead High School, Crombie began inappropriately . touching the legs and knees of girls he was teaching instruments to. He also repeatedly used . 'breathing exercises' as an excuse to touch their bodies, and took them . swimming to indulge his aquaphilia - a fetish for watching . people underwater. While . putting a young harpist through the pointless routine, he grabbed her . breasts, and then shoved her against a wall and kissed her. Crombie . also  put his hands down another girl's underwear as she auditioned for a . singing part in a school show, while another said he was 'known . throughout the school as a perv'. Horror lesson: Crombie told victim 'if you sing the notes right this wouldn't be happening,' the Old Bailey heard . 'Given that most of the girls who attended music lessons were aware of the defendant's behaviour, it is hard to understand why no members of staff shared their suspicions,' said the prosecutor said. Judge Joseph said Crombie's crimes had left a 'real and lasting impact' on his victims, one of whom became anorexic around the time of his abuse, with several going on to suffer depression. 'It was a prolonged and manipulative campaign of sexual abuse,' she said. 'There are themes running through these statements, reflecting the anger of these women at the way he took over their lives. It is clear that several of them believe his actions have affected their relationships in later life.' In a statement, one victim described 'feeling self-loathing, because he was manipulating her into doing this, and she was powerless to stop him.' Another said she was now paranoid about the safety of her own children. The judge added: 'The fact he is being sentenced now rather than earlier can to some extent be placed at his own door, because he has consistently denied wrongdoing. 'When the pleas did come, I could detect no element of remorse.' Crombie, formerly of Woodford Green, Essex, admitted 47 counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual activity with a child.","Convicted paedophile Michael Crombie, 75, jailed for a further three years .

Hospitals will become ‘warehouses of older people’ without major changes in the National Health Service, Labour claimed today. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham warned up to 40 per cent of hospital beds are taken by older people and the ageing population will mean the problem will only get worse. He called for the NHS, social care and mental health services to be merged to stop elderly people being put on a ‘fast track to care homes’. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham warns an ageing population means hospitals will become 'warehouses of older people' without major changes in the health service . Mr Burnham said that as people get older their needs become a ‘blur of the physical, mental and social’ and health spending should be combined into a single £119 billion budget. Ministers including Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and PM David Cameron have blamed poor standards of nursing for problems on wards. But Mr Burnham says the NHS has failed to adapt to the increasingly old patients it treats. Councils, qwhich are currently responsible for adult social care, are under pressure to keep council tax down so have ‘whittled away’ services. ‘It's financial madness, as well as being . bad for people,’ Mr Burnham said in a speech to the King’s Fund as he . launched a Labour policy review of health and social care. Mr Burnham used a speech to the King's Fund to call for NHS, social care and mental health budgets to be merged . ‘Hospital chief executives tell me that, on any given day, around 30 per cent to 40 per cent of beds are occupied by older people who needn't have been there. If we leave things as they are, our district general hospitals will be like warehouses of older people - lined up on the wards because we failed to do something better for them. ‘But it gets worse. Once they are there, they go downhill for lack of whole-person support and end up on a fast-track to care homes - costing them and us even more. ‘We could get much better results for people, and much more for the £104 billion we spend on the NHS and the £15 billion on social care, but only if we turn this system on its head. ‘We need incentives in the right place - keeping at home and out of hospitals.’ He claimed hospitals operate a 'a 20th century production-line model' which treats immediate problems like broken bones or the impact of a stroke without considering the 'whole person'. Staff in hospitals who used to rarely see a patient over the age of 80 have not changed to deal with ever greater numbers of very frail people in their 80s and 90s, with intensive physical, mental and social care needs. Mr Burnham spoke of his distress in 2007 at being unable to fulfil a promise to his sister-in-law, who had breast cancer, that she would be able to die at home. 'I told her I thought I would be able to. But, after a day of phone calls, I will never forget having to going back to Claire and say it couldn’t be done. 'And I was a minister who knew how the system worked, so what chance have families who are at a low ebb and don’t know where to start?' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured on a visit to King's Collge Hospital in London, accused Labour of plotting a fresh reorganisation of the health service . However ministers accused Labour of plotting a huge reorganisation of the NHS, after criticising the coailiton's own shake-up . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'The public will rightly be concerned that, despite their promises, Labour plan a massive restructuring of the NHS which takes power away from the doctors and nurses who know their patients best and puts it in the hands of local politicians. 'I welcome the fact that Labour have finally recognised the importance of integrated care, but they had 13 years to achieve this and failed to do so. In fact, the system they left was fragmented and focused on treating patients as a collection of conditions not as individuals. 'In the last two years we have put patients at the heart of the NHS by allowing GPs, who understand the sometimes complex conditions of their patients, to commission services to meet their personal needs.'Chris Ham, chief executive of The King's Fund think tank, said: 'The demands of an ageing population, changing burden of disease and rising patient expectations mean that fundamental change is needed.' He said Mr Burnham's plans were 'ambitious' but leaves 'a number of unanswered questions'","Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham warns nurses are not able to deal with growing numbers of elderly patients .

Its decadent surroundings hosted numerous Hollywood legends as they laid eyes on the big screen for the very first time. But having sat desolate for more than 30 years - the crumbling Loew's Kings Theatre in New York is finally being brought back to life. The 3,200-seater turned its lights out in 1977, having first opened to the public in 1929. Regeneration: Loew's Kings Theatre in Brooklyn is to be redeveloped in a $93 million project after lying dormant for 35 years . Decadent: The original interior of the French Renaissance-style theatre that was closed in 1977 . Since its closure, the once-bustling theatre slipped into a state of dilapidation and decay, but a $93 million regeneration project was announced on Wednesday. New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said that the regeneration would create 50 permanent jobs and 500 construction jobs. Mr Bloomberg said that the theatre will be 'the Radio City Music Hall of Brooklyn'. Hollywood legend Barbara Streisand once worked as an usherette at the French Renaissance-style theatre, vowing that her name would appear in lights above its door. Sylvester Stallone held a similar position, while Bob Hope appeared before the Loews Kings's adoring crowd. Streisand told an audience in 1995: 'I went to the movies long before I ever went to the theatre. I’d go to the Loew’s Kings in Flatbush every Saturday. Dilapidated: The theatre has become seriously dilapidated since its closure but work will begin next week with the removal of asbestos and repairs to the roof . Announcement: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg broke the ground of the redevelopment, which will be carried out by Texas-based Ace Theatrical Group, on Wednesday . Jobs: Mayor Bloomberg said the project, due to finish in 2015, will secure 50 permanent jobs when completed and also entail 500 construction jobs . She said that she went 'to escape into a world of fantasy - and also because they had the greatest Mellowrolls'. Construction work will begin within the next week, starting with repairs to the roof and the removal of asbestos. Texas-based Ace Theatrical Group is taking on the project, which has been backed by the city's Economic Development Corp. The redevelopment will include a huge staircase, rose-coloured marble and wood-panelled walls. Seven chandeliers will dazzle visitors as they enter the lobby, while paintings on the original domed 70-foot roof will be restored. Restoration: The theatre will undergo an extensive refurbishment, including a restoration of its painted 70-ft roof . A four-story stagehouse will also be built at the back of the theater, facilitating the staging of more expansive theatre productions. Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz was also a key player in the redevelopment. Mr Markowitz said that Brooklyn was getting back an 'historic jewel'. He described the project as a 'dream come true', perhaps swayed by sentimentality, given that he went on his first date there. 'It’s gonna be a movie place on steroids, theater, music, dance, cultural activities,' said Ace’s David Anderson. It is hoped the theatre will open in early 2015, hosting more than 200 concerts, performances, and musicals every year. The movie palace was sold in 1979 and later taken over by the City of New York.","Loew's Kings Theatre in Brooklyn to reopen after $93 redevelopment .

Duncan Millar stole £58,000 from the surgery where he worked because he felt he was underpaid . A practice manager who got into debt after the failure of his 23-year marriage stole £58,000 from an NHS doctor's surgery where he worked. Former RAF serviceman Duncan Millar struggled after his parents died within one month of each other in 2006 and he got divorced, Sheffield Crown Court heard. He tried to make a fresh start by becoming practice manager at Doctor Dilip Chatterjee's surgery in Shiregreen, Sheffield, and moved to a £179,000 house with his second wife. But the father-of-two thought his salary was 'insufficient' and started taking money intended for patients by writing out cheques to himself. Jim Baird, defending, said the couple's mortgage was £147,000 and his new wife, who worked as a nurse at the same surgery, paid . the £30,000 deposit because Millar's divorce had left him with nothing. They had repayments of £1,200 a month . and Millar took out a £30,000 personal loan and ran up credit card debts of £5,000 to make ends meet. Millar, who celebrated his 59th birthday yesterday, started taking small amounts from the surgery's funds in August 2009 and then it became regular almost on a weekly basis until March, 2012. He went to cheque shops in Firth Park, . Chapeltown and even Rotherham to obtain cash and would spend it . immediately on household expenses rather than banking the proceeds. 'The final amount is something which completely amazes and shocks him,' said Mr Baird. Millar, from High Green, Sheffield admitted fraud of just over £58,000. Laura Marshall, prosecuting, said when . arrested in June last year Millar told police he had been writing . cheques to himself from the surgery's funds supplied by the local . Primary Care Trust and cashing them for two years. Millar ran up debts and stole from Dr Dilip Chatterjee's surgery in Shiregreen, Sheffield to make ends meet . Only the practice manage or the doctor had access to the account. He said Dr Chatterjee was often away in India and would leave him blank cheques to make out or he would forge the doctor's signature. He could not tell police why he did it other than he had large debts and when he ran short he would just write out cheques. Mr Baird said Millar had lost his reputation and exemplary good character and immediately admitted his crime when challenged. He . joined the RAF at 17 and was a non-commissioned officer for 23 years . serving in Germany and leaving with a long service and good conduct . medal. He later helped veterans of the Bosnia and Gulf War conflicts. Dr Chatterjee often travelled to India and left blank cheques which Millar wrote out to himself . After . leaving the RAF he retrained within the NHS and became a practice . manager handling a budget of £1.5million without any problems at . another surgery before moving to Sheffield. 'But the last six years have taken their toll and he's a broken man and a mere shadow of the man he was,' said Mr Baird. He did not lead an expensive lifestyle . and still had large debts. His wife, who was the practice nurse, was on . long term sick leave for much of the period. He was spared jail after Judge Rosalind . Coe told him: 'Whether or not you felt you were being paid enough simply . taking money from the public was criminal behaviour.' Judge Rosalind Coe said Millar had fulfilled a 'long and commendable service' for his country but it had ended unhappily 'not just for you and your family but this is public money you defrauded intended for the care of patients.' She added that he had breached the trust placed in him, offended repeatedly and stolen public money but she weighed that against his previous good character, personal circumstances and his early guilty plea. Millar was given an 18-month jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work and made the subject of an extended curfew.","Duncan Millar stole money intended for patients' treatments for two years .

A Wyoming community college has been hit by a tragic murder-suicide after a man killed a teacher then himself in front of students in the classroom using some sort of 'bow-and-arrow-type' weapon. The killer had previously murdered a woman in the street about two miles away before storming into a science building on the campus of Casper College. The classroom killing prompted a college-wide lockdown as police attempted to ensure that it did not spiral into yet another campus massacre. Scroll down for video . On Duty: Police officers responded in full tactical gear to the campus attack at Casper College. No Suspects: Police say they no longer have any suspects, suggesting that the attacker may have been one of the three dead. Casper Police Chief Chris Walsh said . the murder-suicide took place in a classroom with students present, but . he didn't know how many students or what the class topic was. He said investigators were still trying to determine a motive. Walsh said an 'edged weapon' was used . it at least one of the killings, but he did not offer specifics and it . was unclear if the same or a similar weapon was used in all of the . deaths. The attacker was not believed to be a . Casper College student and it appeared he knew the victims, Walsh said. No names were released. Lockdown: Casper College was put on lockdown after apparent bow and arrow attack that left three people dead. 'We're locating next of kin and working on notification absolutely as fast as we can,' Walsh said. He added authorities did not believe there was any further threat to the community. 'I want to emphasize that this is a . horrible tragedy,' Walsh said. 'And I want the city to... just feel safe . right now. There is no one at large.' The attack at the two-year community . college in Casper occurred just before 9am in a classroom on the science . building's third floor. All students and staff were evacuated from the . building. The college sent out a campus-wide . alert via text message and email within two minutes of receiving word of . the attack at 9.06am, school spokesman Rich Fujita said. The lockdown . ended at about 11am after school officials received word that police . were no longer searching for a suspect. There are fewer classes on Fridays . than any other day of the week at Casper College, so only between 1,500 . and 2,000 of the college's 5,000 students were there, Fujita added. Tragedy: Students and staff listen to a new conference discussing the apparent murder-suicide on their campus. Political science instructor Chris . Henrichsen said he was showing the film Frost/Nixon to his government . class when he stepped into the hall to get something for a student and . was told a homicide had occurred on campus. He went back to his classroom, where students were getting messages about the campus lockdown on their phones. 'We locked the door and waited for further instruction,' Henrichsen said. The students were later sent home, . but some who parked near a different campus building where the attack . occurred had to leave their cars there, Henrichsen said. About two miles away, Dave Larsen . said he was headed to the gym when he drove past a body in a gutter with . two people standing over it, one talking on a cellphone. Larsen lives about a block from the location of the body, a well-kept neighborhood of mostly single-story houses. Emergency vehicles had the street blocked off on Friday afternoon. Scene: The horrific murder-suicide took place in the science building of the community college . Walsh said 33 law enforcement . officers from different agencies responded to the college after . receiving reports of the attack. He said authorities first thought it . might have been an 'active-shooter-type situation.' 'We quickly contained the building and started a sweep through the building,' he said. Walsh said that within minutes of the . initial call, there was another report of a traumatic injury about two . miles southwest of campus. That victim was found in the street, the . Star-Tribune reported. Classes were canceled for the rest of the day at the school, one of seven community colleges in Wyoming. A meeting was held in the afternoon . for the 150 teachers and students who remained. College president Walt . Nolte addressed them, calling it the worst day of his more than 40 years . in higher education and encouraging the community to come together. 'It is particularly painful because of our size,' Fujita said of the small, tight-knit campus. Counselors were speaking to students and planned to be available through the weekend. About 450 students live on campus. Classes are due to resume on Monday. 'We agreed it doesn't do any good to . just set the students loose. It makes the most sense to have them come . back to campus, where they can get help if they need help and come to . terms with what happened,' Fujita said. Investigation: Police were concerned there could be a gunman at large on the campus or in the town . Walsh said police train for such incidents but had no warning of Friday's violence. Wyoming governor Matt Mead, who went . to the campus on Friday evening, said it was too early to assess . security precautions at the college. 'There's no sense in doing that now until we understand fully what has taken place,' he said. The governor added that the focus now . 'should be on the victims' family, the community college family, the . president, the trustees and the students, and making sure we're . attending to any of their needs.' Casper College opened in 1945 as the . state's first junior college and moved to its current site 10 years . later. The campus consists of 28 buildings on more than 200 acres. The . college provides more than 140 academic-transfer, technical and career . programs. Casper is Wyoming's second-largest . city with a population of about 56,000. Wyoming residents refer to it as . the 'Oil City' because it's a hub for the state's oil industry.

Deer tend to give birth and then leave the fawn in the . undergrowth and return to feed it. 'We always say that if you find a fawn . on its own then that's normal. But this chap rang the RSPCA to say he . had a deer in his garden and he was worried about it and had put a . blanket on it.' 'We told him to remove the blanket, then he rang back and said he was still concerned and sent a photo which showed it had actually collapsed. 'The little deer was in trouble and so we are assuming that his mother had just given birth because he is relatively newborn. It was a bit of a shock to the system to be dropped like that into the snow. 'He just wasn't strong enough to follow his mum into safety and now he's been handled there's no way she would take him back. 'Snowflake's not strong enough to stand up yet - he only weighs a kilo and is smaller than a cat. 'But he's doing well and is being bottle-fed with a milk formula now and should be fine.'

President Barack Obama managed to provoke the ire of Republicans before he even unveiled his  immigration reform plan this afternoon . The president is refusing to tie tougher border enforcement to his proposal that would allow 11million illegal immigrants to become American citizens. Obama, who campaigned on giving undocumented immigrants 'a pathway to citizenship,' laid out his plan this afternoon, claiming it is similar to the one proposed on Monday by a bipartisan group in the U.S. Senate. His proposal includes stepped up enforcement - like a new program to that would help businesses verify the immigration status of applicants before hiring them. The lynchpin, though, is a provision that would give illegal immigrants legal status if they register with the government, pay a fine and back taxes and learn English. Scroll down for video . Three points: President Barack Obama's speech at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, laid out stepped up enforcement measures, a pathway to citizenship and loosening restrictions on legal immigration . Push: Obama said he would do everything in his power to make Congress act quickly on immigration reform . The president said Congress must also act to make legal immigration easier for highly-educated and highly-skilled foreigners who want to settle in the United States. 'We need congress to act on the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now,' he said. Later he added: 'Remember that this is not just a debate about policy, it’s about people. It’s about men, women,' the president said. 'They want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story.' The battle-hardened Obama, anticipating a fight with House Republicans, said that if lawmakers did not act quickly, he would introduce his plan to Congress and demand an 'up or down' vote on it. 'The foundation for bipartisan action is already in place,' he said. The president said that a bipartisan coalition of senators, including Tea Party conservatives Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona, as well as Democrats Chuck Schumer of New York and Dick Durbin of Illinois, had agreed on a package similar to his own. Standing tough: Florida Senator Marco Rubio said he would not support any immigration reform package that doesn't require enforcement mechanisms before allowing illegal immigrants to become citizens . President Barack Obama's plan to reform immigration relies on three tenants - stepped up enforcement, a 'pathway to citizenship' and making it legal immigration more accessible for highly-skilled workers. Here are excerpts from Obama's proposal. Enforcement: . Citizenship: . Legal immigration reform: . Both packages include increased border enforcement and a system that will force businesses to determine whether they are hiring legal residents. Both include a 'pathway to citizenship' that forces immigrants to pay back taxes, a fine and 'go to the back of the line' behind legal immigrants before they can become American citizens. Obama's plan also includes provisions to allow higher numbers of highly-skilled legal immigrants to move to the country if they study at American universities or plan to start businesses in the United States. A second group of U.S. Senators has proposed similar measures. However, Rubio told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh on Tuesday that he would not back a pathway to citizenship like the one Obama described without tougher border enforcement mechanisms in place. 'If there is not language in this bill that guarantees nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place, I won't support it,' Rubio told Limbaugh in a direct appeal to his base. Under the Senate agreement, a group of border-state law enforcement officials and policymakers will have to certify that border security has been tightened. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security must develop a better exit control system to track foreign visitors and ensure the country knows which ones have overstayed their temporary visas. Rubio said he would refuse to support any bill those does not include those 'triggers.' 'I think that would be a terrible mistake,' he told Fox News. 'We have a bipartisan group of senators that have agreed to that. For the president to try to move the goalposts on that specific requirement, as an example, does not bode well in terms of what his role's going to be in this or the outcome.' Support from Rubio, a rising star in the Republican party and a late signatory to the Senate deal, is seen as one of the keys to convincing conservatives in the U.S. House to pass the legislation. Despite possible obstacles to come, the broad agreement between the White House and bipartisan lawmakers in the Senate represents a drastic shift in Washington's willingness to tackle immigration, an issue that has languished for years. Much of that shift is politically motivated, due to the growing influence of Hispanics in presidential and other elections and their overwhelming support for Obama in November. Another key difference between the White House and Senate proposals is the administration's plan to allow same-sex partners to seek visas under the same rules that govern other family immigration. The Senate principles do not recognize same-sex partners, though Democratic lawmakers have told gay rights groups that they could seek to include that in a final bill. John McCain of Arizona, who is among the eight in the Senate immigration group, called the issue a 'red flag' in an interview Tuesday on 'CBS This Morning.' Washington last took up immigration changes in a serious way in 2007, when then-President George W. Bush pressed for an overhaul. The initial efforts had bipartisan support but eventually collapsed in the Senate because of a lack of GOP support. Cognizant of that failed effort, the White House has readied its own immigration legislation. But officials said Obama will send it to the Hill only if the Senate process stalls.","Senator Marco Rubio, a conservative Republican who is behind an immigration proposal in the Senate, said he would not vote for a bill that doesn't put enforcement first .

Missed: Jimmy Savile could have been prosecuted in 2009 but police and prosecutors were too cautious, a report has found . A chance to convict Jimmy Savile for sex offences when he was alive was missed because police and prosecutors did not take victims seriously enough, an official report said today. Details of a review of the decision not to prosecute Savile in 2009 by . Alison Levitt QC, legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions, were disclosed today. Her report was released in tandem with an official police probe into the DJ's 60 years of abuse that revealed that he raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as young as eight. Since the paedophile DJ died in October 2011 aged 84, a staggering 214 official crimes have been recorded by 28 police forces. In her review Ms Levitt found one alleged victim was told by Sussex police officers that Savile's lawyers would make 'mincemeat' of her in a 'big London court' if she pursued her sex assault claim. In 1970, the Savile fan club member had been groped and forced to touch the DJ's genitals after he invited her into his camper van after she went to watch Top Of The Pops at BBC Television Centre. After going to the police in 2008, the woman, known as Ms A, was told by investigating officers that 'she would be publicly branded a liar and that her name would be all over the newspapers, particularly if she lost the case', the report says. Deputy Chief Constable Giles York from Sussex Police said today: 'We recognise that we could have done better and are committed to honest reflection and learning lessons for the future.' A statement from Sussex Police went on: 'We understand the conclusion the DPP has drawn, that our officers may have inadvertently dissuaded the victim from supporting any prosecution. It can be difficult in such circumstances to achieve the balance between supporting and reassuring a victim, whilst providing honest advice about the prosecution process and standard of evidence needed.' This 'dissuaded her from pursuing her allegation', she concluded. Three offences were also being investigated in 2008 by Surrey Police but they were not continued either. Ms Levitt said that there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in their stories, or that they were unreliable, yet police and prosecutors treated their claims 'with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required', she said. Attack: One victim was told by police that if she pursued her claim Savile's lawyers would make 'mincemeat' of her in court . Surrey Police received an allegation in May 2007 that Savile had sexually assaulted a teenage girl at Duncroft Children's Home in the late 1970s. In the investigation that followed, two more allegations emerged - the first that in about 1973 Jimmy Savile had sexually assaulted a girl aged about 14 outside Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The second was that in the 1970s Jimmy Savile had suggested to a girl aged about 17, again at Duncroft, that she perform oral sex on him. Pledge: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said today the way sexual abuse is investigated will be changed . In March 2008, Sussex Police received a complaint that Savile had sexually assaulted a woman in her early twenties in a caravan in Sussex in about 1970. Surrey Police consulted with the CPS about all four allegations, and in October 2009 it was decided that no prosecution could be brought because the alleged victims would not support police action. Ms Levitt found that Surrey Police did not tell each alleged victim that other complaints had been made, Sussex told the complainant that corroboration was needed and the prosecutor did not question why victims would not support court action or seek to build a case. The victims told Ms Levitt that if they had known that other people were making complaints, they probably would have been prepared to give evidence in court. Meanwhile her review showed how Savile had simply said that the accusations were just 'invented' and an 'occupational hazard' for anyone famous like him. He also said he had a 'policy' to sue anyone who printed these accusations, having taken legal action against five papers previously. 'If this does not disappear then my policy will swing into action', he told Surrey officers, the report says. Surrey Police assistant chief constable Jerry Kirkby said: 'It is important the actions taken by the investigation team are viewed in context. This should take into account what information was known about Jimmy Savile in 2007 and the necessary consideration given by police to the impact of their actions on securing successful court action against him. 'At the time, there was nothing to suggest the level of offending now being reported on a national scale. In July 2007, Surrey Police used national systems to conduct intelligence checks with every other police force in England and Wales. These checks found no record of any police intelligence or prior allegations relating to Jimmy Savile.' DPP Keir Starmer said he wanted the case to be 'a watershed moment'. 'In my view, these cases do not simply reflect errors of judgment by individual officers or prosecutors on the facts before them,' he said. 'If that were the case, they would, in many respects, be easier to deal with. These were errors of judgment by experienced and committed police officers and a prosecuting lawyer acting in good faith and attempting to apply the correct principles. That makes the findings of Ms Levitt's report more profound and calls for a more robust response.' 'Hazard': Savile, who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in his camper van, had told police that the allegations aimed at him was just because he was famous and were malicious . He drew parallels with a damning report on the investigation of a grooming gang in Rochdale. Mr Starmer said police and prosecutors have approached sex offence allegations 'with a degree of caution which is not generally justified'. He said guidance will be drawn up on prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases to underline that 'the credibility of the complainant's account has to be seen in its proper context'. An agreement has been drawn up with the Association of Chief Police Officers that: . Mr Starmer also said that information on cases where a complaint has been made but a prosecution cannot be brought will be shared more fully with police and other relevant agencies. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Official report finds police and CPS treated Savile prosecutions 'with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required'

A 98-year-old widow with dementia was dragged from her bed by burglars who ripped the wedding ring from her finger. Sarah Isaac slept with her handbag under her pillow after two previous raids on her home of 60 years in Kidbrooke, south east London. The attackers ransacked the room, stealing her handbag, purse, house keys and pension money. They took other rings from Mrs Isaac's fingers including her dead husband's wedding band. The intruders broke into her home and threw her onto her bedroom floor - leaving a wound on her arm - before looting her room while she watched helplessly on January 12. Granddaughter Kate Henderson, 37, said: 'She was very distressed. 'My understanding is about three men gained access to her house through her back door, smashed a glass panel, went up to her bedroom, dragged her out of bed onto the floor, dragged the rings from her fingers, her bracelet, and left her lying there on the floor while they ransacked her room. 'She had to be taken to hospital - she had a gash in her arm where they had manhandled her off the bed.' Former school dinner lady Mrs Isaac, nicknamed 'Cis' by her seven younger siblings, is now terrified of another attack and is staying with family.

Map shows proposed SpaceLiner journey routes. London to New York would take approximately one hour . A journey between Europe and the U.S. would be reduced to just over 60 minutes, providing passengers are happy to pay space travel prices, estimated to be in the region of several hundred thousand dollars per ticket. Should it take off in both sense of the word, there is no reason why a fleet of SpaceLiners couldn't make up to 15 flights a day, believes Sippel. 'Maybe we can best characterise the SpaceLiner by saying it's a kind of . second-generation space shuttle, but with a completely different task,' Sippel told TechNewsDaily. The SpaceLiner would take approximately eight minutes to climb to an altitude of some 50 miles where it reach the earth's upper atmosphere before gliding back to Earth at hypersonic speeds of more than 15,000mph. SpaceLiner engineers hope to use a liquid oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel, leaving water vapour as waste. Engineers predict that advances in materials could be combined with new cooling technologies and heat shielding to safeguard the SpaceLiner's structures against the intense heat of hypersonic flight.

Once the SpaceLiner detaches from the rocket, the plan would be for an aircraft to fly . out and latch on to the rocket mid-air before towing it towards an . airfield where it could glide in to land . One of the stumbling blocks experienced by the design team is the exact shape of the SpaceLiner. Its shape has to tolerate the extreme heat created by gliding at such high speeds through the Earth's upper atmosphere .

Lin Homer, chief executive of HMRC, admitted the target is to answer 80 per cent of calls in five minutes . A private phone company is making hundreds of thousands of pounds in profit from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs premium rate helplines. HMRC chief Lin Homer told a committee of MPs that Cable and Wireless has made 'less than £1million' from the 0845 number. Yet, she said keeping millions of customers on hold for five minutes before they can speak to a tax official is 'acceptable' and admitted the target is to answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes. As HMRC receives 80million telephone calls each year, this means 16million callers will be kept waiting for longer than this. Miss Homer said HMRC research showed customers believed such a wait was acceptable. She told MPs: ‘If we can answer 90 per cent of the calls, which we have been doing for the last quarter, then we think people will wait up to five minutes.’ Giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, Miss Homer said: ‘We think real people start counting the call from when they pick up the phone so we are going to measure that and we reckon that will mean that we will be achieving a call of about five minutes to six minutes.’ But MPs said a similar target in the private sector is to answer calls within 20 seconds. And Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the chairman of the committee, criticised HMRC for its ‘lack of ambition’, describing the target as ‘a disappointment’. Miss Homer’s admission emerged after a damning report by the spending watchdog last month said taxpayers spent more than £30million last year waiting to speak to HMRC. A million letters from taxpayers lay unopened for weeks last year after a huge backlog of mail built up at HMRC offices up and down the country, boss Lin Homer admitted. During questioning by MPs, she said: ‘We had one million pieces of post dotted about the organisation. Once you get to that [position], you are getting the chaser letter before you have unpacked the [original] letter.’ She insisted its backlog of post has improved, saying it had dropped to fewer than 100,0000 by Christmas. The report, by the National Audit Office, said the treatment of customers – many of whom waste hours trying to get through - was ‘unacceptable’. Mrs Homer said HMRC did not take profits from the helplines, that can cost up to 41p a minute, but said they do receive some 'additional services' from Cable and Wireless, according The Telegraph. She refused to disclose how much the telecoms company makes in profit on the calls, telling MPs the information was commercially sensitive. She said the company was moving to cheaper 03 numbers this year and said profits should therefore fall. Last year, the average waiting time more than doubled from 107 seconds to 282 seconds, and the NAO said that between April and September, nearly 6.5million people waited longer than ten minutes, excluding the time spent listening to the automated greeting. The new five-minute target will include the time spent listening to the automated greeting. HMRC has, however, revealed plans to scrap all its 0845 numbers – which cost up to 41p per minute from a mobile phone – by the end of the summer. Ruth Owen, director general of personal tax at HMRC, said it will switch to telephone numbers which begin 03, which cost the same as calling an 01 or 02 number. Mrs Hodge said HMRC’s use of 0845 numbers was unacceptable. HMRC does not receive a share of the money from 0845 numbers, which goes to telecoms giant Cable and Wireless.","Company makes 'less than £1million' profit from premium 0845 numbers .

Commander Chris Hadfield, 53, has posted hundreds of breathtaking images on his Twitter account since joining the crew as part of Expedition 34 just a few weeks ago. As well as San Francisco's famous landmark, Commander Hadfield - who has described the shifting view of the earth from windows of the space station as 'a perpetual magnet' - has snapped the bright lights of Manhattan at night, the 'endless' golden beaches of Australia, a vivid blue river snaking through Brazilian farmland, and 'cauliflower' clouds sitting over the Amazon rainforest. Out of this world: The Golden Gate Bridge is visible from space in this incredible shot of San Francisco Bay taken by astronaut Chris Hadfield . Commander Hadfield joined the International Space Station on December 21 at the start of a five month spell on board the satellite in low earth orbit. In March the flight engineer will become the first Canadian to take control of the giant orbiting laboratory. The prolific snapper told his some 280,000 Twitter followers the view from his new office was simply 'too wondrous to ignore', and has shared shot after shot of desert landscapes, sprawling cities, African lakes and Caribbean islands. Commander Hadfield has also uploaded views of flood-hit Queensland, Australia, and the United States from east to west, as well as an image of the glowing lights of Quebec city in his native Canada.

The £522 dress, a silk wrap design by Brazilian designer Daniella Helayel, was subsequently reproduced in the same sapphire shade and went on to sell out again and again on net-a-porter and in Harvey Nichols. And now, the dress has been offered up to a whole new market - an entirely appropriate one too, given Kate's pregnancy - as maternity fashion website Blossom Mother . & Child unveils a version of Kate's engagement dress tailored . especially for pregnant women. Trendsetter: Kate chose to wear a blue Issa wrap dress on the event of her engagement announcement in 2010 - and the style was reissued and went on to sell thousands . Adaptable: Blossom Mother & Child is selling a maternity version of the Issa dress for £522 - and the dress has plenty of space to accommodate a growing bump . The wrap dress, retailing for £522 on blossommotherandchild.com, is an almost identical take on the original blue Issa dress, only the cut allows for a blossoming bump. The dress sits alongside a number of similar sapphire blue dresses on Blossom, as well as other maternity fashion sites such as Babes With Babies and Peaks Of London, proving that the Duchess's fashion influence has touched the world of maternity style too. The dress, a plunging V-necked style with soft wrap ties, is a classic Issa shape, emblematic of the brand's easy aesthetic. Maternity chic: The site is selling the Kate dress alongside other Issa styles that are suitable to be worn by pregnant women . Every season Daniella Helayel puts out new takes on this favourite shape and fans of the brand - which include both Kate and her sister Pippa - have an almost insatiable appetite for the style. Whether a special maternity shape or not, Issa's dresses - maternity or otherwise - have long been worn by pregnant women - and are stretchy and comfortable enough to be worn right up to term. The ties can be comfortably fixed above the bump, and the fabric is light and cool. And the best part? Unlike traditional maternity clothes that cannot be worn once the baby arrives, an Issa dress will become a wardrobe classic. That's £522 well spent.","Blue wrap dress is for sale on blossommotherandchild.com for £522 .

District Judge Tim Devas  passed the £1 coin to a surprised court clerk to clear the penniless defendant’s debt. Then, after condemning rules that require courts to impose compensation orders on criminals irrespective of their financial circumstances, he joked: ‘My chances of getting a knighthood are pretty slim anyway.’ Judge Devas was presiding over the case of a homeless thief who stole two letters from the Christmas post in a hunt for cash. Daniel Northridge, 20, was of ‘limited means’ and had no meaningful family support, the court heard. ‘The sooner the Government changes it [the compensation rule] the better,’ he said, handing over the £1 coin at Mansfield Magistrates’ Court. The judge, who has a history of making outspoken comments in court, then asked: ‘There’s no one here from the Press is there?’ It was when he learned there was a reporter from the local paper in court that he joked about a knighthood. Yesterday he was criticised by a crime victims’ organisation for ordering such a low and ‘insensitive’ sum.

Zara and rugby star husband Mike Tindall sold their white stucco marital home earlier this month in order to live on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park estate near Minchinhampton, Glos. The couple's £1.2 million house in Cheltenham had been quietly on the market for 'some time' before it was snapped up by Shaun Wills, finance director of clothing company Superdry. The Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips has packed up her belongings to begin the task of moving home to mummy Princess Anne . And today the royal pair were spotted loading their possessions, packed in numerous brown boxes, into removal vans to make the 20 mile trip south to their new home. Items including plastic wrapped chairs, a wide-screen Apple Mac computer, wicker baskets and a mattress were carefully carried out of the house throughout the day and loaded on to the blue lorries. An eyewitness, who saw Zara briefly return to house to 'check everything was in order', said she looked slightly stressed during the process. He said: 'For most of the day it was just the removal men on their own, but then later in the evening Zara came back to check everything was in order and being dealt with properly.

Accident: Lucy Sallis died in L'Alpe d'Huez after climbing over a six foot fence to get to an outdoor pool. She was a trainee chef at the resort . A British teenager drowned in a swimming pool yesterday after a night out with friends in the French ski resort where she worked. Lucy Sallis, 19, and a male friend she had been drinking with climbed over a 6ft fence to get to the outdoor pool in Alpe d’Huez. Police say the trainee chef, who was working at the Hotel Belle Aurore, stripped off before diving or jumping into the pool in the early hours. It is believed she became trapped under a tarpaulin that was partly covering the municipal pool. When her friend realised Lucy, from Bognor Regis, West Sussex, had not resurfaced he frantically tried to pull the tarpaulin away and found her unconscious. A rescue team tried to revive Lucy but she died at the scene. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out today. A local police spokesman said: ‘It was late at night and the young girl and a boyfriend decided they wanted to take a swim. The pool was closed so they climbed the wall. There are two swimming pools, both of which are covered at night. The girl jumped into the smaller pool. ‘The boy went looking around. Then when he went to the pool he found the girl’s lifeless body.’ French police spoke through interpreters to the friend and others who had been with them earlier. A local police source said: ‘The group had been drinking, but probably not to excess. ‘The incident is being investigated. An accident is the main line of inquiry.’ Lucy’s mother Karen was too upset to speak at her home last night. Lucy, who was educated at Chichester College, and her friend worked for the British-based company SkiBound, and are thought to have been based in separate hotels. A keen snowboarder, she is believed to have been in the resort since November. Scene of tragedy: The 19-year-old drowned after jumping into this outdoor swimming pool at the Alpe d'Huez resort in France during a drinking session with friends . Covering: The apprentice chef stripped off and dived into the water despite the fact that it was covered by a protective sheet, although only partially . She had worked in a kitchen in the UK and had met leading chef Marco Pierre White. The traditional Alpine-style hotel where she worked is predominantly used for school trips. One bar server said: ‘It’s such a terrible thing to happen. She’s a lovely girl with a great spirit.’ Fabrice Hurth, director of the tourist office, said: ‘We don’t know all the details but we believe she climbed over the fence and jumped in the pool. ‘It probably was just a silly, bad joke that young people do. But it ended so tragically. ‘The pool has been closed today and it will remain closed until the police say it can be reopened.’ SkiBound said: ‘The thoughts and condolences of all at SkiBound are with the family and friends. ‘All our efforts are focused on ensuring they are supported in any way possible through this very difficult time.’ Alpe d’Huez, 300 miles south-east of Paris, is one of the oldest ski resorts in France and one of its most popular, with more than 155 miles of pistes. The resort, known as ‘L’Ile au Soleil’ – the Island of the Sun – because most of its slopes face south, attracts thousands of British skiers each year as well as students working during their gap year. Its foreign workers – seasonaires – are overwhelmingly British and just out school. Alpe d’Huez is at the top of one of the main mountain stages in the Tour de France. It is popular with all abilities of skier, from schools and families on its gentle nursery slopes and green runs to expert skiers on its 16 black runs, which include the lung-bursting La Sarenne, at 10 miles Europe’s longest black run.

Suicide bid: Kiss Nightclub co-owner Elissandro 'Kiko' Spohr reportedly tried to take his own life in hospital . The owner of the Brazilian nightclub where 235 died in an horrific fire last weekend has tried to commit suicide in hospital, it has been reported. Elissandro Spohr, 28, was under arrest following the tragic blaze at the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, in the south of the country. He was being held in hospital in the nearby city of Cruz Alta, where he reportedly tried to take his own life but was stopped by officers. Inspector Marcelo Arigony from the . Civil Police in Santa Maria said: 'He is OK and has now been handcuffed . to the bed to avoid further attempts.' Doctors said Spohr was suffering from severe depression which had left him 'emotionally compromised'. Spohr has been the target of abuse . and intense criticism from the friends and relatives of the victims, who are . demanding answers over the fire and calling for tighter controls to be introduced. Spohr was one of four people arrested including two members of the band Gurizada Fandangueira, which had been performing when the fire started. Spohr's business partner and Kiss co-owner Mauro Hoffman later handed himself in to police. The fire is understood to have started during a pyrotechnic display accompanying the band's performance. The Kiss nightclub was not equipped with a fire alarm, sprinkler system or fire escapes. When a band member tried to put out a fire that had been started by pyrotechnics, the extinguisher didn't work. Rodrigo Martins, a guitarist for the . group Gurizada Fandangueira, told Globo TV network in an interview . Monday that the flames broke out minutes after the deployment of a . pyrotechnic machine that fans out colored sparks, at around 2:30 a.m. local time. Business: Spohr, 28, was co-owner of the Kiss nightclub in the city of Santa Maria, in the south of the country . The moment the band Gurizada Fandangueria, famed for their use of on . stage pyrotechnics, let off a flare which is believed to . have started the fire at Kiss Club in Santa Maria . Horrific: A crowd stands outside the Kiss nightclub in the early hours of Saturday morning as the nightmare unfolds . 'I felt that something was falling . from the roof and I looked up and I saw the fire was spreading, and I . shouted ""Look, it's catching on fire, man, it's catching fire,""' Martins . said. 'Then the drummer tried to throw water on it, and it looked like the fire spread more then. Then the security guards came with an extinguisher, tried to use it, but it didn't work. 'I thought I was going to die there. There was nothing I could do, with the fire spreading and people . screaming in front.' Martins said that the club was packed and estimated the crowd at about 1,200-1,300 people. Other estimates had the figure at around 2,000. Relatives of victims of the nightclub fire attend a collective wake at Santa Maria's municipal gymnasium where the bodies were taken yesterday . Aftermath: Marcelo Arigony, Civil Chief of Police of Santa Maria, investigates inside the Kiss nightclub . Up to 2,000 people were believed to have been inside the club when the fire broke out . Revellers claimed bouncers had initially stopped them from fleeing the club concerned that people might not have paid their bar bills. According to state Brazilian safety codes here, clubs should have one fire extinguisher every 1,500 square feet as well as multiple emergency exits. Spohr's business partner and Kiss co-owner Mauro Hoffman handed himself in to police . Limits on the number of people admitted are to be strictly respected. None of that appears to have happened at the Santa Maria nightclub. 'A problem in Brazil is that there is no control of how many people are admitted in a building, said Joao Daniel Nunes, a civil engineer in nearby Porto Alegre. 'They never are clearly stated, and nobody controls how many people enter these night clubs.' Santa Maria's mayor, Jose Fortunati, told Radio Gaucha that dozens of night spots were closed last year for failing to meet norms. 'At that time, we had lots of protest from those who frequented them, but I think that today people understand it better and that at times hard stands must be taken so that steps are taken to not put people's lives at risk,"" Fortunati said. Brazilian police said they detained three people in connection with the blaze, while the newspaper O Globo said on its website that a fourth person had surrendered to police. Police Inspector Ranolfo Vieira Junior said the detentions were part of the ongoing police probe and those detained can be held for up to five days. Spohr can be held by police for five days and was arrested along with his business partner Mauro Hoffmann and two members of the band Gurizada Fandangueira, the band that was performing when the fire started.

A three-year-old girl has been left with permanent bright blue marks in her hair after the dye from a hair bobble leaked and stained it. Scarlett Belfield had been playing outside her home with friends when the tie got wet and the dye ran - leaving unsightly streaks of blue in her long blonde locks. Dismayed mother Charlotte Hollinshead, 22, has tried washing Scarlett’s hair 15 times following the incident last Friday. Turned the 'air blue: Angry mother Charlotte Hollinshead and three-year-old daughter Scarlett Belfield with the hair bobble, left, and the effects of the dye on her hair, right . Offenders: The blue hair ties which ran while Scarlet was playing in the snow . She has tried a variety of ways to clean the dye off - including using washing-up liquid to wash her hair - but they have all failed to work. The mother-of-two asked a hairdresser for advice, who told her the stubborn dye can only be removed by bleaching her daughter’s hair - or chopping it off. Furious Charlotte said she contacted high street discount store B&M Bargains - only for staff to tell her that the hair clips weren’t suitable for blondes. They offered her a refund on the £1.29 bumper pack of hair accessories but refused to apologise or cover the cost of correcting the mistake. Full time mother Charlotte, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, revealed she is now demanding compensation from the store. She said: 'Scarlett had been playing in the snow with her dad when she came back in with blue in her hair. Permanent: A close up of Scarlett Belfield's hair shows the effect of the blue dye . 'The dye had completely run out of the bobble and in to her hair, it’s stained it blue and nothing will make it come out. 'I have tried everything and even contacted a hairdressers’ for advice. 'They said that I’d either have to bleach Scarlett’s hair or cut it. 'There’s no way I’m going to bleach a three-year-old girl’s hair so the only thing is to have it cut. 'It would have to be cut very short to get rid of all the blue, so we might wait a bit which means she’s stuck with it for now. 'I called the store to complain but they were really snotty with me - one woman even said ""what do you want me to do about it?"" 'I couldn’t believe my ears when they told me the bobbles weren’t made for blonde children - how would I have known that? Streaks: Parents and staff at the youngster's nursery school thought that Scarlett's parents had died her hair deliberately . Bright: Mother Charlotte Hollinshead has washed her daughter's hair 15 times since Friday in a bid to get rid of the dye . 'If there’s that big a risk they should put a warning on the label. 'It is absolutely ridiculous that a child of that age should get their hair coloured because of a hair tie.' Scarlett's mother was left embarrassed when parents and teachers at her nursery group even thought Charlotte had put the blue streaks in her hair on purpose. The youngster’s father Nathan Belfield, 22, a bricklayer, added: 'We had just been out in the street enjoying the snow when it happened. 'The dye was very dark blue at first and we are trying to get her hair back to normal. 'We are angry with what the shop said and we don’t want to have to dye a three-year-old’s hair, it’s just not right. 'I have had teachers at school asking me why her hair is a different colour and I’ve had to explain we haven’t done it. 'It is embarrassing to explain and we would like an apology from the shop and more than a refund.” Staff at the Old Hall Street store in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, where the bobble was bought, have refused to comment on Charlotte’s complaint. The firm’s head office were also unavailable for comment today.

Still alive: Will Carter, 15, surveys the damage to his house upon arriving home from school following the storm . The massive storm system caused at least 20 tornadoes throughout six states, ranging from Missouri to Georgia, USA Today said. Most dangerous were powerful wind gusts that in several places were powerful enough to overturn tractor-trailers. Winds were recorded to be as high as 115 mph in parts of Tennessee. There were reports that people were trapped in homes and businesses, and television footage showed large sections of a sprawling manufacturing plant had been destroyed.Interstate 75 was closed in both directions after the storm flipped about 100 cars onto their roofs and tossed them onto the grassy shoulder. At least two tornadoes were confirmed and several more suspected, and conditions remained ripe for more. Since Tuesday, the system had caused damage across a swath from Missouri to Georgia. In recent days, people in the South and Midwest had enjoyed unseasonably balmy temperatures in the 60s and 70s. A system pulling warm weather from the Gulf of Mexico was colliding with a cold front moving in from the west, creating volatility.Police said high winds toppled a tree onto a shed in Nashville, Tenn., where a man had taken shelter, killing him. Jerry Hardin, 64, in Hogan, Tenn. said he was feeling lucky to be 'in one piece.' He and his wife, Norma said they missed being hit by a collapsing ceiling by about three seconds.

Football referee Kevin Friend failed to live up to his name after denying a gambler a £500,000 win. The Premier League official denied the punter the huge windfall after blowing for full time just one second before a crucial goal went in. A man from Oldham, who does not wish to be named, had put a wager on a series of unlikely scores in cup football matches this weekend including Leeds United to beat Tottenham 3-1. Last gasp: Tottenham, in black and grey, take a free kick from the right hand side in a bid for a late equaliser. Goalkeeper Brad Friedel, in green, is even in the penalty box . Defended: A Leeds player manages to head the ball clear and it looks as if Tottenham's chance has gone . Tables turned: A Leeds midfielder feeds the ball to Rodolph Austin who has free run to Tottenham's goal as goalkeeper Brad Friedel can do nothing . Incredibly, all the results had come in except the match at Elland Road which seemed destined to finish agonisingly close at 2-1. But in the dying seconds of injury time, with Spurs 'keeper Brad Friedel up for a corner, Leeds cleared the ball and it was left to midfielder Rodolph Austin to pump it into an empty net from long range. He duly took his shot, but just one second before the ball rolled across the line the referee signalled the end of the match. Open goal: Leeds midfielder Rodolph Austin prepares to fire the ball into an empty net as Tottenham goalkeeper Brad Friedel is behind him . Moments from glory: The ball looks set to go in, but the referee Kevin Friend has already blown for full time . Denied: The ball trickles over the line and would have made the score line 3-1... If only the ref hadn't already blown his whistle . Pleading: Leeds players protest that the goal should stand with referee Kevin Friend but to no avail . Unlucky ticket: The betting slip which shows how agonisingly close the punter was to a perfect set of scores . Leeds midfielder Rodolph Austin, in white, battling with Tottenham midfielder Scott Parker during the match . Leeds players, including Austin, protested vigorously but didn't take their complaints any further having won the tie in any case. Not living up to his name: Referee Kevin Friend blew the whistle just one second before the crucial goal . The accumulator bet, which also included Oldham to beat Liverpool 3-2, Celtic to get knocked out of the cup by St Mirren 3-2 and Brentford's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, would have netted the unlucky gambler £506,562 if the goal had gone in. Not all has been lost however, as he still walked away with £17,055.80 for his 'Lucky 15' bet at Ladbrokes. Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: 'The referee has ruined our punter’s dream. 'Seventeen grand is sweet enough but he was literally one second away from having his life changed forever.' Bookies heralded Sunday’s results as some of the biggest shocks of all time as all three odds-on Premier League favourites failed to win against lower league opposition. The Lucky 15 bet involved 15, 20p bets on four correct score predictions: four singles, six doubles, four trebles and an accumulator. They were Brentford 2 Chelsea 2 at 18/1 , Leeds 3 Tottenham 1 (25/1), Oldham 3 Liverpool 2 (80/1), and St Mirren 3 Celtic 2 (50/1).","Punter had bet on Leeds to win 3-1 at home to Tottenham in FA Cup tie .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . PUBLISHED: . 05:18 EST, 31 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:34 EST, 31 January 2013 . A grandmother died alone after a doctor marked her file with 'do not resuscitate' despite not actually seeing her, an inquest heard. Christine Shinwell, 63, was admitted to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, after falling at her home. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and the on-call consultant was contacted by phone. After a 15-minute conversation with a medical registrar, and without ever seeing Mrs Shinwell, he decided to put the notice on her records, Essex Coroner's Court was told. Her grieving husband, Colin Green, 50, told the coroner that her family was not consulted and the patient was not seen by the doctor. Christine Shinwell, pictured on the day of her wedding to Colin Green, died after doctors marked her file 'do not resuscitate . He told an inquest into her death that Mrs Shinwell had a long history of medical problems but added that she always tried to pull through. Mr Green also said he made it clear he wanted staff at the hospital to do anything they could to keep her alive. He said: 'My wife is a fighter and is a very strong-willed person. Because my wife has got a huge medical file it is easy to give up on her but in every other circumstance she was okay. 'I told them ""my wife is a fighter and we will take everything step-by-step. I would like you to keep us informed"".' Mrs Shinwell, who had diabetes and wore a pacemaker, died on December 4, 2009, nearly two weeks after falling at her home and fracturing her knee. Days before she was due to be released she started having heart problems. Mr Green, pictured with daughter Heidi Coles, told the coroner's court that his wife was a fighter and the family was not consulted about the DNR notice . Dr Anser Qureshi, consultant physician at Broomfield Hospital, was on call on the night Mrs Shinwell died and made the decision to mark her file 'do not resuscitate' without consulting the family. The decision was made at 3am, from home, after a 15-minute phone call with the medical registrar at Broomfield Hospital despite no previous knowledge of her case. Dr Qureshi told the inquest: 'Generally we tend to discuss it with the family and patient. But at this point the patient was critically ill and did not have the capacity to respond. 'She was dying and CPR was going to be futile. Due to her complex medical history the side effects of the CPR would be worse than the benefits. 'I must say that it was an extremely complex case and a very hard decision. I thought it was in the best interest of the patient. We did not deny her other treatment such as antibiotics. 'The patient was so unwell, I firmly believed it would do her harm rather than any benefit.' Independent expert, Dr Clive Lewis, said she was given a 50 per cent chance of surviving for 'one or two years' after being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 1998. He said: 'It was clear Mrs Shinwell was a remarkable survivor as we had been told that her outlook had been bad in 1998. 'To have survived over 10 years is remarkable but we have to note the prognosis at this point was very poor. She was always living on a knife edge.' Pathologist Dr Martin Goddard, who conducted the post-mortem, told the inquest: 'This is a woman who was at the end of her cardiac function. This is a heart that really had nothing left to give.' The two-day inquest heard evidence from a number of heart experts. A pathologist said that Mrs Shinwell's heart 'had nothing left to give' when she died at Broomfield Hospital (pictured) Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray criticised Broomfield Hospital for failing to communicate with the family and failing to provide better care in the hours leading up to Mrs Shinwell's death. She said: 'Clearly communication has been an issue in this case. Two doctors have commented on the matter and I hope that new measures introduced since 2009 will prevent this happening in future. She recorded a narrative verdict. She said: 'The deceased had a long, complex medical history including end-stage cardiac failure. On December 1, 2009 she suffered cardiac problems and despite on-going treatment she died on December 4 of natural causes.' A spokesman for Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust, which runs Broomfield Hospital, said: 'The trust had previously undertaken a thorough investigation into the circumstances of Mrs Shinwell's death, and was confident in the care it had provided. 'Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust always strives to ensure lessons are learnt from any deaths that occur at the hospital and is pleased that a thorough investigation and Inquest has taken place. 'Mrs Shinwell received excellent state-of-the-art care from the NHS, in particular over the last 25 years of her life - including life-prolonging and life-saving treatment. 'The trust is pleased that the independent expert instructed to report by the coroner was also satisfied that the care and treatment provided to Mrs Shinwell was appropriate and to a good standard. 'The independent expert was also at pains to stress that Mrs Shinwell's courageous battle had come to its natural and inevitable end and that there was no treatment that could have been provided by anyone at the trust or indeed by any other healthcare centre that would have altered the outcome. 'The trust wishes Mrs Shinwell's family its deepest sympathy and condolences at this sad time.' Distraught daughter Heidi Coles, 42, from Chelmsford, fought back tears outside the coroners' court as she slammed doctors for not doing enough to keep her mother alive. The mother-of-two said: 'If you're dying then your family should be there with you. We wanted to be by her side but instead she died alone. 'We know my mum had heart trouble, we know she'd had kidney trouble but she was stable. She was strong and she was a fighter - we miss her every day.' Mr Green added: 'We have been fighting this so no other family has to go through losing someone they love in this way.'","Christine Shinwell's husband said family was not consulted over DNR notice .

Worrying: A pensioner was found at home close to death after being left without medication, food, or water for nine days when police closed the care agency looking after her following this raid, pictured . A pensioner was found at home close to death after being left without medication, food, or water for nine days when police closed the care agency looking after her. The unnamed woman, in her 80s, was discovered by a district nurse with a faint pulse and dehydrated. She was also suffering from kidney failure and severe bed sores. The woman was left without the four daily nurse visits she needed after Carefirst 24 was shut down by police and the UK Border Agency officers on Tuesday January 15. The pensioner, from Banstead, Surrey, was eventually discovered in the appalling condition last Thursday and is now in hospital recovering from her ordeal. The Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board, made up of representatives from Surrey County Council (SCC), police, the NHS have launched an urgent inquiry. A close friend of the woman said she could not understand how she came to be left for so long.She was only found by chance when the district nurse popped in to visit her. Ann Penston, from Sutton, a friend of . the woman, said: 'I got a call because she'd been found dehydrated, . with bedsores and in a terrible mess. They barely got a pulse from her - . it was lucky the district nurse was going there for a different reason. 'How . on Earth could this have been allowed to happen? How can they just . close this thing down and not identify the people they were supposed to . be taking care of? 'I don't . know how she survived. She had a glass of water by her bed, I don't . know if she managed to get up and get it but my assumption is that for . she was just lying there waiting for someone to come.' Six people were arrested when police and the UK Border Agency raided Carefirst 24's premises in Cheam, on January 15. Forgotten: The woman was left without the four daily nurse visits she needed after Carefirst 24 was shut down by police and the UK Border Agency officers . The agency was allegedly employing illegal immigrants under former workers' identities. Since then Carefirst 24 has not been operating and Surrey County Council and Sutton Council, who contracted care to the company, were to work with people receiving care from it to make arrangements - but the woman slipped through SCC's net. Sutton Council said alternative arrangements have been made for all its patients who received care from Carefirst 24. Probe: The Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board, made up of representatives from Surrey County Council (SCC), police, the NHS have launched an urgent inquiry. This is the council's headquarters . A Surrey County Council spokesman said: 'We're saddened to hear about this and our thoughts are with the patient, her family and friends at the moment. 'The safety of vulnerable adults is our top priority. We take any concerns raised very seriously and this is being urgently looked at by the Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board.' The Local Government Ombudsman could step in to carry out a review if the investigation is deemed insufficient. Police and the UK Border Agency raided Carefirst 24 in Cheam, and arrested four people at about 10.30am on Tuesday. Two other people were later arrested. Two British women aged 48 and 52, a 52-year-old British man and a 34-year-old Mauritian man - were held on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to facilitate foreign nationals. The suspects are alleged to have employed illegal workers under former workers' identities.Carefirst 24 provides care to elderly and vulnerable people around Surrey and South London and has provided staff to Sutton Council - although the council says it has severed ties with the business.

His foul-mouthed rants provoked the wrath of parents and now it appears have cost him listeners too. But Nick Grimshaw’s loss is a gain for Chris Evans. The latest set of radio audience figures have revealed a drop in listeners for the up-and-coming DJ who replaced Chris Moyles in the morning on Radio 1. While figures have revealed a drop in listeners to Nick Grimshaw, right, the breakfast show hosted by Chris Evans, left, at the same time on Radio 2 has seen a boost . In contrast the breakfast show hosted by Mr Evans at the same time on Radio 2 has seen a boost in figures. And it appears older men turned off by Grimshaw’s immature banter prefer tuning in to Evans. Grimshaw got 6.7million weekly listeners in the quarter up to the end of this month, compared with Evans’s figures of 9.5million. Grimshaw’s show was also beaten by Radio 4’s flagship news service the Today programme, which got an audience of more than seven million. Sources at the BBC suggested they were relieved by Grimshaw’s figures as many had expected a much more dramatic drop, given the following Moyles had acquired fronting the breakfast show. The corporation is desperate to lower the average age of listeners to Radio 1 and is prepared to take a hit on listening figures if it can get more youthful audience. Grimshaw’s figures were down by 43,000 on the previous three-month period, which was mostly fronted by Moyles, and dropped by almost 550,000 on the same time last year. In contrast the audience for Evans’s breakfast show shot up by a million listeners on the previous three-months. His audience of 9.52million was close to the 9.53million record he pulled in during his first three months in the job in 2010. Chris Moyles, pictured, was replaced by Grimshaw as the morning DJ on Radio 1 . Insiders believe many of the older males who quit Radio 1 after Moyles left having been on the station for eight years, have now switched over to Radio 2. Sources at the BBC claimed that Grimshaw had attracted 250,000 brand new 15-24-year-olds to the show. It was added that the overall average of the listener to the station has dropped from 33 to 32-years-of-age. This is the first set of figures which apply solely to the new Radio 1 breakfast show host. The previous quarter’s results included about a month’s worth of Grimshaw’s show. Grimshaw took over from Moyles as the breakfast host in September and has had a rocky transition. He has been pictured out boozing with celebrity friends such as One Direction star Harry Styles and socialiste Pixie Geldof just hours before the early morning radio show. In November he caused uproar with a series of foul-mouthed comments on his Twitter account. Parents set up an online petition claiming he is a poor role model for younger fans. The foul-mouthed rants sparked criticism that his behaviour was inappropriate for someone in his position. Moyles departed from the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show with his lowest audience for six years last year. Ben Cooper, Controller of Radio 1 said: ‘ What a fantastic quarter for Radio 1, I’m delighted with the figures and they have exceeded my expectation for a brand new breakfast show. This has been the biggest schedule change in a generation which has resulted in the station’s audience getting younger.’ Radio 2 and 6 Music controller Bob Shennan said Evans’s show was ‘the lynchpin of the Radio 2 schedule’ and was ‘in great shape’. The Rajar results as they are known also showed that overall radio listening was up. An average of over 47million listeners are now tuning in, compared with 46.7million at the same time last year. Figures also showed just over 42 per cent of adults now say they own a DAB radio set, compared with 40 per cent last year. Once-doomed Radio 6 Music saw its audience rise by almost half a million listeners since the same period last year. The digital channel, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year, was saved from the axe two years ago after furious listeners protested against the BBC’s decision.",Older men turned off by Grimshaw's immature banter tune in to Evans .
