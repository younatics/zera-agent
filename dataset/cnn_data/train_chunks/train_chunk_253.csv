"(EW) -- It's never too early to make movie plans. Especially when you're a studio with a billion-dollar franchise at stake. Twentieth Century Fox, which has only recently cast its new ""Fantastic Four"" and has another ""X-Men"" movie out this summer, has announced release dates for ""Fantastic Four II,"" the next ""Wolverine"" standalone â€” and a mystery third Marvel film. The rebooted ""Fantastic Four,"" with Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, and Miles Teller reportedly aboard, is scheduled for June 19, 2015, but Fox has already penciled in a sequel for July 14, 2017. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine,"" who stars in this May's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" will return in another standalone movie, targeted for March 3, 2017. His last solo effort, 2013â€²s ""The Wolverine,"" grossed $414.8 million globally. 'Fantastic Four' casting: Fox zeroes in on its final 4 . That film's director, James Mangold, is attached to the next sequel as well. (Another ""X-Men"" all-star movie, ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" will open May 27, 2016.) Fox will deliver another Marvel film on July 13, 2018, but the studio hasn't yet announced which superhero will be suiting up. Since Fox owns only ""X-Men"" and ""Fantastic Four,"" there's speculation that the film could be either a crossover or another standalone for a main character from one of those franchises. In other Fox release-date news, Matthew Vaughn's ""The Secret Service"" has been bumped up from March 6, 2015 to October 24 of this year, swapping dates with an untitled Vince Vaughn movie. 'X-Men: Apocalypse': Bryan Singer teases new film 'will address mutant origins' Daniel Radcliffe's ""Frankenstein"" is moving from January 16, 2015, to October 2, 2015. Liam Neeson's ""Taken 3"" will open January 9, 2016 -- right in the heart of Neeson Season! Fox is also counting on a still-unspecified Ridley Scott movie for a March 4, 2016 release date. Studios like to stake out prime release-date real estate years in advance for their biggest blockbusters, to best protect their properties and theoretically maximize the industry's box-office by preventing costly head-to-head showdowns. It doesn't always work: ""Captain America 3"" is currently on a collision course with ""Batman Vs. Superman"" on May 6, 2016. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Defiant FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told one of Europe's top political organizations not to interfere in the world football body's affairs after it called for a probe into his 2011 re-election. The Council of Europe, a watchdog that oversees the European Court of Human Rights, had insisted on an internal investigation to determine whether Blatter had exploited his position during last year's election campaign. His only opponent, former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed bin Hamman, pulled out of the ballot before a FIFA investigation found him guilty of bribing Caribbean officials three weeks before the June 1 vote. The Qatari, who was also a top FIFA official, was subsequently banned from football. ""The so-called European Council, they should take up problems they have in Europe not the problems they create in FIFA,"" Blatter told reporters on Friday in Nepal, where he is attending the AFC Challenge Cup tournament. Goal-line technology enters final testing . Blatter's offer of an extra $1 million in funding to the CONCACAF federation in the run-up to the election was also questioned by the council. The federation covers Central and North America, plus the Caribbean. ""I don't understand why a political organization, in Europe or somewhere in the world, they have the right to ask FIFA to enter into any activity -- especially in the election,"" said Blatter, who has been FIFA president since 1998. ""Nobody from the football family has any concerns about the election. We need, naturally, also the acceptance of the political authorities -- but we don't like political authorities interfering in our internal affairs."" FIFA is fiercely independent, and suspends any of its 208 member associations if governments interfere in their operations. Blatter, who turns 76 on Saturday, also said it was strange that the opposition to FIFA came only from Europe but not from Asia, Africa or South America. The first results of FIFA's ongoing reform process -- triggered by corruption scandals ahead of the December 2010 vote for naming hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups -- will be made public at the end of March, he said. Meanwhile, Brazil has accepted FIFA's apology after secretary general Jerome Valcke told journalists the country needed a ""kick up the backside"" to be ready in time for the 2014 World Cup. Brazil's Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said he accepted both Valcke's apology and a letter sent by Blatter in a sign that cooperation between the two entities was back on track. He added that these incidents must not be repeated, so that preparations for the four-yearly tournament continue to progress. Rebelo also said Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff had agreed to meet with Blatter, although no date has been set. FIFA has repeatedly expressed concerns over the pace of work in Brazil on both stadiums and broader infrastructure such as airports. But last week, Valcke used unusually strong language. In his apology letter, Valcke explained that in French, ""se donner un coup de pied aux fesses"" means ""to pick up the pace."" Unfortunately, he wrote, the expression had been translated so that in Portuguese it used much ""stronger words."" The translation was a literal one. Also this week, a congressional Commission approved a World Cup bill that would allow the sale of beer at games -- one of the main points of contention with FIFA. It still needs to be approved by both houses. CNN's Shasta Darlington in Brazil also contributed to this story.","Head of world football is unhappy with calls for investigation into his election victory .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- The death toll from a bus bombing in Manila's financial district climbed to five Wednesday as officials pointed to terror and crime groups in the country's south as a likely source of the attack. The bus was approaching a metro rail station when it blew up.  Thirteen people were injured in the attack, authorities said. Gen. Raul Bacalso, the Philippine national police chief, said the terror angle is being looked at closely during testimony before a Senate inquiry Wednesday morning. Evidence recovered from the crime scene and the pattern used in the bombing point to a strong possibility that terror or crime groups operating on the southern island of Mindanao may be responsible for the attack in Makati City, Manila's financial district, according to Nicanor Bartolome, a regional police director. The head of the Police Investigation Task Force, Arne De Los Santos, identified the explosive device as an 81mm mortar, which he said was triggered by a cellphone.  It was placed inside a bag that was left under a bus seat, according to Santos. Mindanao is a predominantly Muslim autonomous region, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country. Journalists Arlene Espirtu and Winona Cueva contributed to this report.","A mortar triggered by a cellphone is used in the bombing, investigator says .

"(CNN) -- To understand how human nature sometimes doesn't heed winter weather warnings, listen to how Deanna Hunt didn't listen. She ventured into Wednesday's storm in North Carolina, rendering herself stuck in her car on a snowbound road -- even after the nation saw two weeks ago how Georgia motorists were forced to sleep in their cars while stuck in another storm. Such standstills frustrate officials who warn the public of deadly weather. They're now studying ways to improve messaging, the National Weather Service said. ""You know, it was such a crazy thing,"" Hunt, who is pregnant, told CNN. ""We knew there was a huge front coming through, but you just never anticipate it coming as fast as it does. And it came in the middle of the day at lunchtime. ""My impression was that I could get to where I was going and get back, like a lot of other people. And the fact that it came so fast, that's the thing. It's amazing how quickly you can get stuck,"" she added. ""All it takes is one accident, and then it just starts backing up, and it's the trickle-down effect. ""And here I am, ironically, stuck in it,"" Hunt said in a phone interview Wednesday from her vehicle. She and her child were spending their fourth hour in the car, though it should have taken only 22 minutes to get home in Raleigh. When officials see footage of such stranded drivers, they become distressed, said Eli Jacks, the National Weather Service chief of fire and public weather services. Weather warnings are often issued three or four days in advance of a storm so that people can prepare for their safety, Jacks said. Thwarting those efforts are public attitudes of ""I've been through this before or I'll get through this,"" he said. ""In places that aren't used to receiving this type of weather like Atlanta and North Carolina, the images of people being on the road unable to move are very disturbing,"" Jacks said. ""Nobody wants to see that. ""We're issuing these watches, warning and advisories, and yet people go out into these storms,"" Jacks said. ""We issue them so that people will listen to them and say, hey, there is something different going on than the average weather."" The agency is working with social scientists and researchers on possible ways to improve the public messages. Their goal is to protect people and property. ""One of the things that we're studying is whether our messages are clear,"" Jacks said. ""There is no single answer to this. It's a topic that I think is important to study because we want to minimize (distressing weather images) you see on TV, so that people understand the threat and they react to the threat appropriately."" Don't put on your stupid hat . Gabrielle Harte of Raleigh experienced frostbite on her ankles Wednesday when she left work and drove home as snowfall began. But she moved only a mile in an hour and then didn't move at all two hours later, so she decided to walk the remaining four miles, she said. She became stranded in a hotel where she warmed up and discovered the apparent frostbite, she said. Fortunately, a team of nurses were also finding refuge in the hotel, and they wrapped her ankles and elevated her feet. Harte acknowledged she heard of the weather warnings. ""I was kind of hesitant to go, but figured I would leave as soon as it started, then make it back in time,"" Harte said. ""But once the snow came, in 45 minutes, everything was covered. Traffic was bumper-to-bumper. No one was moving."" Abandoned or snowbound vehicles in the middle of the road can hamper the travel of first responders and government trucks with snow plows, sand and salt, the North Carolina Department of Transportation said Thursday. There's also the driving peril of fallen power lines, trees and branches as well as ice dropping from overpasses, the Georgia Department of Transportation added. That's why transportation officials urge motorists to stay off the road during storms. Widespread gridlock unfolded any way Wednesday, inflaming North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to tell residents bluntly not to be ""stupid."" ""More than anything else, we're just encouraging people to be smart, and don't put their stupid hat on during the next 48 hours,"" McCrory said, in reference to how special four-wheel vehicles were being dispatched to rescue motorists stranded on highways. Officials and citizens alike often speak of how experience can go a long way in avoiding such calamities, but as the writer Aldous Huxley put it, ""Experience teaches only the teachable."" The school of hard knocks . Georgia seemed teachable this week, as residents wisely stayed home and off the roads in the ongoing storm that has since moved north and is now pummeling North Carolina and New York. But Georgia's response was learned the hard way after last month's ice storm brought highway and local traffic to an eerie standstill, as if frozen in a snow globe. In all, that weather was blamed for 10 deaths in the Southeast, five in Alabama and the others in North Carolina and Mississippi. In last month's storm, Georgia officials were excoriated for not acting promptly on early warnings. ""I accept responsibility for the fact that we did not make preparation early enough to avoid these consequences,"" Gov. Nathan Deal said. ""... I'm not looking for a scapegoat. I'm the governor, the buck stops with me."" In this week's storm, however, Georgia's highways and byways were so empty that one Atlanta resident likened them to a sleeping beauty. Meteorologist Mike Smith, senior vice president of AccuWeather Enterprise Solutions, remarked how Georgians this week avoided spending 22 hours stuck in their car as they did in last month's storm. ""With that wake-up call, people took the forecasts seriously this time,"" Smith said in a CNN commentary. ""Schedules were adjusted and people worked from home. For days, meteorologists warned of widespread power failures."" Heeding the warnings mitigated the effects of electricity loss Wednesday to more than 729,000 customers in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere in the Southeast, Smith said. Mayor blasted over opening schools . As the front now hammers New York with 14 inches of snow, controversy now roils there about whether the city should be holding school for its 1.1 million students -- especially when Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency Thursday for New York City, Long Island and the mid-Hudson areas. Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged the criticism against opening the schools in a snowstorm, but he defended his decision. Other school districts in the region kept students at home. ""It's always a tough decision based on imperfect information,"" de Blasio told reporters Thursday. He said the National Weather Service reported as little as 3 inches of snow on the ground at the start of the school day, with warmer conditions than in previous storms. But meteorologist Al Roker of NBC's ""Today"" show disagreed with the mayor's characterization of the forecast, saying it was ""on time and on the money."" ""At the time, we thought our children would be able to get to school safely,"" the mayor said. ""There are a huge number of parents for whom the consistency of the school schedule is absolutely necessary. ""They are going to work, they have no choice. If they can't get their kid to school, they don't have another option. There are huge numbers of parents for whom their kid getting to school also means their child will have a good meal, and in some cases, two meals. And so, the fact is, it's a very big deal to some parents,"" de Blasio added. The city's teachers union disagreed with him, citing safety concerns. ""Having students, parents and staff traveling in these conditions was unwarranted. It was a mistake to open schools today,"" Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said Thursday.","National Weather Service studies ways to improve messaging of danger .

"New York (CNN) -- A 57-year-old musician arrested in connection with the drugs found in actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment was granted bail Friday. The musician, Robert Vineberg, was among four people arrested in Manhattan in the days after the apparent heroin overdose of the Academy Award-winning actor on February 2. Prosecutors said Vineberg, who was arrested on a felony charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, had just under 50 small bags of heroin as well as packaging paraphernalia in his apartment during the raid. In another one of his apartments in the same Mott Street building, prosecutors said, 250 small bags of heroin were found. In addition, prosecutors said, detectives recovered nearly $1,300 in cash on Vineberg. Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Edward McLaughlin set bail at $200,000 bond or $40,000 cash. Vineberg is due back in court Tuesday. Vineberg's attorney, Edward Kratt, asked for a lower bail, saying his client has been an ""accomplished musician"" since the late 1980s and a ""functioning heroin addict"" with a 10-bag-a-day habit. The large quantity of drugs found in the apartments were for Vineberg's personal use, Kratt said. The judge, however, appeared to doubt that assertion, saying that the amount of heroin in Vineberg's possession was ""off the charts."" Vineberg was found to have the actor's phone number stored in his cell phone, a law enforcement official told CNN. Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said. Outside court, Kratt said his client hoped to raise bail money with the help of friends. Asked if his client sold heroin to Hoffman, Kratt said: ""I really can't comment on that. I know that he did have a relationship with Mr. Hoffman as a friend, how that translated into other aspects of their behavior, I really can't comment."" Michael Holman, a friend of Vineberg who attended the hearing, described Vineberg as ""very talented, very generous, very smart."" ""We are shocked and believe that he is being railroaded for political reasons,"" Holman said outside court. ""It's convenient that they find someone to blame for ... Philip Seymour Hoffman's overdose and death but I just don't believe that Robert had anything to do with it, and the fact that he might have been friends with him is no surprise. Robert was friends with a lot of people, a lot of important people, a lot of important artists."" Two other people arrested in connection with Hoffman's death -- Juliana Luchkiw and Max Rosenblum, both 22 -- were released last week until their next court dates. Luchkiw pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance. Her attorney, Stephen Turano, told the court his client had no criminal record. He said her father, who was present in court, is a lawyer and her mother a doctor. The prosecution asked for Luchkiw's bail to be set at $1,500, but McLaughlin ordered her released on her own recognizance. Rosenblum, who is to live with his parents until his next court date, had bond set at $35,000, or $8,500 cash, which his family posted. Prosecutors did not file charges against a fourth person arrested in the raid. The New York medical examiner's office said a determination of the cause and manner of Hoffman's death is pending further study, including toxicology reports. When police were called to Hoffman's fourth-floor Manhattan apartment, they found the 46-year-old actor lying on the bathroom floor with a syringe in his left arm. He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, his eyeglasses still resting on his head, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the inquiry. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, the law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. Also found in Hoffman's apartment was his personal journal, resting on a living room TV stand, two law enforcement sources said.","Robert Vineberg was among four people arrested after the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman .

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- President Barack Obama led the nation's Memorial Day observances Monday, laying a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery's Tomb of the Unknowns and declaring that Americans owe ""a debt to our fallen heroes that we can never fully repay."" ""The blessings we enjoy as Americans came at a dear cost,"" Obama told a crowd at the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal fans were hoping for a fairytale win against old rivals Chelsea to mark Arsene Wenger's 1,000th game in charge. Instead, they endured a nightmare defeat as Jose Mourinho's side romped to a 6-0 win in the English Premier League at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Gunners' fans have already seen their team taken apart by top-four opposition this season with Liverpool winning 5-1 at Anfield last month and Manchester City dominant in a 6-3 goal-fest at the Etihad Stadium last December. But the loss to local London rivals Chelsea will be the most difficult to stomach with the margin of defeat equaling Wenger's worst loss -- 8-2 by Manchester United in 2011 -- at the club. Mourinho's side were two goals up after seven minutes as first Samuel Eto'o then Andre Schurrle scored. A 10-minute period of respite ensued before the home side was awarded a penalty for hand ball, with referee Andre Marriner mistakenly showing a red card to Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who had tipped Eden Hazard's shot around the post. Marriner later apologized for the error. Amid the confusion, penalty-taker Hazard kept a clear head to fire Chelsea into a 3-0 lead with just 17 minutes played. Oscar then added a fourth three minutes before the break and popped up again for his second of the day in the 66th minute. Mohamed Salah made it six with his first Chelsea goal in the 71st minute. The win maintains the Blues' four-point lead at the top of the table while Arsenal slip to fourth with 62 points -- seven points adrift of Chelsea. After the match, Wenger shouldered the blame for the heavy defeat and conceded it had been one of the worst days of his career. ""This defeat is my fault. I take full responsibility for it,"" Wenger said. ""I don't think there's too much need to talk about the mistakes we made. We got a good hiding today. It's how we respond now on Tuesday night (against Swansea City) and the best way is not to explain too much the mistakes. ""Yes, of course it's one of the worst days. It's over after 20 minutes and it's a long game after that. ""You don't prepare all week to experience that kind of experience. It's a huge disappointment today, but we want to win the next game now."" After crashing to defeat at Aston Villa last weekend, Mourinho's side are back on championship-winning form. But the Portuguese continued his policy of playing down his team's title chances. ""We go match after match,"" Mourinho said. ""We play Crystal Palace next and after that we go to Paris (for the first leg Champions League quarterfinal tie against Paris St Germain). ""It's a different situation to Arsenal. It's a different situation to Liverpool, and Manchester City are also not in that situation. We are happy to be in that situation."" Manchester City kept in touch with Chelsea as they battered relegation-threatened Fulham 5-0 at the Etihad. Yaya Toure scored a hat-trick (two goals coming from the penalty spot) with Fernandinho and Martin Demichelis adding two late on to keep Manuel Pellegrini's side third on 63 points, but with three games in hand. Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick as Liverpool's winning run continued with a 6-3 victory at Cardiff City. The home side led twice -- goals from Jordan Mutch in the ninth minute and Frazier Campbell in the 25th minute -- but Brendan Rodgers' side was once again irresistible in attack. After scoring in the 16th and 60th minute, Suarez scored his third of the match and his 28th league goal in injury time, adding to two from Martin Skrtel and one from strike partner Daniel Sturridge. The win keeps Liverpool second with 65 points while Cardiff remain second from bottom with 25 from 31 games. Manchester United backed up a promising Champions League win in midweek with a 2-0 win at West Ham United. Wayne Rooney was the star of the show with two first-half goals. The first, a looping 45-yard shot caught Spanish goalkeeper Adrian napping while his second was a more straightforward tap in. David Moyes' team now have 51 points from 30 matches and will enter next Tuesday's Manchester derby with renewed optimism. Elsewhere, Everton beat Swansea City 3-2 to rise to fifth while Newcastle are up to eighth after a 1-0 win against Crystal Palace. Norwich City eased relegation worries with a 2-0 win over fellow strugglers Sunderland -- Chris Hughton's side are up to 13th with 31 points. Gus Poyet's Sunderland remain in the bottom three. Hull City further improved their survival hopes with a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion. Read more: Champions League quarterfinal draw .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama says he isn't bluffing when he says Iran shouldn't have a nuclear weapon, but he cautions against an Israeli strike against the Islamic republic. ""At a time when there is not a lot of sympathy for Iran and its only real ally, (Syria) is on the ropes, do we want a distraction in which suddenly Iran can portray itself as a victim?"" he said this week in an interview with the Atlantic. Obama, who is to meet Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said a permanent solution is necessary. ""The only way historically that a country has ultimately decided not to get nuclear weapons without constant military intervention has been when they themselves take (nuclear weapons) off the table,"" Obama said. ""That's what happened in Libya, that's what happened in South Africa."" Obama said Iran and Israel understand that he isn't bluffing about his opposition to an Iranian nuclear weapon. ""I think that the Israeli government recognizes that, as president of the United States, I don't bluff,"" he said. ""I also don't, as a matter of sound policy, go around advertising exactly what our intentions are. But I think both the Iranian and the Israeli governments recognize that, when the United States says it is unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, we mean what we say. "" Iranian officials have insisted their nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes. But their statements have not persuaded Washington or Israel. Obama said he's not going to take ""any option"" off the table and will pressure Iran until it ""takes a different course."" He stressed the importance of political, diplomatic and economic sanctions against Iran. He said the West has a ""sanctions architecture that is far more effective than anybody anticipated"" and tough sanctions ""put a world of hurt on them."" He also said that a transition to ""a peaceful and stable and representative Syrian government"" from the pro-Iran Bashar al-Assad regime would be ""a profound loss for Iran."" ""Preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon isn't just in the interest of Israel, it is profoundly in the security interests of the United States,"" he said. Obama said that Iran's gain of a nuclear weapons would ""run completely contrary to my policies of nonproliferation."" ""The risks of an Iranian nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorist organizations are profound. It is almost certain that other players in the region would feel it necessary to get their own nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""So now you have the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world, one that is rife with unstable governments and sectarian tensions. And it would also provide Iran the additional capability to sponsor and protect its proxies in carrying out terrorist attacks because they are less fearful of retaliation."" Netanyahu said three years ago that Iran was being led by a ""messianic apocalyptic cult."" Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called the leadership ""rational."" The interviewer, Jeffrey Goldberg, asked where Obama fell ""on this continuum."" ""There is no doubt they are isolated,"" the president said. ""They have a very ingrown political system. They are founded and fueled on hostility towards the United States, Israel and, to some degree, the West. And they have shown themselves willing to go outside international norms and international rules to achieve their objectives. All of this makes them dangerous. They've also been willing to crush opposition in their own country in brutal and bloody ways. ""I think it's entirely legitimate to say that this is a regime that does not share our world view or our values. I do think, and this is what General Dempsey was probably referring to, that as we look at how they operate and the decisions they've made over the past three decades, that they care about the regime's survival. They're sensitive to the opinions of the people and they are troubled by the isolation that they're experiencing."" Obama said Netanyahu has a ""profound responsibility to protect"" Israelis, given the Holocaust and anti-Semitism. ""I think it's important to recognize, though, that the prime minister is also head of a modern state that is mindful of the profound costs of any military action, and in our consultations with the Israeli government, I think they take those costs, and potential unintended consequences, very seriously,"" Obama said. There have been reports of friction between Obama and Netanyahu. The president was asked if they are friends and talk about matters other than business. ""The prime minister and I come out of different political traditions. This is one of the few times in the history of U.S.-Israeli relations where you have a government from the right in Israel at the same time you have a center-left government in the United States, and so I think what happens then is that a lot of political interpretations of our relationship get projected onto this,"" he said. Obama said he and Netanyahu ""can be very frank with each other, very blunt with each other, very honest with each other."" ""For the most part, when we have differences, they are tactical and not strategic. Our objectives are a secure United States, a secure Israel, peace, the capacity for our kids to grow up in safety and security and not have to worry about bombs going off, and being able to promote business and economic growth and commerce."" Obama has been criticized by some for not adequately supporting Israel's security interests, but he said, ""we've never had closer military and intelligence cooperation."" ""When you look at what I've done with respect to security for Israel, from joint training and joint exercises that outstrip anything that's been done in the past, to helping finance and construct the Iron Dome program to make sure that Israeli families are less vulnerable to missile strikes, to ensuring that Israel maintains its qualitative military edge, to fighting back against delegitimization of Israel, whether at the (U.N.) Human Rights Council, or in front of the U.N. General Assembly, or during the Goldstone Report, or after the flare-up involving the flotilla -- the truth of the matter is that the relationship has functioned very well,"" Obama said. ""Flotilla"" was a reference to Israel's raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla that left nine people dead. The Goldstone Report was a controversial assessment of Israel's Gaza offensive. Obama said ""there's no good reason to doubt"" him. ""Why is it that despite me never failing to support Israel on every single problem that they've had over the last three years, that there are still questions about that? ""Some of it has to do with the fact that in this country and in our media, this gets wrapped up with politics. And I don't think that's any secret. And if you have a set of political actors who want to see if they can drive a wedge, not between the United States and Israel, but between Barack Obama and a Jewish-American vote that has historically been very supportive of his candidacy, then it's good to try to fan doubts and raise questions,"" he said. Obama cited his ""full-throated defense of Israel"" before the U.N. General Assembly as an example. ""Our goals are in sync. And historically, one of the reasons that the U.S.-Israeli relationship has survived so well and thrived is shared values, shared history, the links between our peoples. But it's also been because it has been a profoundly bipartisan commitment to the state of Israel. And the flip side of it is that, in terms of Israeli politics, there's been a view that, regardless of whether it's a Democratic or Republican administration, the working assumption is: we've got Israel's back. And that's something that I constantly try to reinforce and remind people of."" The president also countered those voices who say he isn't up to using military power to stop Iran. ""If people want to say about me that I have a profound preference for peace over war, that every time I order young men and women into a combat theater and then see the consequences on some of them, if they're lucky enough to come back, that this weighs on me -- I make no apologies for that. Because anybody who is sitting in my chair who isn't mindful of the costs of war shouldn't be here, because it's serious business. These aren't video games that we're playing here."" But Obama said the record shows he's willing to take military action when necessary, citing the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and actions against the Taliban. Drone strikes have been used regularly against militants along the Afghan-Pakistani border during Obama's term. ""So aside from the usual politics, I don't think this is an argument that has a lot of legs,"" Obama said. For his part, Netanyahu said Friday that any long-term talks with Iran on the state of its nuclear program would likely go nowhere. ""It could pursue or exploit the talks as they've done in the past to deceive and delay so that they can continue to advance their nuclear program and get to the nuclear finish line by running up the clock,"" he said. The Israeli prime minister was in Canada ahead of his planned meeting next week with Obama. Netanyahu repeated that Israel reserves the right to defend itself against Iranian threats, leaving a unilateral, pre-emptive, military strike as a possibility. ""This is a very dangerous time, actually,"" said Janice Stein, a Middle East analyst and director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. ""Somebody can miscalculate. For example, should Iran, right after these parliamentary elections, think that an Israeli military strike is certain in the next few months, there is some incentive to go first.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders met with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Thursday, using the occasion to raise strong concerns about Beijing's commitment to human rights and economic issues such as the protection of intellectual property. Hu met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, among others.  Neither man attended Wednesday night's White House state dinner in honor of the Chinese leader. Earlier in the week, Reid called Hu a ""dictator"" -- words that were later recanted by his spokesman. Boehner noted that the concerns relating to tensions on the Korean peninsula also were raised during Thursday's talks. We had ""a good meeting,"" Boehner said.  ""I would hope that the dialogue on all of these subjects would continue."" Disagreements over human rights -- including China's treatment of imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo -- were ""raised very strongly,"" according to Rep. Howard Berman of California, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I would not indicate there was great engagement ... other than a general recognition by the president of China that they have a ways to go,"" Berman told reporters. On Wednesday, Hu met with President Barack Obama behind closed doors at the White House for several hours as top officials from both countries worked to address a range of issues tied to the global economic crisis, international security, the environment and human rights. Obama administration officials used the president's meeting with Hu to highlight economic progress between the two countries, announcing Beijing's approval of $45 billion in new contracts for U.S. companies to export goods to China. The contracts will support an estimated 235,000 American jobs, according to the White House. The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights, but they pledged to keep working on such issues in a ""frank and candid way,"" according to Obama. Human rights is always a touchy subject in China, as censors in China have made clear during Hu's visit.  The censors blacked out CNN's news broadcast each time human rights was mentioned.  Even when Hu spoke about human rights, it was blacked out. Censors also blacked the network out in China whenever a CNN report mentioned or showed video of Liu. Footage of anti-China protesters near the White House was similarly blacked out. Hu, who started his three-day trip to the United States on Tuesday afternoon, was treated to a military honor guard and review at the White House -- part of the traditional pomp and circumstance reserved for visiting leaders of major powers. Obama hailed Hu's visit as a chance to lay a foundation for the next 30 years of Sino-American relations. ""At a time when some doubt the benefits of cooperation between the United States and China, this visit is ... a chance to demonstrate a simple truth,"" Obama said.  ""We have an enormous stake in each other's success. In an interconnected world, in a global economy, nations -- including our own -- will be more prosperous and more secure when we work together."" Hu declared the relationship between the two powers to be one of ""strategic significance and global influence."" Under ""new circumstances, and in the face of new challenges, China and the United States share broad common interests and important common responsibilities,"" he said. ""Our cooperation as partners should be based on mutual respect,"" he added. ""China and the United States should respect each other's choice of development path and each other's core interests."" The formal state dinner for Hu on Wednesday evening was the third such occasion of Obama's administration.  Among the 225 dignitaries who attended were former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton; former secretaries of state Madeleine Albright, George Schultz and Henry Kissinger; Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer; actor Jackie Chan; Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire; and designer Vera Wang. Herbie Hancock and Lang Lang were to provide entertainment after the dinner. The last White House state dinner for China was in October 1997, when Clinton welcomed President Jiang Zemin and his wife, Wang Yeping. While Hu was at the White House, he joined Obama in a meeting with key business leaders. The list of corporate executives taking part in the discussion included Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, HSBC's John Thornton, Intel's Paul Otellini, Motorola's Greg Brown, Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, GE's Jeff Immelt and Boeing's Jim McNerney. Hu later met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden at the State Department.  He was scheduled to head to Chicago Thursday after the meetings on Capitol Hill. During a news conference with reporters Wednesday, Obama said he had received a promise from Hu to establish a more ""level playing field"" for U.S. trade.  China's currency, Obama said, remains undervalued -- a key factor in America's trade imbalance with Beijing. The two countries need to develop a ""win-win situation as opposed to a win-lose situation,"" he said. Hu conceded that key differences remain over economic policy, but he promised that Beijing would continue making attempts to resolve those differences. Obama noted that he and Hu agreed on the need to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula and prevent further provocations from Pyongyang. A Korean peninsula with no nuclear weapons remains a key goal for both leaders, Obama stressed. Obama on Wednesday defended his administration's decision to engage with China despite those differences over hot-button issues such as human right.  Obama pointed out that ""China has a different political system than we do"" and is at a ""different stage of development."" ""I have been very candid with President Hu about these issues,"" Obama told reporters, and ""occasionally, they are a source of tension."" But ""we can engage and discuss these issues in a frank and candid way,"" he said. Hu defended his country's human rights record, arguing that ""China recognizes and also respects the universality of human rights.""  At the same time, he said, it is important to account for ""different national circumstances."" ""We will continue our efforts to improve the lives of the Chinese people"" and promote ""democracy and the rule of law,"" he said.  At the same time, Beijing is willing to engage with Washington on the basis of ""mutual respect"" and the principle of ""noninterference"" in domestic affairs.

"(CNN) -- As the United States weighs possible military strikes on Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack, it has to consider a critical question: then what? A broad cross-section of experts on the region agree: A missile strike could worsen the war in Syria and usher in a host of new problems. ""The key issue is not the tactics of the strikes, but the strategic aftermath,"" says Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Read the U.S. government's assessment of Syria . Most experts believe a strike would target the Syrian regime's weapons arsenal -- not suspected sites of chemical weapons stockpiles. The latter would be ""the worst possible option,"" and could spread chemicals downwind, says Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the British military's chemical defense regiment. U.S. officials have said strikes on command bunkers, airfields or the artillery batteries and rocket launchers used to fire chemical projectiles are among the possibilities being considered. CNN asked analysts to discuss what could follow. Al Qaeda, extremists emboldened? ""A limited attack could suppress morale among regime forces and encourage defections and splits,"" says Jeffrey White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The opposition would be emboldened -- including the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, analysts say. ""Supporting the opposition at this point would be like French-kissing al Qaeda,"" says Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official now with the American Enterprise Institute. ""If the opposition wins, al Qaeda will win power."" ""There is a real risk that destabilizing the Assad regime could enable the jihadist and al Qaeda-affiliated rebel groups,"" agrees Erica Borghard, author of the policy analysis ""Arms and Influence in Syria: The Pitfalls of Greater U.S. Involvement."" ""These groups are militarily more capable than the rebels currently receiving U.S. support. "" It would be difficult for the United States to target al-Nusra infrastructure as part of a missile strike campaign because al-Nusra does not operate with clear ""command-and-control assets"" like the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Borghard says. What do Syria's neighbors think of potential Western strikes? Syria steps up attacks? Many analysts believe a U.S. attack would be aimed largely at making a statement that using chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war is unacceptable -- and that President Barack Obama is serious about his ""red line."" The attack would be unlikely to severely damage al-Assad, analysts say. But a limited attack brings its own dangers. ""Doing something cosmetic would be worse than doing nothing at all,"" says Christopher Harmer, senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. It would send a message to al-Assad ""that he has relative immunity from us, that he can continue to do whatever he wants short of massive chemical attacks on civilians,"" Harmer said in a CNN interview. Some other analysts fear al-Assad would respond with new chemical weapons attacks. ""Damaging his air force and known military installations would force him to consider his more extreme options for regime survival,"" including chemical weapons to quell rebellions, says Ed Husain of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Syria is now a fight to the death for both sides."" More than 100,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict -- the vast majority through conventional weapons, according to the United Nations. Rebels officials have said 1,300 people were killed in a recent chemical weapons attack; the United Nations has said hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand, were killed. 'Red line' debate: Are chemical weapons worse? The United States insists Syria was behind the attack, but ""there is no absolute certainty,"" Husain notes in a CNN Opinion column. Syria insists it has not used chemical weapons, and blames rebels. If rebels did carry out the attack ""to bait America into the conflict, then U.S. firepower would be futile,"" says Husain. ""No amount of surgical strikes on government facilities will prevent non-state actors from further use of these weapons."" Bombing raises suspicion of another chemical attack . Retaliation -- against Israel? It's unlikely Syria would attack U.S. assets, analysts say. ""They could try to shoot down U.S. bombers, if they are used, but have little hope against cruise missiles,"" says Benjamin Friedman of the Cato Institute. ""The regime's forces are tied down against rebels, and it lacks an air force or missiles that can hit any important U.S. targets with reliability."" And if Syria did manage to hit a U.S. target, ""it would only help shift U.S. opinion toward war and invite greater U.S. military involvement"" -- the last thing the Syrian regime wants. ""It's easier for Syria to target Israel, but Israel's retaliation would bring similarly dire consequences,"" Friedman says. ""The nightmare scenario is that Assad will respond by launching chemical weapons into Israel or another neighbor,"" says Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute. ""After all, if he hasn't batted an eye at gassing sleeping Syrians, why worry about killing Turks, Jordanians, or Lebanese?"" Israelis have lined up in recent days for gas masks. But a more likely scenario, says Friedman, is that Hezbollah would attack Israel. ""The Lebanon-based terrorist militia might fire rockets into Israel, as they did in 2006, in response to an attack on their Syria patrons. That could draw the United States more deeply into the war. On the other hand, the memory of Israel's 2006 response might deter Hezbollah."" International ramifications: Protests, unrest, attacks? A missile strike on Syria could lead to new violence in other parts of the Middle East and around the world, says Firas Abi Ali, head of Middle East and North Africa Country Risk and Forecasting at IHS. In Lebanon, Hezbollah supporters would be more likely to attack Sunnis ""due to the increased perception that Sunni communities are supporting Western-Israeli targeting of Hezbollah and Syria,"" he says. In several Middle Eastern countries, protests could arise -- some of them potentially violent. In Jordan, Syria ""would likely sponsor groups"" to attack malls, hotels, and government targets, Abi Ali says. And there will be a ""high risk"" of attacks, sponsored by Iran, against Western assets around the world, from India to Thailand to Brazil, Abi Ali says. Russia would also likely take action against companies based in the United States and some other countries, he says. Who wants what? Syria becomes 'Obama's War'? The repercussions for the United States, in the eyes of the world, could be tremendous, analysts say. ""By intervening, Syria may well prove to be Obama's war, bequeathed to a new president in 2016. Civilian casualties are inevitable. The images on our screens will not be Syrians using chemical weapons to kill each other, but American bombs creating carnage and killings in yet another Muslim country,"" says Husain of the Council on Foreign Relations. There would be ""real and false claims of collateral damage and civilian deaths,""and at the United Nations, Syria would accuse the United States of ""illegal aggression,"" adds Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""No amount of spin and victory claims can get around these issues. Nothing can stop critics from validly raising every past U.S. mistake in past interventions in the region and the world."" ""The worry here is that the U.S. could be drawn into even more extensive involvement in Syria,"" says author Borghard. ""This could involve a number of things, including imposing a no-fly zone over Syrian airspace and/or more extensive arming and training of rebels... This would be a far more resource-intense operation than the 2011 NATO operation in Libya and would involve greater risks."" Still, ""Doing nothing is not an answer,"" says Cordesman. ""... Simply standing by and letting Syria drift into armed, violent partition will threaten every U.S. interest in the region."" At the least, there should be a new international humanitarian effort, increased support for moderate factions in the opposition and a willingness to say the ""U.S. will consider collective action in terms of some no fly zone or use of airpower to both protect and empower the rebels if they can show they really have moderate leadership, can control the flow of arms and support, and will give full rights and protection to their Sunni opponents,"" he says. But in examining the possible repercussions of a missile strike, Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute says, ""There is no scenario that will end violence and improve the situation. The time for preventive medicine was two years ago."" ""When one side finally wins, the United States will have to craft a strategy to address a whole new set of problems that such a victory will bring,"" he says. ""Let's call where we are now Phase I of the Syrian civil war. We have yet to see Phase II and Phase III but they are coming.""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is back in the Middle East where he plans to propose a framework for a lasting peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, saying the time is close for tough decision-making. Kerry arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday and immediately headed for Jerusalem, the start of his ninth trip to the region since taking over as America's top diplomat nearly a year ago. A senior State Department official said Kerry's talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would be substantive. ""It is an effort to provide agreed guidelines for a permanent status agreement, that is to say, a full and final peace treaty between the parties,"" the official said. Kerry said in Jerusalem ""we know the parameters and the possibilities of peace"" after several months of discussions. He met with Netanyahu first, but the Israeli leader was not optimistic in brief public remarks. He expressed fresh doubts the Palestinians were committed to peace. ""I know that you are committed to peace. I know that I am committed to peace. But, unfortunately, given the actions and words of Palestinian leaders, there's growing doubt in Israel that the Palestinians are committed to peace,"" Netanyahu said in a speech at the start of his meeting with Kerry. During the remarks, Netanyahu accused Abbas of glorifying a group of Palestinian prisoners recently released by Israel. The release of the prisoners is part of a U.S.-backed deal to jump-start peace talks. Meanwhile, Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of sabotaging the talks with the announcement of new settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- areas that are considered key in any creation of a Palestinian state. With Mideast peace in mind, Kerry coaxes Israel on Iran . Kerry's proposal is based on five months of intensive consultations with Israelis and Palestinians since the resumption of the peace process last summer. He intends to test them on some of the ideas resulting from those talks. The purpose of the trip is for Kerry to ""climb with the two leaders to the top of the hill and be able to share with them the view of what's on the other side, what peace will look like in terms of all of the core issues that have to be resolved between them,"" the official said. The hope is that it will be easier to finalize details once the shared vision is understood, the official added. But gaps remain, and the United States acknowledges that achieving the ultimate goal will not be easy as evidenced by recent actions by both sides. With direct negotiations between the two sides flailing, the Obama administration seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals instead of relying on the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate between themselves. With Mideast peace in mind, Kerry coaxes Israel on Iran . CNN's Halimah Abdullah contributed to this report.","NEW: ""There is growing doubt in Israel"" that Palestinians want peace, Netanyahu says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Hollywood's disgraced private investigator to the stars shuffled in shackles into a federal courtroom Monday and was sentenced to 15 years in prison in a celebrity wiretapping scandal. A threat to a reporter launched an investigation that brought down celebrity shamus Anthony Pellicano. The sentence for Anthony Pellicano was close to the 16 years sought by federal prosecutors. A probation report had recommended a sentence just under six years. U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer also ordered Pellicano and two other defendants in the case to pay $2 million in restitution. ""You were unquestionably the organizer and leader,"" the judge said, referring to Pellicano's role in the vast wiretapping scheme. The judge added that Pellicano inflicted ""emotional, physical and psychological harm onto his victims"" and counted the justice system among the victims. After the sentencing, Prosecutor Dan Saunders applauded the 15-year term, saying Pellicano never considered the law when trying to help his wealthy clients. ""If anything he was very jubilant, and proud and excited with his ability to break the law,"" he said. Dressed in a green jailhouse jumpsuit, Pellicano, 65, blew a kiss to family members as he was led into court. Later, he shifted in his chair as he told the judge, ""I have already taken complete and full responsibility for all of my actions."" Saunders called Pellicano's statement ""false and hogwash."" Pellicano was convicted in May of 76 counts of racketeering, wire fraud, identity theft and wiretapping after a two-month trial. Pellicano and high-profile entertainment lawyer Terry Christiansen also were convicted in August of conspiring to wiretap the private conversations of billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's former wife, Lisa Bonder Kerkorian. The Kerkorians were locked in a child-support battle in early 2002. According to witness testimony, many of Pellicano's wiretaps involved conversations between lawyers and their clients. ""The importance of the attorney-client privilege cannot be overstated,"" the judge said . Pellicano represented himself in both trials, which included testimony from MGM mogul Kerkorian and comedian Garry Shandling, as well as 34 recordings Pellicano made with attorney Christensen. The men could be heard joking about the phone conversations of Kerkorian's ex-wife. Pellicano's new lawyers said outside the courtroom that they would appeal. ""There are numerous appellate issues with both the conviction and this sentence,"" said Michael Artan. Pellicano faced up to 20 years to life in prison for the racketeering convictions alone. Christensen, a partner in one of Hollywood's top entertainment law firms, was sentenced to three years in federal prison. The infamous Hollywood wiretaps case began when Los Angeles Times reporter Anita Busch was threatened in June 2002. A dead fish, a rose and a note demanding ""Stop!"" were left on the windshield of her car. In court, Busch propped a crutch against the back row of courtroom seats and limped forward to tell the judge how Pellicano's actions had harmed her. ""I thought it was just a matter of time before I would be killed [by Pellicano],"" Busch said. She added that she was so frightened by Pellicano that she feared turning on the ignition on her car because she thought it might blow up. Busch turned to Pellicano and scolded, ""You threw away your responsibility as a son to your mother and as a father to your own children -- for money."" She then delivered a parting shot: ""I fear for your soul when I think that God is just."" Investigators raided Pellicano's offices on Sunset Boulevard as part of their investigation into the threats against Bush and exposed his wiretapping enterprise. The case captured Hollywood's attention as A-listers and insiders speculated on who would be caught up the scandal. Sylvester Stallone and Keith Carradine were wiretapped; Shandling was subjected to an illegal criminal background check. The names of other stars, including Chris Rock and Courtney Love, came up in testimony during the trials.","Anthony Pellicano, disgraced P.I. to the stars, gets no credit for time served .

"(CNN) -- Puffing on electronic cigarettes is already a no-no on flights, but the government wants there to be no doubt. The Department of Transportation is proposing to explicitly ban the use of the devices on planes. ""Airline passengers have rights, and this new rule would enhance passenger comfort and reduce any confusion surrounding the use of electronic cigarettes in flight,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Electronic cigarettes look like the real thing, but they're actually battery-operated devices that turn nicotine into a vapor that is inhaled by the user, according to the FDA. They're a potential cause for concern because ""there is a lack of scientific data and knowledge of the ingredients in electronic cigarettes,"" the DOT said. But the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association criticized the move, insisting that the devices only emit water vapor. ""It makes absolutely zero sense,"" said Ray Story, the group's CEO. ""It only gives the smoker a dosage of nicotine, but it doesn't do anything else to the innocent bystander. ... I have sat next to people who wore a particular type of cologne that was far more intrusive than what this particular product is."" The DOT believes its current ban on smoking of tobacco products is broad enough to include electronic cigarettes, but wants to eliminate any confusion. Some airline passengers have been ""vaping"" on planes, convinced that the devices are exempt from the ban. In July, a Sandy, Utah, man was arrested after an altercation that began when he started using an electronic cigarette on board a Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. The story prompted hundreds of comments from CNN.com readers, many defending electronic cigarettes and arguing they're a smoke-free way to provide relief for passengers suffering from nicotine withdrawals during a flight. ""The problem is not with the people using this device, but with the people around them who are psychologically affected by the fact that it LOOKS like a cigarette and someone is sucking on it,"" one commenter wrote. But others worried about the safety of using the devices at 35,000 feet, as well as their health effects on others. ""I sat next to someone who was e-smoking and it's impossible to contain all of the nicotine mist. I don't want to breathe that stuff and shouldn't have to sit next to someone on a plane who is spewing chemically loaded mist. Get a patch or nicotine gum if your addiction is that bad,"" a commenter wrote. The DOT's proposed rule would apply to all U.S. and foreign airlines on scheduled flights to and from the United States. Officials are also considering whether to extend the ban on smoking to charter flights. Amtrak has already banned the use of e-cigarettes on trains and in any area where smoking is prohibited, the DOT said, and the U.S. Navy doesn't allow them below decks in submarines. The government will accept public comments on the proposal until November 14.","Government proposes to explicitly ban the use of electronic cigarettes on planes .

"(CNN) -- The tornado that tore through the Oklahoma City suburbs this week ranks among the strongest storms ever to strike the United States, packing powerful winds that topped 200 mph. Officials from the National Weather Service gave the tornado that hit Moore on Monday a preliminary EF5 rating -- the highest score on the scale that measures tornado intensities. The Enhanced Fujita scale uses the physical damage caused by the storm to estimate how fast the wind was blowing. Opinion: How can we be safe from tornadoes? Teams are still evaluating the destruction, and the rating released Tuesday is preliminary. So far, they've found that the tornado spanned 1.3 miles -- the length of more than 22 football fields lined up end-to-end -- carving a 17-mile path of destruction. Damage assessments show that the tornado was an EF5 for at least some of the time it was ravaging the area near Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett didn't mince words Tuesday when he described what he saw. ""We're talking levels of debris that's 4 feet high, as far as you can see. And we're talking about cars that are upside-down and school books and children's toys and trees without bark,"" he said. ""This was the storm of storms."" Tornado prediction is improving, scientists say . As officials continue to assess the damage, here are CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen's responses to some key questions about the storm: . What are EF5 storms? Storms now used the Enhanced Fujita scale, or EF scale, which is based on damage, which than translates to estimated winds. EF5 storms are the strongest storms on Earth, with winds of over 200 mph. How frequent are EF5 storms? You can go years without an EF5 tornado. In fact, since 1950 this is only the 59th tornado on record that has reached that threshold. How frequent are storms of this strength in this area? While EF5 storms are rare, the area in the Plains known as ""Tornado Alley"" is a focus for when this happens. There also seems to be a focus for strong tornadoes in an area known as ""Dixie Alley,"" which covers parts of the Southeast and includes Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia. Opinion: The making of a nightmare tornado . What factors give rise to a storm of this strength? A number of factors have to come together at the right time and place to produce a strong tornado. The clash of warm and cold air at the surface combined with lift in the atmosphere and strong winds both at the ground and high above help contribute. The greater the temperature differences and the winds, the greater the chance for supercells, or the thunderstorms that produce tornadoes. Deadliest tornadoes on record . How long does it take to assess the strength of a storm? Why does it take so long? After a tornado, the local National Weather Service office sends a team to take a look at the damage. In this case, the Norman, Oklahoma, office sent numerous teams in the field to evaluate damage. Since this storm path was 17 miles long and the damage path was so wide, it takes time to see all of the damage. Some people are calling this the strongest storm ever. Is that accurate? Crews are still surveying the damage. The strongest tornado on record to date struck Moore in 1999. It had winds recorded at 318 mph at 300 feet above the earth's surface. At the surface, officials estimated winds were at 250 mph. The estimated winds of this week's storm are 200-210 mph, but survey teams are still evaluating. It's safe to say this is one of the strongest tornadoes. Moore in bull's-eye twice, science may know why .

"(CNN) -- The great Davos talking shop is now up and running, with delegates of all levels of importance, shapes and nationalities zeroing in on this quaint, alpine town to put the world to rights. For many ordinary people the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) is yet another ""important"" summit in the calendar where the elite of business and politics will schmooze for a few days in a rarefied environment they have little or no experience of. Whether or not you believe events such as Davos justify their lofty ambitions, they are certainly a unique experience. So how do you become a Davos delegate? Official invite . The World Economic Forum is strictly by invitation only, with 2,600 participants representing over 100 countries. The roll call includes CEOs and representatives from the world's biggest corporations; politicians and heads of state from the G20 and other key countries; technology innovators; social entrepreneurs; philanthropists and media companies. However these special invitations -- or white badges -- are not free for everyone. Unless you're an anchor for one of the many broadcasters covering the event; an academic; a faith leader; a Young Global Leader (young people with great potential selected by the WEF from all fields of business); a social entrepreneur; or from an NGO, the average cost to a business to send each delegate is close to a whopping $20,000. Huge travel budget . Getting to this small ski resort, nestled in a picturesque valley high up in the Swiss Alps 150 km south-west of Zurich, is not for the budget traveler. For a delegate arriving from New York this week flying business class, the price comes in at between $4,200 and $5,300. A visitor from Tokyo can expect to pay between $7,200 and $10,500, while a delegate flying in from Johannesburg, South Africa will pay around $4,150. And once in Zurich there's the small matter of the transfer to Davos. A regular shuttle bus and train service is available, but a two-hour trip by public transport may not suit the business client. The alternative would be a limousine which would cost 650 Swiss Francs ($689) for a one-way trip. However corporate CEOs may choose to come by helicopter, which costs around $9,500 for a return flight. Place to stay . Finding accommodation in Davos during the week of the World Economic Forum is not easy, with a limited number of large hotels. Predictably tariffs reflect the resulting demand/supply imbalance, with a room in a modest three-star hotel coming in at around 500 Swiss Francs ($530) per night. Those with a considerably bigger budget often choose to rent out whole apartments or chalets. A chalet sleeping up to ten people for the week can command as much as 60,000 Swiss Francs ($63,600) - though catering might just be included. The right outfit . It's cold in Davos, very cold. At 5,052 ft (1,540m) above see level, temperatures average -6 degrees Celsius (21.1 degrees Fahrenheit) in January. Thermal underwear, winter jackets and snow boots are a must, particularly when the temperature plummets in the evenings as you make your way to the various cocktail parties, meals and social events hosted by partner companies. It is not uncommon to see $2,000 bespoke suits finished off with bulky snow boots around the Congress Center. Knowing where to go . With all the above boxes ticked, it is essential to have a plan once you have run the gauntlet of airport-style security -- there are 4,000 Swiss troops in Davos this week -- and made it inside the newly-extended Congress Center with the correct color of identity pass. Some delegates do nothing but network with other delegates, oblivious to the feverish discussions going all around them about the post-crisis new reality. So delegates can spend four days roaming this cavernous indoor amphitheater attending conferences and workshops about everything from how the environment agenda will change in light of current trends and norms, to how music can transform communities and unite people. $40,000-per head well spent.","World Economic Forum is strictly by invitation only, with 2,600 participants .
Average cost to a business to send each delegate is a whopping $20,000 .
Getting to Davos and then finding accomodation also hits the pocket hard .

"(CNN) -- When 14 members of the anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church showed up at the University of Missouri Saturday to protest the presence of openly gay football player Michael Sam at an NCAA basketball game against Tennessee, they were in for a bit of a surprise. Sam, who acknowledged he is gay on February 9, has received a great deal of support from around the globe, but his fellow students were about to go one step further. Missouri students Kelaney Lakers and Alix Carruth organized an event called ""One Wall, One Mizzou,"" which drew hundreds of people to the campus Saturday afternoon for the purpose of supporting Sam. According to the group event's Facebook page, the students planned to form a human wall to block off the Westboro protesters. ""The focus of this wall is unification behind Sam to represent this school as One,"" the Facebook page stated. A total of 4,952 people responded to the page. The Westboro protesters had announced that they planned to show up at 1:30 p.m., so the Mizzou students assembled at 1 p.m. and formed a long human chain that surrounded the campus. Many wore the school colors of black and gold and carried handmade signs that used the hashtag #StandwithSam. By the time Westboro protestors did arrive, all they could do was wave their signs, because they couldn't get close to the school. HLN affiliate KMIZ reported that police were on hand for the event, but that the Westboro protesters and the event attendees did not have any negative interactions. ""We're thankful that both groups kept it professional in the fact of how they expressed their points of view,"" university police department Capt. Brian Weime told KMIZ. ""There were no problems or issues between the groups which is good."" University Vice Chancellor Dr. Catherine C. Scroggs, who also attended the event, told HLN that she was very happy with the way students conducted themselves. ""The way they addressed it made us proud,"" Scroggs said. ""The Missouri Students Association was also on hand, giving out 'Stand with Sam' buttons to administrators and students. They ran out and they had a thousand, so we know at least that many people were there!"" The university tweeted photos from the event from their official account: . Tweet: @Mizzou The line of Mizzou students stretched from Providence to nearly Champions Drive at its peak. #StandWithSam . Tweet: @Mizzou #Mizzou students linked arms and sang our fight songs and the alma mater. #StandWithSam . Sam showed his gratitude by tweeting to supporters: @MikeSamFootball Thank you for all of my Mizzou family for your support. Divided we are weak, Together We are Strong. #OneMizzou . At halftime of the basketball game, the school presented its football team with the Cotton Bowl trophy. Sam raised it high, to a standing ovation.","Westboro Baptist Church staged a protest Saturday at the University of Missouri .

"(CNN) -- Turkish-Iranian posturing on Syria, with Ankara arguing for more than limited strikes against the regime and Tehran saying that whoever strikes President Bashar al-Assad must bear the consequences, serves as a harbinger for the birth of a new Middle East order. Just as World War 1 transformed the Middle East by ending the Ottoman rule and creating contemporary nation states, so the Arab Spring has recalibrated this regional system by ushering in a tri-axial Middle East composed of: a Turkey-Kurdish-Muslim Brotherhood (MB) axis; an Iran-Shiite axis; and a Saudi Arabia-pro-status quo monarchies axis. Opinion: Why limited Syria strike could hurt Turkey . In this fluid re-alignment, nation states will technically not disappear, but borders will increasingly be transcended by these axes as they contest regimes across the region in pursuit of installing their respective allies. Forces representing Iran's aggrandizing foreign policy, Turkey's pro-MB alignment and the Saudis' desire to keep the region's remaining regimes in place will grind against each other, cutting across existing borders and churning tensions, stoking sectarianism in the name of achieving their realist motivations. Opinion: Turkey may be Obama's key to solving Syria crisis . The novelty is not in the competition, but in the way this rivalry is playing out. In the pre-Arab Spring period, dominant Muslim nations of the region -- Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia -- challenged each other by standing for different models of statecraft and often promoting opposing values. Nevertheless, this competition did not usually turn acutely violent, with the exceptions of Lebanon, a weak state that was always exposed to regional and sectarian rivalries, and Iraq, where the Saudis and Iranians took advantage of the post-2003 vacuum to back warring Sunni and Shiite militia. The tumult of the Arab Spring, however, has been a game-changer in expanding the scale and scope of these regional rivalries. Firstly, the uprisings weakened the authoritarian states in the region, thus providing new venues for them to play out. The Syrian civil war is a case in point. Secondly, Egypt's paralysis has taken it out of the four-way regional game. Violent political polarization has transformed Egypt from ""the anchor of the Arab world"" into yet another theater for regional competition among the three remaining Muslim powers: Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, too, has changed. Under the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government, Ankara has abandoned its Kemalist world view. Once shunned as a hardline Islamist party but recently rehabilitated, the AKP sees itself as a model forward for the MB and has engaged regional MB parties to this end. Ataturk's Turkey used to look at the Middle East from the West. The new Turkey has embraced a new stance towards the region, looking at it from the AKP's pro-MB vantage point. Is Syria plunging Mideast into sectarian war? The AKP elites believe that if they could moderate and come to power through democratic elections in Ankara, like-minded Egyptian and Syrian MBs should be able to do the same in Cairo and Damascus. Hence, Turkey's dream: a region ruled by MB parties, looking to Turkey for guidance. This explains why Ankara is aghast at Washington's response to the ouster of the government of Mohamed Morsy, issuing a very rare public rebuke of Washington that harshly blamed the U.S. and the West for the bloodshed in Egypt. While Washington has accepted the MB's ouster in Egypt, pro-status quo forces in the region, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates have actually supported military intervention against the MB. These monarchies abhor the tumult of the Arab Spring. The Saudis dislike the idea of an Islamic democracy led by the MB, because they still see it as tumultuous and destabilizing. Bergen: Strange bedfellows -- Iran and al Qaeda . Iran meanwhile has taken advantage of the Arab Spring to mobilize a contemporary Shiite ""mythomoteur."" Tehran has cast the pro-democracy uprising against the Assad regime in Syria as a Sunni uprising against minority Alawites, an outlier sect of Shiism, and then used this to play to the persecution syndrome of the region's Shiites, mobilizing them from Iraq to Lebanon into Syria to rally behind the cause of propping up the Assad regime. Iran also supports the minority Shiite rebels in Yemen, who oppose a Saudi-backed government there. At the same time, the Saudis have cracked down on a pro-democracy uprising by Bahrain's majority Shiites. These moves have helped trigger sectarian chasms in the region, especially in the northern Fertile Crescent. This arch being home to three weak states, namely Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, is accordingly the prime theater for regional rivalries, whose borders are increasingly bleeding together. The Shiites of the northern Fertile Crescent are coalescing with each other and with Iran in ways not seen before in living memory. CNN poll: Public against Syria strike resolution . Turkey, whose regime change policy in Syria has been undermined by Iran, has entered the Fertile Crescent competition, throwing its support behind the Syrian and Iraqi MB parties. This move has cast Ankara and Damascus as enemies, and also cooled ties between Ankara and Baghdad, where the government is run by Shiites that Turkey considers Iran's peons. The Iraqi Kurds, wary of the emerging central government rule in Baghdad, have taken advantage of the situation and edged closer towards Ankara, building on the nascent energy corridor already being developed between them. The Syrian Kurds, too, are seeking Turkey's protection. Turkey's recent peace talks with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which holds sway among not just Turkish Kurds but also Syrian Kurds, will help this rapprochement. Syrian civil war: Not just about Syria . At the same time though, Turkey's MB policy has been, for the time being, upended. The Brotherhood has fallen from government in Egypt, failed to elect its candidate to lead the Syrian opposition, and has been sidelined in Libya. Qatar, which had hitherto allied itself with Ankara to fund MB style parties, appears to be changing its heart after an unexpected change in leadership in Doha. The tri-axial Middle East includes tactical alliances. In Syria, for instance, although Turkey and the Saudis support different camps in the opposition, they are, nevertheless, united against Iran. At the same time, Ankara and Riyadh challenge each other in Egypt where Turkey stands with Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood party and the Saudis with General Sisi's government. Ghitis: Why the Middle East is a mess . This leaves a tri-axial Middle East, in which Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia oppose each other in shifting alliances, vying to set a new regional order. Moving forward, it is unclear whether Riyadh will continue to use its financial and political leverage amongst Sunni regimes, particularly monarchies, to sustain its status quo posture. For Iran, Syria is the linchpin of its effort to extend beyond Shia-governed Iraq, and will determine whether it can be a broader strategic hegemon or remain relatively contained. And non-Arab Turkey, by standing for just the MB anywhere in the region, will see its influence wax and wane as each national revolution unfolds, though Ankara's clout among the Kurds may be more permanent. The U.S. has squandered the Arab Spring by not siding with liberal democracy, an agenda promoted by none of the three regional powers. Citizens across the region have once again returned to chanting anti-U.S. slogans to explain their tumult and plight. Moving forward, Washington must navigate the new Middle East. Otherwise, the region's political and ideological map will be redrawn by more influential anchor states. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Soner Cagaptay and Parag Khanna.","Khanna and Cagaptay say the Arab Spring has recalibrated the regional system by ushering in a tri-axial Middle East: .

"(CNN) -- In a message to Pope Francis, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said his government is ready to participate in next month's peace talks but noted outside countries must stop supporting what he called terrorist groups in the country's civil war, Syria's state-run news agency said Saturday. Al-Assad sent the message through intermediaries and expressed appreciation for how the Pope on Christmas urged an end to the violence and suffering in Syria, state-run SANA reported. ""The message also highlighted that stopping terrorism requires having the countries which are involved in supporting the armed terrorist groups stop providing any sort of military, logistic or training support, noting that this support was provided by some of Syria's neighbors and other known countries in the Middle East and abroad,"" SANA said. The Syrian president's message said that ""the crisis will be solved through national dialogue among the Syrians and under a Syrian leadership without foreign intervention as to enable the Syrians to determine their future and leadership through ballots."" The message was delivered during a meeting between Syrian Minister of State Joseph Sweid and the Pope's secretary of state, Archbishop Pietro Parolin, SANA said. Parolin told Sweid that the pope ""is constantly following the situation in Syria"" and ""Pope Francis affirms the need to solve the crisis in Syria through dialogue among the Syrians without foreign intervention,"" SANA said. The papacy confirmed the communique, saying the Syrian leader's ""delegation brought a message from President Assad to the Holy Father and explained the position of the Syrian government,"" the Vatican's website said. The Syrian presidency's Twitter account also posted details about the message to the pope, saying that the Syrian people ""are the only rightful owners in deciding on his future through their choices at the ballot boxes."" Al-Assad's dispatch to the pope comes before a United Nations-brokered peace conference that will be held in Geneva between the Syrian government and opposition beginning January 22. Next month's talks are called Geneva II, a follow-up to a June 2012 meeting in which international parties laid out a peace plan that calls for a transitional government body in a civil war that began in March 2011. The Geneva I meeting left open the question of whether al-Assad must leave office. ""The message stressed the Syrian government's readiness to participate in the international conference on Syria 'Geneva 2,' highlighting that combating the terrorism that targets citizens is a decisive factor in making any peaceful solution to the crisis a success,"" SANA reported from the Vatican. Meanwhile, a U.N.-related mission said Saturday it's likely to miss a December 31 deadline for removing important chemicals from the country, but overall it's making ""important progress"" in eliminating chemical weapons in Syria. The mission blamed the delay on ""the continuing volatility in overall security conditions"" and on ""Logistical challenges coupled with inclement weather."" Syria's chemical weapons are targeted for removal and elimination by the end of June 2014, said the Joint Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations. ""Preparations continue in readiness for the transport of most of the critical chemical material from the Syrian Arab Republic for outside destruction. However, at this stage, transportation of the most critical chemical material before 31 December is unlikely,"" the mission said. The Syrian civil war continued to its death toll Saturday when at least 25 people in a rebel-held area of the Syrian city of Aleppo were killed in an airstrike, a Syrian opposition group said. Government helicopters dropped barrel bombs striking a vegetable market and and an area near a hospital in the neighborhood of Tariq Al-Bab, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in statement. Women and children were among the dead, the group said. The regime of al-Assad has been accused of dropping barrel bombs -- drums packed with explosives and shrapnel -- on Aleppo. The opposition Local Coordination Committees said hundreds have been killed in the city this month. CNN cannot independently verify daily death tolls, but the United Nations says well over 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011. CNN's Slma Shelbayah and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.","President al-Assad says foreign support of terrorists in civil war must end .

"Washington (CNN) -- Embattled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie forcefully stood by his account that he only found out about notorious traffic lane closures at the George Washington Bridge last year after they appeared in the media and that he knew absolutely nothing about a suggested political motive behind them. ""The answer is still the same,"" Christie said in a radio interview on Monday night, adding later that he can't wait to get the ""full story"" behind the scandal that has rocked his administration and, for now, has clouded any potential presidential run in 2016. ""The fact of the matter is I've been very clear about this. Before these lanes were closed, I knew nothing about them. I didn't plan it. I didn't authorize it. I didn't approve it. I knew nothing about it,"" he said in a studio appearance for a live call-in show hosted by New Jersey 101.5. The fresh response came amid a new allegation from a former top adviser caught up in the scandal, David Wildstein, that ""evidence exists"" that Christie knew about the closures and resulting traffic gridlock over five days in Fort Lee in real time, which would, if true, contradict his account of events. On CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich said he believed Christie but thought the governor should sign a sworn statement backing up his claims. ""I take it him at his word but it would appear from the polls that a lot of folks don't,"" Sokolich said. Why is this important? Christie's recollection ultimately may be critical in answering why the bridge lanes overseen by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were closed in the first place and who authorized it for sure -- and whether any laws were broken. E-mails and political figures in New Jersey have suggested the gridlock was a bit of orchestrated political payback for the Fort Lee mayor, who did not endorse Christie for re-election last November. A state legislative committee is investigating as is the Justice Department, which would be interested if there was any abuse of power. Both have subpoenaed Christie's office for documents, and he said his office is complying. Christie's office also has hired a private law firm to investigate. And why is Wildstein important? It has been suggested in the e-mails released by state legislative investigators in New Jersey that Wildstein, a top Christie appointee at the Port Authority, carried out the closures. He also has been subpoenaed, refused to answer questions from legislative investigators, and he's got a lawyer. For his part, Christie has fired a top aide linked to what has metastasized into a political scandal coming on the heels of a successful re-election and prior to a possible White House bid. Others have left their jobs as the scandal unfolded, including Wildstein. Former deputy chief of staff Bridget Ann Kelly, whose e-mail to Wildstein -- ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee"" -- weeks before the gridlock occurred led to her firing by Christie in January, refused on Monday on constitutional grounds to comply with a state legislative subpoena to turn over documents, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN's Chris Frates. State lawmakers leading that investigation said they are reviewing the matter and ""considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena."" Christie, in the radio interview, repeated what he said at a January news conference -- challenged by Wildstein in a letter written by his lawyer to the Port Authority on Friday -- about the timeline around when he became aware of the traffic mess. He also denied having any knowledge of a suggested political motive. Who's who in the bridge scandal . Christie blasts Wildstein . ""The first time that this really came into my consciousness, as an issue"" was when an e-mail from Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye ""was leaked to the media and reported on."" Foye was the person, according to e-mails, who started asking questions about the lane closures and ordered them reopened. That's when Christie said he asked his chief of staff and his chief counsel to ""look into this and see what's going on here."" He said any reference to the bridge situation prior to this wouldn't have meant anything to him because he wasn't clued into the fact that there was a problem. Afterward, Christie said again that he was told the ""Port Authority was engaged in a traffic study,"" which has now been called into serious question. He also stressed that ""nobody has said I knew anything about this before it happened, and I think that's the most important question."" A question of evidence . Christie's appearance follows steps by his office over the weekend to strike in an unusually personal way against Wildstein, a one-time high school classmate of the governor in Livingston, N.J. ""Bottom line - David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,"" a letter released by the governor's office said in a statement. On Monday, Christie's office also planned to send to friends and allies a list of tweets and stories aiming to put the focus on The New York Times' handling of the disclosure by Wildstein, according to CNN's Jake Tapper. The Times broke the story, saying Wildstein ""had the evidence to prove"" Christie knew about the lane closures. The newspaper quickly revised its lead to simply reflect what the letter written by Wildstein's attorney actually said: that ""evidence exists,"" not that Wildstein was in possession of it. The letter never disclosed the evidence. Chris Christie scandal: A primer . First on CNN: Mayor behind Christie allegations full of contradictions . The letter also didn't suggest that Christie had knowledge of what his people might have been up to -- political or otherwise. Read Wildstein's letter . The scandal and another allegation of strong-arm political tactics by Christie administration officials over Superstorm Sandy aid have generated a wave of negative political fallout for a governor overwhelmingly re-elected in November and considered a top-tier Republican presidential hopeful in 2016. Christie's swagger and straight-shooting style had him riding high in the polls as late as December. He topped other potential GOP 2016 White House hopefuls in various surveys. But those numbers have faded as the scandal has intensified, according to a new CNN/ORC International survey. Christie trails Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points in a hypothetical presidential match-up, a turnaround from December when he was up by 2 points. Opinion: Are clouds gathering for Christie?

"(CNN) -- Want to read that e-book or play Candy Crush while taxiing to the runway? Add Southwest Airlines to the list of U.S. airlines that have received Federal Aviation Administration approval to allow passengers to use many portable electronic devices in all phases of flight. Southwest Airlines' move Wednesday came three weeks after the FAA announced the loosening of electronics rules aboard aircraft. Under the new rules, passengers may use certain electronic devices in ""airplane mode"" during taxiing, takeoff and landing. Each airline has to prove to the FAA that devices are safe to use in airplane mode on its aircraft. JetBlue Airways and Delta Air Lines moved quickly to get FAA approval to allow devices on board on November 1. American Airlines implemented the policy change November 4. United Airlines unveiled its policy change November 6, and US Airways announced its change November 7. Other airlines are moving to get FAA approval to allow greater electronic use. Virgin America said it hopes to allow devices in all phases of flight this month. ""We're in the process of applying through the new process and hope to implement the changes as soon as possible, with the goal of having the change live in November -- in time for the holidays,"" Virgin America spokeswoman Abby Lunardini wrote in an e-mail. Spirit Airlines was less specific about its time frame. ""We are in the process of coordinating with the FAA. I don't have a specific implementation date at this time,"" Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson wrote in an e-mail. With such a new policy, some confusion exists about what's still permitted on board. US Airways reminded passengers of some restrictions that remain in place. The airline noted that the eased restrictions apply only to domestic flights flown by its ""mainline"" aircraft, which means partner airline flights (such as US Airways Express flights) are not included. Those airlines have to get their own FAA approval. Smartphones and other devices must be operated in airplane mode or with cellular services disabled. The new expanded use of electronics does not apply to making or taking calls, which are still prohibited in flight. Phone calls are not allowed after the main cabin door is closed or before a crew member makes an announcement allowing calls upon arrival, US Airways said. Customers should not use their devices during safety announcements. For takeoff and landing, laptops and other electronic devices that weigh more than 2 pounds must be secured in an overhead bin or under the seat in front of passengers. Some folks had a sense of humor about the device debate. Earlier this month, @RealMediaMedusa tweeted that ""Portable Electronics on Airplanes policy too late for Alec Baldwin,"" referring to the 2011 incident in which the actor refused to turn off his electronic device at the gate and got booted from a flight.","Southwest is newest airline to ease electronics rules .

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old boy who had confessed to being an assassin for a Mexican drug cartel was among six people found murdered execution-style, authorities in the central Mexican state of Zacatecas have confirmed. The boy, identified as Jose Armando Moreno Leos by officials, was arrested only three weeks ago by the Mexican Federal Police, according to Arturo Nahle Garcia, state's attorney in Zacatecas. Get the latest news from CNN.com . ""After being detained, he confessed to authorities that he had participated in at least 10 homicides and that he was somebody who was good at shooting with a high-caliber weapon,"" Nahle Garcia said. After his February arrest, the Federal Police released the boy into the custody of the Mexican Attorney General's Office, which later set him free in compliance with the law. The Mexican constitution prohibits the incarceration of anybody under the age of 14. The constitutional ban also applies to correctional facilities. Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing . According to Nahle Garcia, Moreno Leos missed a court appearance on February 20. ""Only his mother appeared before the judge to say that she had lost control of her son after he left the house at about age 11,"" the prosecutor, said. The court appearance was to determine custody and measures to help the teenager leave behind a life of crime. The boy's body was found Thursday alongside a highway in the municipality of Morelos. The bodies of five other people, four females and one male, were also found at the same location. Officials say they had all been shot execution-style with high-caliber weapons. Blogger vows to fight despite threats . ""They all appeared to be young people, but we're still in the process of positively identifying the bodies,"" Nahle Garcia said. This is not the first time a teenager has admitted being a hit man for organized crime in Mexico. In 2011, authorities arrested a 14-year-old boy, identified only as ""El Ponchis"" -- ""The Cloak"" -- who admitted on camera that he had brutally killed people. In a video obtained by CNN, he told a military interrogator that he had beheaded four people. El Ponchis was found guilty and sentenced to three years in a correctional facility, the maximum allowed under Mexican law. Speaking about the most recent incident, Nahle Garcia said he's not surprised. ""It's really unfortunate, but we're seeing more and more young men who drop out of school and end up selling drugs on the streets,"" he said. ""They all end up the same.

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- Fidel Castro, the longtime Communist leader of Cuba, met with visiting members of the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday, a day after his brother, Raul, who succeeded him as president, did the same, according to a U.S. official in Havana. U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, at left with Reps. Marcia Fudge and Mel Watt, was among those who met with Castro. The meeting with Fidel Castro, 82, comes amid speculation that the United States is considering a shift in relations with the Communist nation that sits just 90 miles from the Florida Keys. Upon returning to the United States, members of the caucus said it's time to consider an end to the trade embargo and other diplomatic restrictions placed on Cuba for the past five decades. ""Yes, we have history. We have good history and not-so-good history,"" said Rep. Laura Richardson, D-California. ""But the point is, it's history, and we need to move forward."" Three members of the caucus were visiting the Latin American School of Medicine, where students from nations including the United States study, when they were invited to meet with the senior leader. ""Former President Fidel Castro is very engaging, very energetic,"" said caucus Chairwoman Barbara Lee, also a Democrat from California. ""Our conclusion is, given the new direction in our foreign policy, that it's time to look at a new direction in our policy toward Cuba. ""The 50-year embargo just hasn't worked,"" she said. There was no immediate response from the Obama administration on the meeting. But asked earlier about Monday's meeting with Raúl Castro, State Department spokesman Robert Wood declined to say what, if any, role it could play in a possible warming of a decades-long diplomatic and economic freeze. ""Members of Congress have the right to travel where they want and to discuss issues with whom they want,"" Wood said. ""And I am sure members of that delegation will be raising some of the concerns that the U.S. government has with Cuba, in terms of allowing Cubans to have some of the same rights and freedoms as other countries in the hemisphere."" Obama has said he is in favor of changing the relationship with Cuba but has not offered specifics. Government officials have hinted that he may soon lift travel restrictions between the two countries. In a letter published Tuesday in the online version of Granma, a state-run Cuban newspaper, Fidel Castro wrote that an unnamed caucus member told him ""he was sure that Obama would change Cuba policy but that Cuba should also help him."" He noted that the group was in Cuba during the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s April 4 assassination and visited a center dedicated to King. ""I value the gesture of this legislative group,"" Fidel Castro wrote. ""The aura of Luther King is accompanying them. Our press has given broad coverage of their visit. They are exceptional witnesses to the respect that U.S. citizens visiting our homeland always receive."" The United States broke diplomatic ties with Cuba in 1961, two years after Fidel Castro took office. The following year, the U.S. government instituted a trade embargo. Both policies still remain in effect. Early last year, and with his health failing, Fidel Castro announced that he was resigning from the presidency. The Cuban National Assembly appointed Raúl Castro to the post days later. Fidel Castro led the revolution that, in 1959, overthrew Cuba's Batista dictatorship. He was credited with bringing social reforms to Cuba but criticized internationally for oppressing human rights and free speech. Despite widely documented health problems the past few years, including intestinal surgery in 2006 that required him to turn power over to Raúl while he recovered, Fidel Castro seemed to be largely in good health, the delegation said. ""Of course, he has been ill, but I think we will agree he was very healthy, very energetic and very clear thinking,"" Lee said. ""He was very engaging."" Two caucus members, Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Bobby Rush of Illinois, preached sermons at two Cuban churches to commemorate the anniversary of King's assassination. While in Cuba, the delegation also met with family members of the so-called Cuban Five, a group imprisoned in the United States after being convicted of spying. In 2005, a three-judge appeals court panel overturned the convictions, but the full court later reversed that decision.","NEW: ""We have history ... and we need to move forward,"" lawmaker says .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- President Viktor Yanukovych defended his government's handling of the political crisis in Ukraine on Thursday, saying that it had ""fulfilled all its obligations"" and that opposition leaders were stoking people's anger for their own gain. The opposition ""continues to escalate the situation"" and to encourage people to maintain their protests in the icy streets, he said in an address posted on his website. ""I think that is wrong. We must understand that there is no future for the state and people if political interests of certain groups are set higher than the existence of Ukraine itself."" Yanukovych insisted the government had lived up to ""concrete agreements"" reached with the opposition to try to end the crisis. ""The government has fulfilled all its obligations under these agreements, including the adoption of the Law on Amnesty that guarantees freedom and liberation of persons arrested during the conflict,"" he said. He also appealed to Ukrainians to ""do everything for peace and normal life"" and said he regrets ""the young people (who have) died in this confrontation."" Earlier, Yanukovych's office said the President was out on sick leave after an ""acute respiratory disease accompanied by fever."" The country's Parliament approved the amnesty bill for anti-government protesters in an extraordinary session Wednesday. 'Unacceptable' conditions for amnesty . A top legislator announced that all factions had approved the amnesty law, but opposition leaders dispute that, saying the legislation was rushed through and imposes ""unacceptable"" conditions. For the amnesty to come into effect, protesters must vacate seized government buildings and unblock streets and squares, ""except those where peaceful protest actions are taking place,"" the law says, according to the state-run Ukrinform news agency. There was no sign of protesters leaving Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, on Thursday, despite the political maneuvering and the bitter cold. A billboard above the square, which has been at the heart of anti-government protests since November, registered -16 Celsius (3 Fahrenheit) Thursday afternoon, with -23 Celsius (-9 Fahrenheit) forecast for the evening -- the coldest weather since the protests began. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, head of the opposition Fatherland Party, warned late Wednesday that fresh violence could erupt if authorities try to clear out protesters. ""It depends on the way the government is to act. If they press on peaceful protesters, this will definitely trigger another spiral of violence,"" he said. If people feel that the issue of constitutional reform to shift the balance of power away from the President toward Parliament is addressed, he said, ""this could even somehow calm down the situation in Ukraine. If no, another surge of violence."" Klitschko: People want real change . Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms, or UDAR, said he and his supporters could not stand behind a move that called for an end to protests without real change beyond freeing the 218 activists who the Interior Ministry says have been arrested. ""People took to the streets because they want to change the situation,"" Klitschko said. ""A statement, 'We will free people, if they go home' is unacceptable. It cannot be understood."" Klitschko has called for Yanukovych to resign and said his departure from power would be ""a logical step."" After a special session held Tuesday and Wednesday, Parliament won't reconvene until next Tuesday. The opposition hasn't yet announced its next move. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his Cabinet resigned Tuesday, hours before Parliament annulled draconian anti-protest laws that sparked violent confrontations between police and demonstrators. The President has yet to sign off on the bill repealing the anti-protest laws, and UDAR urged Yanukovych on Thursday not to let his sick leave prevent him from living up to his responsibilities. The recent clashes are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia. Europe's concern . The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on Thursday voiced its ""deep concern"" about the situation in Ukraine. A resolution adopted by the body said the government's resignation and the repeal of the protest laws were ""a first step"" toward resolving the crisis, which should be followed up ""by both authorities and opposition with further concrete steps to resolve the crisis peacefully and democratically."" Sanctions could be imposed against Ukraine ""if grave human rights violations continue, or if the Maidan protest were to be broken up by force,"" it said. Such sanctions could include a suspension of voting rights. The resolution calls for a full investigation into ""the excessive and disproportionate use of violence by the police against protesters"" and said it was ""especially concerned about credible reports of torture and maltreatment of protesters by the police and security forces."" Those responsible must be held accountable, it said. The assembly also raised concern about violence directed at police by extreme right-wing protesters. Merkel calls Kiev, Moscow . In a call with Yanukovych on Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the dialogue between the opposing sides and the decision to repeal the controversial protest laws. ""With its resignation, the government has assumed responsibility for its part in the most recent escalation in the crisis,"" a news release from her office said. ""Now it is a matter of following through on the agreements, including amnesty, and continue ongoing dialogue. It should not come to renewed violence."" Merkel also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, her office said. A readout of that call said she urged Putin to ""push for constructive and results-oriented dialogue between the government and the opposition."" There have been tensions between Russia and the European Union over developments in Ukraine, with each side accusing the other of interference. But Putin denied this week that Moscow is exerting undue influence in Ukraine. After Yanukovych's U-turn in November on the planned EU trade deal, he and Putin agreed to a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt. Moscow also agreed to slash the price Ukraine pays for its gas. Putin said Tuesday that Russia intended to honor that deal once Ukraine's political crisis has played out. CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Kiev and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Victoria Eastwood, Lindsay Isaac, Stephanie Halasz and Marilia Brocchetto, as well as journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev, contributed to this report.","Viktor Yanukovych says his government has ""fulfilled all its obligations""

"(CNN) -- Facing lethal injection in a matter of days, Ohio murderer Billy Slagle apparently hanged himself in his prison cell early Sunday, state corrections officials said. Slagle was discovered in his cell at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution just after 5 a.m. Sunday and pronounced dead about an hour later, said Jo Ellen Smith, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections. He was to have been put to death Tuesday, Smith said. Slagle had been on death row since 1988, convicted of murder after stabbing a neighbor to death in her Cleveland home. Ohio's parole board voted 6-4 against his petition for clemency in June, and Gov. John Kasich denied his request on July 24. Death row diary offers rare glimpse into a morbid world . The refusal came despite the rare support for a commutation from Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty, whose office recommended Slagle's sentence be reduced to life in prison without parole. Slagle was 18 and already had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse when arrested in the killing of Mari Anne Pope, who was stabbed 17 times with scissors while her children were in the home, according to court records. His family had a long history of alcoholism and domestic abuse, and he spent his teenage years ""largely unsupervised by any adult,"" his attorneys argued in seeking clemency. McGinty said in July that there was ""no doubt of Slagle's guilt,"" but jurors at the time didn't have the option to consider a sentence of life in prison without parole. If the case were brought today, McGinty said, prosecutors weren't likely to seek the death penalty. Slagle was in solitary confinement, Smith said. Prison officials have launched an investigation into how he died, she said, and no further details had been released Sunday afternoon. An autopsy was scheduled for Monday, Mike Ratliff, chief investigator for the Ross County Coroner's Office, told CNN.

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin last month, visited a gun manufacturer Thursday, TMZ reported. The celebrity gossip site TMZ published a picture of Zimmerman smiling and shaking hands with someone it said was an employee of the gunmaker, Kel-Tec. It said Zimmerman asked about the KSG compact 12-gauge shotgun while he was there. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, confirmed to CNN by text message that is was George in the photo. Kel-Tec is headquartered in Cocoa, Florida. The company manufactures, assembles and repairs its line of weapons, and its facility contains a shooting range but does not sell guns, according to its website. Kel-Tec manufactures the PF-9, the type of gun Zimmerman used to shoot Martin. A jury acquitted Zimmerman in July of second-degree murder in Martin's February 2012 death. The neighborhood watch volunteer, now 29, killed the 17-year-old as he walked to his father's fiancee's house through a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman had called 911 to report Martin as a suspicious person. He acknowledges killing Martin but says it was in self-defense after the two had a confrontation. His parents said Zimmerman and his family received many death threats after the acquittal. Zimmerman's defense attorney, Mark O'Mara, described his client as a marked man who wore a disguise and often strapped on body armor when he left home. O'Mara said Zimmerman must now be protective of his safety because of the threats against him. TMZ also reported that O'Mara went to the gun facility with Zimmerman, but O'Mara told CNN he was not there and was in court at the time.","TMZ publishes a photo of George Zimmerman shaking hands with an apparent employee .

"New York (CNN) -- City University of New York students and faculty plan to continue protesting the arrival of retired four-star Army Gen. David Petraeus, who is a visiting professor at the school, said a professor who helped form a committee aiming to oust the former CIA director. On Monday, CUNY students, faculty and other activists, led by the newly formed Ad Hoc Committee Against the Militarization of CUNY, used signs and chants to protest Petraeus' arrival at Macaulay Honors College. Amateur video shot by Brian Hudson, who tells CNN he was among the protesters, shows a group of young adults approaching Petraeus as he walks near Manhattan's Central Park West, calling him ""disgusting"" and a ""war criminal."" It is unclear if these protesters are CUNY students. A flier from the committee lists several student groups and professors who support banning ""this mass murderer"" from teaching at the CUNY school. Opinion: Would a President Petraeus be in the cards? Hunter College adjunct professor Sandor John, who teaches Latin American history and helped organize Monday's protest, says it should come as no surprise that so many diverse groups support the committee's effort to oust Petraeus. ""A lot of our students are from countries that have been targeted by the United States,"" John said. ""We don't want someone like him on campus."" In a prepared statement, Dr. Ann Kirschner, dean of Macaulay Honors College, said that the university must strive to connect students with ""remarkable leaders and thinkers"" and that complex issues and points of view should be respected. ""While the college supports the articulation of all points of view on critical issues, it is essential that dialogue within the academic setting always be conducted civilly."" Robert Barnett, Petraeus' attorney, had no comment Thursday. The next protest is scheduled for Monday, John said. Petraeus is teaching a once-a-week course titled ""Are We On the Threshold of the North American Decade?"" It's an interdisciplinary seminar in which students ""examine in depth and then synthesize the history and trends in diverse public policy topics with a view towards recommendations for America's leadership role in the emerging global economy,"" a course description says. In April, Petraeus said he was pleased to have the opportunity to work with Macaulay's talented and diverse students, a news release said. Petraeus resigned as director of the CIA in November 2012 after admitting to an extramarital affair with his biographer.","Some at the City University of New York don't want David Petraeus as a visiting professor .

"The Atkins diet, which advocates steering away from carbs, may not lead to long-term weight loss. A Stanford University study, released in May 2007 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, compares the effectiveness of four popular diets -- Atkins, LEARN (Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships, and Nutrition), Ornish, and Zone -- for women who are premenopausal and overweight or obese. Women on Atkins lost the most weight, although the average loss was only about 10 pounds for 12 months. What's the best diet? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: It's always difficult to know which diet is right for you. Researchers at Stanford University looked at four popular diets: Atkins, LEARN, Ornish, and the Zone diet. Three hundred overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomly assigned to these four diets, which they followed for a year. Women in the Atkins group lost the most weight -- about 10 pounds in a year. It's also interesting to note that more participants stayed on the Atkins diet for the entire year, compared with women on the other diets. But even though these women lost weight, isn't the whole issue about Atkins that it's high in fats that can raise your cholesterol, which might eventually lead to heart problems? Gupta: Researchers also looked at the good and bad cholesterol and blood pressure of each participant. Atkins patients had a few points higher number for their LDL or bad cholesterol, but overall there was no significant difference. And the Atkins patients had a higher blood pressure number but, again, not that much higher. What about for the long term? Can they keep the weight off with Atkins? Gupta: First off, although any doctor will tell you it's good for most people to lose 10 pounds, 10 pounds is not a significant amount of weight to lose in one year. The study does not follow the patients after the year, so you don't know whether they gained their weight back, or whether they lost more. Also, other nutritionists we talked to who have worked on this same type of research said that the only real difference in diets was between Atkins and the Zone. All the others had pretty much the same results. And they found while Atkins can be an effective way to lose weight, few people are able to maintain meaningful long-term weight loss on this diet.","Bottom Line: Atkins can help you lose weight, but few people are able to maintain meaningful long-term weight loss with it ."
"(CNN) -- Apple's new CEO is no Steve Jobs, says Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, who first met Jobs when his company employed him in 1974 as a $5-an-hour developer. ""If I were to choose somebody to run international manufacturing and processing and keep the wheels on the bus, Tim Cook is about as good as anybody can get,"" said Bushnell. ""But I just feel like somebody needs to stick a little bit of dynamite under his left cheek."" Bushnell is author of the new book, ""Finding the Next Steve Jobs: How to Find, Keep and Nurture Talent."" He spoke to CNN about his former employee's legacy -- just days before the second anniversary of Jobs' death on October 5, 2011 -- and what it will take for a new tech visionary to emerge today. To be sure, Apple continues to succeed. Its new iPhone 5S models sold more than 9 million units in their first weekend, and the company has earned praise for overhauling its iOS mobile operating system. But Bushnell, who also founded the Chuck E. Cheese's pizza franchise, said profits today aren't the same, or even as important, as success tomorrow. ""I have a feeling -- and this is a funny thing that happens with people who are very buttoned down -- that (Cook) probably thinks he's innovating, when in fact it's just micro-evolution,"" he said. ""They were able to build (the new iPhones) cheaper, which is something I would expect Tim Cook to do. ""But the market cap of Apple is underpinned by its innovation margin,"" Bushnell said, which he believes ""has a shelf life of maybe three to five years. Then, all of a sudden, the followers have matched you feature by feature."" Bushnell is more impressed with Google's approach, which focuses on testing new products and ideas even when some might fail. It may lead to some clunkers, but it's also produced things like a self-driving car and the Google Glass connected headset. Bushnell says Google Glass might not be a huge seller, but it represents a big step toward creating the technology of the future. ""I use some Apple products and like them,"" he said. ""But I lately have been spending much more time in the Google-sphere than the Apple-sphere."" Bushnell reflected on his memories of Steve Jobs, who at 19 showed up in sandals at Atari and demanded an interview, and shared his thoughts on the future of innovation. On hiring the unconventional Jobs . ""Understand that we at Atari at the time thought of ourselves as being quite counterculture. We were really young and somewhat arrogant and we really felt that we could rewrite the rules in an absolute way. We took the attitude of hiring for intensity or passion. That really worked for us. We felt that we could train anybody that had the passion and fire in their belly. Steve -- actually both Steves (referring to Jobs' longtime friend and collaborator Steve Wozniak) -- had passion that was a very different passion, but it was passion. ... Jobs loved kind of seeing the world as it could be, as opposed to what it is. That was an important thing about what our ethic was."" On why he didn't invest early in Apple . ""I didn't think that Steve would be a good chief executive and I didn't have the time to do it. I've often thought one of the unsung heroes was actually (early investor and second Apple CEO) Mike Markkula, who actually provided the adult supervision for the first few years, which I think was really important. If I'd invested and Markkula hadn't been there, the outcome could have been very different."" On 'celebrating failure' ""I don't strive for failure. But what you want to do is strive for appropriate risk. One of the ways you can thwart appropriate risk is by making the penalties for failure high. It's a little bit like the Catholic church and their idea of forgiveness and absolution and all that. Most employees who are really good employees, if they screw up, they feel really bad about it. What you want to do is you want to give them absolution."" ""I defy you to find somebody who's known as an innovator or visionary who hasn't had multiple failures. It's really about doing. It's really about ... being a prime mover that allows you to become a visionary. It's an uncharted path, and when you're on an uncharted path you end up in a cul de sac every once in a while. That doesn't mean that your overall direction isn't correct. You just have to back up and maybe move a little bit more to the right this time, or to the left."" On corporate culture . ""A good company basically says, 'We don't care what you do. We don't care how you do it. You're going to be judged on your outcomes, period. Nothing else matters.' When Atari started in Silicon Valley, then Apple, we were the first and only places where engineers didn't come to work in a coat and tie. So guys who are wearing shorts and T-shirts and flip-flops to work now need to say thank you very much."" ""From a corporate standpoint, think about the difference between the way you think about Google and the way you think about Hewlett Packard. At the outset -- eight years ago, five years ago -- Hewlett Packard had significantly more resources that they could have been innovating with than Google did. Google has the one cash cow (search), but they are planting seeds for their future that I think are extraordinary."" On napping at work . ""Think of your body as your innovation instrument. It turns out that all kinds of cognitive functions are increased in the afternoon with just a 20-minute nap. (NASA studies showed) a 15 to 30% increase in cognitive ability after a 20-minute nap. It's just silly to not do that."" On finding the next Jobs . ""I think there are thousands of them out there. I think the main issue is going to be, are they going to be allowed to perform? Remember, Steve was at an integral point where he was product maven and had control of tremendous amounts of resources at his fingertips. A lot of the Steve Jobses out there don't have that control, don't have those resources at their disposal. They have to be given them. When I hear a company say 'We'll vote on that' or 'We'll get consensus,' you know that they're going to be mediocre. True innovation has no consistency. Nobody sees it until it's done.""","Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell headed the company when Steve Jobs worked there in the '70s .

"(CNN) -- Ralph C. Wilson Jr. -- the founder and longtime beloved owner of the Buffalo Bills, not to mention a leading figure in the NFL's rise to prominence -- has died, his team announced Tuesday. He was 95. Upon forming the Bills in 1959, Wilson became one of the co-founders of the American Football League. A few years later, he was key to negotiations with leaders of the rival National Football League that paved the way for today's immensely popular and profitable professional football league. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called him ""a driving force in developing pro football."" Those efforts and his stewardship of the Buffalo franchise -- including overseeing its run of four straight Super Bowl appearances and keeping it in western New York -- helped earn Wilson entry in 2009 in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ""He was bigger than life in many ways and yet he was the everyday man, driving his Ford Taurus to the local store and greeting everyone as they called out 'Hi, Ralph!'"" Russ Brandon, the Bills CEO and president, said in a statement. ""He will be greatly missed by those in our community whose lives he touched."" The Columbus, Ohio-born Wilson served in the South Pacific during World War II. After returning to the United States, he got into pro football first by buying a minority share in the Detroit Lions and then staking his claim to the Bills franchise. And his new team found almost immediate success, including AFC championships in 1964 and 1965. It took the Bills longer to make history in the newly reincarnated NFL. But for four straight seasons in the early 1990s, the team was the class of the AFC thanks to players like Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas and Bruce Smith. Still, while the Bills notched the second-most wins of any club in the 1990s, they never broke through with a Super Bowl win. Wilson remained a presence in Buffalo for many years, including lending his name to the Bills' home stadium. He gave up control of the organization on January 1, 2013. On Tuesday, the man who took the reins lamented the loss of ""our founder, our mentor, our friend."" ""For those of us fortunate to have worked for him, we'll miss his kindness, his insight, his leadership, but mostly his sense of humor,"" Brandon said. ""He possessed the unique ability to turn a negative into a positive."" Bills players past and present responded with sorrow and tributes to news of Wilson's passing. Andre Reed, a standout wide receiver on those Super Bowl teams who was recently picked for the Hall of Fame, tweeted that Wilson was a ""#GreatOwner #Fatherfigure."" Current Bills offensive lineman Eric Wood wrote: ""Rest in peace to a great man.""","NEW: Andre Reed calls Wilson a father figure; current player says he was a ""great man""

"(CNN) -- Leading former FIFA insider Alexandra Wrage is calling for a new vote over the selection of the 2022 World Cup hosts given the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision to award Qatar the event. Without any football pedigree and despite concerns over staging the world's most prestigious tournament in a desert climate, the Middle East nation emerged as the surprise winner of the vote by FIFA'S Executive Committee in December 2010, when beating the United States in a 14-8 vote in the decisive round. The choice has raised far more questions than answers. Notably regarding the season in which the World Cup would be played. There has been repeated talk of switching the tournament to winter in a bid to avoid the sweltering heat of Qatar's summers. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has also admitted that the vote to decide both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to possible collusion among bidding nations. Another issue has been many allegations of corruption -- with the latest surrounding former FIFA official, Jack Warner, which were revealed earlier this week. The Qatari World Cup committee as well as prominent FIFA officials have steadfastly denied the allegations. But the questions prompted FIFA to create an Independent Governance Committee (IGC) in 2011. The aim was for the IGC to propose methods to restore the reputation of football's global body. Yet former member Wrage -- an anti-corruption authority who resigned in April 2013 over frustration at what she described as FIFA's resistance to reform -- believes drastic action is needed to correct the decision to award the tournament to Qatar. Even current Executive Committee member Theo Zwanziger has described it as a ""blatant mistake."" ""The only way to restore confidence in the World Cup selection process is to rerun the vote,"" Wrage, the president of non-profit international anti-bribery group Trace, told CNN. ""Having said that, I don't expect it to happen and expect, instead, that the process will be further contorted with a controversial move to winter and a great deal of stalling and shifting on the human rights issues raised by the selection of Qatar."" The treatment of migrant construction workers toiling around the clock to deliver new stadiums and, in some cases, whole new cities ahead of the finals has been another unwanted aspect of FIFA's decision to hand the finals to Qatar. The global body has since tasked Germany's Zwanziger with addressing the convoluted issue of labor rights in Qatar. A report is expected at this week's FIFA conference in Zurich, which starts on Thursday. FIFA's Ethics Committee, headed by the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York -- Michael Garcia -- is also busy, currently investigating allegations of corruption regarding the vote for the 2022 World Cup site. The American may have more paperwork to sift through after a British newspaper published a damning story this week. The Daily Telegraph claims a company owned by former Executive Committee member Jack Warner invoiced one owned by Qatar's former FIFA vice-president and Asian football chief Mohammed Bin Hammam for a substantial sum of funds within a month of the 2022 voting decision. ""I have no comment to make on any article -- but feel free to write whatever you wish,"" Warner told CNN in response to the claims. Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organising Committee has also issued a statement to refute the allegations made in the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday. ""The 2022 Bid Committee strictly adhered to FIFA's bidding regulations in compliance with their code of ethics,"" it read. ""The Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy and the individuals involved in the 2022 Bid Committee are unaware of any allegations surrounding business dealings between private individuals."" Amidst the constant questioning over the decision to take the World Cup to the Middle East for the first time since the competition started in 1930, Wrage believes more still needs to be done by FIFA. ""To restore confidence, the public needs to see a serious and broad investigation of all allegations - with prompt and meaningful consequences for any wrongdoing,"" she argues. ""In spite of some recent governance improvements, there is still a widespread sense that FIFA provides far too little transparency."" Shortly after her resignation from the IGC, Wrage wrote a piece for Forbes.com stating her belief that the ""only entity capable of insisting on transparency at FIFA is the Swiss government."" This came after FIFA rejected proposals from the IGC to introduce two members to the Executive Committee who were independent as well as a compromise proposal that the Chairman of FIFA's Audit Committee should be an independent observer at all ExCo meetings. Seeking comment, CNN contacted the four other nations beaten by Qatar: the U.S., Australia, South Korea and Japan. Only the latter replied, saying that it ""does not have a comment on a supposition."" Australia has previously said it will pursue compensation if the 2022 finals are switched from summer to winter months.","Former FIFA insider calls for a fresh vote on the 2022 World Cup .

"(EW.com) -- It's hard out there for a plus-sized-and-proud actress like Melissa McCarthy — especially in a world where svelte Jennifer Lawrence considers herself ""obese"" by Hollywood standards. But McCarthy has built a career even the tiniest starlet should envy — one that's included an Emmy (and another nomination), an Oscar nod, and roles in two $100 million-plus-grossing comedies in the past two years. Even so, McCarthy's weight has made her a target for Photoshop-happy marketing execs, mean-spirited Internet commenters (that's right, guys — we see you!), and at least one film critic. The New York Observer's Rex Reed famously attacked McCarthy in his review of ""Identity Thief"" this past February, calling her ""tractor-sized,"" a ""female hippo,"" and ""a gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success."" His comments quickly went viral, prompting online rage but no direct response from the comedian herself — until now. The very mention of Reed's remarks was enough to strip McCarthy of her normally sunny tone, according to a new profile in The New York Times. Her first reaction to the review was pure shock: ""Really? Why would someone O.K. that?"" As somebody raising two daughters during a ""strange epidemic of body image and body dysmorphia,"" the article felt particularly stinging to her. But ultimately, the star of the upcoming comedy ""The Heat"" decided that it's better to take the high road: ""I felt really bad for someone who is swimming in so much hate,"" McCarthy told the Times. ""I just thought, that's someone who's in a really bad spot, and I am in such a happy spot. I laugh my head off every day with my husband and my kids who are mooning me and singing me songs."" The Times writes that McCarthy seemed to have more to say — until she was rudely interrupted by a blaring fire alarm. ""I imagine that's my publicist,"" she told her interviewer with a laugh.

"(CNN) -- The top Republican on the Senate committee that oversees the Justice Department issued a blistering criticism of Attorney General Eric Holder and his department for failing to pursue criminal charges against a giant global bank that admits violating federal laws by laundering money on behalf of Iran, Libya, Sudan and Myanmar. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, sent his stinging letter to Holder Thursday, calling it ""inexcusable"" for the department not to prosecute criminal behavior by the British banking giant HSBC. In a settlement reached Tuesday, HSBC agreed to pay the U.S. government $1.92 billion in a wide-ranging agreement. Any prosecution in the case was ""deferred,"" meaning it is unlikely anyone from the bank will ever go to jail for wrongdoing. ""What I have seen from the department is an inexplicable unwillingness to prosecute and convict those responsible for aiding and abetting drug lords and terrorists,"" Grassley wrote. ""By allowing these individuals to walk away without any real punishment, the department is declaring that crime actually does pay,"" Grassley asserted. The Justice Department had no immediate comment Thursday. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer defended the settlement Tuesday in a New York news conference. Breuer said, ""HSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight."" HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver released a statement Tuesday, saying ""we accept responsibility for our past mistakes.""","The Justice Department reached settlement with HSBC in money laundering investigation .

"(CNN) -- Here's something shocking. Democrats and Republicans totally disagree about the significance of the GOP's victory in the first major competitive congressional ballot box test of 2014. Republican candidate David Jolly narrowly edged out Democrat Alex Sink to win Tuesday's special election in Florida's 13th Congressional District. Jolly will fill out the term of his former boss, longtime Republican Rep. Bill Young, who died in October. Republicans win first election showdown of the year . The race was consistently in the spotlight with national Republicans framing the election as a referendum on Obamacare. They injected a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race and some pundits cast the election as a possible bellwether for November's midterms. ""I think this was a referendum on (President Barack Obama's) policies and on Obamacare, that played out significantly to the disadvantage of (House Democratic Leader) Nancy Pelosi. And I think it sets the tone for what's coming in the fall,"" Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told CNN Wednesday. ""We've been trying to tell people this is a referendum election, Obamacare is not helping people the way it was promised, and Democrats are going to have a lot of answering to do,"" Walden added. But his counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sees very little predictive value in the results. ""Special elections are not indicators of the future. They never have been. They never will be. And certainly this is not an indicator of the future,"" Rep. Steve Israel, the DCCC chairman, told reporters. Special coverage: 2014 Midterm Elections . While a contest this far out from Election Day rarely offers a preview of what will actually happen in November, Jolly's victory gives the GOP instant bragging rights. And the results also illustrate a few things about how the midterm election season may play out. GOP's convinced Obamacare's bad medicine for Democrats: While the candidates and local matters weighed heavily in the race, Obamacare was also a key issue. And Jolly's victory will only embolden Republican attempts top repeal the Affordable Care Act. ""His (Jolly's) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day said in an email blast to reporters. Many of the ads attacking Sink focused on health care. ""Canceled health plans. Higher premiums. Medicare cuts. People losing their doctors. A disaster for families and seniors. For Alex Sink, the priority is Obamacare. Not us,"" said the narrator in a TV commercial by the Chamber of Commerce, which backed Jolly. That was a potent message in a district that's one of the grayest in the nation. Nearly a quarter of all residents in Florida-13 are 65 or older. Jolly said he was committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely. Sink recognized that Obamacare was a major issue. While she highlighted how the Affordable Care Act has helped people, she also noted that the law has flaws and said she was open to GOP proposals to amend some of the measure's requirements. The Democratic National Committee claimed the issue of health care actually kept the contest close. The most important poll number of 2014 . ""Republicans fell short of their normal margin in this district because the agenda they are offering voters has a singular focus - that a majority of voters oppose - repealing the Affordable Care Act that would return us to the same old broken health care system,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the DNC chair. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told reporters that ""based on polling we did up until the election, Alex Sink basically neutralized the issue of the Affordable Care Act."" But Garin noted that Obamacare energized the GOP electorate. ""We have to acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act was a motivating issue for Republicans to come out and vote, and less so for Democrats,"" he said. Last autumn's flawed rollout of the health care law and the controversy over canceled policies because of Obamacare played into Republican hands. And the President's inaccurate pledge that ""If you like your insurance, you can keep it"" under the new health care law is a line that dominated GOP attack ads the past few months. Even before Tuesday's GOP victory, Republicans pledged to keep the campaign focus on the health care law, even if it starts to gain traction with the public. A number of Republican strategists CNN reached out to on Wednesday said that while the focus won't be 100% on Obamacare, they admit it will remain a huge part of how they frame the midterms. Non-partisan analysts agree. Republicans hit Landrieu over climate change all-nighter . ""The one thing Republicans will take away from this race is that the Obamacare assault worked. We're going to see more and more and more,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. ""Regardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about November, the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""Jolly's win means it's all about Obamacare for the GOP."" Outside money really mattered: In Sink, national Democrats landed the high-profile and well-known candidate they wanted in this race, and she faced nominal opposition in January's Democratic primary. Jolly was far from the GOP's dream candidate, and he had to battle to win his party's nomination. The past two months, he faced a barrage of attacks by Democrats on his days as a lobbyist and his work for groups pushing to privatize Social Security. Sink, meanwhile, greatly out-raised, and outspent Jolly. But support from outside groups gave Jolly a major boost. Since it's one of a dwindling number of competitive districts and since it was the only game in town, outside money poured into the race. It was the most expensive contest so far this cycle, topping even last year's special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. In addition to the approximate $2.5 million spent by the two campaigns, the party committees and outside groups dished out more than $9 million to run TV and radio ads, other paid media and direct mail, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors outside spending. The pro-Republican group American Crossroads, which said it spent $500,000 on the contest, said that Florida-13 was just an appetizer . ""A lot of us rolled up our sleeves after 2012, studied the Obama playbook and invested in targeted voter turnout and more effective messaging. The Florida CD-13 special was an important test market and there was unprecedented cooperation among outside groups. We intend to keep refining these lessons as we prepare for the fall elections,"" said Crossroads CEO Stephen Law. Turnout mattered: Florida-13, which is a swing district in a swing state, covers most of Pinellas County between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, including parts of St. Petersburg. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district in his 2008 and 2012 victories. So what happened Tuesday? Jolly won by around 3,500 votes out of some 180,000 cast. A libertarian candidate grabbed just under 5% of the vote. The plain and simple truth is that Sink lost because Democratic voters didn't vote. Turnout in the 2012 election was nearly double what it was in the special election. Democratic officials Wednesday said by their calculations, the GOP had a plus-13 advantage in the voting electorate in Tuesday's special election, compared to a plus-five advantage for the Republicans in the district in 2012. ""The reality is Alex Sink was able to narrow a very large Republican advantage in turnout. She did very well with independent voters,"" said Garin. And Israel vowed to win the district come November, when he says the electorate will be more slightly more favorable to the Democrats. ""If this election were in November instead of March, I think Alex Sink would have won,"" Israel added. A veteran Democratic strategist says his party has some hard work ahead. ""While it is true that a special election often has lower turnout (and thus is more likely to be won by a Republican), I think Democrats spin this loss at their own peril. We lost, period,"" said CNN contributor Paul Begala. ""It means we have to redouble our efforts to register and turn out the Rising American Electorate: people of color, unmarried women, young people. We will never be able to match the right wing dollar-for-dollar, so we have to beat them voter-to-voter,"" he said. Steep road got steeper: The Democrats odds of winning back the House in November just got a little bit slimmer. With Jolly's win keeping the congressional seat in GOP hands, the Democrats still need win 17 seats in the midterms to regain control of the chamber. Political handicappers consider that a tall order, considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts nationwide.","Republican David Jolly narrowly beat Democrat Alex Sink in a special election .

"(CNN) -- Air India has suspended a pilot and two flight attendants after an overstay incident on a flight last month. The airline denied as ""baseless"" numerous local and international media reports claiming two pilots had vacated the cockpit for almost an hour during a flight between Bangkok and New Delhi. ""At no point of time the cockpit was left unattended by the cockpit crew,"" the airline said in a statement. The airline said it conducted an inquiry after it was notified that cabin crew members were in the cockpit for a prolonged period. ""The inquiry confirmed the overstay of the cabin crew in the cockpit (and) administrative action was taken against them and the pilot. They have been suspended pending the final inquiry of the incident,"" the airline said. ""At Air India, flight safety is paramount. We take all steps to ensure that safety is not compromised under any circumstances."" The Times of India reported the two flight attendants were in the cockpit on flight 133 from Bangkok to the Indian capital on April 12 for almost an hour and were sitting in the pilot and co-pilot's seat. The Times of India reported that at some point during the overstay the plane's autopilot function was inadvertently disengaged. ""It never happens that two flight attendants are called inside the cockpit at the same time as happened on this flight. This is very strange,"" a senior commander was quoted by The Times of India.","Earlier media reports said plane's pilots both left the cockpit .

"Jackson Hole, China (CNN) -- Looking for a weekend escape from the city, Annie Liu and her husband fell in love at first sight with a log home in Jackson Hole and bought it for less than $300,000. Five years on, a weekly 90-minute drive from their downtown apartment to the house has long been the norm. They enjoy gardening, barbecuing or simply relaxing in their getaway surrounded by mountains -- but often shrouded in Beijing's infamous smog. Yes, the couple's three-bedroom weekend home lies on the outskirts of the Chinese capital -- thousands of miles away from the original Jackson Hole valley in the U.S. state of Wyoming, which is known for its breathtaking natural beauty. The Chinese Jackson Hole is more crowded, containing some 1,000 single-family houses inspired by rustic lodges in the American frontier. Still, wealthy locals are lured to this sprawling development by the promise of living in the ""Wild West."" After driving past security guards in cowboy outfits patrolling ""Route 66"" on golf carts, Liu's husband Lu Jun pulled over their SUV at the end of a cul-de-sac one recent Sunday. Opening the door to a world of Americana, Liu and Lu -- both lawyers in Beijing -- proudly displayed their fondness for the United States by adding personal touches to the built-in furniture and decoration that evoke the Old West. She studied and worked in Indianapolis for two years from 2003 to 2005, during which time he visited. Adorning the earthy-toned walls are colorful license plates from the U.S. states -- including Wyoming -- they have traveled to and a large framed copy of the American Declaration of Independence. ""We want more freedom,"" said Liu, 40, pointing to the framed copy she bought in Florida. ""This is a milestone -- (we hang it here) partially for the history, partially for our profession."" ""Many people have been to the United States and enjoy the environment there,"" Lu, 55, added. ""Those who haven't think this place is authentic America and they like it."" That's proven to be a great selling point for developer Liu Xiangyang since he -- with the help of an American designer -- launched the Jackson Hole project a decade ago. He has sold almost all the houses, and seen the property value double over the years with the bigger homes now fetching $1 million each. Official data shows that a typical urban resident in China earned less than $4,000 in 2012. Annie Liu -- who is not related to the developer -- and her husband feel pleased about their purchase as early believers, and bought a second, bigger house here last year. They say other homeowners share their appreciation for the American culture and values that are reflected in the architecture and setting, despite frequent news reports on rising tensions between the two nations. ""We like the States and we like the lifestyle,"" Liu said. ""Let the governments worry about the things that should be worried about by them."" Her sentiment echoes the most recent results of an annual survey on Chinese people's attitude towards the United States by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Although the Pew study finds Chinese public perceptions of the United States becoming less favorable in 2012, it notes: ""There is one constant: richer, younger, more educated, and urban Chinese all express a more positive view of (the soft power) aspects of America's image. And this also holds true for overall ratings of the U.S."" Developer Liu is a fan of the United States as well, overseeing construction for the next phase on his 70-square-kilometer lot -- the size of 13,000 American football fields. His plans include 2,000 townhouses mimicking the feel of Mendocino, a scenic coastal town in northern California, and a winery that he says will rival Napa Valley in ten years. In between sipping wine and chatting with residents at a lunch gathering on site, the 51-year-old businessman from the central Henan province reflects on his corporate mission. ""For those who can afford to buy houses here, they have enough money,"" he explained. ""They want spiritual fulfillment."" For that, the developer has built a brand new church in the center of his town -- next to a row of small shops, bars and cafes -- serving residents like Annie Liu, who embraced Christianity as a graduate student in the United States. ""This is an 'American' community so it's a necessary element here,"" said Liu as she walked out of the soon-to-open Jackson Hole church. Although she misses the natural beauty and cultural diversity of the United States, Liu says she never hesitated about returning to the motherland because of her and her husband's career aspirations and their roots. Now comfortably settled at work and home back in China, where the Communist leadership is proclaiming national revival as the ultimate Chinese Dream, Liu feels she hasn't completely abandoned the American Dream -- as she and her fellow residents in this fictional U.S. town pursue their freedom and happiness every weekend.","A Chinese developer has built an American-themed town 90 minutes from Beijing .

"(CNN) -- Mary Willingham tried to help struggling student-athletes at the University of North Carolina learn to read. First it was just one case, then another and another. Seeing a bigger problem, Willingham researched the reading abilities of football and basketball players at the Chapel Hill campus, and then raised the alarm when she found many with only elementary school literacy, so low they were unable to follow college courses. The Drake Group selected Willingham in April as the 10th recipient of an award recognizing university faculty or staff who speak out about academic integrity at their institutions. Many of them risked their jobs doing it. One of the earliest whistle-blowers was Jan Kemp, who in the early 1980s exposed the University of Georgia for allowing football players who failed a remedial English class to play in a bowl game. ""There is no real sound academic reason for their being here other than to be utilized to produce income."" Kemp told Sports Illustrated in 1986. ""They are used as a kind of raw material in the production of some goods to be sold ... and they get nothing in return."" She was demoted and then fired, and the trauma led her to attempt suicide twice in the 1980s, once by stabbing herself in the chest with a butcher knife. She also sued UGA officials, saying she was terminated unlawfully, and won compensatory and punitive damages from a jury. She was later reinstated at the university and Georgia later tightened academic standards for its athletes, the New York Times reported in 2008. She was the Drake Group's first honoree in 2004. The group, an organization of educators and activists who push for academic reform, now annually awards its Higgins Award on faculty who stand up for academic integrity. Kemp died four years later, her son told The Associated Press as reported by the New York Times, of complications from Alzheimer's disease. The harassment that haunted Kemp has happened to several others since. In the late 1990s, Linda Bensel-Meyers was in a similar position at Tennessee -- an English teacher who saw tutors doing far too much work for athletes who were far too under-prepared for college coursework. In 2003, after years of hate mail and verbal attacks, she decided to leave Tennessee because death threats mentioned her children. Bensel-Meyers said she was treated so badly she had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, â€Žand when she resigned, she told the university in her resignation letter: ""No faculty member should ever find her attempts to do her job met with institutional threats and public attacks on her character."" Tennessee, when contacted by CNN, would not say whether it still uses the system that Bensel-Meyers alleged was in place -- where a school psychologist would diagnose learning-disabled athletes and put them in a program that allowed them to forgo graduation requirements all other students had to meet. ""Many of the records I looked at revealed that these athletes came to us essentially illiterate and still left the school functionally illiterate."" Bensel-Meyers told CNN. In 2009, Sally Dear-Healey, adjunct lecturer at Binghamton University, told the New York Times she was pressured to change her grading policy for basketball players who were missing classes. About seven months later, she was fired, and The Times reported that Dear-Healey felt it was because she spoke out. The university denied that charge. Louisiana State University instructor Tiffany Terrell-Mayne settled a lawsuit with the school in 2005 after alleging she was told to change grades to keep football players eligible for a bowl game. LSU admitted to some NCAA violations in the early 2000s, and the probe went away. Then-coach Nick Saban said publicly that he knew of no cheating. Then-Chancellor Mark Emmert -- now the president of the NCAA -- said at the time Terrell-Mayne and another whistle-blower were tying personal issues to NCAA violations.â€Ž . Willingham said that since she began speaking out about what she saw at the University of North Carolina, she has felt harassed by the university. She took her grievances to a peer panel at UNC, but they found no evidence of retaliation.â€Ž . Read more from Willingham and what CNN found . ""It's very sad that people like Linda, Mary and others, who are dedicated to higher education, have to be subjected to this kind of intimidation for merely doing their jobs,"" said Allen Sack, director of the Drake Group.","College staff who complain about student-athlete learning say they are harassed .

"(CNN) -- Wrigley has decided to stop production, sales and marketing of their new caffeinated gum, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday. The company's decision follows meetings with the FDA to discuss the government agency's concerns about the effect the gum has on children and adolescents. Alert Energy Caffeine Gum was introduced earlier this month by Wrigley, a division of Mars Inc. One piece contains 40 mg of caffeine, the same amount found in a half cup of coffee. The gum comes in two flavors: mint and fruit. When it's chewed, the caffeine is released into your saliva. Some some gets swallowed as if you were drinking coffee or a soda; some is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the cheeks and under the tongue. ""The FDA applauds Wrigley's decision and its recognition that we need to improve understanding and, as needed, strengthen the regulatory framework governing the appropriate levels and uses of caffeine in foods and beverages,"" said Michael Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. ""The company's action demonstrates real leadership and commitment to the public health. We hope others in the food industry will exercise similar restraint."" Wrigley was only the latest company to introduce caffeinated chewing gum; a number are already on the market. The company released a statement about their decision to stop production. ""When Wrigley launched Alert Energy Caffeine Gum, we took great strides to ensure that the product was formulated, distributed and marketed in a safe and responsible way to consumers 25 years old and over,"" Wrigley President Casey Keller said. ""After discussions with the FDA, we have a greater appreciation for its concern about the proliferation of caffeine in the nation's food supply. There is a need for changes in the regulatory framework to better guide the consumers and the industry about the appropriate level and use of caffeinated products."" In recent years, controversy has also swirled around energy drinks, which also contain caffeine. In November, the FDA began investigating 13 deaths preliminarily linked to the dietary supplement 5-Hour Energy. Monster Energy adds caffeine content to labels . The deaths had been reported to the FDA as ""adverse events,"" which does not mean that the product is responsible for or that it contributed to any health issue. The manufacturer, packer or distributor of a dietary supplement is required to notify the FDA of any adverse events linked to its product, according to agency spokeswoman Tamara Ward. That requirement does not apply to products sold as beverages or food. Taylor said the agency looks forward to working with industry leaders ""to address the issues posed by added caffeine in foods and beverages.""","Wrigley introduced Alert Energy Caffeine Gum earlier this month .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- It's very rarely African cities get compared with their flashy European counterparts, yet, when it comes to cost of living Lagos isn't just competing with its neighbors in Europe -- it's beating them. Hotel rooms in Lagos, now the 30th most expensive city in the world, now cost hundreds of dollars a night. Nigeria's coastal economic and financial capital is the shock entry in the top 50 cities of this year's Mercer Cost of Living survey. The vibrant home to almost eight million Nigerians beat off the likes of Barcelona, Berlin and Brussels, and even U.S. locations such as Washington and Los Angeles -- to be rated the 30th most expensive city in the world. Its streets are now home to BMWs, its waterways play host to multi-million dollar super-yachts, and its hotel rooms fetch hundreds of dollars per night. Yes, if the Mercer survey is anything to go by this is an economic ""boom-town."" But, how can a city from such a notoriously poverty-stricken region of the world rise to join this list of riches? The answer: a mix of democracy, private investment and tourism -- according to Lagos governor, Babatunde Fashola. Part of the city's current level of development undoubtedly rests with the growth achieved during the oil boom of the 1970s, which saw a population explosion and unrestrained economic growth. But Fashola believes there are number of contemporary factors pushing the seventh fastest growing metropolis in the world forwards into a ""truly international city."" There is a wealth of local resources which has helped the region grow, and now private sector business is becoming the major driver to financial success. ""The government is trying to engage with the private sector. It's about engaging in partnerships with the private sector -- partnerships that other countries have used successfully for a long time. ""I think [Lagos is] beginning to take its rightful place in the community of top international cities."" Fashola believes the democratic climate in Nigeria has helped the Lagos region develop by offering new-found freedom to local governments, private investors, and other independent groups. ""There's no perfect democracy. But, if you look at where we came from almost nine years ago, when you couldn't criticize government, we are better off today. Elected officials can now be held to account."" He said that the environment allowed for more robust planning between the government, individuals and the wider public. Independent investors are helping improve local services by investing in private hospitals and schools, but Fashola admits there is still plenty of work to be done, with infrastructure still not up to the standards of other major cities around the world. ""These other cities like New York have reliable and efficient power supply 24 hours a day. We still do not have that in Lagos."" He told CNN he did not agree with Mercer's cost of living survey placing Lagos as the ""30th most expensive city in the world."" ""Life can not be measured like this. You can't compare Lagos with other cities across the globe and across the continent. ""You can not put them on the same scale as they do not have the same resources and infrastructure,"" Fashola said. He added that Lagos is expensive compared to other parts of the country, but that was like comparing prices between ""London and Milton Keynes."" ""The greater the population and the greater the demand for goods, then the forces of demand and supply will push up the price,"" he said. Despite this, Fashola believes the development of Lagos has not made the city unaffordable for locals. Some central city rents are said to be as high as US$6,000-$7,000 per month, but Fashola said the situation was the same in many European cities, and locals were surviving. However, if prices are high now, there's little to suggest they will ease in the near future. Fashola said the growing number of tourists are bringing a lot of new money into the city. ""People are coming in as tourists, but tourists are also investors. They come here to do business at the same time,"" he said. He believes the key to Lagos' future is catering to these groups. ""We are providing a mix of business and pleasure. A city where people can live, work and play. ""I would like it to become a truly international city, and a center of tourism and business. It has a wonderful Atlantic coastline and we need to use it,"" Fashola said. If cost of living measures and growth meters are anything to go by -- Lagos is well on the way to that end.","Lagos, Nigeria is the 30th most expensive city in the world .
It beat cities like Barcelona, Brussels, Washington and Los Angeles .
Private investment and tourism have help local development .

"(CNN) -- The federal government has reversed a proposed cut that could have left millions who get their health insurance through the Medicare Advantage plan paying more for coverage. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced Monday the final Medicare Advantage rates for 2014. CMS had initially proposed a 2.3% reduction in what the government pays the insurance companies that provide the plans -- a move that would have saved the government money but potentially would cost the public more. However, CMS on Monday announced a 3.3% increase instead. Insurance companies were upset by the proposed cut, and spent the public comment period time lobbying legislators and running ads against it. Ads from the America's Health Insurance Plans' Coalition for Medicare Choices called the proposal ""drastic"" and ""too much"" and featured seniors saying they can't afford to pay more for health care. About 25% of the 47 million Americans on Medicare pay more to have Medicare Advantage. The plans are run by private insurance companies that are reimbursed by the government for doing so. The plans vary, but they offer the elderly more than they would get with regular Medicare. Most plans offer prescription drug coverage; some also offer dental and vision. All the plans cap a person's out-of-pocket expenses, while regular Medicare does not. Seniors won't know what their out-of-pocket costs will be until the fall, when insurance companies put in their bids for government work.","The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reverses a proposed cut .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Though on the surface it seems like another typical day in central Bangkok -- hot, muggy and busy, with traffic snarls around town -- tension is rising as protesters continue to exert pressure on the Thai prime minister to step down. Thousands of demonstrators were expected to march on key ministerial buildings on Wednesday to demand an end to the government of Yingluck Shinawatra, ahead of a no-confidence vote in parliament on Thursday. The escalating political tension has prompted travel updates from 23 foreign governments, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry. Among the countries warning their citizens to be vigilant are the UK, the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, Sweden and Singapore. Locals and tourists appear unconcerned . For those not plugged into official information sources, there are few signs of what's being broadcast around the world -- images of government ministries under siege, rallies filled with thousands of cheering anti-government protesters and video of Yingluck explaining to the nation why she's implementing the Internal Security Act (ISA). The ISA gives law enforcement officials and the military additional powers, including the right to impose curfews, put up checkpoints, restrict the movement of demonstrators and search for weapons. Away from the affected sites it's pretty much life as normal in most parts of wider Bangkok. But while it's easy to avoid protests, as of Wednesday morning the situation had become extremely fluid and increasingly worrisome to some observers. While the number of demonstrators, led by the Democrat Party, has declined from the 100,000 reported on Sunday, protesters claim tens of thousands of people are still on the streets. Authorities say the figure is closer to 10,000. On Wednesday, they'll split into two or more groups, according to Akanat Promphan, a spokesman for the protesters. He told CNN they plan to march to a number of government buildings, including the ministries for Public Health, Social Development, Labor, and Science and Technology. Another group is heading to a complex outside the city which houses a number of government offices. A primary target in this location is the Department of Special Investigation. A city accustomed to protests . The capital's residents have become accustomed to political uprisings, hence the business-as-usual attitude among locals. Thailand was wracked with turbulence for four years after a 2006 coup, culminating in a 2010 army crackdown on supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of the current prime minister. More than 90 people were killed in the violence. Foreign government have warned their citizens to be vigilant, despite assurances from the Thai government that authorities will ""absolutely not use violence"" to disperse the demonstrators. On its website, the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office said, ""A number of political demonstrations have taken place in various locations in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand since the start of November 2013."" ""Further large scale protests are taking place with little warning, at various locations in Bangkok. The main ongoing protest area situated along Rachadamnoen Avenue including Democracy Monument in Bangkok has now expanded to include protests at a number of government buildings in central Bangkok."" In its security message to citizens, the United States Embassy in Bangkok said. ""Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence."" Russian foreign ministry tells citizens to avoid Bangkok . Though most government warnings advised citizens to avoid protest areas, Russian media reports say their Foreign Ministry advises tourists to avoid the capital completely. ""The possibility of further escalation of the unrest should not be ruled out,"" the ministry said in a statement quoted by news agency RIA. ""In this respect, we recommend that Russians avoid visiting Bangkok. Those already there should take due care, comply with law enforcement officers' demands and avoid crowded areas."" Protests, what protests? Security concerns notwithstanding, some tourists who spoke with CNN didn't even realize protests were taking place in Bangkok. Others said they were aware of the situation, but weren't concerned. British traveler Charles Rowson, 43, who is on a 10-day vacation with his family, said he was keeping an eye on developments. ""I have been reading the local papers to keep up on the political situation and our hotel briefs us daily on the areas to avoid,"" he said, while waiting for his hotel's courtesy ferry to pick him up from the Saphan Taksin pier. Tourism is a concern for the nation's travel industry right now, as Thailand enters its high season. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the tourism and travel sector contributed $27.99 billion, or 7.3%, to Thailand's GDP in 2012. A report on state-run website MCOT cites a senior Bangkok Metropolitan Administration official as saying tourism revenue may fall 10% lower than projected if the political demonstrations continue. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Despite anti-government protests, Bangkok residents remain calm, unconcerned .

"Antakya, Turkey (CNN) -- Demonstrators congregated in central squares in Istanbul on Sunday, blowing giant bubbles, blaring music and chanting ""down with the government"" for a ""Peace Day"" rally. The annual anti-war protest was organized amid a Turkish government effort to push the U.S. to intervene militarily in neighboring Syria. Turkey's prime minister has made no secret of the fact that he would like the U.S. to lead an effort to topple Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. On condition of anonymity, Turkish government officials have shown respect for the American democratic decision-making process, while also expressing disappointment at President Barack Obama's announcement Saturday that he would seek congressional approval before launching any attack on Syria. ""We are not thrilled with the delay and uncertainty that today's announcement entails,"" wrote one Turkish official, describing his government's reaction. On Friday, as the Obama administration was still mulling the possibility of a strike against the al-Assad regime, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told journalists ""a limited intervention will not satisfy us."" ""It should be like the one in Kosovo,"" he added, referring to the 1998-99 U.S.-led campaign to drive Serbian troops out of that contested region in the Balkans. ""The intervention shouldn't be a one- to two-day hit and run. It should bring the regime to the brink of giving up,"" Erdogan said. Erdogan's outspoken opposition to the al-Assad regime, and his government's overt and covert support to armed Syrian rebels, have proven divisive in Turkey. A senior Turkish official concedes that the Syrian policy has been criticized as ""un-Islamic"" by some influential members of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party. ""Before the prime minister expressed support for the rebels, Assad had killed only 5,000 people,"" the official said, on condition of anonymity. ""But now more than 100,000 people have died, and it has gone from being a sectarian conflict to a sectarian war."" In the Turkish border province of Hatay, which has absorbed some of the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who have flooded into Turkey since the conflict erupted more than two years ago, leftist opposition groups prepared to stage their own anti-war rallies in the provincial capital of Antakya. There is substantial sympathy among some members of Hatay's Alawite religious minority for al-Assad, who is also a member of the Alawite sect. Critics accuse Erdogan of supporting Syria's overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim armed opposition. The ranks of its armed fighters have swelled over the last year with jihadi volunteers traveling through Turkey to Syria from North Africa, Europe and North America.","Demonstrators at annual anti-war gathering chant ""down with the government""

"(CNN) -- Armed confrontations and roadside bombs made for a bloody day in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Wednesday, claiming the lives of at least 16 people -- including militants who died in a battle with the Iraqi army, police in Mosul said. The army killed 10 members of the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and detained 16 others in a security operation in southern Mosul, according to Gen. Mehdi al-Garawi, commander of federal police in predominantly Sunni Muslim Nineveh province. In western Mosul, three police officers were killed and six others were wounded when several roadside bombs exploded near police patrols, police officials said. Also in western Mosul, gunmen fatally shot a civilian while he was driving a car Wednesday, Mosul police said. And in eastern Mosul, Iraqi soldiers killed two gunmen who tried to attack an army checkpoint, police in the city said. Iraq has been engulfed in violence for many months. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed in violence, most of them civilians. Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since fighting broke out recently to the west of Baghdad in Anbar province, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraq's security forces have been battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. Mosul, the capital of Nineveh province, is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Baghdad.

"(CNN) -- A Siberian Tiger mauled a man Monday morning after he and a friend scaled the fence of the Calgary Zoo and pressed up against the tiger cage, zoo officials said. Two-year-old Vitali is normally one of the more laid back tigers, zoo officials said Monday. ""The information we have is that while his injuries appear not to be life-threatening. They are, however, quite serious,"" Graham Netwon, the zoo's director and chief financial officer, said at a news conference Monday. Officials said two men scaled the zoo's 8-foot perimeter fence, which also is covered in barbed wire, about 1 a.m. Monday morning. The two 27-year-old men, who were not identified, then headed toward the tiger cage, where they scaled a safety fence meant to keep the public away. The two men never entered the cage, but stood in between the safety fence and another fence meant to ""keep the tigers in"" when they startled a 2-year-old Siberan tiger named Vitali.  Watch Vitali inside the zoo enclosure » . Vitali ""has a fairly significant armament at his disposal: very sharp claws,"" said Dr. Sandie Black, the zoo's head veterinarian. Once the tiger was startled, he probably clawed one of the men, officials said. ""My guess would be that the gentleman was hooked by a claw and the arm dragged in and then continued to be attacked from that point,"" Black said during the news conference. The second man then struggled to help his friend escape the tiger's grasp, officials said. The tiger was likely trying to protect itself, officials added. ""He's perfectly fine. A tiger is a carnivore, so they're going to behave naturally, and that's his natural reaction,"" zoo curator Tim Sinclair-Smith said. ""Vitali has certainly done nothing wrong here. It's his natural behavior,"" Sinclair-Smith said. Vitali will remain in the exhibit. The tiger had not previously attacked any people, Black said. ""In the normal course of a day, Vitali is one our most laid-back cats, I would say,"" Black added. Calgary Police Department Acting Staff Sgt. Rick Halford said authorities were investigating the case and will decide whether to pursue charges against either man. Zoo officials and police said they had no idea what the motive was for breaking into the zoo, or nearing the tiger cage. ""There's no indication that the two offenders were involved in anything other than just being silly, I suppose,"" Halford said.","Men scaled perimeter fence, safety fence in front of tiger cage, officials said .

"(CNN) -- A California police officer won his appeal Monday at the Supreme Court, after being sued for chasing a suspect onto private property without a warrant. At issue is whether a homeowner's ""expectation of privacy"" was violated, since there was no ""immediate danger"" to law enforcement and the alleged offense -- disobeying the police -- was a misdemeanor. The justices said Officer Mike Stanton of the La Mesa Police Department had ""qualified immunity"" from civil claims of unreasonable search and seizure. ""There is no suggestion in this case that Officer Stanton knowingly violated the Constitution,"" specifically the Fourth Amendment, said the unsigned opinion from the high court. ""Stanton may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified, but he was not 'plainly incompetent.' "" Judges generally give wide latitude in justifying police chases involving felonies and use of weapons, but in cases where the circumstances are less clear, there can be tricky legal questions like those presented here. The incident happened in May 2008, in a neighborhood east of San Diego that lower courts had said was known for ""violence associated with drug gangs."" Stanton and his partner responded to a 911 call about an ""unknown disturbance"" concerning a person with a baseball bat. The officers arrived in their marked vehicle, saw three people and ordered them to stop. One of the men, who carried no noticeable weapon, ran into a nearby fenced residential yard. Stanton pursued, and believing the suspect had committed a misdemeanor, made the ""split-second"" decision to kick open a 6-foot-high gate. The owner of the property, Drendolyn Sims, happened to be on the other side of the gate and was struck when it flew inward, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder. Sims sued in federal court, alleging the officer invaded her home without a warrant. A judge agreed with the officer, saying the situation was potentially dangerous, Stanton ""feared for his safety"" and he was justified going after the fleeing suspect. But a federal appeals court in San Francisco found for Sims, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. Now, the high court has reversed, saying previous rulings made clear that Stanton deserved immunity from civil claims. The conservative majority court in recent years has given the benefit of the doubt to law enforcement in a number of cases involving searches of private property. ""Stanton was in hot pursuit of"" the suspect, said the high court. ""He did see (the suspect) enter Sims' property, and he had every reason to believe that the suspect was just beyond Sims' gate."" The issue was thrown back to the lower courts to be sorted out, after the Supreme Court's conclusions, and could lead to the lawsuit's final dismissal. The case is Stanton v. Sims (12-1217).","A California homeowner sued police after an officer chased a suspect onto her property .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's national election day has morphed into a day of tense uncertainty after chaos prevented voting in several districts. Of the 375 constituencies nationwide, 92 reported voting-related incidents. The Bangkok district of Laksi postponed its election for about 87,000 voters Sunday because protesters were blocking the administrative office where the ballot boxes are kept, national security chief Paradorn Pattanathabutr said. The new voting date has not been set. Laksi, a district of mixed pro- and anti-government sentiment, saw violent protests Saturday when gunfire erupted during anti-government protests, witnesses said. At least eight people have been wounded since Saturday, the Erawan Medical Centre said. And in the Bangkok district of Din Daeng, voting was called off because government protesters blocked officials from distributing ballot boxes. A group of government supporters responded by gathering at the Din Daeng district office chanting, ""Election, election"" and ""We want to vote today."" They raised their fists and held up their voter registration cards -- but to no avail. At a rally Sunday, an opposition leader urged protesters to remain peaceful and to continue boycott efforts by shutting down government offices Monday. ""We need to keep our principles. We fight in peace, with no weapons and violence. We only fight with our feet and whistles,"" People's Democratic Reform Committee leader Suthep Thaugsuban said. ""We have the right to a peaceful protest."" Even before voters started casting their ballots, the opposition Democrat Party appeared to be bracing for a battle. On Friday, an attorney for the party filed a petition asking the nation's constitutional court to declare Sunday's election invalid, arguing that some areas could not hold elections and some polling stations would not be able to count votes. The turmoil stems from a monthslong campaign against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Since November, at least 10 people have died and nearly 600 have been wounded in violence. Despite the continued chaos, some voters in Bangkok insisted on casting their ballots. ""I'm very excited to exercise my right to vote today,"" Nopphorn Tabupha said from Bangkok's Bueng Kum district. ""I didn't think I would be able to come out. I thought I was going to be blocked by the protesters."" Meanwhile, many opposition activists, including Suriya Phodhikul, have already rejected the vote. ""No, I didn't (vote) -- I want reform before elections. Because if I did, we will only get bad people, corrupt politicians,"" Phodhikul said. Shinawatra called this week's elections in December in a bid to ease mounting tensions on the streets of Bangkok. But the demonstrators and the main opposition party with which they're affiliated have already rejected the vote. The Prime Minister's party is expected to win comfortably. Her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, is a business tycoon who became prime minister before being overthrown in a military coup. He has since lived in exile, but his opponents accuse him of dominating politics from afar, including through his sister. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Pamela Boykoff reported from Bangkok; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. Journalist Kiki Dhitavat also contributed to this report.","NEW: Opposition protest leader: ""We fight in peace, with no weapons""

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- Norng Chan Phal ran through the notorious Khmer Rouge prison S-21 in the Cambodian capital as a 9-year-old boy, frantically looking for his mother after their torturers had fled from advancing Vietnamese troops in 1979. Norng Chan Phal was one of five children who survived the S-21 prison. He didn't find his mother, but what he did see made him hide under a pile of clothes with other children for days in the prison. ""I was shocked when I saw the bodies -- I was thinking maybe my mother was killed like this as well and I ran back to hide with the other kids,"" he told CNN. Norng Chan Phal is one of a few people to survive the school converted into a grisly prison, where more than 14,000 perished at the hands of the ultra-Maoists bent on creating an agrarian utopia -- an experiment that failed and left at least 1.7 million people -- or nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- dead from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. He is one of many survivors of the Khmer Rouge still seeking justice more than 30 years after the Vietnamese toppled the genocidal regime. But whether that happens remains to be seen. A war crimes tribunal backed by the United Nations got under way earlier this year after more than a decade of preparation, with five of the regime's former leaders facing charges that include crimes against humanity. ""The scale of the atrocities is indeed mind-boggling ... all of these crimes are to me crimes against humanity and put a tear into the fabric of humanity and have to be repaired and have to be fixed,"" said Robert Petit, chief co-prosecutor. First in the dock was Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch, a former mathematics teacher turned born-again Christian who is accused of overseeing S-21. ""I am responsible for the crimes committed at S-21,"" he told the court. ""I would like to express my regretfulness and my heartfelt sorrow and loss for all the crimes committed from 1975 to 1979."" Of the five charged, Comrade Duch is the only one of the group who admitted his responsibility at S-21. The other four charged had lived in freedom up until late 2007 and they have been denying their responsibility. Many others connected with the regime and alleged atrocities are still at large. CNN's Dan Rivers tracked down the alleged chief interrogator at S-21, a man named Ta Chan who is living in a former Khmer Rouge stronghold in western Cambodia.  Watch Dan Rivers' special coverage of Cambodia's search for justice » . Thousands of documented confessions found in the prison archives show he was the man who made prisoners talk by using means such as electrocution, waterboarding, merciless beatings and mutilations. Ta Chan has not been charged with any crimes by the tribunal, and refused to speak with CNN, though his son said his father was old and his health was bad, and none of the family wanted to talk about the past. But CNN found a woman who said she was a former comrade of Ta Chan -- and that she was still afraid of him all these years later. ""Ta Chan used several methods of torture,"" Mom Va said. ""He pulled prisoner's fingernails out with pliers and strung prisoners up and smashed them into brick walls."" Some critics question whether the tribunal will provide a final closure to many Cambodians who continue to live in fear of -- and anger at -- the Khmer Rouge. Their concerns have grown with allegations by some tribunal staff members alleging they have been forced to hand over part of their salaries to an official. There is no suggestion the judges or lawyers are involved, instead it is Cambodian staff from the court's Office of Administration who are at the center of the allegations. CNN interviewed two Office of Administration employees who described pressure on employees to kick-back money to their boss. ""We have received, indeed, a couple of anonymous complaints but none of them have referred to the matter you have raised,"" Helen Jarvis, a court spokeswoman, told CNN. The Cambodian government told CNN a senior Cambodian court official was investigated for corruption but was exonerated. ""They told me they cannot find any proof of kick-back or corruption,"" said Khieu Kanharith, government information minister. ""If you want the court -- the trial -- to go ahead, separate the two cases."" The U.N. confirmed to CNN that the OIOS, the U.N.'s internal affairs body, has investigated corruption in the court administration but would not share the results.  Watch more on the corruption probe » . But some involved in the tribunal have speculated that the U.N. may have to pull out of the process if this issue isn't tackled, meaning the trial could collapse. ""It's becoming a real possibility and it would be a massive shame for the Cambodian people. The victims who've been waiting for 30 years for these trials they deserve justice, they deserve peace, they deserve closure,"" said Richard Rogers, Chief of Defence Section of Trial. On many days, Cambodians fill the court outside of Phnom Penh to watch the proceedings. Despite the skepticism and concerns of some, Norng Chan Phal is hopeful of the outcome. ""I think (the) Khmer Rouge court is very good for people like me and other victims. We believe the court can find justice for us.""

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- An Australian author imprisoned last month for insulting the king and crown prince of Thailand was on his way home Saturday after receiving a pardon from the king. Harry Nicolaides behind the bars of a Thai holding cell. Harry Nicolaides, 41, was arrested last August over his 2005 book titled ""Verisimilitude."" The book includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that authorities deemed a violation of a law that makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten the crown. CNN has chosen not to repeat the language because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand. Mark Dean, a lawyer for Nicolaides, said he was released Friday and taken to the Australian embassy in Bangkok, where he stayed until leaving for Australia at about midnight. ""He is obviously very relieved and grateful that the pardon was granted,"" Dean said. Nicolaides was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty last month. He faced a term of up to six years before the plea.  Watch shackled Nicolaides at court » . His lawyers then requested the pardon. King Bhumibol Adulydej had pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past. Dean said Nicolaides was deported from Thailand, but that he did not know of any other stipulations related to the pardon. In an interview with CNN International, Dean avoided repeating what Nicolaides wrote, but said the passage was presented as a rumor, not a fact. ""This is probably not the best time to repeat the passage that was found to be offensive,"" Dean said. ""But it concerned the crown prince of Thailand and a rumor that was being circulated in Thailand about the crown prince."" Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003, lecturing at two universities about tourism. He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31. It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him. Fifty copies of the book were published, and only seven were sold. Thailand's king is highly revered in the Buddhist nation. But even he has said in the past that he can be criticized. Thailand's prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also has told CNN he is concerned about what he called misuse of the law. Still, other cases of violating the law are pending before the Thai Criminal Court, involving both Thais and foreigners.","Harry Nicolaides, 41, was arrested last August over his 2005 book .

"(CNN) -- Luxury hotels and resorts conjure images of sunny skies, designer furnishings, lavish restaurants and the well-to-do milling about in grand fashion. But all that can change in rapid time, leaving decay and squalor in its place. War, weather, financial foul-ups and man-made catastrophes have all contributed to many of these former pleasure palaces being left to ruin. Here are a few of the most celebrated empty hotels. 1. Sheraton Rarotonga, Cook Islands . This sprawling almost-resort along the coast road on Rarotonga, one of the Cook Islands, is still shown on Google maps even though it has never hosted a single guest. Called the ""Heartbreak Hotel"" by islanders, the project nearly bankrupted the tiny Pacific nation. The 200 rooms were tiled, plumbed, wired and fitted with air-conditioning. Some were carpeted and furnished -- but now the only residents are a few squatters and local gangs. Construction began in the late 1980s but, when it was almost complete, the backers pulled out amid lurid allegations of misappropriated funds. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/unZ4j . 2. Sofitel Heiva, Huahine, French Polynesia . Ideally located on a secluded spit of land on the French Polynesian island of Huahine, the over-water bungalows here still appear alluring and the botanic garden-like grounds are still meticulously maintained. Closer inspection reveals a totally derelict property, battered by the elements and stripped of all fittings, with gaping holes in the bungalow roofs and many of them in danger of collapse. It's been a decade since the last guest checked out and the former Sofitel stands as a somber monument to the dramatic downturn in this onetime holiday paradise. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/tu3om . 3. Lee Plaza, Detroit, United States . As the city of Detroit appears to descend into a post-apocalyptic nightmare, so too many of the beleaguered metropolis's great buildings are crumbling into dust. Already the grand Statler, Tuller and Madison-Lenox hotels are gone, leaving this stately 1929 art-deco high-rise the sole unoccupied survivor of heritage status. Closed for two decades, the Charles Noble-designed 15-floor structure is, however, deteriorating badly despite a preservation order and inclusion on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Images from inside reveal its former grandeur and serve as a tragic indictment of this once great city's spectacular fall from prominence. Location: 2240 West Grand Boulevard, Detroit, Michigan 42°21′34″N 83°6′6″W . 4. Ryugyong Hotel, Pyongyang, North Korea . Is this hotel the world's greatest construction folly? Many say yes. Begun in 1987 as a monument to North Korea's eternal leader, Kim Il-sung, what was conceived as an attempt to create the world's tallest hotel has turned into the secretive Stalinist state's greatest visible embarrassment. Just last April, the swank Kempinski chain back-peddled from its earlier management announcement that slated the 330-meter, 3,000-room, 105-story monstrosity to open as early as 2014. "" ... [M]arket entry is not currently possible,"" Kempinski told CNN. In September 2012, the North Korean state-owned tour company, Koryo Tours, released the first ever images from inside the very empty structure. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/YrbBs . 5. Hotel Renakse, Phnom Penh, Cambodia . This historic hotel is a well-known landmark opposite the Royal Palace on the waterfront at the Tonle Sap and Mekong junction. It began as part of the Royal Court of Justice and, in 1979, housed the first post-Khmer Rouge government. The century-old French colonial style hotel is owned by the Cambodian People's Party -- or was. In a controversial transaction that broke the leaseholder's contract, it was sold to a private development company with ties to the ruling party. Phnom Penh residents and other concerned persons launched a petition to save it from demolition, but its future remains uncertain. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/RIvVw . 6. Varosha, Famagusta, Cyprus . The once flourishing resort district of Varosha in the Cypriot city of Famagusta was once frequented by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Brigitte Bardot. Some regarded it as the most famous seaside resort in the world. When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, Varosha saw bloody fighting on its streets and, since partition of the island, the once hedonistic enclave is now a forbidden, fenced-off no man's land. Not one, but dozens of hotels are slowly falling apart as the urge to resettle this region has long diminished. The Argo, Grecian, Asterias, Florida and King George are just some of the luxury hotels that will probably never see another guest. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/O9tN0 . 7. Igloo City, Alaska, United States . If you're driving out along the George Parks Highway in Alaska, keep your eyes peeled for the bizarre Igloo Hotel near Cantwell. At first glance you might think it was some forgotten Cold War installation or spaceship, but it was started in the 1970s and contravened so many building codes it couldn't ever be opened. It's served variously as a souvenir stand and gas station over the years but is now all but derelict. Open to vandals, wild animals and the savage Alaskan elements, enter at your own risk. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/XIFSh . 8. El Hotel del Salto, Colombia . Overlooking the stunning Tequendama Falls on the Bogota River 30 kilometers southwest of the Colombian capital, this hotel sat empty and forlorn for two decades. Scenic beauty regardless, the river powering the falls is one of the most polluted in the world and, coupled with the hotel's ""most haunted"" reputation, soon put overnight guests off. The popularity of the falls for suicides also helped to doom this ornate little hotel. Built as a mansion in 1928 for the Colombian elite, it will never host another guest even if they did want to stay -- it's become a Museum of Biodiversity and Culture. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/788QM . 9. Hotel Polissya, Pripyat, Ukraine . This then 10-year-old, eight-storey hotel, along with the entire city of 50,000 residents, was hurriedly evacuated in April 1986 after the catastrophic explosion of the nearby Chernobyl nuclear reactor. One of the tallest structures in the abandoned city, Hotel Polissya serves as a prominent and sad reminder of that fateful day. The new wave of disaster tourists make a beeline for the building for a rooftop view over the desolate urban wasteland. The hotel, along with a ghostly amusement park, high school and stadium, make of Pripyat an altogether unsettling experience. Location: http://goo.gl/maps/NnR2W . 10. Unknown hotel, Vientiane, Laos . Just as many abandoned hotels are famous for their once lavish accouterments and celebrity guests, others are notable for their anonymity. This forlorn, riverside pension still has a couple of ground level occupants but is largely abandoned. Clearly of French colonial origin, it probably dates from the 1920s or 1930s -- no definitive written or other record remains to confirm it.

"(CNN) -- Switzerland's part-time soldiers could lose their famous right to store their weapons at home. Switzerland's part-time soldiers could lose the right to store their weapons at home. A coalition led by the country's Social Democrat party and the Greens has collected nearly 120,000 signatures to force a national referendum on whether the weapons should be stored at military bases. The coalition of 74 groups says the weapons are involved in too many suicides and murders in the country and tighter controls are needed. Switzerland's armed forces consist of just a few thousand permanent full-time staff, with the rest essentially a militia. Service in the militia is compulsory for men aged between 19 and 31 and in between call-ups they store their weapons at home. There are currently around 220,000 conscripts. However, a 2007 law change banned the storage of ammunition in homes. The coalition is looking to extend this, control the purchase of military weapons and set up a national gun register. Green lawmaker Josef Lang said more than 1.5 million unused weapons were kept in Swiss homes. Lang said their presence ""at the heart"" of the population could not be justified. He said a national register had to be created to keep track of the weapons, something police had long been seeking. Lang said the weapons had to be ""banished"" from homes. Barbara Weil, of the Swiss Medical Association, said it had been scientifically proven that if the guns were less freely available the number of suicides would drop. The studies had also shown that other methods of suicide did not increase in countries who had brought in stricter gun controls. The coalition estimates that 300 deaths annually are connected to gun use.","Swiss soldiers could lose their famous right to store their weapons at home .
Coalition of groups get enough signatures for referendum on gun laws .
They want weapons stored on bases and a national register ."
"New York (CNN) -- For Angel Rojas, the daily bus ride through the streets of Brooklyn provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low-paying jobs. ""It was his time to relax,"" his wife's cousin, Josie Guerrero, said Saturday. ""His time to take the load off. He usually listened to music or talked on the phone. It was a few minutes of calmness."" That peace was shattered Thursday evening as Rojas shuttled between jobs, hoping to make a quick stop at home to see his wife and two children. It was his final bus trip. A young man boarded the bus, police said. In the rear, a 14-year-old boy police described as a member of a street gang called the Stack Money Goons allegedly spotted a member of a rival gang and pulled out a .357-caliber revolver. Shots were fired, the bullets missing the intended target, police said. Rojas, 39, was hit in the head and declared dead later at a hospital near where his bus trip began. ""Pretty big gun for a pretty small man,"" Police Commissioner William Bratton said of the suspected gunman. On Friday, Kathon Anderson was charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon, according to the Brooklyn district attorney's office. He is to be tried as an adult. ""Just as everyone in New York probably feels terrible about it, we feel terrible about it too,"" Anderson's lawyer, Frederic Pratt, told reporters, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. ""I'm just going to ask everyone not to rush to judgment."" Anderson allegedly belonged to Stack Money Goons and targeted a rival from another group known as TWAN Family, police said. ""The stupidity of those gangs that basically, over nothing, are trying to kill each other and, unfortunately, in the process, kill innocents as they did with this hard working young man trying to raise his family,"" Bratton said. ""A life needlessly lost, taken by a 14-year-old who felt it necessary to carry a gun on a city bus and shoot it."" On Saturday, Rojas' wife was raising money for a wake and to fly her husband's body home to his native Dominican Republic. ""He was the sole provider,"" Guerrero said. ""She never thought she would have to bury her husband and raise the children alone."" The couple has two children: a 12-year-old son, Saury, and 8-year-old daughter, April. ""Why he did that to my dad?"" Saury asked, according to WCBS. Guerrero said, ""He was just sitting on a bus. He had nothing to do with this."" Angel Rojas and his wife came to New York from the Dominican Republic about five years ago, Guerrero said. She held occasional part-time jobs; he stocked shelves at two Brooklyn bodegas. ""He was a hard worker and a family man devoted to giving his family a better life,"" Guerrero said. ""He was the funniest man you would ever meet. Everyone loved him. His laughter and his presence stayed with you."" Mother loses both children in same month .

"(CNN) -- This weekend's kick-off at the 28th Africa Cup of Nations launches a three-week explosion of color and noise in the soccer-crazy continent. The tournament is set to transfix the region as 16 teams go head-to-head to be crowned footballing kings of Africa, but there is also a tinge of trepidation in the air. That's because the 2010 installment in Angola was overshadowed by a machine gun attack on the Togo team bus that left three people dead and organizers -- the Confederation of African Football (CAF) -- having to defend the decision to stage it there. This year's co-hosts Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest nations ever to hold the event -- which is also known as AFCON -- giving rise to concerns about security, as well as travel and tourism infrastructure. CNN examines the complex nature of the event, investigating the issues on and off the field. The hosts . Oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest countries ever to ever host the Africa Cup of Nations, with a combined population of just over two million. The fact they were chosen underlines the Confederation of African Football (CAF) policy to use the tournament as an investment tool, hoping to drive tourism and business long after the soccer extravaganza has gone. ""It is only the second time that Central Africa has the honor to host the most prestigious competition on the continent. The first time was 40 years ago in my country, Cameroon,"" CAF spokesman Habuba Suleiman told CNN. ""It has become something unique allowing us to complete our major language areas; Arabic, Anglophone, Francophone, Lusophone and today Hispanic with Equatorial Guinea. ""Each of the co-hosts could perhaps not afford to host a competition of 16 teams alone. We had a first experience in 2000 (hosted by Ghana and Nigeria) and it was not entirely satisfactory. This time the two countries have cooperated very well as evidenced by the decision to grant common visas to both countries. This is a great step forward."" But there is pressure on them to deliver a successful and safe Cup of Nations after 2010's pre-tournament tragedy in Angola -- which had only recently emerged from a civil war lasting three decades. According to African football expert Mark Gleeson, who has been to every tournament since 1992, CAF's decision to take the tournament to new territories has had mixed success. ""When you award AFCON to places like Burkina Faso, Mali, Angola or Gabon, you find that coffers for sporting infrastructure that would be normally be difficult to open suddenly emerge and you're leaving a legacy of football infrastructure,"" he told CNN. ""CAF have actively pursued that line over the last two decades, sometimes to the detriment of the tournament -- in Gabon there isn't a hotel room for neither love nor money. ""Luckily in Africa there are not too many traveling fans so that's not much of a problem, but infrastructure is poor: how do you get from one venue to the next? ""There isn't the immense pressure on traveling fans as there would be in Europe. What would you rather have -- a stadium that allows a nation to participate competitively in football versus disgruntled visitors that can't find a hotel room for two weeks?"" The culture of chaos . The deadly attack on Togo's team led to questions about the tournament's organization and security, but according to Gleeson, the Africa Cup of Nations can't be judged by similar standards to the World Cup or the European Championships. ""The tournament has a unique, chaotic charm, maybe that has an appeal,"" he said. ""My experience is that nothing is ever ready -- it is all a patch-up job. ""But if the football kicks off at the appointed time, the TV cameras are in place and the whistle is blown, it doesn't matter whether the accreditation machine broke down five hours before. ""I think there's far too much emphasis on all the other sideshows that there needs to be. It's important to have the competition taking place, to have a good intensity that African football followers will enjoy."" Suleiman said security arrangements are the responsibility of the host nations, not the ruling body. ""We don't have an army to check security. We are a group of peaceful people who are convinced that football has to be a factor of unity, friendship and fraternity,"" he told CNN. ""We were all ruffled by what happened in Angola. It was a tragedy that touched us profoundly. I hope that never repeats itself. The opportunity . There may be huge pressure on the co-hosts, but the pride they feel at staging the African soccer showcase is palpable. Gabon spent an estimated $500 million on stadiums and infrastructure despite them being tiny in comparison to hosts of other major tournaments, like China, who spent an estimated $42 billion on the 2008 Olympics. Hugues Dowe, from Gabon's local organizing committee, told CNN that hosting of the Cup of Nations is ""something exceptional."" ""Finally hosting the tournament means so many opportunities for Gabon and its people,"" he said. ""When you host the Cup of Nations you can't expect benefits immediately. But we have built big infrastructure in terms of hosting the tournament like roads, stadiums and hotels. ""These big investments are very important for development of our country, particularly in sports and tourism sectors."" ""The security in Gabon will be the best organized of any country which hosted the tournament before us. Dowe also insisted there would be enough hotel rooms to accommodate the 80,000 expected visitors, as well as the many journalists descending on the competition, while the four stadiums that are hosting matches across the two countries are open and ready for kick-off. ""I have never heard of problems without solutions,"" Suleiman said. ""In Africa, small problems always end up being arranged. ""CAF belongs to each of the 53 national associations. They all have the right to bid to host without any exception. With each new edition of the competition, the AFCON has become a factor of economic development in terms of structures and infrastructures. ""We would not have had all these beautiful stadiums in Africa without the AFCON. Roads have been constructed, medical facilities built, zones electrified and development of new technologies accelerated. It is something CAF can legitimately be proud of."" The tournament . AFCON is the planet's third biggest football tournament, behind the World Cup and the European Championships. The biennial competition is contested by 16 teams split into four groups. Each country will host matches in two cities. Saturday's opening Group A matches will be in Equatorial Guinea's former capital Bata, while other games will be held in Malabo -- its 1969 successor. In Gabon a new 40,000-seater stadium has been built in the capital Libreville, with help from the Chinese government, and will host the final. In Franceville, the Stade de Franceville has been refurbished to hold 35,000 spectators. The top two teams from each group go through to the quarterfinal stage. The final will be held in Gabon's capital, Libreville, on February 12. The teams . The qualified nations are: Group A -- Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Zambia, Senegal; Group B -- Ivory Coast, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Angola; Group C -- Gabon, Niger, Morocco, Tunisia; Group D -- Ghana, Botswana, Mali, Guinea. There is a notable list of absentees. Egypt, who won the last three titles, failed to qualify along with African heavyweights Cameroon, South Africa and Nigeria. The rise of African football in recent years means some of the world's biggest soccer stars will be on show, such as the Ivory Coast's Chelsea striker Didier Drogba and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure, as well as Mali's Seydou Keita, who plays for European and Spanish champions Barcelona.","Africa Cup of Nations to be hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea .

"(EW.com) -- When ""Breaking Bad"" left off last summer, tenacious DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) was hot on the trail — and, er, toilet — of meth maker Walter White (Bryan Cranston). And when the revered drama returns with the second half of season 5 (beginning Aug. 11 on AMC), what should we brace for? Among other things, maybe a bit of self-reflection from the cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who transformed himself into a lethal drug kingpin with the help of high school dropout/partner Jesse (Aaron Paul). ""We often said in the writers' room that if Walt had a superpower, it would be not his chemistry knowledge or his ability to cook crystal meth but his ability to lie,"" series creator/executive producer Vince Gilligan tells EW. ""Walt has been the world's greatest liar, and I think the person he lies most capably to is himself. So in these final eight episodes, perhaps the lies will cease to find traction and the scales will start to fall away from Walt's eyes. And when that happens, will Walt really begin to realize who he is? That's a question that we asked ourselves a lot in the writers' room this year."" Of course, Walt won't have too much time for navel-gazing, as he'll need to keep his eyes on his brother-in-law Hank — in addition to other adversaries. ""There will be antagonistic relationships aplenty,"" promises Gilligan, adding: ""Walt's got plenty of fight left in him. And he's got plenty of forces to fight. You met some of them. Others you haven't."" Should viewers brace for a high body count? ""As the movie title goes, there will be blood,"" answers Gilligan. ""To my mind, that's not the most interesting thing. It's the emotional moments and the character moments. ... We've got some stuff that I think is going to be truly satisfying and truly shocking and jarring. It does not always center on moments of violence."" And these moments will come flying at you at ""breakneck speed,"" he warns: ""I have surprised myself at how much story there was left to tell and how quickly we tell it. You need to really settle down on the couch and pay close attention because it's going to come at you fast and furious in the final eight episodes."" Gilligan is both cautious and upbeat when it comes to discussing that highly anticipated finale. ""We worked long and hard to ensure that these final eight — and, in fact, the very last episode — would satisfy an audience,"" he says. ""I am guardedly optimistic that we have achieved just that. And furthermore, trying to be as coy as possible, trying to give away as little as possible, I feel like this ending represents on some level, however small, something of a victory for Walter White. Read into that what you will. And try to be as open-minded as possible when you watch this episode, because it may not indeed feel like a victory. Or maybe it will. ... I feel good about where it all ended up, and I can't wait for people to see it.""

"(CNN) -- ""Uno de enero, dos de febrero, tres de marzo, cuatro de abril, cinco de mayo, seis de junio, siete de julio, ¡SAN FERMÍN!"" Like schoolchildren on a field trip, my friends and I excitedly sang this song on a bus from León to Pamplona in 2005. All I knew about the festival of San Fermín was that it involved people running with bulls, and that it took place every year from July 7 to July 14. Here are some tips: . Dance, dance, dance. Pamplona turns into one big 24-hour-a-day party for the festival of San Fermín. Everyone's dressed in white clothes with red bandanas, and everyone is there to have a good time. There is live music everywhere, so it's a great opportunity to groove to the most popular Spanish hits. I remember dancing to Melendi's ""Caminando por la Vida"" around 3 a.m. at one of the outdoor concerts. Don't expect to sleep (much). If you're making last-minute plans to go to Pamplona, don't be surprised if you can't find a bed. My friends and I didn't even try. It seems like everyone sleeps outside in public places, or doesn't sleep at all. In fact, Pamplona is the only place where I've ever slept in a public park. I brought a foldable sleeping bag in my backpack -- handy, since northern Spanish nights can get cold -- but most people just lay on the grass, huddled together to stay warm. If you go this route, hang on tightly to your belongings. I used my purse as a pillow, but at least one person from my group had his backpack swiped while he was asleep. Running is risky. Every year, there are serious injuries or even deaths among people who try to run with the bulls. In 2010, I spoke with cancer survivor Michael Lenahan, who got gored in the leg by a bull; his brother got hurt in the left buttock. In fact, between 200 and 300 people are injured annually, according to the Council of Pamplona. Proceed with extreme caution if you are planning on getting near the toros. There are so many people trying to watch and run that you might not know a bull is near you until its horn scrapes your arm. Check out the bullfighting ring. There are so many people stretching their necks to see over the fences that line the streets of Pamplona -- not to mention sitting on the fences, too -- that it's actually hard to see people and bulls running. ""No vamos a ver nada"" (We're not going to see anything), my friend Marek lamented. We decided to go instead to the Plaza de Toros. With everyone pushing and shoving each other to get tickets to this event, it seemed almost as dangerous as chasing bulls in the streets. But we finally got our passes and made our way inside the enormous arena, which is the ending point of the bull run. There, we watched hundreds of people run around the bulls, including one member of our group who emerged proudly with a large cut or two. Don't wander off. One of the girls in my group didn't show up at the agreed-upon time that morning. A half an hour went by, and she still hadn't shown up. We all started worrying, and had no idea how we would ever find her in a sea of thousands of people, since she didn't have a cell phone. Finally, she appeared two hours later -- she apparently made some new friends the night before and lost track of time. Don't do this to your traveling companions! Check out San Sebastián afterward. If you're looking for a place to chill out after a crazy night in Pamplona, head about 51 miles northwest to San Sebastián, a beautiful small city on the Bay of Biscay where you can lie on the beach, admire medieval architecture and actually sit down for a yummy Basque meal. Those are my top tips for visiting Pamplona. How about you?

"(CNN) -- A free Lamborghini in Miami, Florida. Brazos, a new luxury condo development in Austin, Texas, will auction off its rooms at deep discounts in May. Complimentary housekeeping in Phoenix, Arizona. Two bedrooms for the price of one in Atlanta, Georgia. It's a buyers market again for condominium shoppers after years of artificially high prices and speculation. Marketing gimmicks, along with auctions, upgrades and incentives, continue to be wildly popular for developers desperate to relieve the inventory glut. ""We want to move the products as fast as we can,"" said Summer Dunham, marketing manager for Starpointe Communities, which develops luxury condominiums in Scottsdale, Arizona, one of the first states slammed by the nation's housing crises. ""It was very slow in 2008. Everyone had difficulty selling."" So in February, the determined company auctioned off 20 four-story condominiums overlooking a golf course, private park and three swimming pools against a mountain backdrop. The upscale properties were priced as high as $1.6 million before the market sank. The auction was declared a success for the company, which sold nearly all of its units in a weak market where only 115 out of nearly 2,000 available units have closed in the first quarter of this year, according to a report by Metrostudy, a research firm tracking the condo market. And bargain hunters were jazzed to pay, on average, $600,000 for a unit at the auction. ""Developers will bend over backwards to sell these units,"" said Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy. ""There is no limit on the number of ways they will work with someone to sell at this point."" Condominium sales continue to sag amid soft demand from buyers. Metrostudy reported that sales prices nationwide have dropped from a massive and unsustainable pace that reached a crescendo in 2006. Sales are at a virtual standstill today. For example, only 158 units closed out of 3,137 available units in Palm Beach County, Florida, during the first three months of this year, according to Metrostudy. The situation has only worsened with the  economic downturn, Hunter said. Buyers are tightening their wallets and demanding lower prices. Recovery isn't expected for several more years in some markets, the firm says. Even more troublesome, thousands of new units are entering saturated condo markets such as Miami, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona. Much of the financing from the projects came before the condo market collapse, experts say. Meanwhile, the value of existing condominiums is falling. The National Association of Realtors found that the prices for existing condos has dropped nearly 16 percent since 2006. The small number of recent sales probably were brought on by the deep discounts, said Walter Molony, spokesman for the group. ""The condo market is starting to improve, but you still have a long way to go,"" Molony said. Other prospective buyers are having trouble obtaining loans to make down payments in a tight credit market, housing experts say. This month, Fannie Mae implemented additional fees on condominium loans regardless of applicants' credit scores. Some private mortgage lenders are also refusing to give loans to buyers for condos that are empty or have delinquent owners. But if buyers do have the cash saved up, now may be the best time to finance. Interest rates have fallen to under 5 percent in some places. In some condo markets, marketing teases are still popular. While they may not make the sale, they spark interest, sellers say. ""At one point, they were giving away free flights, free Vespas,"" said Ben Kakimoto, a Realtor at John L. Scott Real Estate specializing in condos in Seattle, Washington. Kakimoto said at least five more high-rise luxury condos are set to open in downtown Seattle this year in addition to the oversupply already on the market. His research shows there is a 9.2-month supply of condos in Seattle -- the highest number his company has ever seen. A healthy market should have about five or six months of supply, he says. High-end shoppers will find luxury properties like the South of Fifth development in South Beach, Florida, which offered a free Lamborghini worth $260,000 when buyers purchased one of the multimillion-dollar properties, said Sildy Cervera, who managed the sales. ""The fear factor is still holding people back,"" said Cervera, who ended the promotion this month after receiving ample inquiries but few buyers. In recent months, auctioning has become a popular way for developers to liquidate their properties. When consumers name a price, they can feel confident they are getting rock-bottom prices, said Chris Longly, a National Auctioneers Association spokesman. Auctioning also can encourage more buyers, he said. Next month in Austin, Texas, Kennedy Wilson, a California company that handles auctions nationally, will auction units at the Brazos, a sophisticated development with prices previously at $200,000 to $1.6 million. Instead, the starting bid prices will range from $80,000 to $600,000. Kennedy Wilson President Rhett Winchell said he has received four times as many inquiries for auctions in the last year, compared with the previous year. ""We can sell out 30 to 50 properties at one single event,"" he said. Last month in Atlanta, sellers auctioned off The Horizon at Wildwood, where sleek contemporary condos originally priced at $375,000 went for $200,000. In Atlanta, only 645 units units sold, leaving more than 6,000 units unsold in 2008, according to Haddow & Company, a real estate consulting firm. It was here, at the Horizon auction last month at a W Hotel -- where drinks and finger foods were served -- that cattle rancher George Drake, 73, and his wife purchased a new two-bedroom condo for nearly 40 percent off. ""I got a fine deal,"" said Drake, who is currently painting the walls before he and his wife move in next month. ""I am really pleased.""","Condo market continues to see slow sales in cities like Miami, Phoenix and Atlanta .

"New York (CNN) -- A 12-year-old girl found hanged in her home left behind a suicide note that mentioned online bullying, according to police. Gabrielle Molina was found dead Wednesday afternoon by her family, authorities said. In addition to interviewing Gabrielle's friends and relatives, police took two computers from the seventh-grader's home to investigate whether harsh online messages and other cyberbullying may have been a factor in driving the young girl to take her life, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters. ""It's a terrible, terrible tragedy,"" Kelly said Thursday. Police released few other details. Gabrielle's school, Jean Nuzzi Intermediate School 109 in Queens, received an overall rank of B in the city's 2012 school progress reports, but a C in the ""School Environment"" portion, which includes rankings on safety and respect, communication and engagement. But Dennis M. Walcott, chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, says he takes cyberbullying seriously. ""It's something that I want to make sure we continue to focus on, something I'm very much interested in working with our student population about,"" he said. ""Kids need to know they're not in this situation by themselves,"" Thomas Meyers, a crisis counselor sent to the school to talk to Molina's classmates, told CNN affiliate WCBS. Young people and social media: Docs examine pitfalls . According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, approximately 20% of students report experiencing cyberbullying in their lifetimes, and adolescent girls are specifically likely to have experienced it. In a 2008 Yale University report published in the International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health, researchers analyzed 37 studies that examined bullying and suicide among children and adolescents. Nearly all of the studies found a link between being bullied and suicidal thoughts among young people, and five even reported that victims of bullying were 2-9 times more likely to report suicidal thoughts than other young people. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among young people, resulting in about 4,400 deaths per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. For every suicide among young people, there are at least 100 suicide attempts. When bullying goes high-tech .","Girl hangs self at her home in Queens .

"Washington (CNN) -- Starting his sixth year in office, President Barack Obama promised to use the power of the pen to push his legislative agenda. Translation: executive orders, the tool used by every president except for one -- William Henry Harrison, who died on his 32nd day in office. As for Obama, he said, ""Let's make this a year of action"" during his most recent State of the Union speech, referring to his willingness to employ his presidential pen to move forward on priorities stalled in Congress. His opponents on the right have criticized him for unconstitutionally expanding executive authority. Putting him in a politically tricky spot, his political allies are jumping on the executive order train and calling on the President to use it for their policy priorities. Nearly 250 members of the House and Senate sent a letter to the President on Tuesday asking that he sign an executive action that would prohibit federal contractors from employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-New Jersey, said he had been pushing the White House on the issue ""for several years now"" but essentially got the cold shoulder. Pallone said he was told by the Obama administration that the issue was being examined. With no final answer given, Pallone and more than 200 of his colleagues decided the executive order route was a viable one. ""He was speaking about wanting to move on a progressive agenda,"" Pallone said. ""Those of us who have these various priorities are asking him to make those priorities part of that agenda."" The President's use of the tool, which he has employed at least 168 times during his tenure, has been used for both menial and meaningful measures. He has used it to change the name of the National Security Staff to the National Security Council Staff. He also imposed sanctions against Russian officials over the dispute in Ukraine. Political risks of acting unilaterally . In most cases, the President determines which issues to pursue via executive authority. By asking him to act unilaterally potentially puts Obama in a difficult spot. Outside of potential legal debate, there are political risks. Ohio State University Law School professor Peter Shane said, ""He can claim to do things on his own, but if he doesn't, he looks weak or out of touch with his base."" This is at least the second time that allies are pressuring Obama to use his executive authority to further a policy agenda. As the prospects of comprehensive immigration reform continue to dim, some Democrats have asked the President to use his executive authority to halt deportations of immigrants illegally in the country. Obama has deported more people than any previous presidents, angering Latinos -- a key Democratic voting bloc -- who say Obama's deportation policy is extreme as it creates fear and heartache. For months, the President said he did not have the authority to halt deportations. But after continued pressure that included Hispanic leaders calling him the ""deporter-in-chief,"" the President announced last week that he called for a review of deportation policies. Dems to Obama: Suspend deportations . While Shane said Obama is not acting any differently than previous administration, he said ""the President has done himself a bit of a disservice by saying he's going alone."" Opening Pandora's box . He's put the idea out there and opened the Pandora's box. Additionally, executive directives can be undone as easily as they are done, leaving the next president the ability to undue any one of them. And Shane said they sometimes leave Congress off the hook from having to act. But Pallone said that the LGBT discrimination executive order would provide incentive for Congress to pass broader legislation, the Employment Nondsicrimination Act, prohibiting any discrimination based on sexual orientation. The White House hasn't said if it would move forward with Pallone's idea of an executive order, but in Wednesday's daily briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney said ENDA ""would provide those protections broadly in a way that an [executive order] would not."" ""I think it's a step towards ENDA,"" Pallone said, comparing it with the President's recent executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors. He signed the executive order while Congress works to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10. But Republicans are sure to balk. Republican strategist John Feehery cautioned the President, saying executive actions will make him look weak and ineffective. ""The more he goes on down this road, the less ability he has to get anything done in Congress,"" Feehery said. But that wasn't Pallone's concern. ""The President has said this is a 'year of action,' we can do this for federal contractors.""","President Obama has pledged to use executive orders to further his agenda .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- Off track, Tasneem Howa is a rather introverted young woman who works as a photographer in Cape Town. On track, however, she pulls on black tights and slips into roller skates to transform into ""TazMEANian Devil"" -- a hard-hitting, sharp-moving diva on wheels. ""When I put on skates, it's a rush,"" she says. ""You get that, it's like freedom. You're skating and feeling the air; it's awesome."" ""TazMEANian Devil"" is a proud member of the Rev'ettes, one of the three roller derby teams that take part in the women-only Cape Town Rollergirls league. Just like many of her teammates, she took up the sport after seeing the 2009 film ""Whip It,"" starring and directed by Drew Barrymore. Read this: Boxing gives teens hope in crime hotspot . ""I watched the movie 'Whip It' -- I thought it was chicks bashing each other, getting all bloody, but it's a bit calmer than that,"" says ""TazMEANian Devil."" Quirky outfits . Fast-paced and full-contact, roller derby involves endurance, teamwork and crashes -- all on wheels. As much a bump-and-bruise sport as a lifestyle, derby's alternative edge is on full-on display on the rink. Roller girls typically don colorful skates, protective pads and quirky outfits as they race on a flat oval track, body checking each other to impede opponents from earning points for their team. ""You can be dainty but need to be slightly aggressive at the same time,"" says Ming-Cheau Lin, a.k.a ""Wolverming,"" who plays for Cape Town's Storm Riders. In line with the hard-hitting sport's tradition, players also adopt certain monikers chosen to reflect their on-track alter ego. ""One of the most important things about roller derby is your derby name,"" explains Shawn Graaff, who founded Cape Town Rollergirls in 2010. ""I know it seems kitsch and silly but it's something people get excited about and historically people had derby names because they didn't want to participate in such an aggressive spectacle sport and compromise their professional career."" What is roller derby? Roller derby is a sport that requires strategy, team spirit and lots of body checking. A derby match, called a bout, is played by two teams consisting of jammers, who are the point scorers, and blockers, the team's line of defense. The goal is for the jammers to get past the other team's blockers and then lap them. Once the jammer has done so, the team gets a point for every skater she passes. Read this: Maasai cricket warriors -- ""Bowling is like throwing a spear"" Along the way, the action is rough and rowdy. ""It's not Miami beach skating!"" says Nadine Brits, or ""Doll Vuis,"" who is a jammer for the Rev'ettes. ""Full impact -- we're tough; we've got our team's points on the line so we're fighting for that."" Comeback . Roller derby first took off as a competitive sport in the United States in the 1930s but later evolved into a TV spectacle sport, much like WWE. Its popularity decreased in the 1980s but an all-women league in Texas helped re-invent the sport in the early 2000s, this time with a bigger emphasis on athleticism. Drew Barrymore's ""Whip It"" gave the sport attention around the world, including in South Africa, where its popularity has been growing steadily. The Cape Town Rollergirls league is made up of three teams -- the Rev'ettes, the Storm Riders and the Iron Meisies -- boasting a variety of female players, from working mothers and students to locals and ex-pats. Men are only involved in a coaching or refereeing capacity. Graaff says the sport is helping break stereotypes, crashing any notions that women can't be both tough and feminine. ""Roller derby is one of the most multifaceted and dynamic organizations to be a part of,"" she says. ""It's kind a do-it-yourself culture; it's gender empowerment because we praise the finer points of our gender without compromising femininity, but at the same time we are embracing strong independent women."" Read this: The best of African street art . Elisabeth Hansen Dreyer, or ""Betty Blizzard,"" a working mom of two, agrees. She encourages other mothers to join the roller derby fun. ""It will save your sanity,"" says the Storm Riders blocker. ""After a day and the kids are screaming and you're just tired of chores and you get to go and bump girls. It's awesome!"" Looking ahead, the Cape Town league is gearing up to host an officiating director from the international governing body of women's roller derby. This will be the first time the organization visits Africa and the Cape Town Rollergirls are excited about the possibilities. It's a nod to how seriously these players view their sport and will hopefully push them to grow into a bigger brand. And of course, there will be more bruises along the way.","Roller derby is a full-contact sport played by women on roller skates .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United was left reeling Sunday after a demoralizing loss to arch-rival Liverpool that kept it a dozen points adrift of a Champions League spot but there was respite for under-fire manager David Moyes and his team Wednesday. The Red Devils advanced to the quarterfinals of this season's Champions League by thumping Olympiacos 3-0 thanks to a Robin van Persie hat-trick, thus overturning a 2-0 first-leg deficit. They were joined in the last eight by 2013 finalist Borussia Dortmund, which like United is struggling domestically but has enjoyed success in Europe. Dortmund overcame Zenit St. Petersburg 5-4 on aggregate despite losing 2-1 Wednesday. Before the game, Moyes -- one bookmaker lists Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp as the favorite to succeed the Scot -- denied reports that he had clashed with Ryan Giggs and van Persie. The 40-year-old Giggs was reinserted into the starting lineup at Old Trafford as part of four changes from the 3-0 defeat to Liverpool -- and he made an impact. Also helping Manchester United was Olympiacos' poor record in England: The Greek side has played 12 times -- and now lost on each occasion. ""I said to (my team) on Monday morning we have to win 3-0, give the crowd something back because the crowd here has been incredible,"" Moyes, the successor to managerial giant Alex Ferguson at United, told Sky Sports. ""They deserved a good night because we haven't given them many good nights this season. ""I'm not feeling pressure from inside the club. It's all coming from you people,"" Moyes added, referring to the media. ""I know the job I have to do. It's a big job. It's way bigger than maybe we all expected when we came in. ""But the players have been great. I keep hearing about this one has fallen out or someone else has fallen out and I keep telling people it's rubbish -- and it is rubbish."" Van Persie, who led United to the league title last term, and Wayne Rooney were isolated in the loss to Liverpool, with the Dutchman spending the majority of his time in midfield instead of up front. That wasn't the case Wednesday. Bookings, a collision that left United winger Antonio Valencia with a swollen eye and a glaring miss by Olympiacos' Hernan Perez highlighted an action-packed opening 15 minutes. And when Rooney struck the post in the 18th minute, some of the United fans must have thought this might not be their night. Giggs, however -- and not for the first time in his stellar career -- split open the Olympiacos defense with a diagonal ball that reached van Persie. Referee Bjorn Kuipers pointed to the spot when the striker was pushed by Jose Holebas and van Persie made no mistake as he picked himself up in the 25th minute. Olympiacos didn't crumble. It was always a threat on the counter and David De Gea, now firmly settled in Manchester, made a sparkling double save in the 40th minute. But Olympiacos was dealt a blow when van Persie converted Rooney's low cross -- after Giggs' pivotal ball -- in first-half injury time. ""I thought Giggsy was fantastic,"" said Moyes. ""Sometimes you might be thinking, 'You'll need to come off after 60 minutes' but he's a freak. He really is. He's something different."" Only six minutes after the break van Persie completed his hat-trick with a low free kick. Olympiacos pushed forward and although De Gea had to be sharp, he and the United defense held firm to the delight -- and relief -- of most of those at Old Trafford. Van Persie limped off in the dying stages but Moyes said his injury ""doesn't look that bad."" Dortmund progresses . Zenit St. Petersburg -- which named Andre Villas Boas as its new manager this week -- faced a difficult task since it trailed 4-2 after the first leg in Russia but Hulk's stunning long-range effort in the 16th minute provided the visitor with hope. Once midfielder Sebastian Kehl leveled in the 39th, though, it was almost impossible for Zenit St. Petersburg to progress. Even after Jose Rondon made it 2-1 for Zenit in the second half, it still needed two more goals. Dortmund's joy was tempered by a yellow card to striker Robert Lewandowski that rules the Pole out of the first game of the quarterfinals and Kehl was displeased with the home crowd, too. ""Maybe they wanted to see a 6-1 win, but that does not happen every day,"" he told reporters. ""We have had a lot of injuries this season, but this result shows we are well prepared."" Defending champion Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea, Atletico Madrid and Paris St-Germain join Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund in Friday's quarterfinal draw.","Man United overturns a first-leg deficit and advances in the Champions League .

"Paris (CNN) -- Fresh political sex scandals, following closely on the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair, have France gripped by a debate on the nation's hidden culture of sexism and how its tough privacy laws, which prevent journalists from exposing sexual misbehavior, help perpetuate it. In the latest development, former French Education Minister Luc Ferry was talking to police as a witness Friday at the department for the protection of minors in Paris after suggesting on national television that a former government minister is known to have abused children in Marrakech, Morocco. The comments arose during a discussion on whether former International Monetary Fund head Strauss-Kahn's supposedly well-known sexual impulsiveness had been kept quiet because it was seen as a private matter. ""All of us here probably know who I'm talking about,"" Ferry told the panel on the daily French political show ""Le Grand Journal."" Asked if he had any proof, he said, ""Of course not. But I have testimony from Cabinet members at the highest level, state authorities at the highest level."" He went on to say he had been informed ""particularly by the prime minister."" Ferry refused to name the former minister because of the privacy laws, saying, ""If I let his name out now, it's me who will be charged and doubtlessly convicted, even if I know that the story is true."" Since the comments were made Tuesday evening, rumors have been spreading about who Ferry was talking about, with the names of several high-profile politicians being mentioned. Ferry's comments also followed the resignation Sunday of former French Secretary of Public Affairs Georges Tron after two female colleagues accused him of sexually assaulting them while giving them foot massages. The two women told French press that the Strauss-Kahn case had inspired them to come forward. One of the women, identified only as Eloise, told French reporters, ""We will not withdraw our complaint. I am determined to see it through regardless of unpleasant things that could be spread about me. "" The accumulation of affairs has brought out a flurry of personal testimony in France from highly placed women politicians and officials who now feel empowered to speak out on the issue of sexual harassment by men in politics. Christine Deviers-Joncour, mistress of former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, told CNN, ""In France we don't talk about that. It never happened. I have no example. Up until now it was very difficult. ""Imagine a woman who is sexually pursued by a politician, what can she do? Go to the justice and complain? Immediately they will laugh at her. So I hope this will change things."" Nicole Guedj, a member of the Council of State, told CNN: ""Clearly it's an issue. I started my career quite a long time ago and throughout its course I was faced with sexist behavior, but I was lucky enough to overcome those difficulties."" Aurelie Filipetti, Socialist Party spokeswoman, told the French media: ""In France, 80% of the political sphere is dominated by men and male political journalists. So yes, we suffer and you harden yourself to it. You have to when you hear 15 sexist jokes in a row. It is sexual harassment disguised as humor. Some can't come to work wearing a skirt."" Similarly Roselyne Bachelot, current Minister of Solidarities and Social Cohesion said: ""Recently something big has been taking place: a real omerta is being lifted, reinforced by a judicial system that protects privacy. I think politicians have understood that respecting privacy has its limits now. ""Is this a good thing? Yes, of course. How could I not rejoice the end of impunity?""","The Strauss-Kahn affair and the Tron incident have helped raise awareness .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger apologized to the club's fans and said he had been ""hurt"" after his side suffered their worst ever defeat against Manchester United on Sunday. The Gunners were beaten 8-2 at Old Trafford, with a Wayne Rooney hat-trick, a brace from England winger Ashley Young and goals from Danny Welbeck, Park Ji-Sung and Nani sealing a comprehensive win for the English Premier League champions. ""I can only apologize for the score,"" Wenger told Arsenal's official web site. ""It hurts very much. ""The players go away for two weeks [on international duty] and maybe that is a good thing. ""When they come back we'll have to prepare. Big scores are humiliating and difficult to swallow but I don't think they have a special meaning. They are always under special circumstances."" Later Monday, the north London club announced that fans who attended the match would receive a free ticket to another Arsenal away game in the EPL. ""Sunday's result was obviously disappointing for everyone connected with the club. Our traveling fans were magnificent throughout and we want to recognize their fantastic support. We will be writing to them shortly with the details,"" read a statement. The defeat leaves Arsenal -- who were without forward Gervinho and defensive duo Bacary Sagna and Thomas Vermaelen for the United defeat -- with just one point from their opening three matches and languishing in 17th place in the table. The defeat comes after a controversial start to the season for the London side following the sale of star duo Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri to Barcelona and Manchester City respectively. Despite the 61-year-old French manager signing four new players -- including Ivory Coast's Gervinho and the young trio of Carl Jenkinson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joel Campbell from Charlton, Southampton and Saprissa -- the former Monaco coach has been criticized for not investing in experienced players. However, Wenger insisted he would spend money if the right players could be found. ""We have to find the right players and if we do we will sign them,"" he told the BBC ahead of the current transfer closing on September 1. ""We have the money and if we find players to strengthen the team we will do it. If we don't do it, it is because we haven't found them. ""I try to make the right decisions and the two players we sold [Fabregas and Nasri], I brought them to the club. In 15 years I have brought some good players. You know me, so you should give me some more time to see if I have got it completely wrong.""

"(CNN) -- Audi's Tom Kristensen recorded a record ninth victory in the Le Mans 24 hour race Sunday and dedicated it to fellow Dane Allan Simonsen, who died in a high speed crash the previous day. Kristensen, 45, has been touched by personal tragedy after the death of his father earlier this year, but paid wanted to pay special tribute to Simonsen. ""He can wait for the next victory of mine,"" he said. ""This victory today I dedicate to Allan Simonsen, a great fellow Dane."" Kristensen shared his triumph, his first at Le Mans since 2008, with co- drivers Britain's Allan McNish and local star Loic Duval. It was Audi's fourth in row and 12th in 14 years. Before the victory ceremony a brief tribute to Simonsen was paid. The Aston Martin driver crashed at speed early in the famous endurance race Saturday and died of his injuries at the track. ""We lost someone yesterday who had the same dream as I did, a good bloke,"" added Kristensen. His car came home a lap clear of the first from arch-rivals Toyota, who included Engand's former F1 driver Antony Davidson. The ex-Minardi driver suffered a heavy crash at Le Mans last year and said Simonsen's death had been at the back of his mind as he raced. ""It's very hard, especially with what happened to me last year, to fight my own demons and carry on driving,"" he said. ""It's sad, sad news and it puts everything into perspective."" The Aston Martin team, fielding five entries in the GTE-Am class, continued to race after the tragedy at the express wishes of Simonsen's family. Aston Martin chairman David Richards said it had been a tough experience for all concerned, although their leading car managed third place in the category. ""The team continued its participation in the race which was obviously very emotional and difficult for everyone,"" he told the official Aston Martin website. ""I'd like to thank everyone who has shown us such support over the weekend and sent the messages of condolence to Allan's family,"" he added. Wet conditions and the one-hour delay after Simonsen's fatal accident made for a difficult race on the Circuit de la Sarthe in western France. Audi's two-time defending champions Marcel Faessler, Andre Lotterer and Benoit Treluyer had led the race, but lost 43 minutes when they were forced to change the alternator in their sportscar during Saturday night. Kristensen, who scored his first win at Le Mans back in 1997, took full advantage to register an emotional win.","Audi's Tom Kristensen wins Le Mans 24-hour race .

"(CNN) -- When you think back to your favorite TV memories, often music is intertwined. Whether it's the theme song from ""Gilligan's Island,"" ""M*A*S*H,"" ""Cheers"" or ""Batman,"" it's often the thing people remember more than anything else about a show. But were they ever on the same level with, say, the themes from ""Star Wars"" or ""The Godfather?"" Over the past decade, we've seen the rise of television as prestige entertainment. And we've had memorable theme music to go along with it, from ""The Sopranos"" to ""Dexter"" to ""Mad Men."" Two of the most noteworthy themes from the recent era, ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""The Walking Dead,"" come from the mind of young Emmy award-winning composer Bear McCreary, who has been in demand ever since ""Battlestar."" For example, he won that Emmy for the Starz TV series ""Da Vinci's Demons,"" and most recently, he's composed the theme for the high-profile network series ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" and the upcoming Starz series ""Black Sails."" McCreary recently spoke to CNN about what goes into TV music in the 21st century, and whether it now stands shoulder to shoulder with movie scoring. CNN: How did you first find yourself in this line of work? Bear McCreary: I've never wanted to do anything else for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid, I loved film and television and loved music. I was always keenly aware of music in film and television, more so than anyone else I knew. When I'd go see a movie, my friends would talk about the cool spaceships (and later, the hot chicks). But for me, I would talk about how Jerry Goldsmith used the French horns instead of the English horns to signify a different character, or what Danny Elfman or Elmer Bernstein was doing. These were my heroes growing up, so it never occurred to me to do anything else with my life. It was predestined almost. I'm very lucky that I got into it, because there's literally nothing else I would be interested in doing in my life. My first project was ""Battlestar Galactica,"" which put me on the map in a big way in science fiction. Even the horror and suspense genres, action shows -- I do a lot of work in that environment. When (creator) David Goyer called me about doing ""Da Vinci's Demons,"" it was the first time I was asked to do a historical period piece, so I leapt at the opportunity. One of the things that makes it different -- when you're doing regular TV, or science fiction especially, you can't really argue with how music sounds. You can do whatever you want. It doesn't mean it's always tasteful, but there's no right or wrong. I really wanted to embrace the restrictions of that time period -- Renaissance instrumentation, Renaissance melodies -- I really wanted to evoke that period. The problem was Goyer wanted to do the opposite of that. It was a very modern adventure show. What ended up happening is actually a hybrid of both ideas. We ended up with this unique hybrid. When you hear it, ends up sounding like the show -- it doesn't sound like anything else. CNN: At what point in the process of making a TV episode is the music composed? McCreary: I definitely know what's coming. I'm aware of where the stories are going. But ultimately that's to get some preliminary ideas in the back of my mind. I look at the finished video to figure out what it needs -- are there shortcomings? Are there storylines not quite being communicated? And that's when I sit with the showrunners and get from them what they want the audience to feel and what stories they want to track. Then I go back to my studio to add all that narrative connective tissue in a language that still stays true to the sound of the show. CNN: ""The Walking Dead"" has a memorably haunting theme. How did you approach making music for the apocalypse? McCreary: It's funny, I had dealt with the end of the world in ""Battlestar Galactica,"" ""Caprica,"" ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles."" Even with ""Eureka,"" I had done it. After a while, I had a feeling, wow, I'm the end of the world guy! With ""The Walking Dead,"" I wanted to focus on the opposite of that. I wanted to let the apocalyptic events unfold naturally. I try to focus on the actors' performance and try to support them. They're the ones who react -- they are us. When Rick crawls out of the hospital for the first time among all the bodies, the music -- given what he's seen and probably smelled at that time -- is pretty reserved. And that I think also heightens the tension. Horror is a particularly tricky genre for television. It's hard enough to scare an audience and keep them on the edge of their seat for two hours. You really have to pull out a lot of tricks to do that. We're on hour 50 of ""The Walking Dead"" and these producers are keeping people on their toes, and keeping things fresh and keeping it scary. So a subtle approach helps that, because when you have a really long duration story, you want to conserve your energy as much as possible. CNN: What is your favorite type of scene to score? Your most challenging scene? McCreary: It's very hard to say. I thrive on diversity. Action scenes are fun until you do a million of them. Emotional scenes are great until you get too many in a row. My favorite type of scene is one that has layers to it, narratively. I like scenes that when I look at them, it's not obvious what the music should be doing. Should it be scary? Should it be funny? What is the character thinking? If the slightest shift in the music will make you feel sympathy to one person over another, that's really fun and that puts the composer in a powerful position. There was a cue in ""The Walking Dead"" -- in the third season, the fourth episode, a major character died. I'm a bit of a method actor when I write, I can't write music for a scene without completely taking myself to this emotion and trying to channel my feelings into music. When people watched it, they were gutted and heartbroken when they saw this scene. I had to watch it probably 70 times. I would be weeping sometimes, my stomach hurt. I was truly miserable doing that scene. But the key turned out pretty good and moved people. Those sort of scenes are not fun to do. The process is not my idea of a good time, but the rewards are much higher. CNN: What are your favorite TV themes of all time? McCreary: The first TV theme that really popped up for me was ""The Simpsons."" Danny Elfman's interesting, harmonic take, using the tritone, which sounded a little weird. I remember picking that up on the piano and wondering why that note was weird. What stoked me as a kid was ""Mission: Impossible."" It is in 5/4. It is one of the handful of famous television theme songs that are not in 4/4 or 3/4. No one realized what they were hearing. It's very sophisticated scoring. CNN: Where do you think TV music is today? McCreary: (TV has) been a proving ground for actors, writers and directors. It's changing -- it's less the training ground to hone your skills and go onto movies. Now, you get good at your skill and you get onto really incredible television shows. The scores on TV are so satisfying. For me -- to take it back to ""Da Vinci"" -- it feels like a bit of a renaissance in the industry. CNN: I saw that they recently created an instrument based on Leonardo da Vinci's design -- a hybrid of a piano and cello. McCreary: I heard about the designs on the codex for this and planned to build this and do something with it for a future episode, having no idea this guy had built it. Of course I was thrilled when this went up on the social media radar. It just puts Leonardo as a pop culture figure in the mainstream -- though he never really left. The mechanics are different, like a rotating keyboard and the hurdy-gurdy engine. David Goyer and I are talking about it and we've got some ideas cooking.","Music and theme songs continue to be among the most memorable parts of TV .

"(CNN) -- Its name is Black Beauty, and it has traveled a long way to tell you about its home: Mars. This meteorite, discovered in northern Africa, contains preserved materials from the Red Planet that are 4.4 billion years old, say scientists in a new study published in the journal Nature. Black Beauty, they say, may be the first identified example of crust from ancient Mars, and its age suggests that the planet's crust formed within the first 100 million years of Mars' existence. ""It's just pressing its nose against the creation of Mars,"" lead study author Munir Humayun, a professor at Florida State University, said of the meteorite. What's more, the rock contains 10 to 30 times more water than any previous Martian meteorite, suggesting it was derived from a water-rich environment, said University of New Mexico professor Carl Agee, who was not involved in the Nature research, but separately studies Black Beauty. It is unlike any other Martian meteorite ever found, he said. ""If I were going to start looking (for evidence of past Martian life), this would be the first place I would go, to this meteorite, because it is a sample from the surface,"" Agee said. It's really old, older than we thought . Black Beauty contains zircon crystal grains that are 4.4 billion years old, according to the new study. That's only about 100 million years after the solar system's first dust condensed. ""Since it takes time to build up a crust, and to allow that crust to process itself until it can start growing zircons, it's pretty amazing that we have such ancient zircon,"" Humayun said. What's more, said Humayun, the oldest crusts of the Earth and moon formed at around the same time. Although scientists have found zircons that are almost that old on Earth, only one -- discovered in Western Australia -- is around the same age. But five zircons in this Martian meteorite alone -- some of the first zircons to come to Earth from Mars -- seem to date to 4.4 billion years old. ""A very large portion of the Martian crust must be very ancient,"" Humayun said. Humayun's sample of Black Beauty, officially called NWA 7533, is about the size of a fist, but all pieces of the meteorite together total about 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds). Earth sees a lot of meteorites generally; about 100 tons of rocks come in from space every day, said Don Yeomans, manager of the Near-Earth Object Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But rarely do we find Martian rocks. Less than 100 have been found, Humayun said. A large meteor impact on Mars, about 5 to 11 million years ago, was enough to eject material from the crust and into space in the form of this meteorite, Agee said. Cosmic ray exposure measurements suggest it was floating in space for all this time. Black Beauty had initially been described in a Science study published in February, led by Agee, which dated it to about 2.1 billion years old. But since then, Humayun and colleagues found the rock contains materials that are 4.4 billion years old, and published their new findings this week. Agee said his group has independently confirmed Humayun's results regarding the age. What accounts for this discrepancy? Agee said his first result may have been for the bulk rock -- that is, an average age of all of the rock types embedded within it. It's likely that the earliest formation of the meteorite was at 4.4 billion years, Agee said, but it continued to be shaped by geological processes for another 2 billion years before it blasted off into space. Agee and Humayun continue working on different Black Beauty samples separately, but not as rivals, said Agee. In fact, they are good friends. ""Two labs working completely independently coming up with similar conclusions is much more convincing than if you're all part of the same gang,"" Agee said. Different than other meteorites . NASA's most powerful and sophisticated rover on Mars, the 2-ton Curiosity, has given plenty of insight into the planet's former habitability since it landed there last year. But even it cannot do a great job of dating rocks. On Earth, scientists can better estimate ages because they can measure the amount of trace elements in rocks, not just the most common elements. The trace elements -- those that are present in tiny quantities in a particular sample -- can be more indicative of the processes that led to the formation of meteorites than common elements, Humayun said. The trace element iridium, present in this meteorite, indicates that it came from a mysterious area of Mars called the southern highlands. That makes Black Beauty the first known resident of the southern highlands to get to Earth. Other samples from Mars that have reached Earth have been coming from the Martian Northern Hemisphere, which has low, flat plains. The Southern Hemisphere, by contrast, has a lot of craters, Agee said, meaning it's about 3.8 billion years old or older. Given its newly confirmed age, Black Beauty is one of the oldest samples scientists have seen from Mars. The other possible contender for that title is the famous Allan Hills meteorite, which has been dated to a similar time frame. NASA announced in 1996 that the Allan Hills meteorite, discovered in Antarctica, contained evidence of primitive life, but that conclusion has since been disputed. Agee noted futher that the Allan Hills sample is a chunk of bedrock, and would not have interacted with water and the surface environment the way that Black Beauty did. In the meantime, scientists are also probing Black Beauty for ancient Martian fossils. So far none have turned up, Agee said, but there could still be chemical byproducts of primitive life hidden in the rock samples. Clues to Martian history . Mars had a lot of volcanic activity when Black Beauty's zircons formed 4.4 billion years ago, Humayun said. Volcanic processes would have released water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, which were trapped inside the interior of Mars, creating a ""a very quick, thick atmosphere, perhaps even an ocean on the surface."" In other words, we're talking about ""very livable conditions"" at that time, Humayun said. ""If there was a biosphere on Mars ever, this is the time it would have originated,"" he said. Unfortunately for whatever life may have existed then, these processes happened very early in the history of Mars. The planet then underwent heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets, forming the craters in the southern highlands and knocking the atmosphere and oceans off the planet. On Earth, a biosphere emerged after our own planet was bombarded, and took advantage of abundant sunlight. The cold, dry conditions at the surface of Mars today are so hostile that nothing could survive, Humayun said. But Black Beauty may hold clues to what might have lived early in the planet's history. ""We will be looking inside this rock for evidence of early micro-organisms that may have left behind chemical traces,"" he said. How it got to scientists . Recovered pieces of the meteorite, found in 2011, are now the subjects of intensive study. But they didn't just crash-land on scientists' desks. A thriving business has emerged in Northwest Africa among nomads who wander the Sahara Desert collecting fossils and other interesting rocks and sell them. That's how Black Beauty first got to a dealer, who sold it to a private collector in Indiana, who then gave it to Agee to look at. The rock sat on Agee's bookshelf for two months. He wasn't even sure that it was a meteorite. Finally, he decided to cut into it and see what it was. ""It was shiny black on the outside, and when I cut into it, it was still very black, but it had also white specks and sparkling specks, and it looked really different than anything I'd ever seen,"" Agee said. The Moroccan dealer who bought it from nomads called the meteorite ""Black Beauty,"" a name that has stuck among scientists working on it, Agee said. Once the word got out that Black Beauty was from Mars, the nomads scoured for more pieces of the meteorite, some of which ended up with Humayun. Any meteorite buff who sees Black Beauty would be ""struck by its odd beauty,"" Agee said. ""It is just a gorgeous sample,"" he said. ""It's so different. I always say to everybody, 'It's my favorite meteorite of all time.' "" As scientific investigations continue, researchers may find even more reasons to praise Black Beauty.

"(CNN) -- An oil pipeline exploded Friday in eastern China, killing at least 44 people, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Authorities said more than 135 others were injured when the pipeline caught fire near the port city of Qingdao, about 300 miles north of Shanghai. Rescue operations continued Saturday. The oil line sprung a leak in the pre-dawn hours, Xinhua said, citing the city government. The oil flow was cut off, and workers went out to repair the breach. The explosion occurred in the late morning. The pipeline, which is 176 kilometers (109 miles) long, belongs to Chinese petroleum giant Sinopec and connects the oil port to chemical plants further inland. Maritime authorities are checking the coastline for possible oil leaks, Xinhua said. None have been reported so far.","The pipeline caught fire near the port city of Qingdao .

"(CNN) -- Most Egyptians favor an advisory role for religious leaders in their country's new government, believe economic conditions are worsening and generally mistrust the United States, according to a Gallup survey released Monday. The survey, the first since the Egyptian revolution toppled Hosni Mubarak, found most Egyptians were positive about their future and their country's political and economic prospects. ""Egypt is at a vital crossroads,"" said Mohamed Younis, a senior analyst at the Abu Dhabi Gallup Center. ""This important data has now been shared with Egypt's citizens, and Egyptian and American leaders to assist in understanding the next steps in this country's history. The results, first presented Sunday during a public forum in Cairo, are based on a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of about 1,000 Egyptians who are 15 years of age or older, according to Gallup. This year's survey, titled ""Egypt from Tahrir to Transition: Egyptians on their assets and challenges and what leaders should do about it,"" examines current and future Egyptian perceptions of life in the country following 18 sometimes bloody days and nights of protests that led to Mubarak's resignation. After, Egypt's military -- which had largely stayed on the sidelines of the revolution -- officially took control of the nation's political apparatus, until an agreed-upon constitution and elections. The findings, according to Gallup, show ""Egyptian leaders must deliver on their people's expectations for free and honest elections, building on the success of the constitutional referendum."" ""Civil society activists and policymakers alike would do well to approach security and community cohesion as a local issue requiring reform of local institutions,"" the survey said. It's the fifth consecutive year Gallup has surveyed Egyptians, though the result this year clearly reflected a change in Egyptian opinions on social, religious and political reforms in Egypt. Among other findings, according to Gallup: . -- 92% of Egyptians say they would include freedom of speech as a provision if they were drafting a new constitution for the country . -- 67% say they would draft a provision for freedom of religion were they drafting a new constitution . -- 55% say they would include freedom of assembly in a new constitution . -- 92% say they have confidence in their religious institutions, while 96% say religion remains important in Egypt . -- 69% favor an advisory role for religious leaders, while 14% want religious leaders to have full authority . -- 9% wanted religious leaders to have no role in the new government. The survey also found that the role of social media in igniting the revolution has been largely overstated. It found only 8% of those surveyed relied on Twitter or Facebook for news on the nationwide protests that began January 25 in Tahrir Square. The survey says the majority got their news from Al Jazeera and Egyptian state-run media. When it comes to Egyptian-U.S. relations, the survey found that 68% of those polled believe the United States will try to exert influence over Egypt's future. But it also found that 88% of Egyptians face a U.S. model for their country, though 75% oppose the U.S. providing aid to political groups in the country. Many of those polled pointed to the U.S. support for Israel as a major stumbling block in trusting the United States. More than 60 %, two-thirds of those polled, said their opinion of the United States would significantly improve, if the U.S. pressured Israel to halt settlement expansion, withdrew its troops from Iraq and pulled its forces from Afghanistan. CNN's Jenifer Fenton contributed to this report.","The survey finds two-thirds of Egyptians are suspicious of the United States .

"(CNN) -- Spirit Airlines isn't happy with the new airline price advertising rule. The big ""Warning!"" sign popping up on the carrier's website makes that pretty clear. The message: ""New government regulations require us to HIDE taxes in your fares. This is not consumer friendly or in your best interest. It's wrong and you shouldn't stand for it."" The rule, which requires airlines to roll mandatory per-passenger taxes and fees into the advertised fare, went into effect this week as part of a new package of Department of Transportation airline passenger protections. Before the rule, airlines could advertise the base fare or show it on the first screen of online fare results, adding taxes and fees later in the shopping process. Opinion: Truth in advertising is the best policy . Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, called Spirit's message to customers a ""deliberate attempt to deceive the flying public"" in a letter Thursday to Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza, urging him to take the warning off the airline's website and clarify its message to consumers. Spirit Airlines is disappointed by the letter, said spokeswoman Misty Pinson. ""We would normally expect Senators to encourage (First) Amendment protection,"" Pinson said via e-mail. ""We have always shown taxes before someone purchased. They now want them hidden. It is wrong and we will fight for consumers,"" Pinson said. Spirit's online message encourages customers to contact lawmakers to oppose the rule. Boxer's office isn't buying the airline's First Amendment argument. ""Spirit Airlines seems to think it has a First Amendment right to deliberately mislead its own customers. I'm not sure that's what our founding fathers had in mind,"" said Boxer spokesman Andy Stone, noting that the Department of Transportation has fined Spirit in the past for deceptive price advertising. The Business Travel Coalition, a group advocating for transparency, calls Spirit's message ""a disgraceful lie"" employing ""over-the-top fear tactics."" Opinion: New rules make airfare seem higher . In messages to consumers, Spirit said the government has a ""hidden agenda"" to increase taxes. The Obama administration has proposed raising air travel taxes, which the DOT says is unrelated to the new regulation. ""We are simply requiring airlines to post the full fare, and we leave it to them to break it down if they want,"" DOT spokesman Bill Mosley said. Spirit is not the only airline that objected to the new regulations. Spirit, Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Air have all made legal appeals to have the price advertising rule overturned. Southwest said the rule singles out airlines. ""Our main objection ... is that there is no justification for treating air travel differently from just about everything else that consumers purchase, i.e. they pay for the price of goods and services and then pay tax. And that's how everything is advertised, as the price of the item separately from the tax on that price,"" Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King told CNN last month. Southwest's message to passengers about the new rule takes a different tack, explaining the changes and assuring consumers that while fares look higher, the airline and subsidiary AirTran have not raised fares.","Airline to customers: Fare rule ""wrong and you shouldn't stand for it""

"(CNN) -- Moments after crossing the line, the new marathon world record holder Wilson Kipsang had just one thought on his mind -- ""I can run faster"". The Kenyan athlete smashed the record for the 26.2 mile slog by a huge 15 seconds on the streets of the German capital of Berlin. Kipsang set a new mark of two hours, three minutes and 23 seconds Sunday to beat the time set by his compatriot Patrick Makau on the same course two years ago. ""This is a dream come true,"" said Kipsang, who won the bronze medal in the men's marathon at the 2012 London Olympic Games. ""I was feeling strong so I decided to push. I'm very happy that I've won and at breaking the world record. ""There was a lot of wind, I was really fighting. I still think I have the potential to run faster - anything under 2:03.23 would do."" Kipsang was born in Kenya's Keiyo District, an area popular for high altitude training, but it was on the fast streets of Berlin that he achieved his lifelong ambition. His marathon world record was the ninth set in the German capital and the eighth over the marathon course in the last 15 years.

"(CNN) -- ""Regime! Be very scared of us We are coming tonight with intent  The supporters of Al Ahly will fire everything up  God almighty will make us victorious Go, hooligans!""  Chant of the Al Ahly Ultras, before the Egyptian revolution . It was as if a levee had finally broken, and for once there was no retribution. Some 7,000 fans of Al Ahly, Egypt's largest soccer club, gathered for the first match of the Egyptian football season and chanted the names of the regime and its apparatchiks they had fought for the past four years. ""F*** the mother of Hosni Mubarak!"" shouted Assad, the leader of Al Ahly's militant ultra group Al Ahlawy, at the police in front of him. Thousands followed suit. ""Go f*** your Minister, Habib al Adly!"" This show of dissent would have been ruthlessly cut down a few months ago. But Mubarak and Al Adly -- the former Minister of the Interior and the man formally in charge of Egypt's hated police force -- were now under arrest. ""The police would abuse us every day,"" Assad said. ""Now it's our time."" Even so, he didn't want his real name used for fear of arrest. Al Ahly took on their city rivals Zamalek in Africa's biggest derby football match on Wednesday in a game that divided Cairo between the red of Al Ahly -- the most decorated team in Africa and a club whose identity has always been aligned with the poor, the devout and the nationalistic -- and the white of Zamalek, a side followed by an awkward squad of intellectuals, poets and outsiders. Traditionally it has been one of the most violent derbies in world football, with the match -- which ended in a 2-2 draw -- taking place at the neutral Cairo International Stadium under heavy police guard. But a few months earlier the ""ultras"" among both sets of fans stood side by side during Egypt's revolution. This may have been dubbed the ""Facebook Revolution,"" but improbably it was a football revolution too, where organized fan groups, if only for a little while, played a crucial role in bringing down a government. But today that unity is gone. The Egyptian Premier League was almost cancelled amid fears that football violence between fans would destabilize the country further. It was decided that the season would continue but the league has been scarred by the upsurge of football violence between the competing ultra groups, as well as the purging of Mubarak supporters from the Egyptian Football Association, including the country's most successful national coach, Hassan Shehata. His failure to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations -- a tournament the Pharaohs have won a record seven times -- may have been the reason for his sacking, but his support for Mubarak meant few mourned his passing. ""Living under Mubarak was like living under communism in Eastern Europe ... nobody could talk to each other, as they have the potential to organize,"" explained Assad. ""The whole concept of any independent organization didn't exist, not unions, not political parties. Then we started to organize football ultras ... to them it was the youth, in big numbers -- very smart people -- who could mobilize themselves quickly. They feared us."" Al Ahlawy soon grew into something more violent and anti-authoritarian. Members were arbitrarily beaten and arrested, fans harassed by being strip-searched or humiliated. Assad himself had been arrested and thrown in jail. Al Ahly's football matches provided a microcosm of the heavy-handedness that the rest of the country felt on a daily basis in Mubarak's Egypt. ""The more they tried to put pressure on us, the more we grew in cult status. The Ministry and the media, they would call us a gang, as violent,"" said Assad. ""It wasn't just supporting a team; you were fighting a system and the country as a whole. We were fighting the police, fighting the government, fighting for our rights ... this was something new, a little bit of a seed that was planted four years later."" The skills that Assad and his Al Ahlawy had honed during four years of fighting the police came in handy when the January 25 revolution, and the ""Day of Rage"" that took place three days later, saw the confrontation between the authorities turn violent. ""I don't want to say we were solely responsible for bringing down Mubarak!"" Assad laughed. ""Our role was to make people dream, letting them know if a cop hits you, you can hit them back. This was a police state. Our role started earlier than the revolution. During the revolution, there was the Muslim Brotherhood, the activists and the ultras. That's it."" And what of their hated rivals, Zamalek and their group the Ultras White Knights? Did they join forces on the front line? ""For a few hours,"" spat Assad, as if he had made a pact with the devil. ""But I couldn't do it for long."" The Ultras White Knights (UWK) were more magnanimous. One of their leaders, Ahmed, cautiously agreed to meet in Nasr City. He had good reason to be careful. Earlier this year Zamalek fans had stormed the pitch during an African Champions League match against the Tunisian Club Africain, destroying the goals and attacking the players. The UWK had been blamed. Now the authorities were arresting its leaders. The three men sitting in Costa Coffee couldn't have looked less like violent football revolutionaries. Ahmed, a gentle-natured, heavy-set man in his early 20s, was a production manager. Mohammed was a lawyer; Massoud a student. ""There is a war between us and the police,"" said Ahmed. ""We are fighting them in every match. We know them. We know when they run, when we should make them run. We were teaching them (the protesters) how to throw bricks."" ""On the Day of Rage (January 28) we made a plan,"" Mohammed continued. ""Every group, 20 each, traveled separately. On our own, it was nothing. But together as a group in the square we were a big power ... 10,000-15,000 people fighting without any fear. The ultras were the leaders of the battle."" The victory didn't come without its cost. Three were killed, according to Ahmed, ""one in Suez, one in Alexandria, one in Cairo. And a lot of injuries. One was shot in the stomach."" But would the old rivalry with Al Ahly return? ""During the march we celebrated with each other. We were fighting with Al Ahlawy on the front line,"" Ahmed recalled. ""We are trying to make a peace treaty with Al Ahlawy, because we are fighting in the same direction.""","Al Ahly and Zamalek face each other in the Cairo derby at the city's International Stadium .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Islam Lotfy may look like your average 35-year-old Cairene. He's dark, clean-shaven, slightly chubby and wears glasses. There's nothing in his appearance that hints at his Islamist identity, save for the prayer mark on his forehead. Lotfy is, in fact, an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood -- Egypt's largest opposition movement, which was banned from politics under the former regime of Hosni Mubarak. Lotfy is a lawyer who specializes in human rights cases and also a member of a youth coalition that comprises young Egyptian revolutionaries of varied ideologies. The young members of the coalition are united by a single goal: ensuring Egypt's transition to a civil democratic state. More than four months after Mubarak was forced from office in mass uprisings that erupted January 25, Lotfy and other young Muslim Brotherhood members say they are feeling increasingly alienated from the Islamist organization that shaped their political beliefs and influenced their behavior for most of their lives. ""We are not in agreement with all of the principles adopted by the older members of the group,"" Lotfy acknowledged recently over espressos at Groppi's, a tea room in downtown Cairo. ""Our motives are different ... we have Egypt's best interests at heart."" Prior to this year's mass protests that swept across Egypt, it was rare to hear a younger member of the Muslim Brotherhood openly criticize the group's elder leaders. Lotfy's statements suggest a possible split within the ranks of Egypt's most organized political movement. Behind the rift is support from younger members for Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh -- a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood who has announced his candidacy in the upcoming presidential election. The movement's older leaders had ruled out fielding a candidate in the presidential vote and have responded by blacklisting Aboul Fotouh. Their decision to stay out of the presidential race, however, does not mean they lack political ambition. In statements to the news media made after Mubarak was forced from office in February, Mohamed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood leader, declared that the group would seek 35% of the seats in Parliament. But that was before the Islamists scored a victory in the March referendum vote for proposed constitutional amendments. The result of the referendum was a resounding 77% favoring a yes vote. That outcome fueled the political ambitions of the Islamists, who had warned voters that a no vote would have been ""un-Islamic."" After the results were announced, Muslim Brotherhood leaders declared their intentions to compete for around 50% of parliamentary seats in the upcoming election. But the vote was a blow to the secularists and pro-democracy activists who had hoped to garner support for the drafting of a new constitution to replace the old one. Fearing a rise in political Islam, they have called for delaying the legislative election to allow more time for new political movements to organize. Activists fear that, if the vote is held in two months as planned, the Muslim Brotherhood and remnants of Mubarak's National Democratic Party, as the country's only organized parties, would dominate the lower house of Parliament, called the People's Assembly. Calls to postpone the election have gone unheeded and the ruling Supreme Military Council has announced that the vote will be held as scheduled. Despite growing concerns among some analysts that the Islamists are gaining ground, others remain confident that the group is unlikely to win more than 20% of the seats in parliament. Activist Hisham Qassem pointed to the schisms within the Muslim Brotherhood and noted that the situation today differs greatly from what it was like during the election six years ago. ""In the 2005 election, disgruntled voters had flocked to the ballot box to vote NDP members out,"" he said. Running as independents, the Islamists won a fifth of the seats in parliament in the 2005 election. ""But, the Brotherhood has now lost the 'I-hate-Mubarak' votes,"" Qassem said. On the streets of Cairo, similar views were expressed by residents, including those in poor neighborhoods like Imbaba and el Doweika, where the Muslim Brotherhood has been most active, offering a range of much-needed social services. ""I will certainly vote in the next legislative election, but my vote won't go to the Islamists,"" said Salem Fathalla, a mechanic in Imbaba's working-class district. ""All they are after is a power grab."" ""The loyalty of the Brotherhood lies with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Iran; they don't really care much about the welfare of this country,"" said Taher Abdel Fattah, a bearded, 56-year-old taxi driver. ""No one knows what their agenda really is,"" he added. Outlining the Muslim Brotherhood's vision for a ""new Egypt,"" Mohamed Morsi said the group wants a civil democratic state with laws drawn from Islamic Shariah law. ""Egypt is a predominantly Muslim country, but we have Christians too living in our midst; it is their country too,"" he said. It is therefore not surprising that the new political party launched by the Muslim Brotherhood under the name ""Justice and Freedom"" is open to Christians -- and to women. The Supreme Military Council now running the country has made it clear that no party will be allowed to run along religious lines. In a surprise move, the Obama administration this week announced it would open a dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood, saying that ""it is in the interests of the U.S. to engage with all parties that are committed to non-violence and that intend to compete for the parliament and the presidency."" Mahmoud Ghozlan, a spokesman for the Islamist group, said the United States "" must first respect the people's choices for a true democracy, independence and respect their choice of leaders. We would welcome the open dialogue, if they are serious and transparent."" Meanwhile, Lotfy and at least 20 other young members of the Muslim Brotherhood have teamed up with other young activists espousing different ideologies to launch their own political party, ""Egyptian Trend,"" a move that risks their expulsion from the Islamist bloc. Mahmoud Hussein, the Brotherhood secretary general, has said that any Muslim Brotherhood members who join competing political parties will be penalized. ""Members of the Brotherhood are banned from joining any party except the Brotherhood's own Justice and Freedom party,"" he recently told the independent Al Shorouk newspaper. Lotfy said he regrets the move by Brotherhood leadership to ostracize him and insisted that the new party he has helped to establish will work toward fulfilling the goals of the revolution. Among its priorities will be ending corruption and social injustice, eradicating poverty and increasing civil liberties--demands made by opposition activists during 18 days of protest in Tahrir Square this year. Lotfy, who has worked with other young activists in the 25 January youth coalition to chart a way toward a successful transition to democracy, said he hopes to use the experience to help build the new Egypt. ""There's a lot of work to be done and Egypt must come first,"" he said.","Youth coalition seeks to help Egypt transition to a civil democratic state .
Some younger members say they feel isolated from the Islamist organization .
""Our motives are different,"" says 35-year-old Islam Lotfy ."
"(CNN) -- The gruesome images are clear. There's little doubt Syrians suffered a chemical attack last month. But videos of the aftermath -- including 13 shown to Congress -- do nothing to show who was responsible. President Barack Obama says he has ""high confidence"" that the regime is to blame -- the strongest position short of confirmation. But his administration has not released hard evidence. Secretary of State John Kerry says declassifying any more information could endanger ""sources and methods"" of U.S. intelligence gathering. Britain, France and NATO also blame Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the horror in a Damascus suburb last month. Still, as Obama engages in a full-court press to build U.S. support for strikes, some Americans hear echoes of a different basketball analogy: ""slam dunk."" That's how then-CIA Director George Tenet described what turned out to be flawed intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the war 10 years ago. Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel were senators at the time. ""We are especially sensitive, Chuck and I, to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence. And that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and re-scrubbed the evidence,"" Kerry told Congress. Some lawmakers remain skeptical. ""The administration is asking us to go to war on the basis of a four-page document and a 12-page document and none of the underlying evidence,"" Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, complained on CNN's New Day Saturday. ""They have evidence showing the regime has probably the responsibility for the attacks. They haven't linked it directly to Assad, in my estimation,"" Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, told CNN's State of the Union Sunday. Beyond a reasonable doubt or no? U.S. says both . White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said the intelligence passes a ""common sense test."" ""Now, do we have a picture or do we have irrefutable, beyond a reasonable doubt evidence? This is not a court of law. And intelligence does not work that way,"" he told CNN's State of the Union. But Kerry said last week, ""We can tell you beyond any reasonable doubt that our evidence proves the Assad regime prepared for this attack, issued instructions to prepare for this attack, warned its own forces to use gas masks."" Kerry says the amount of information that's been declassified is ""unprecedented."" That information boils down to summaries of what the evidence is. 'Concrete' evidence: Described, not declassified . Physical, ""concrete"" evidence shows where the rockets came from, when they were fired, and that not one landed in regime-controlled territory, Kerry said. ""Satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred,"" a declassified White House report says. ""... The lack of flight activity or missile launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used rockets in the attack."" The White House released a map, but no satellite images. The report also cites ""multiple streams of intelligence,"" without giving specifics. 'Intercepted communications' ""In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack,"" the U.S. report says. ""Syrian chemical weapons personnel were operating in the Damascus suburb of 'Adra... near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin. On August 21, a Syrian regime element prepared for a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus area, including through the utilization of gas masks."" ""We have a body of information, including past Syrian practice, that leads us to conclude that regime officials were witting of and directed the attack,"" the report says. ""... We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence."" Intelligence shows Syrian chemical weapons personnel were told to cease operations in the afternoon of August 21 and that the regime then ""intensified the artillery barrage"" in the area, the report says. The material remains classified. U.S.: Opposition doesn't have 'the capacity' U.S., British, and French intelligence reports all agree that the opposition couldn't have pulled off such an attack. ""We are certain that none of the opposition has the weapons or capacity to effect a strike of this scale, particularly from the heart of regime territory,"" Kerry told lawmakers. The White House report points to Syria's known stockpiles of chemical agents. And it says the United States assesses ""with high confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year, including in the Damascus suburbs. This assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of Syrian officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals, which revealed exposure to sarin. ""We assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons."" In May, a U.N. official said there were strong suspicions that Syrian rebel forces had used sarin gas. But the findings were not conclusive, the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry for Syria said at the time, and the opposition Syrian Coalition condemned any use of chemical weapons. The U.S. State Department said at the time it had no evidence suggesting rebels had used chemical weapons. Russia, a Syrian ally, says its investigation of a March attack in Aleppo, which apparently involved chemical weaopns, found that the charge used was homemade and similar to projectiles produced by the group Bashaar al-Nasr, part of the opposition Syrian Islamic Liberation Front. Sarin was discovered in samples from the scene, the foreign ministry said. Assad's motive unclear . Some experts on the region question why al-Assad would have ordered the attack. ""Al Assad has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage, and in this phase of the conflict. He is not losing,"" writes Ed Husain of the Council on Foreign Relations in a CNN Opinion column. He pointed out that some suggest the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front or other opposition elements may have carried out the attack to bait America into the conflict. William Polk, who served U.S. administrations during the Cuban Missile Crisis and and 1967 Middle East War, writes in The Atlantic, ""I do not see what Assad could have gained from this gas attack."" Analyst: 'No way in hell' U.S. can back up death toll . Questions about the purported death toll in last month's attack also raises questions about the solidity of the information the U.S. is using. A preliminary assessment ""determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children,"" the U.S. report says. ""Secretary Kerry seems to have been sandbagged into using an absurdly over-precise number,"" says Anthony Cordesman, former director of intelligence assessment at the U.S. Defense Department. Now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Cordesman writes on the CSIS website, ""Put simply, there is no way in hell the U.S. intelligence community could credibly have made an estimate this exact."" The methodology used to come up with the toll remains classified. Rebel leaders have said more than 1,300 people were killed. Britain's Joint Intelligence Organization says at least 350 people were killed. A French report says several sources estimated at least 355 deaths, while others estimate 1,500. U.N. won't place blame . The United Nations is calling on world leaders not to take action until the results of the U.N. probe are in. But it's unclear how soon that may be. And the U.N. team's mandate was only to determine whether chemical weapons were used -- not by whom. And Obama says that cat's out of the bag. ""Frankly, nobody is really disputing that chemical weapons were used,"" he said. So, short of a shocking finding that chemical weapons were not used, it's unclear how much of an effect the U.N. results will ultimately have. Meanwhile, the Syrian regime continues to insist rebels were behind any chemical attack. But it offers no proof to back that up. After word broke Sunday that al-Assad had done an interview with Charlie Rose of CBS and PBS denying any involvement in chemical weaopns attacks, Kerry was asked for a response. ""The evidence speaks for itself,"" he said.","Americans have not seen the evidence the Obama administration describes .
Two U.S. officials differ on ""reasonable doubt""
Obama has ""high confidence,"" the strongest position short of confirmation .
""No way in hell"" the U.S. knows such a specific death toll, a former defense official says ."
"(CNN) -- Several potential Republican presidential contenders are heading to Las Vegas this week, hoping to hit the jackpot. And that's before they hit the casinos. They hope the political payoff will come in appearances before some of the party's most influential donors attending the Republican Jewish Coalition annual spring meeting. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and current Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and John Kasich of Ohio will speak before the group, which seeks to promote Jewish causes among Republicans. Many of the nation's leading Republican fundraisers and donors are part of the organization. Some donors estimate about a third of the party's most important fundraisers are active in the coalition, so it's a major audience for the possible presidential candidates attending. Bush is getting a lot of attention because he has been tapped to speak at a private, VIP dinner with major financiers on Thursday night -- giving him top billing for the event and a major platform as he considers whether to seek the party's nomination. While he has said he won't make a decision until the end of this year and won't engage in further talk about the subject, Bush has recently picked up the pace with his political schedule, appearing in the past two weeks at fundraisers for Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, and Govs. Susana Martinez, R-New Mexico, and Brian Sandoval, R-Nevada, both running for re-election, as well as at an event for House Republicans helping him build a network of supporters if he needs one. ""Jeb has something to prove at this meeting,"" one influential Republican donor who will be attending told CNN. ""It is pretty significant"" for him to come to the event because he has refused to tip his hand any more about his intentions, the donor said. ""Jeb has to do a good job of handling that issue."" Another party money man said the event is a ""great opportunity for him"" with decision-makers. ""Showing up and speaking is showing 'I am taking this seriously,' "" is how he put it to CNN. Bush, who served as Florida's governor from 1999 to 2007, is liked by many in this key group. During his tenure, and his father's and brother's time in the White House, they built good relations with the American Jewish community. Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton together again to talk education . Many eyes on Christie as well . Christie, who speaks on Saturday, is also known to many in this group. ""Most of the people will be making a judgment on Christie"" during his appearance, one of the donors told CNN. ""We are not absent 'Bridgegate,' "" referring to the scandal over the closing of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge last year in an apparent act of political retaliation by some of his aides. Christie has said he was not aware of the closings until they happened. ""People are going to want to have the hallway conversations ... private meetings"" to discuss where the controversy stands, the donor said. A different major party fundraiser said that Christie so far has emerged fine among many of the donors, who like his political accomplishments and policies. ""I don't think in the long term this will harm him,"" the fundraiser said. As Christie travels around the country raising millions as head of the Republican Governors Association, he is building up support among the donor class. Besides their public appearances at the meeting, Christie, Kasich and Walker all can be expected to have smaller individual sessions with some influential attendees. Christie: Bridge scandal doesn't change anything about 2016 . Will Adelson tip his hand? The host for the weekend activities is Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, owner of the Venetian Casino where the meeting is taking place, and active in the Republican Jewish Coalition. Adelson and his wife gave $93 million to various groups and candidates in the 2012 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, making them the biggest individuals financiers of outside groups. The Thursday dinner will be at the airport hangar Adelson uses. While candidates and groups would love to have his support, several GOP donors said they doubt Adelson will tip his hand any time soon. One said he is ""very hard to uncover ... he likes to support existing groups with real structure."" Adelson did support the super PAC Winning Our Future that backed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 because of his pro-Israel stance, a majority priority for Adelson. Besides Adelson, some of the more influential Republican fundraisers include businessman Lewis Eisenberg, former ambassador Sam Fox, former Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, and former ambassador Mel Sembler. Santorum 'very open' to another presidential run . All over the place . Unlike four years ago where most of these donors ended up supporting Mitt Romney, this go-around is expected to be much different. ""You still have the donor groups all over the place,"" said one of the fundraisers while also emphasizing just how early in this process things stand. The amount of activity by the field of possible 2016 contenders reaching out to prospective financial backers is at about the same pace it was four years ago, several of those interviewed said. What is different, they said, is that the field at this stage appears to be shaping up to be much stronger than last time around -- meaning the battle for support among these key supporters will likely be intense. ""I think the difference is in the quality of the candidates,"" the fundraiser said. CNN has learned Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who have been traveling the country as part of their official duties, met recently with some prominent Republican donors, but did not indicate their future plans. One of the most active Republicans considering a White House bid has been Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has met with donors and who has been working to broaden his appeal beyond his father's libertarian base.

"Rahman Mina Camp, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A 30-minute drive from the heart of the Afghan capital along dusty pot-holed roads lie the slums of the city. In the distance are plains with some patches of greenery before they hit a mountain range that juts out of the earth. We're in Rahman Mina Camp, also known as the slum of Kabul. Dirty brown canvas tents litter the landscape, as children walk barefoot next to open sewers. A group of women, wearing blue burqas, carry their young children into one particular tent. On the outside is a UNICEF logo next to a sign for ACF International -- the two humanitarian organizations that fund this medical clinic, which is a last resort for some very desperate mothers. We follow the Afghan women inside and are slammed by the heat and noise inside this low ceiling canvas tent. Dozens of women sit on the floor nursing their children. They've lifted up their burqas to let in some air but when they see the camera they drop the blue veils over their faces. Some children cry, others appear too weak and exhausted to even let out a whimper. Some of the babies have black eyeliner drawn around their eyes. I'm told it's to keep away the ""evil eye"" and bad spirits. A nurse calls out a name and 30-year old Rahela stands, picking up her daughter Bibi -- the youngest of her five children. Bibi is 15 months old but very small for her age. Doctors tell me she has a condition called stunting -- acute malnutrition that affects the growth of a child. They follow the nurse under one of the curtains off the main waiting area where Bibi's measurements are taken. Staff members put a tape measure around her arm, place her on scales and make her lie down on the table to accurately measure her height. Bibi starts crying, calling out for her mother. As Rahela tries to comfort her little girl, she tells me: ""My child was born very weak. All my children were born weak and underweight. I went to a clinic close to my home but they told me to come here. I've been coming here twice a month for three months and Bibi is now getting much better. She's putting on weight and getting stronger."" Once Bibi's measurements are taken, Rahela takes her little hand and leads her to a man behind a desk at the end of the tent. He's handing out food supplements -- energy dense nutrients -- and putting them in plastic bags. He tells Rahela how much to give Bibi and how often to feed her. A lot of these mothers don't know how to nourish their children properly. A lot of them have little choice because they are so poor. Rahela explains to me: ""Our life situation is not good. We are suffering a bad time. My husband has a job, but his salary is not enough for our monthly expenses. I have five children, so his salary is not enough for us."" UNICEF estimates more than three million children in Afghanistan under the age of five suffer from stunting and one-third of those cases are acute. These are some of the highest levels in the world. The technical definition for the condition is low height for age, and the causes are numerous. It's the result of poor nutrition, lack of access to health care, poverty, a mother's malnourishment, natural disasters and war. Afghanistan has been torn by war of one kind or another for more than three decades, which only exacerbates this life-threatening problem. Dr. Moazzem Hossain, Chief of Health and Nutrition for UNICEF, visits the clinics in Afghanistan several times a year from his base in Bangladesh. He says these outreach programs can sometimes be the difference between life and death. ""These clinics are so important because when you have high levels of acute malnutrition that doesn't just have an immediate impact on a child's mobility and chance of sickness...the chances of mortality and dying are much higher."" He says inappropriate feeding practices are often at the core of the problem. Poor and uneducated Afghan women have received misinformation that breastfeeding is bad and not good for your child. And those that do breastfeed will dilute it with water or tea. It's a huge problem facing health groups working in Afghanistan, as they desperately try to re-educate mothers on the importance of breastfeeding. UNICEF nutritionist Elham Monsef weighs into the conversation explaining that somewhere in the last 20 years the message has been mixed up. ""I spoke to a doctor in Afghanistan who said his grandmother used to feed all the poor babies in her village with her breast milk. Now these women are told to use instant formula or mix it with water and crushed biscuits. It's such a dangerous message. Breast milk is the golden drop for the child and the best chance of giving these kids the start they will need in what will be a tough life."" A nurse calls out a new name -- this time an 18-year-old woman called Karima picks up her two listless children off the floor. She's traveled more than two hours to get here. In her arms are seven-month-old boy Aqhaigul and her three-year old daughter Gulmina. They look roughly the same size. Gulima has sores all over her face and patches of skin missing from her legs. She wears a dirty pink outfit and no shoes. She clings to her mother and whimpers. ""My child was very weak and under weight when she was born,"" says Karima, a mother of four. ""We didn't have money, so someone told me about this clinic, and I brought her here to hopefully get some medicine."" Doctors examine Gulmina and tell her mother she has a very severe case of malnutrition and must go to hospital. Confused by what doctors are saying, her husband Rahmad arrives and takes charge. He's 38 years old but looks at least 10 years older with his dry, weathered skin. He sells corn on the street to support his family and asks: ""Who is going to pay for us to go to the doctors? Who is going to pay for her treatment?"" The nurse gives Gulmina a sachet of the energy dense food that comes in the form of peanut paste. She slowly opens her mouth and sucks it. Her father smiles and continues to feed her, forcing it into her mouth. The nurse explains that she needs time to digest and break it up with mouthfuls of water. As life returns to Gulmina's little brown eyes her young mother relaxes a little. She knows her child is out of danger for now but explains the reality of their lives and the hardship they face everyday. ""We don't have enough food, and sometimes our four children have nothing to eat. We live in a tent; we have few belongings. If my husband gets work, then we can find food. If not, then we all eat less. This can go on for days.""","At a UNICEF aid tent in Afghanistan families line up with sick, malnourished children .

"(CNN) -- Seth Green and Matt Senreich, known for their maniacally inventive manipulation of action figures on ""Robot Chicken,"" now want the viewing public to have a similar sense of control over a real person. Their vision arrives in the form of ""ControlTV,"" a new Web series that takes the standard reality format and adds to it an element of interactivity, possibly creating a novel form of entertainment in the process. Green and Senreich are joined in the venture by ""The Bachelor"" director Ken Fuchs, former president of Dimension Films, Richard Saperstein, commercial director Stephen Kessler and the full-service video network DBG. The premise of ""ControlTV"" is simple: For six weeks, the life of an unemployed 20-something named Tristan Couvares is documented and streamed live on the internet for 18 hours a day. The hook is that he's agreed to relinquish his own free will for that of the collective, meaning viewers can vote on just about everything he does. They'll decide what he eats, where he goes, who he dates, even the frequency and duration of his workouts, all in real time. To some, this might sound like an opportunity for a bunch of Web-trolling sadists to anonymously mess with a stranger, but Green and Senreich's intentions seem genuinely benevolent. Tristan's at a cross-roads in his life, doesn't have a job, a girlfriend or an abundance of accomplishments, and he's basically not sure what to do with himself. The hope is that viewers will help him figure that out, that the wisdom of the crowd will point him in the right direction. It helps that Tristan's a likable guy, as his success will probably depend on whether or not the voters are pulling for him. The show's essentially a character study, but not only of Tristan. It's the general character of the audience, or people in general, that will be revealed most tellingly, based on how they treat him. Lastly, it's worth noting that ""ControlTV"" is much less filtered than other reality shows. Nothing much happens at times, but that's almost preferable to the overly-contrived situations that typify rest of the genre. As we watch Tristan make breakfast, click a mouse or sit in a chair, we'll be surprised most of all by the fact that we're still watching, but Green and Senreich understand that even the most mundane moments can become fascinating from a voyeuristic distance.","Seth Green and Matt Senreich have launched the online reality webisodes, ""ControlTV""

"(CNN) -- Bangladesh's Cabinet decided to inspect the safety and security of all garment factories Monday after last week's deadly building collapse, state news reported. At least 398 people were killed when a factory collapsed at Rana Plaza in Savar, a Red Crescent official told CNN, and up to 2,773 people survived. Under the inspection plan, a committee led by a state minister would visit the factories and submit a report to the government about the safety measures, Cabinet Secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan told reporters. The panel includes the ministries of home, labor, disaster management, textiles, defense, industries and environment. M.S. Akbar, chairman of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, said the rescue operation might be completed by Tuesday or Wednesday. At least two bodies were pulled from the wreckage Monday, but no survivors were found. Rescuers are now using heavy machinery to remove wreckage at the site of the collapsed building, suggesting the hunt for survivors of the disaster is coming to an end. ""It is hardest for those family members who do not know if their loved ones are dead or alive or trapped,"" Akbar said. The chances of finding more survivors were dim ""unless there's a miracle."" Many workers hailed from the country's north . Most of the factory workers were between the ages of 18 and 22, said Morshed Ali Khan, editor of the local Daily Star newspaper. Most were impoverished residents from the country's northern region who went to the city to find work. Many were parents with children still waiting for them to come home. Khan has seen several hundred families looking for loved ones each of the past five nights. ""A strong stench of rotting human flesh has taken over the scene. It is very hard to stand next to the site,"" he told CNN. Yet children and their grandparents still waited at the scene Monday. They said they would camp out at the site until they get the body of their loved one, Khan said. Some relatives have lost work while waiting at the site. Many sleep on the street or quietly clutch a photo. One man was talking to himself with a photo of his son in his hand. Some have given up hope of finding their relatives alive. ""Yesterday a woman told me, 'I want the dead body of my daughter so I can take her dead body home to bury,' "" Khan said. Rescue efforts . Rescue teams have been combing through the debris since Wednesday morning, when the nine-story building collapsed and buried thousands of garment workers. ""We will proceed extremely cautiously,"" Brig. Gen. Ajmal Kabir told reporters at the scene Sunday. Sunday evening's rescue efforts were disrupted by reports that a fire had broken out as workers tried to cut through mangled metal trapping a woman identified only as Shahana. Shahinul Islam of Bangladesh's Inter Services Public Relations -- a department of the Ministry of Defense -- told reporters that the fire was put out shortly afterward, but it was not clear what happened to the woman. Local media reports said she died. The commercial building, containing five garment factories, several shops and a bank, was in Savar, about 45 kilometers (27 miles) from the capital, Dhaka. Cracks had appeared in the building structure a day before the collapse, but garment workers were told to come in despite their concerns that the building was unsafe. Authorities have arrested seven people: three factory owners; two government engineers; the owner of the building, Sohel Rana, a local leader of the ruling Awami League who was caught as he tried to flee the country; and Rana's father. OPINION: Who really pays for our cheap clothes? John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, told CNN that while people should be held accountable, Bangladesh's government and the garment industry must also take steps to protect their workers. He said research conducted by Human Rights Watch indicated that there were only 18 inspectors for the 100,000 factories operating in and around Dhaka. ""What this tragedy really needs to result in is stricter labor laws, stricter safety laws and the government coming to terms with the reality that it can't just supply all these workers without giving those workers their rights. ""There are only so many tragedies like this that can happen before Western retailers and Western buyers ... realize that they are going to go elsewhere, not because they necessarily can get lower prices but because the scandal is too much."" Journalist Katie Hunt wrote and reported from Hong Kong and Aliza Kassim reported from Atlanta. CNN's Saeed Ahmed, Harmeet Singh and Joe Sterling and journalist Farid Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll up to 398, Red Crescent Society says .

"(CNN) -- ""Number nine. Number nine. Number nine."" ""The Beatles: Rock Band,"" to be released Wednesday, lets players strum along with classics. The repetitive refrain from one of The Beatles' most mind-bending journeys into psychedelia -- ""Revolution 9,"" the audio pastiche from ""The White Album"" -- is now serving as the backbeat of a big day for the biggest band in rock 'n' roll history. On Wednesday -- 9/9/09 -- remastered versions of the Beatles catalogue will be released, giving listeners what the remaining members of ""The Fab Four"" say is the closest reproduction ever of how their music sounded in the studio. The same day, the video game ""The Beatles: Rock Band"" is set to be released by Harmonix. Modeled after the already popular ""Rock Band"" game, and closely supervised by The Beatles and their estates, the game lets players sing and strum along on a huge list of Beatles classics over scenes ranging from Liverpool's Cavern Club to their final performance on a London rooftop. And on top of that, there's rampant speculation that a planned ""music-themed"" announcement by Apple Inc., also scheduled on 9/9/09, could involve the supergroup. The Beatles are one of a handful of groups whose music has never been approved for sale by Apple's iTunes, and the timing of the announcement has fueled speculation that could finally change -- or even that specialized Beatles iPods, like the ones sold in 2004 loaded with U2's music, could be in the works. It's a remarkable amount of buzz for a band whose roots stretch back nearly five decades. And it's a clear sign, observers say, that through time and a multitude of cultural shifts, the group's hold on the public's imagination has endured. ""People are still looking at Picasso. People are still looking at artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original,"" said Robert Greenfield, a former associate editor at Rolling Stone magazine who has written about the band. ""In the form that they worked in, in the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive than The Beatles were."" Research shows that more than 40 years after their last public performance, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr's music remains as interesting to young people now as it ever was. A Pew Research survey released last month showed that 81 percent of respondents between ages 16-29 said they liked The Beatles. Eleven percent said they dislike the band and only 4 percent said they have never heard of them. By comparison, current rockers Coldplay received 39 percent positive responses, with 45 percent saying they'd never heard of them. Forty-two percent said they like hip-hop star Kanye West. ""To put this in perspective: Try imagining young adults back in the 1960s putting the big jazz bands of the roaring '20s at the top of their list of favorites,"" the survey reads. ""Not very likely."" Walter Everett, professor and chairman of music theory at the University of Michigan, said his students know The Beatles catalogue as well today as they would have 30 years ago. He said the cultural phenomenon that was The Beatles -- the frenzy-inducing early concerts, the furor when John Lennon said the group was ""more popular than Jesus,"" the pre-Internet obsession over ""Paul is dead"" rumors -- made them something more than just another rock group. ""They were just idolized,"" said Everett, who has written several books on the band. ""It was a musical revolution, but [also] the hair, the clothing, their attitude about the establishment, their support of everybody, young and old alike, to try to understand each other at a very difficult time. ""Some of that message endures."" But at the heart of the phenomenon, experts agree, is the music. From the charming, school-boy bop of ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" to the blistering assault of ""Helter Skelter,"" the songs, they say, were just that good. ""The point is how great the music is,"" Greenfield said. ""It isn't about the fact that The Beatles were willing to practice and get better at what they did -- it was the fact that that band contained at least two-and-a-half geniuses [Lennon, McCartney and, at times, Harrison]."" Wednesday's announcements -- and, in Apple's case, possible announcement -- show that the minders of The Beatles legacy are keeping up with how today's music consumers behave, said Bruce Burch, director of the University of Georgia's music business program. ""A lot of bands and artists have been slow to embrace the fact that technology is driving the industry,"" Burch said. ""Their music is not going away and this is a step for them for their music to come into the 21st century."" EMI, which will be releasing the remastered recordings, has been famously protective of The Beatles brand and music. Digital reproductions like MP3s have lower sound quality than albums or compact discs -- one of the reasons they've been slow to embrace iTunes. But if an announcement on that front is coming, Burch said, it would signal an acknowledgement that such quality-control concerns may be obsolete for the majority of the music-buying public. ""It's just a different audience out there,"" he said. ""They're used to listening on ear buds. The sound quality, in some cases, maybe isn't' as important to them."" Everett said that, even with all of the news expected Wednesday, the Beatles music will no doubt remain popular for decades to come -- meaning more new wrinkles are almost certain. ""There's still more that can be done,"" he said. ""Who knows where technology may be in another 10 years? We may have holographic images."" And regardless of how it's delivered, no one's expecting another band to ever eclipse the four lads from Liverpool who would go on to shape popular culture the world over. ""There will probably be another artist that comes along and captures the imagination,"" Burch said. ""But it will never be like The Beatles.""","9/9/09 a big day for The Beatles .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Featuring everything from hand-painted heels to a live (and semi-naked) woman, Hong Kong's latest art fair wrapped Sunday with sales topping HK$39 million ($5 million) -- up 50% on last year's inaugural event. A record 29,000 visitors came to check out the three-day exhibition -- the most in the fair's 15-year global history. But the art on sale here is not intended to break the bank. Affordable Art Hong Kong, a spinoff of the original event launched in London in 1999, attracts art enthusiasts from all walks -- and wallets -- of life, with original works on sale from unknowns and well-knowns at the more than 120 galleries represented from around the world. Amid the watercolors, oil on canvas and prints, eye-catching installations included bronze skulls and a live exhibit of a nearly nude woman being painted to blend into wallpaper. Organizers say it's up to the artists and galleries to set a price for each artwork, as long as it does not exceed HK$100,000 (roughly $13,000). Visitors could also satisfy their creative urges by trying their hand at Chinese painting and collage. A section on Hong Kong's young artists appealed to local tastes, while an ""Under HK$10,000 Wall"" catered to the art collector on a tighter budget. ""This is an area where people can come and find works that are about HK$1,000 to HK$10,000 (US$130-$1,300),"" said Camilla Hewitson, fair director. ""If there's something that really inspires, then you can find the gallery and have a discussion about that particular artwork."" 'The purpose is to democratize art' So is affordable art really that affordable? For many Hong Kong residents, the answer is no. The median monthly income for people living here is HK$14,100 ($1,800), according to the latest report from Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department. On that salary, buying the most expensive piece at the fair would cost seven month's wages, excluding daily living expenses like food, transportation and rent. But of course, it's all relative. Compared to Zeng Fanzhi's ""The Last Supper,"" which auctioned at Sotheby's 40th Anniversary Sale in Hong Kong last October for a record HK$180.4 million ($23.3 million), everything under HK$100,000 seems like a steal. Organizers of Affordable Art Fair say price is just a small part of their mission. ""The purpose is to democratize art -- to open it up to a much wider audience who wouldn't normally have the opportunity to see fantastic works on display,"" says Paul Matthews, director of development and global partnerships for the fair. ""People are very intimidated by the idea of going to galleries and each city we go to we help to break down those perceived barriers and get people understanding that there's art out there that they can afford -- and that art can be for everyone,"" he adds. Based on the fair's success in Asia so far, organizers say they are now looking to expand into South Korea, Japan and Taiwan in coming years. If you missed the show in Hong Kong, you can always hit the Affordable Art Fair at one of its upcoming global tour stops. It's heading to Maastricht, Netherlands next -- followed by New York, Toronto and Singapore. Click here for the full worldwide schedule. Hong Kong art galleries .

"(CNN) -- Controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders was cleared Thursday of inciting hatred against Muslims, the Dutch justice ministry said. Wilders was tried for inciting discrimination and hatred over a controversial film he made about Islam. The court in Amsterdam said comments by the leader of of the Party for Freedom were ""denigrating,"" but not illegal, the ministry said. Wilders' film ""Fitna,"" which he released online in March 2008 to international outcry, features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran in an apparent attempt to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. It drew complaints from the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as concern from the United States. Comments Wilders made in a variety of media between 2006 and 2008 formed part of the case against him. Wilders said he did nothing wrong. If found guilty, he would have faced up to two years in prison and a fine of up to 19,000 euros ($26,000) for each charge.

"(CNN) -- Five decades ago, Franklin McCain and three fellow African-American college students made history just by sitting down at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, and waiting. And waiting. And waiting -- for service that never came that day at the whites-only counter. The four came back the next day. And the next. The ""Greensboro Four,"" as they came to be known, drew national attention with their peaceful demonstration in the winter of 1960. Within three days of their first attempt to simply sit and eat, more than 300 students, including whites, were taking part in what was being called ""a sit-in"" in Greensboro. Nearly six months later, with similar sit-ins happening at dozens of whites-only lunch counters in Southern cities, the counter where it all started served its first black customers. McCain died Thursday after a brief illness, according to his alma mater, North Carolina A&T State University. He died in a hospital a few miles from the old Woolworth's location -- now the nonprofit International Civil Rights Center and Museum, which opened 50 years to the day McCain and his colleagues began their sit-in on February 1, 1960. The museum posted on its site a tribute to McCain and the other three students for their ""courageous act (that) marked a turning point in the struggle for equality that continues to this day."" McCain, 72, graduated from North Carolina A&T in 1964, and worked for a chemical company, the Celanese Corp., in Charlotte for almost 35 years, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. He was a member of the North Carolina university system's board of governors and was active in civil rights throughout his life, according to North Carolina A&T. ""His contributions to this university, the city of Greensboro and the nation as a civil rights leader are without measure. His legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of Aggies and friends throughout the world,"" A&T Chancellor Harold L. Martin said in a statement posted on the university's website. In 2010, McCain told CNN of his concern when an elderly white woman approached the lunch counter that day. ""I was thinking to myself, she must have knitting needles and scissors in that handbag of hers and they're about to go right through me,"" said McCain, a bespectacled freshman at the time. Instead of pulling a knitting needle on the young men, the woman placed her hand on McCain's shoulder and smiled warmly. ""She says, 'Boys, I am so proud of you. I only regret that you didn't do this 10 years ago,'"" McCain said. ""That was the greatest source of inspiration to me, probably for all my life, primarily because it came from a very unexpected person,"" he said. ""You picture 1960 in the South in a little old white lady's space and you are acting out of place, and she compliments you."" Another member of the four, Joseph McNeil, also spoke with CNN on the 50th anniversary of the sit-in and said the planned action grew out of lifetimes of personal experiences with segregation. ""Unless we decided to do something about it and took some action, our children would have had to also challenge racial segregation,"" said McNeil, a retired major general in the Air Force Reserves. ""Woolworth's was a national chain, and what we fundamentally wanted to do was to bring attention to the negative, and the evil of segregation."" In addition to McCain and McNeil, the Greensboro Four were Jibreel Khazan -- then known as Ezell A. Blair Jr. -- and David Richmond. Richmond died in 1990 at age 49, according to the Greensboro News & Record. Speaking of McCain as news of his death spread, Khazan told the New & Record, ""Frank would say we didn't want to set the world on fire, we just wanted to sit down and eat like everybody else. We wanted to be included in the round table of humanity."" People we've lost in 2014 .

"(CNN)  -- Archaeologists believe they have unearthed only a small fraction of Egypt's ancient ruins, but they're making new discoveries with help from high-tech allies -- satellites that peer into the past from the distance of space. The enclosure wall of the Great Aten temple in Egypt, as seen from the QuickBird satellite. ""Everyone's becoming more aware of this technology and what it can do,"" said Sarah Parcak, an archaeologist who heads the Laboratory for Global Health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""There is so much to learn."" Images from space have been around for decades. Yet only in the past decade or so has the resolution of images from commercial satellites sharpened enough to be of much use to archaeologists. Today, scientists can use them to locate ruins -- some no bigger than a small living room -- in some of the most remote and forbidding places on the planet. In this field, Parcak is a pioneer. Her work in Egypt has yielded hundreds of finds in regions of the Middle Egypt and the eastern Nile River Delta. Parcak conducted surveys and expeditions in the eastern Nile Delta and Middle Egypt in 2003 and 2004 that confirmed 132 sites that were initially suggested by satellite images. Eighty-three of those sites had never been visited or recorded. In the past two years, she has found hundreds more, she said, leading her to amend an earlier conclusion that Egyptologists have found only the tip of the iceberg. ""My estimate of 1/100th of 1 percent of all sites found is on the high side,"" Parcak said. These discoveries are of no small significance to the Egyptian government, which has devoted itself anew to protecting archaeological sites from plunder and encroachment. The Supreme Council of Antiquities has restricted excavation in the most sensitive areas along the Nile -- from the Great Pyramids at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo to the carvings of Ramses II in the remote south. Antiquities officials hope the move will encourage more surveys in the eastern Nile Delta in northern Egypt, Parcak said, where encroaching development in the burgeoning nation of 82 million poses the greatest threat to the sites. Old and modern methods . Parcak's process weds modern tools with old-fashioned grunt work. The archaeologist studies satellite images stored on a NASA database and plugs in global positioning coordinates for suspected sites, then tramps out to see them. Telltale signs such as raised elevations and pot shards can confirm the images. As a result, the big picture comes into view. ""We can see patterns in settlements that correspond to the [historical] texts,"" Parcak said, ""such as if foreign invasions affected the occupation of ancient sites. ""We can see where the Romans built over what the Egyptians had built, and where the Coptic Christians built over what the Romans had built. ""It's an incredible continuity of occupation and reuse."" The flooding and meanders of the Nile over the millennia dictated where and how ancient Egyptians lived, and the profusion of new data has built a more precise picture of how that worked. ""Surveys give us information about broader ancient settlement patterns, such as patterns of city growth and collapse over time, that excavations do not,"" said Parcak, author of a forthcoming book titled ""Satellite Remote Sensing and Archaeology."" The vagaries of climate in the region make satellite technology advantageous, too. ""Certain plants that may indicate sites grow during certain times of the year,"" Parcak said, ""while sites may only appear during a wet or dry season. This is different everywhere in the world."" Archaeologists working in much more verdant climates, such as Cambodia and Guatemala, also have used the technology to divine locations of undiscovered ruins. They have been able to see similarities between the vegetation at known sites and suspected sites that showed up in fine infrared and ultraviolet images covering wide areas of forbidding terrain. ""For the work I do [in Egypt], I need wet season images as wet soil does a better job at detecting sites with the satellite imagery data I use,"" Parcak said. ""I can pick the exact months I need with the NASA satellite datasets."" Benefits of a bird's-eye view . Remote subsurface sensing has been used in archaeology in one form or another for years, though the term ""remote"" doesn't necessarily imply great distance. Typically, a surveyor has wheeled a sensing device over a marked-out area to determine what lies below. The sensing devices employ any of an array of technologies, such as Ground Penetrating Radar. They bounce signals off objects below the surface and translate the data into images that a scientist's trained eye can decipher. Multispectral imaging encompasses technologies that ""see"" what the human eye can't, such as infrared and ultraviolet radiation. Scientists have used it for years to study the Earth's surface for a variety of purposes. Until resolution of these images improved, though, the only way to produce a sharp image was to be relatively close to the ground. For those lugging unwieldy gear across jungle and desert, an effective bird's-eye view can change the world. It lets them leave behind the days and days of meticulous ""prospecting"" and get results from airplane-mounted sensors or, later on, a flyover by an advanced satellite. One of the most advanced is called QuickBird, which has been in orbit since 2001 and can provide high-resolution images of 11-mile-wide swaths. The satellite can collect nearly 29 million square miles of imagery data in a year, according to DigitalGlobe, which developed and operates QuickBird. The company, based in Longmont, Colorado, is working on an upgrade. WorldView-2, to be launched in 2009, will offer sharper resolution of visual and multispectral images than QuickBird, according to the company's Web site. In the end, though, a tool is only as useful as its wielder. ""Most of the advances have come through processing on the ground by end users such as Dr. Parcak,"" said DigitalGlobe spokesman Chuck Herring.","Sharper resolutions allowing scientists to use satellites to locate ruins sites .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's high court is indefinitely suspending all its sessions, after supporters of President Mohamed Morsy surrounded the building and blocked judges from entering. Calling Sunday a ""dismal, black day"" in the history of the country's judiciary, the court said in a statement that its judges will not return to work until they can do their jobs ""without any psychological or physical pressures."" ""The judges of the Supreme Constitutional Court have no choice but to declare to the great Egyptian people that they are unable to perform their sacred mission in light of the current charged situation,"" the statement said, according to the state-run MENA news agency. It was the latest salvo in a growing crisis that pits Morsy and his conservative Islamist allies against liberal, secular opponents, raising fears among observers that the political strife could translate to violence in the streets. Read more: Rallies in Cairo as Morsy sets date for constitution referendum . A protester who was injured in anti-Morsy demonstrations last week died of his wounds Sunday, Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Mohamed Sultan said. And at least one person died and 66 were injured Saturday in clashes at protests, both for and against the president, according to MENA. Sunday's protest by Morsy's supporters forced judges to postpone ruling on the legitimacy of the body drawing up the nation's constitution, and on a separate but related decision about whether to dissolve the Shura Council, Egypt's upper house of parliament. The scheduled court session was widely viewed as a challenge to Morsy, who set off a political maelstrom on November 22 when he declared his past and future decisions were immune from judicial oversight. Morsy said the powers are necessary and temporary until a new constitution is adopted. But that promise has done little to quiet the opposition, which says Morsy's actions are reminiscent of those taken by ousted President Hosni Mubarak. Anger at Morsy's move led to protesters reoccupying Tahrir Square, the scene of the Arab Spring uprising that saw Mubarak ousted in 2011. The anger only grew when the Islamist-dominated Constitutional Assembly pushed through a draft despite the objections of the secular opposition, including some members who walked out in protest. But Morsy and his political allies may have reason to be worried, given steps taken by the the military council that ruled Egypt after Mubarak's ouster. The council has previously dissolved parliament's lower house, which was populated with a number of Islamist lawmakers loyal to Morsy, because it said the elections were unconstitutional. When Morsy said he would call back the lower house, the high court upheld the dissolution. On Saturday, Morsy said a constitutional referendum will be held on December 15. Following the announcement, tens of thousands of protesters -- for and against Morsy -- took to the streets. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood and Morsy supporters spent Saturday night outside the court, which had indicated it would review the proposed constitution. Trucks brought food and blankets to crowds outside, said Sultan, the Health Ministry spokesman. Opinion: Why the Middle East is a mess . Protesters had surrounded the building by Sunday morning. They blocked entrances, ""with some of them on top of the walls while chanting slogans that denounce the judiciary and inciting people against the judges,"" the court said in its statement Sunday. It was unclear Sunday whether the high court judges would rule on the constitution. But beyond the court's chambers, opinions over the document were split. About 1,000 judges from around the country agreed Sunday that they would not supervise a national referendum on the constitution, members of the Egyptian Judges Club said. The club's unanimous decision means court officials who would normally sort out any irregularities in voting will abstain from the process in protest. But there were also signs of support for the measure. Following Morsy's announcement of the referendum, there was at least one indication that his move signaled progress: The Egyptian stock exchange rose by nearly 5 billion pounds ($8.2 million) -- 2.5% -- in 15 minutes following the news of a constitutional referendum. Essam El-Erian, a senior Morsy adviser, has insisted all viewpoints -- including the need to safeguard freedoms when it comes to things like gender and religion -- were taken into account in the drafting of the constitution. But critics are unconvinced. The constitution's articles include language dealing with individuals' civil rights, particularly how security forces and the justice system treat them. There is wording prohibiting arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring due process, a sensitive topic in Egypt. Mubarak and his supporters are blamed for jailing and harshly mistreating innocent people in the years before and especially during last year's uprising. While many of the articles sound democratic, the fine print indicates otherwise, some human rights advocates say. ""Moving a flawed and contradictory draft to a vote is not the right way to guarantee fundamental rights or to promote respect for the rule of law,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. The preamble includes language pertaining to women, saying they are equal to men, but it also accentuates their role as mothers. The United Nations' high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, has urged Morsy to reconsider the draft, saying a number of measures contained in it are incompatible with international human rights law. Opponents of Morsy said they were organizing another round of protests Tuesday against the president and his decree. The scheduled demonstrations are dubbed ""the final warning.""

"(CNN) -- In a development that should surprise absolutely no one, anti-NSA activists were quick Friday to say that President Barack Obama's efforts to limit the agency's spying activities didn't go far enough. Leading up to a speech in which he outlined reforms that include requiring court approval for analysts to dig into telephone data, Obama had promised to address privacy concerns while defending digital surveillance in the name of national security. Advocates who feel that the National Security Agency's techniques, some of which have been exposed by former contractor turned international fugitive Edward Snowden, represent a massive intrusion into citizen privacy responded quickly and often harshly. Some examples: . Alex Fowler and Chris Riley, policy experts at Mozilla (makers of Web browser Firefox) ""We'd hoped for, and the Internet deserves, more. Without a meaningful change of course, the Internet will continue on its path toward a world of balkanization and distrust, a grave departure from its origins of openness and opportunity."" Carl Messineo and Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, co-founders of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund . ""Rather than dismantling the NSA's unconstitutional mass surveillance programs, or even substantially restraining them, President Obama today has issued his endorsement of them. ... The speech today was 'historic' in the worst sense. It represents a historic failure by a president to rein in mass government illegality and violations of fundamental rights."" Electronic Frontier Foundation (via Twitter) ""Today, Obama took several steps toward reforming NSA surveillance, but there's a long way to go. Now it's up Congress & courts."" (The foundation gave Obama 3.5 points out of 12 on a scorecard it had created on its hopes for ""real NSA reform."" Anthony D. Romero, executive director, American Civil Liberties Union . ""The president's speech outlined several developments which we welcome. Increased transparency for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, improved checks and balances at the FISA court through the creation of a panel of advocates, and increased privacy protections for non-U.S. citizens abroad -- the first such assertion by a U.S. president -- are all necessary and welcome reforms. ""However, the president's decision not to end bulk collection and retention of all Americans' data remains highly troubling. The president outlined a process to study the issue further and appears open to alternatives. But the president should end -- not mend -- the government's collection and retention of all law-abiding Americans' data."" Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder . ""I think it's embarrassing for a head of state like that to go on for almost 45 minutes and say almost nothing. ... It's clear that the President would not be speaking today without the actions of Edward Snowden and whiste-blowers before him. ... Security whistleb-lowers have forced this debate. This president has been dragged, kicking and screaming, to today's address. He's been very reluctant to make any concrete reforms, and unfortunately, today we also see very few concrete reforms.""","Activists say Obama's NSA speech was not enough .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean trade official abducted this week in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, has been rescued and his kidnappers detained, authorities said Thursday. The incident has underscored the instability plaguing the oil-rich North African country. Han Seok-woo, the head of the Libya unit of the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, was handed over to the South Korean Embassy in Tripoli on Wednesday evening and is in good health, the South Korean foreign ministry said. Libyan security forces have arrested the four men who abducted Han, 39, and determined that they were members of ""an armed group,"" the ministry said without providing further details on their identity or the reason for the kidnapping. It expressed its gratitude to the Libyan government for its ""close cooperation"" in rescuing Han. After Han's kidnapping Sunday, the South Korean foreign ministry set up an emergency task force to deal with the abduction and dispatched a special envoy to Libya. It also issued a warning against traveling to Libya and asked the 551 South Korean nationals living in the North African country to leave. Libya's government and fragile state security forces are struggling to impose law and order in a country awash with weapons left over from the 2011 war that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Militias, former rebel fighters and militants have refused to lay down their arms and often resort to force to impose their demands on the weak central authorities. This month, gunmen shot dead Libya's deputy industry minister in the first assassination of a transitional government official since Gadhafi's ouster in October 2011. Journalist Soo Bin Park reported from Seoul and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

"(CNN) -- The ""fastest man in rugby"" is to remain in the sport after resisting overtures from a major National Football League (NFL) team to sign for British team Glasgow Warriors. Carlin Isles built his reputation playing for the U.S. in the HSBC Sevens World Series, where his searing pace helped him score 27 tries in 14 tournaments. The former track athlete caught the attention of NFL franchise the Detroit Lions, who signed Isles to a practice contract in December. But Isles has opted to commit his future to rugby, moving from sevens into the 15-a-side version of the sport with the Warriors -- who play in the Rabo Direct Pro 12 competition with teams from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Italy. ""I can't wait to fly over to Glasgow and join up with my new teammates,"" the 24-year-old, who only started playing sevens for the U.S. in 2012, told the Sevens World Series website . ""Everything has happened so quickly for me over the last couple of years and I'm just happy to be playing rugby and getting the opportunity to play at the highest level."" Isles hasn't ruled out representing the U.S. sevens team, known as ""The Eagles"", in future tournaments, but for now he is focused solely on playing for Glasgow. The Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend, a veteran of 82 Test matches with Scotland's rugby union team, is excited by the potential of Isles -- who clocked a time of 4.22 seconds for the 40-yard dash while training with the Lions. ""This is a major coup for the club and a very exciting prospect,"" said Townsend. ""Carlin is an exceptionally gifted athlete, who has picked up the game of rugby in a very short period of time and has had a huge impact on the sevens circuit over the last couple of years."" Isles' conversations with Townsend proved key to the American's decision in making the switch from sevens into the 15-a-side form of the sport. ""It's very exciting to be moving to the 15-a-side game,"" he added. ""It's a lot different to sevens but I want to work hard and do everything I can to succeed. ""I've been in contact with Gregor (Townsend) a few times and knowing he really wants me and sees something in me means a lot and was a big factor in deciding to join the club.""

"(CNN) -- A floating restaurant along the banks of the Ohio River in Covington, Kentucky, broke free from its moorings Thursday and drifted several hundred yards downriver, according to Assistant Fire Chief Chris Black. Jeff Ruby's Waterfront Restaurant -- which has sweeping views of downtown Cincinnati -- separated from the shoreline and floated downriver, striking the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge, which carries U.S. Routes 42 and 127, and spinning around in the process. ""The part that was facing Kentucky is now facing Cincinnati"" said the restaurant's owner, Jeff Ruby. The restaurant is currently being held in place by two tug boats and a barge, according to Ruby, preventing it from ramming into the aging Brent Spence Bridge. ""The tugs will keep it (in place) overnight and then we have two more (boats) coming in the morning."" Ruby says the plan is for them to gently guide the restaurant a few miles downriver to a secure dock in Hebron, Kentucky. Ruby told CNN that one of his employees was walking the 110-foot ramp that connects the floating restaurant to the dock when ""he heard cable popping and snapping."" Moments later, the dock end of the ramp plunged into the icy water. Ruby says the worker was able to scramble to safety, while another worker inside the restaurant was rescued about an hour later. This is not the first time that Jeff Ruby's Waterfront Restaurant has floated away. In fact, the restaurant has been closed since March 2011, when the same thing happened with 83 patrons inside, according to Black.","Jeff Ruby's Waterfront Restaurant broke from its moorings on the Ohio River .

"(CNN) -- A celebration of specialness, Joss Whedon's slick blockbuster ""The Avengers"" presents what may be the ultimate team: half a dozen Marvel Comics superheroes for the price of one. You don't need me to tell you it's the culmination of a five-year plan that began with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury taking Tony Stark aside at the end of the first ""Iron Man"" to tip him off as to the ""Avengers Initative."" There is a bigger picture, he told him -- and here it is: The be-all but not (they're hoping) the end-all of the current craze for CGI-enhanced superheroics. Interspersing flip one-liners with a host of larger-than-life characters and the usual flurry of fight-and-flight scenes, the film is never less than amusing. Still, it's never more than amusing either. Marvel Studios has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the DC / Warner Bros Batman films. The lightness is fun but it doesn't offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic. And let's face it, there's more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted World War II hero, Captain America (Chris Evans), an inventor-industrialist, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the pagan lightning god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a scientist with anger-management issues, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) against the Norse god of mischief, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a legion of marauding aliens. In 3-D. Still, Whedon (who shares a screenplay credit with Zak Penn) is a very sharp operator. He knows which buttons to press and where there's room for a little diversion. The improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movie's most rewarding asset. Imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room! The movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand-offs. Not surprisingly, Robert Downey Jr.'s flip, cynical Stark (Iron Man) gets a good measure of the movie's best lines, bouncing off Steve Rogers' (Captain America) boy scout idealism and Thor's guileless sledgehammer style (sometimes literally). Whedon also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in ""Iron Man 2."" But no question, the movie's not-so-secret weapon is Hulk. Share your review of ""The Avengers"" Mark Ruffalo is the third actor to play Bruce Banner/Hulk in the past decade, and even though the soft-spoken star would seem to have the longest fuse (when we first see him he's tending to the sick in an Indian slum) he's immediately both more dangerous and more fun than either Edward Norton or Eric Bana in the same role. Whedon gives him a long build up. For the first hour of the movie we're invited to speculate along with his new allies just how much havoc Banner's rampaging id might cause. Then the leash comes off! Never underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash. That's probably the most important lesson to be drawn here, and one that clearly hasn't been lost on the filmmakers, who have reportedly signed Ruffalo to a six-picture deal. Beyond that, the movie wants us to believe that these action figures have learned to play nice and work as a team -- which is good news for humanity, but maybe not so promising for the inevitable sequels. A climax on the war-torn streets of Manhattan could almost be an extended outtake from the last ""Transformers"" flick -- Whedon can only push the blockbuster form so far -- but if it's a Friday Night SmackDown you're after, ""Avengers"" gets the job done.","""The Avengers"" -- interspersing flip one-liners with a host of larger-than-life characters .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli media went into one of its periodic feeding frenzies this week over reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's oldest son Yair has a non-Jewish girlfriend. Gentile media around the world gleefully reported the faux hand-wringing in Israel. In a world in which hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Jews are in some level of ""romantic involvement,"" with non-Jews, Yair Netanyahu's love life is, by any rational standard, a non-story. In America today, more than four out of five marriages involving non-Orthodox Jews are intermarriages, according to a survey by Pew Research Center. So why would anyone profess to be distressed by Yair Netanyahu's alleged romantic interests? (The PM's bureau, incidentally, issued a statement that Yair and the Norwegian woman identified as his girlfriend are nothing more than study partners at the Herziliya Interdisciplinary Center.) The Jews are a small and ancient people. Their continued existence, despite the rise of those determined to destroy them in every generation, is history's most prolonged miracle. Even today, Israel is the only country in the developed world not on the path of demographic suicide, in which elderly retirees will nearly equal younger workers in the foreseeable future. For believing Jews, Jewish survival reflects God's choice of the Jewish people to be the primary vehicle through which He reveals himself to the world. Jews have held fast to that relationship for more than three millennia. Across the globe and in every historical period, great scholars and simple peasants have willingly given their lives rather than give up their relationship with God. When a Jewish male marries a non-Jew, that unbroken, millennial chain of ancestors is severed for good. His children are not considered Jewish in Jewish law. And if a Jewish woman marries a non-Jewish man, it is virtually guaranteed statistically that her offspring will cease to be Jewish within one or two generations. In America, three-quarters of children of intermarriage marry Gentiles. In America, three-quarters of children of intermarriage marry Gentiles. Only 14% of intermarried homes describe their religious orientation has primarily Jewish, according to the sociologist Bruce Phillips during the mid-1990s, and 60% of those have Christmas trees. Bluntly, the non-Orthodox segments of the Jewish people outside of Israel will cease to exist in one or two generations through intermarriage. The end of so many family lines extending back to antiquity provokes sadness. Yet intermarriage is the consequence rather than the cause of a more fundamental change. Most modern Jews have lost connection with the distinctive beliefs and practices that have always characterized the Jewish people, in particular the belief that the Jewish people were chosen for a unique historical mission. Without the belief in a particular purpose for the Jewish people, it makes perfect sense to look for marriage partners from among those with shared political views or tastes in movies. The real tragedy is that ""Jewish"" constitutes such a small part of the self-identity of most Jews today. What Orthodox Jews mourn when their assimilated brethren intermarry is the finality of a step that cuts off them and their offspring of from the possibility of rediscovering what it means to be a Jew. Size is not a Jewish standard of measure. The Bible itself promises that we will be the smallest of the nations. But the loss of any Jew is nevertheless a tragedy. For at Sinai, the Jewish people were not only given a collective mission. Each soul that stood there or would descend from those who stood at Sinai was created with the potential to reveal, within the framework of the Torah's commandments, some aspect of God by virtue of his or her unique combination of talents and challenges to be overcome and particular familial and historical situation. The loss of that potential is a diminution of the entire Jewish people. Many non-Jews, and increasingly many Jews as well, find Judaism's stress on endogamy to be racist. That's nonsense. Membership in the Jewish people is open to any human being who is willing to take on the same commitment as those who stood at Sinai. Judaism does not sanctify gene pools but rather commitment to a mission. One need not be Jewish to serve God. Judaism is unique among major monotheistic religions in not viewing eternal reward as contingent on becoming Jewish. Yet Jews have always believed that they were chosen for a unique mission. For those in whom that sense of historical mission still burns the case for endogamy is a matter not just of Jewish law but logic. A sense of mission -- especially one that has always entailed a high price, along with its rewards -- can only be transmitted consistently from generation to generation by two parents who share a common vision. The decision to marry only another Jew is one to make shared spiritual goals paramount in one's marriage. Don't all religions advocate the same, according to their specific beliefs?

"(CNN) -- Midway through this month's Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, there was a bright and glorious full moon that lit the night sky high above the Earth. Down below, men and women from around the world competed for medals on behalf of their countries. As usual, special attention was paid to the contests between American and Russian athletes. On Sunday the closing ceremonies in Sochi will lower the curtain on the Winter Games. The ceremonies, as is tradition, are expected to center on two themes: competition, and the common ground that exists between different nations. The view of that full moon during the Olympics, though -- so far away from the sights and sounds of the athletic contests -- brought to mind an era, not so very long ago, when competition between the United States and what was then called the Soviet Union was a much more serious game than anything played out on ice rinks or ski slopes. There were two quotes that galvanized the world back then, two quotes that set the urgent game in motion. The first was from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. He spoke the words in 1958, directed at Western nations and their capitalistic way of life. Translated from the Russian language, the words appeared in banner headlines in big cities and small towns across the United States: . ""We will bury you."" In an America already on edge during the stare-down atmosphere of the Cold War, it is difficult to imagine Khrushchev's warning being any more unequivocal than that. The second quote was from President John F. Kennedy, delivered in 1962 at Rice University. Even now, the concise confidence of his pledge, the contrast in tone from what Khrushchev had said, is stunning: . ""We choose to go to the moon."" Just like that. That impossible thing -- that thing no one had ever done, that thing that all but defied dreams. And, in case anyone missed the extent of his determination, Kennedy explained why the United States was going to attempt such feats: ""not because they are easy, but because they are hard ... because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win."" Talk about high stakes. The United States had been woefully behind the Soviets in the space race. Now the president was promising to go to the moon, not just someday, but ""in this decade."" It still seems almost beyond belief, except that it happened. The race into space that followed those two famous declarations -- ""We will bury you"" and ""We choose to go to the moon"" -- mesmerized the nation in ways difficult to describe for those who were not born in those years. There was one day in particular, early in the effort, when the United States was still trying to catch up with the Soviets and put a man into Earth's orbit. It was in 1962 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Walter Cronkite, reporting for the CBS television network, was doing his best to be dispassionate and objective as the giant Atlas rocket, with an American inside the tiny capsule atop it, thundered fearsomely into the skies. ""Flight seems to be on target so far,"" Cronkite said. ""Looks like a good flight."" And then the emotion of it all, the importance of the contest at hand, overtook him. If it is possible for a baritone voice to keen, that's what it sounded like: so unexpected and so right, a proud and almost prayerful keening as the rocket lifted: . ""Oh, go, baby!"" Then, not long after, a disembodied voice from beyond where anyone could see, the voice of the man alone in the capsule, John Glenn, telling a waiting world that he was in orbit and had achieved weightlessness, that he was free of the Earth's gravity. The sound of that faraway voice on that day, the flat Midwestern cadence, no more tense or jittery than if he were back in his hometown of New Concord, Ohio, ordering a cheeseburger and a milkshake at the corner hangout: . ""Zero G, and I feel fine."" The United States would win the contest; Kennedy was dead before the end of that decade, but, just as he had vowed, Americans walked on the moon by the time the 1970s commenced. There have been only 12 people in the history of humankind who have stepped onto the moon. All were Americans. The Soviets never made it. Was it worth the effort? Have the fruits of the victory meant much, in the long run? Those are questions for each American to decide for himself or herself. This month athletes from the United States and Russia have engaged in spirited and friendly competition at the Sochi Games. No one was threatening to bury the losers of the contests. It is Khrushchev himself who is now buried; he has been gone since 1971. Today, in space, Russian cosmonauts and American astronauts circle the Earth in harmony together, traveling aboard the International Space Station. A different world in which we all live. The old race -- the race to conquer space, that deadly earnest competition -- is consigned to history. On Sunday, two weeks of beautiful and immeasurably less momentous games will come to a close at a stadium in Russia. And above those games this month, there was that moon. A reminder of a time when, in ways sometimes difficult to recall, anything at all seemed somehow possible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says Olympics thankfully didn't echo 1960s competition between superpowers .

"(CNN) -- Ding, ding. Passengers lean back as a Hong Kong tram -- affectionately called ""Ding Ding"" by locals -- signals its slow approach to the station. One by one, riders board through the doors at the back and struggle to pass through the narrow turnstiles. Jammed bags are a common sight. The tram slowly rolls back into action, cruising through the middle of traffic in some of Hong Kong's busiest neighborhoods, just as it has for 110 years. ""The tram is such an icon of Hong Kong because it's closely associated with the big events that have happened here over the last century,"" says Emmanuel Vivant, director and general manager of Hong Kong Tramways. ""The tram has continued its service and accompanied the city through times good or bad. Thus it's very intimately connected to its people."" Often lacking an on board passenger information system or uniformed station staff, Hong Kong's trams can be intimidating for rail virgins. But they're worth figuring out. Namely because they're a fantastic way to get to know the city. ""Trams run along some of the best parts of Hong Kong,"" says Vivant. ""It's in the middle of the road with a vantage point [if you sit on the upper deck of the tram]. They travel at a relatively low speed, so you have time to take the views in. ""Inside the tram, you enjoy a special atmosphere, even poetic. ""A lot of cities in the world had replaced their tram networks with cars and buses by the 1950s before realizing the importance of the tram in the 1970s. They then rebuilt the tram networks, but it's different. So Hong Kong is very, very lucky to have the (older) tram in this sense."" How to ride the tram . Hong Kong's tram stations usually sit in an ""island"" in the middle of the street, though a few are on the side of the road. Stops are marked by stand-alone green signs. The tram line runs 30 kilometers on Hong Kong Island, stretching from Kennedy Town on the western end of the line to Shau Kei Wan on the eastern end. It runs in only two directions -- eastbound and westbound -- but some routes go further than others. It's really quite simple. First, decide which direction you're heading. Then, look for the tram that goes to or beyond your station. There is a map at the stops. For example, if you're in Central and want to go to Causeway Bay, all eastbound trams -- those going to North Point, Shau Kei Wan and Causeway Bay -- stop at Causeway Bay station, with the exception of the one going to Happy Valley. MORE; Sexy, sophisticated, skintight -- China's iconic cheongsam . Boarding is through the rear door -- passengers don't pay until they exit through the front. The fare is HK$2.30 (about 30 U.S. cents per ride), regardless of the length of the journey. Fares can be paid with cash or by swiping one of Hong Kong's all-purpose Octopus cards inside the tram. For comparison's sake, it costs more than 50 U.S. cents for a one-stop ride on the more commonly used MTR. QR codes are posted at most stations, allowing passengers to find out the time of the next three arriving trams. The longest possible tram ride takes around 90 minutes. Here are a few tram highlights. Chun Yeung Street, North Point . ""My favorite section is the loop at the terminal in North Point,"" says Vivant. This route, which actually terminates at North Point, is the only section of a tram route that runs through the middle of a wet market. ""The wet market on Chun Yeung Street used to be less organized and vendors would have their stalls set up in the middle of the tramway,"" says Eric Lee Tsun-lung, founder of tram fan club Hong Kong Trams Enthusiast and the mini-tram cultural museum, Hong Kong Trams Station. ""When I was young, the tram came and honked 'ding, ding' and the vendors moved to the sides with their stuff before resuming their original position as the tram left,"" says Lee. Nowadays, vendors don't set up in the middle of the tracks. Stalls can be found on both sides of the street though, meaning shoppers can often be seen zipping from one side the other, dodging trams in the process. Des Voeux Road West, Sheung Wan . On the western side of Hong Kong Island, Des Voeux Road West is packed with dried seafood shops, giving it the nickname ""Dried Seafood Street."" ""If you go to the Dried Seafood Street in the late morning or early afternoon, you can see something very interesting -- shop owners laying large sieves of dried scallops and salted fishes on the side of the road for sun drying,"" says Lee. ""Some even manage to steal a spot on the roof of the tram station."" In addition to Des Voeux Road West and Chun Yeung Street in the east, Vivant says it's worth taking time to ride the whole route. ""There's the historical area in Sheung Wan, the business center in Central, the commercial center in Causeway Bay and the less eye-catching parts of the east of Hong Kong Island,"" he says. ""It gives you a good idea of all different sides of Hong Kong."" The gallery above has more tram route suggestions. Tram 120, the oldest running tram . Vivant says Hong Kong Tramways is looking at dedicating a special car for tourists. In the meantime, there are now 163 trams in operation, each with a different number on the front. Choosing which one to ride requires special knowledge -- not because of where it goes, but because of its history. ""My favorite is model 120, the only tram built in the 1950s that survives till now,"" says Lee. Most of its features are well preserved, including its woven bamboo benches on the upper deck. ""There is only one worker left in the company who knows how to weave these benches,"" says Vivant. ""There are also two 'party trams' for hire privately, models 28 and 128. Car 128 is our second oldest tram."" Millennium Trams are cars built in 2000 -- models 169 and 170. ""The former management company launched three at that time, hoping it would be the future of Hong Kong trams,"" says Lee. ""But (the cars) were heavily criticized by the public as they look too new, too much like a bus. So they scraped the idea."" Future of the tram . There are about 30 tram cars built after 2010 now in operation, known as seventh generation trams. ""Most of the public hopes that the tram remains how it is, whereas frequent travelers want it to be more comfortable and modern,"" says Vivant. ""To answer this contradiction, the exterior of the tram shares the same shape as the old tram but it's almost 100 percent new inside. Apart from the wheels or controllers that we reuse sometimes. These are over 80 years old."" Tram cars are now made of aluminum instead of wood, so they're more durable. New trams have passenger information systems, more handles and new engines. ""Without government subsidies, we have to stay competitive and offer 21st-century service to our passengers,"" says Vivant. ""It's not commonly known, but we are now 100 percent made in Hong Kong with 150 workers in production and maintenance. We are hoping to use our skills to help other cities rebuild their tram networks."" A four-day tram pass can be purchased on Hong Kong Tramways' website for HK$37 ($4.80); private hire from HK$880 per hour ($113).

"(CNN) -- It's looking like the digital divide may have less gray hair than it used to -- but it's still a big issue for U.S. seniors. According to new research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, for the first time more than half (53%) of Americans age 65 or older now use the Internet or e-mail. Also, most Internet-using seniors have made a daily habit of going online; Pew noted that 70% of them access the Internet on a typical day. E-mail is especially popular with Internet-using seniors. Nearly half of them use e-mail on a typical day. But social networking sites, which are accessed via the Web or apps, are far less popular: Just 34% of seniors use these at all, and only 18% on a typical day. Looked at differently, those numbers mean that nearly two-thirds of seniors still either don't go online at all or don't do so on most days. Seniors also are especially lagging in their adoption of Internet-enabled mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. While cell phone ownership overall has risen sharply among seniors (69% now have a cell phone, up from 57% a year ago), Pew notes that just 10% of U.S. seniors own a smartphone. Also, only 11% own an e-reader, and 8% own a tablet. Only 39% of seniors have broadband at home. This means a substantial number of seniors access the Internet only from shared or public computers (such as at libraries, Internet cafes or senior centers), or by bringing a laptop to a location with open Wi-Fi. Just under one-third of U.S. seniors own a laptop computer, Pew found. Meanwhile, the Internet has become a key tool for accessing news, information and services that affect or can benefit seniors' lives daily. And mobile access to online information and services could be particularly helpful to seniors. For example, transit is a crucial concern for many seniors -- especially those on a limited income, or who have visual or mobility impairments. Obtaining and interpreting current printed schedules and route maps for buses and trains can be a challenge even for young, able-bodied people with good vision. But when seniors have to get to a location that's off their regular transit routes, they can face enormous challenges in simply figuring out whether they can get to that destination via transit. I live in Oakland, California, which has pretty good transit access compared to many cities and towns. Earlier this year I overheard one of my neighbors (a senior who doesn't drive) complaining that she might have to change doctors because her physician of 20 years moved to a new office in a part of town she rarely visits. What caught my attention was when she said, ""I don't even know what buses go there -- and have you tried to read that AC Transit map? What a mess!"" I pulled out my Android phone, brought up Google maps, and asked her where the doctor's new office was. She gave me the address. In less than a minute I found two potential bus routes to that location -- both involving transfers. I wrote down the route and stop information for her, and later she called AC Transit to have the relevant schedules mailed to her. When the printed schedules arrived, she mentioned it was a struggle for her to read the tiny, complex tables well enough to determine when the transfers might be easiest, so she could figure the best times of day to schedule her appointments. Looking at those schedules, I found I had the same problem. But again, with poking around a bit on Google Maps on my phone, I was quickly able to give her some good options for appointment times. She said, ""You can do all that on your phone? So if you want to visit a friend or see a show you can find out which bus to take, just like that? I had no idea!"" From there stemmed a conversation in which she revealed how over the years she'd limited her outings mainly to places along the transit routes she already knew well, or where a friend could give her a ride. Having a smartphone or tablet could help her find more transit options, but she's not going to get one. She might be able to afford one, but she doesn't think she could learn how to use it. ""It's just too different,"" she said. Seniors' low adoption rates for e-readers and tablets also curtail their access to news, books and services. These devices are ideal for people with visual impairments; any e-book or website can be viewed with large print. Also, they're light, easy to carry, generally easier to learn than a smartphone or computer and don't require much typing -- considerable benefits to people with arthritic hands or joints. For instance, my parents are seniors who live in the greater Philadelphia area. Both lifelong news junkies, they subscribe to several print newspapers. Avidly following national and local news is a key part of how they remain engaged and active. But for several years the company that publishes the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News has been in dire financial straits -- including being sold this year for what Forbes called a ""fire-sale price."" It's possible these venerable papers might cut back to publishing in print just a few days a week (as the New Orleans Times-Picayune recently decided to do), or go online only (as the Seattle Post-Intelligencer has done), or fold entirely (as Denver's Rocky Mountain News did in 2009). My parents are very concerned that they might lose their Philly newspapers, which they consider a lifeline. I've been trying to get them interested in tablets -- but so far to no avail. If print papers disappear, they and many seniors like them will be bereft and disadvantaged. Broadcast news is fine, but it doesn't match the depth and range of what they've been getting from newspapers. Last year Dr. Jeff Cole, director of the Center for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California, told AARP that ""lack of access is no longer the primary reason that older adults aren't online. Today, lack of participation is likely more related to other reasons, like fear of learning, how difficult computers are to use (still!), and just general lack of interest."" Yet mobile devices seem to be marketed primarily toward people who are younger or, at most, middle aged. Pew's research is encouraging, but there's still a long way to go in helping seniors bridge the digital divide. Until this happens, seniors will grow increasingly disadvantaged in an increasingly digital -- and mobile -- society. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Pew: More than half of U.S. seniors now use the Internet .

"(CNN) -- A Washington watchdog group is calling for the University of North Carolina to investigate whether administrators broke state law when a whistleblowing employee's credibility was repeatedly and publicly attacked following a CNN investigation into the reading levels of student-athletes. The Government Accountability Project (GAP), a 37-year-old group that says it leads the nation in whistleblower protection, urged the inquiry in a letter to UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Carol Folt on March 6, which the project made public Friday. The group expresses alarm about university officials' treatment of instructor and tutor Mary Willingham, who alleges the Chapel Hill campus has enrolled student-athletes with reading levels near the lowest elementary grades. In response to GAP's letter, university spokeswoman Karen Moon and Vice Chancellor for Communications Joel Curran told CNN in an e-mail that the university insists it is committed to accountability and will be as transparent as possible in the controversy. About the group's demand for an investigation, the two school officials cited how the university has already hired a Washington attorney to conduct an independent inquiry of ""academic irregularities"" that relate to another controversy involving student-athletes. That attorney, Kenneth L. Wainstein, who had worked at the U.S. Justice Department for 19 years, may or may not look into alleged violations of the whistleblower law involving Willingham, according to the officials. ""How he proceeds, to whom he talks and what questions he asks will be up to him,"" they said. ""The University will cooperate fully with Mr. Wainstein and ensure that he has the full access he needs to complete his work."" Wainstein couldn't be immediately reached for comment Saturday. Group has harsh language for comments . In their letter, the government watchdogs allege at least three instances since January in which it says UNC officials responded poorly to Willingham's claims that she tutored and researched athletes in revenue-generating sports who were reading at levels as low as third grade. The group noted that after Willingham spoke to CNN, UNC immediately challenged her, saying in a press release ""we don't believe that claim."" But GAP President Louis Clark said the comments of UNC Provost James Dean in the ensuing days were particularly offensive. In January, at a public faculty meeting, Dean verbally attacked Willingham's credibility and called her research ""unworthy of this university,"" according to Clark's letter. Dean also mischaracterized her research as being critical of all athletes when she had been very clear that it dealt with a sample of about 180 athletes, Clark said. Several days later, Dean flew to New York for an in-person interview with the Bloomberg news outlet. Dean denounced Willingham's findings and called them ""a lie."" When the Bloomberg reporter asked Dean whether he stood by those comments, Dean said he misspoke. Dean has not since spoken publicly on the topic and declined through a representative a CNN request for comment. University spokeswoman Moon stated there ""has been no need for Provost Dean to offer any additional comments."" Clark, in GAP's press release, said that the reaction from Dean and other UNC officials was ""disgraceful, morally wrong and legally questionable."" He asked Chancellor Folt to investigate whether UNC's whistleblower policy -- which relies on state law because it's a state institution -- was violated. A chilling effect? GAP says the policy states that employees should be ""free of intimidation or harassment."" ""It is simply unacceptable for a person in a position of such authority to make disparaging comments about an employee who has raised legitimate and important concerns about the education of student-athletes,"" the letter states. ""The effect of these actions is that UNC-CH is perceived as a bully who is intent on publicly smearing a well-meaning employee rather than fairly addressing the substance of the concerns being raised,"" the letter says, referring to the main Chapel Hill campus. Clark also wrote that UNC's response and Dean's comments have a damaging and chilling effect on whistleblowers. That's something Willingham alleges she has already experienced. Willingham said that in hundreds of e-mails privately supporting her, very few people -- at a diverse set of academic institutions -- say they are willing to imperil their careers by publicly talking about the issue of athlete literacy, let alone voicing support for her work. Echoing that, many people who have talked to CNN since January have sought anonymity, noting the criticism of Willingham and the death threats that she received in the days after CNN's initial report. Among those is the psychologist who administered the tests that Willingham used to determine the reading levels of the athletes she studied. The psychologist stands behind Willingham, but asked CNN not to use her name because she feared for her personal safety. CNN hasn't published her name. School asserts her data is flawed . Meanwhile, the university continues its assertions that Willingham's research was flawed, despite her claims that she personally tutored almost every one of the athletes in her study. UNC is expected to release a second review of Willingham's data in the coming days. In a related matter, another university-sanctioned review of academic fraud is under way. Last month, Folt announced the university hired Wainstein, a business fraud attorney, to take another look at the so-called ""paper class scandal,"" where athletes allegedly were taking classes in which the only requirement was completing a single paper. Wainstein also served as homeland security adviser under President George W. Bush. Willingham, who has worked with athletes for several years, also helped expose the paper class scandal two years ago in the Raleigh News & Observer. Despite seven prior reviews, that scandal continues to nag the university as officials insist it was the doing of a single professor. Willingham says the existence of such classes was well-known, and athletes who couldn't read were steered toward them. The accused professor, Julius Nyang'oro, has been indicted on a fraud charge related to the scandal. He has pleaded not guilty. Earlier this month, District Attorney Jim Woodall of Orange and Chatham counties announced that the criminal probe is over, and no one else will be charged.","Government Accountability Project demands a probe in a letter to UNC-Chapel Hill .

"(CNN) -- Know who's one degree away from Kevin Bacon? Thanks to the new season of ""Robot Chicken,"" it's Seth Green. Green, known for playing characters that make a lasting impression on pop culture (like Oz from the TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" Scott Evil from the ""Austin Powers"" movies and Chris Griffin from the irreverent animated series ""Family Guy"") has found critical acclaim with ""Robot Chicken."" The stop-motion animated series he created with Matt Senreich won an Emmy last year for Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program and has earned Green multiple nominations for his voice work. Their ""Star Wars"" parody/tribute specials are endorsed by George Lucas. Green spoke with CNN about the upcoming season. The fifth season of ""Robot Chicken"" premieres on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim on Sunday, January 9. (Cartoon Network, like CNN is a Time Warner company.) CNN: You're pretty much cornering the market on stop-motion television. How hard is that? Seth Green: The show's tricky. We do 20 episodes in a year, basically. It's 11 months from the time we start doing our writing to the time we deliver our post [production]. This year was longer because we folded an hourlong ""Star Wars"" special into the middle of our production, so it will wind up being 15 months when it's all over. It's a long, long process. But we love stop-motion, and it's a really communicative medium. It looks just like film, and you see real shadows, and you see light and your brain registers something that's tactile that you've maybe interacted with. That helps you to believe that what's on film is actually happening, which makes it funnier. It's a medium that's rarely used for comedy, and I think that's a mistake. CNN: Are you debuting any new action figures or characters this season? Green: We got some Charlie Brown, some Harry Potter, some He-Man. Gobots, Matrix, Avatar, Buck Rogers, Transformers, RoboCop, it's a good one. Oh! The ""Back to the Future"" -- I don't want to tease this too hard because it's so late in the season, but we have a ""Back to the Future"" crossover with Jay-Z ... it's not the real Jay-Z. It's pretty cool, we got Christopher Lloyd to do it. I'm really excited about this season. We had Jon Hamm, Bryan Cranston, Kevin Bacon, Megan Fox, what a crazy year! CNN: Do you ever have any guest ""cluckers"" on the show? Green: In the closing credits? We've never re-recorded that since the first season, except for ""Star Wars,"" and it was all the same people. In our post department, when Chris McKay was editing the show before he was directing it, he came up with that song and got everybody together to cluck it, and we've just kept it. No one's ever asked for that! CNN: How awesome is it, knowing that George Lucas likes your work? How hard is it to control your fanboi around him? Green: It's crazy. It's crazy stuff. We're getting to work with him now on this new animated thing, and get to spend time with him actually writing stuff, and it is one of the more surreal experiences I've ever had. And you have to just tune all that out and really focus on the work you've got to do to make what you're working on good. And not be overwhelmed by the fact that you're actually getting to do it. You just have to dig down and say, ""All right, what are we trying to accomplish here, make this funny and good,"" and we can worry about the fact that we're, like, creating ""Star Wars"" together, later. [Lucasfilm has not yet formally announced the upcoming animated ""Star Wars"" comedy series project.] . CNN: Who's your dream ""Robot Chicken"" guest star? Maybe we can help get that out there. Green: We've been targeting Harrison Ford pretty hard for a while now, and whenever people ask us who we're trying to get, we always go after him. Just because eventually he's going to hear it and either think we're so obnoxious that he's going to tell us to f*** off or he's going to come do the show. CNN: What are your thoughts on the new Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie that's in the works (and does not involve creator Joss Whedon)? Green: I saw that Joss wrote that open letter. Let's be fair, all he really said was, ""Hey, this isn't even 10 years old."" Are we really at the place where we're remaking ""Two and a Half Men""? Is that really still on the air, and we're remaking it? And where is the need for that other than some kind of capitalizing on a trend. You know, there's no public outcry for a remake of Buffy, there's only the opportunity in pop culture where vampires are very popular. If Joss came out and said, ""I want to make a new Buffy movie,"" even if he said, ""I want to do it like the reboot of Spider-Man. I want to put Buffy back in high school and I want to tell a different story with this character,"" I think people would go with that. But the fact that people who are not connected to it and were not connected to the show or any of the mythology that was created going back to the movie -- which everyone kind of agreed wasn't a perfect version of its potential -- you know, I think that really confuses people. It confuses the audience. They're like, ""How am I supposed to feel about this?"" CNN: Will we see you work with Whedon again anytime soon? Green: I have told Joss, publicly and privately, that I will do anything for him. Everybody that worked on that show gave me some of the best material I've ever gotten to work with. I'm super grateful for that experience and that opportunity. CNN: Are you a nerd or a geek, and what's the difference between the two? Green: Typically, by definition, nerds are interested in things that are not mainstream and may be subculture -- but subculture with usually a mythical bend or mathematic bend or scientific bend. So nerds are typically interested in subculture things that have to do with science or wizards or superpowers. Whereas geeks, I guess, usually tend to be the extreme version of that, where they're less able to relate to actual, other human beings that aren't interested in the same thing. Like geeks tend to be so focused and consumed with their subculture interests that they are incapable of communicating or interacting with other people; i.e., leaving the house or making dates or having social engagements. Which am I? I've always been more of a nerd than a geek. ... You don't like that definition? Hold on, wait a sec, my partner disagrees. ... (Green's collaborator Matt Senreich furrows his brow at Green and speaks up.) Do you know the difference between a nerd and a geek? Matt Senreich: I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. Green: No, no, no, let's hear it, you might be an authority having dealt with ... (to CNN) This is Matt Senreich, who before I stole him away to make ""Robot Chicken"" was the editorial director for Wizard Publications, which in its day had five different banners that Matt was in charge of, including ""ToyFare"" and ""Wizard,"" which were the premiere genre magazines for both toys and comics. CNN: Matt, we love your nerd pedigree. Senreich: All right! I just disagree with that [nerd/geek] definition. We always said that geeks were more into the pop culture subculture, if you will, whereas a nerd was more book-smart. Green: So define that. So the geeks, you're saying, are into cosplay and D&D? Senreich: Geeks are into what is considered pop culture [as if it were] a science, in a sense, where they know all the little intricacies that nobody else would pay attention to. Whereas a nerd is more book-smart, and is the guy in math class who can answer a million different scientific equations. That was the definition we always used at Wizard. We always catered to the geeks, and the nerds would end up reading if they wanted but may not. Nerds are more high brow. Green: A slight difference of opinion here, a yin and a yang, if you will.","Kevin Bacon, Bryan Cranston, Megan Fox are guest stars on ""Robot Chicken"" this season .

"(CNN) -- Asia's emergence as a golfing power has received a boost with the announcement the continent's top golfers will face off against their European counterparts in a competition similar to the Ryder Cup. The EurAsia Cup will be held every two years, with the inaugural event taking place at Malaysia's Glenmarie Golf and Country Club in March 2014 . Two 10-man teams go head-to-head. Europe's team will be comprised of the tour four players from the European Tour's Race to Dubai standings, the leading four available players from the world rankings and two captain's picks. The four top players from the Asian Tour's Order of Merit, the four available leading Asian players from the world rankings and two captain's picks will make up the Asian team. Team captains will be announced at a later date. ""We are all excited by the prospect of this matchplay event between Europe and Asia,"" European Tour COO Keith Waters said in a statement. ""It will be a fantastic event showcasing world-class golf at the highest standard as matchplay competitions always bring out great excitement and drama for golf fans and television viewers,"" declared Asian Tour chairman Kyi Hla Han. The European Tour's statement went on to say the competition ""will be beamed live to more than 45 countries and 670 million homes."" The Ryder Cup is a biennial match played between Europe and the United States. The intercontinental rivalry is one of the oldest in sport. The competition dates back to 1927 and was most recently held at the Medinah Country Club in Illinois, with Europe retaining the trophy.","Europe and Asia's top golfers to compete in the EurAsia Cup .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Authorities have identified the Twitter user accused of posting violent threats against the Longacre Theater, New York Police Comissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday. Kelly said the user is not located in New York City, but police were preparing to interview the person. Kelly declined to offer details on the person's exact whereabouts, but did say reckless endangerment is one of the possible charges the alleged tweeter could face. Twitter initially had refused to disclose the user's personal information to police investigating the threats, but identified the individual after being served with a subpoena. ""We think in an instance like this, sort of common sense would dictate that we get that sort of information,"" Kelly said. ""Certainly this message referred to (the mass shooting in) Aurora. Referred to a specific location. This is the type of thing that a law enforcement agency needs to know."" Twitter has not responded to multiple CNN requests for comment. Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN Tuesday, ""We take the threat seriously, especially in light of recent attacks in Wisconsin and Colorado."" Authorities said the Twitter user posted a threat about an attack at the Longacre Theater in midtown Manhattan, where former boxing champion Mike Tyson, 46, is performing his one-man show, ""Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth,"" a Broadway production that centers on his well-publicized life. Additional information about the incident was not disclosed, but authorities have bolstered security at the theater and other public areas across New York after two deadly mass shootings in Colorado and Wisconsin. Authorities' quest this week for personal user information highlights a growing conundrum for companies in the Internet age, when privacy concerns are pitted against those of public safety.","Police say person is not in New York City but will be interviewed .

"New York (CNN) -- In his many blockbusters, actor Russell Crowe plays the man of the hour, swooping in to the rescue. But this weekend, he needed a little help of his own. The Coast Guard plucked the actor and his friend from the waters off New York's Long Island after the pair lost their way while kayaking. Coast Guard personnel were on a routine patrol in the area when they heard one of the two calling for help Saturday night, Petty Officer Anthony Kozak said.

""They were just lost in the area after nightfall,"" Kozak said. ""Wasn't really a rescue of sorts, more of an assist. Nobody called 911 or anything. The Coast Guard happened upon the situation."" No one was injured, and Crowe seemed like an experienced kayaker, Kozak said. The Oscar-winning actor thanked ""the boys from the U.S Coast Guard for guiding the way"" on his official Twitter feed. In another tweet, he made light of the experience: ""Not lost, we knew where exactly where we were ... we ran out of day."" Crowe won an Academy Award for best actor in ""Gladiator.""

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s words, written in April 1963 from a jail cell in Birmingham, Alabama, ring as true today as they did then: . ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."" This is a profound part of the testimony of black history in America. What King knew was that the fullest potential of our nation will never be achieved until all Americans have the ability to access the freedom, justice and equality that we so proudly proclaim. I am keenly aware that it was the courage of countless Americans confronting the bigotry, disadvantage and institutional biases of the past that blazed a trail allowing my family to thrive. My ancestors worked hard and sacrificed for their success, yet, but for the collective struggle of those dedicated to a more just and inclusive America, they would not have succeeded. Sen. Tim Scott: I have lived the power of the American Dream . This generation can never fully repay those who struggled to build a better America -- the names and faces at the center of Black History Month who changed the course of our collective American history. But we can honor them by paying it forward, by working to create tides that lift more boats. Because we remain a country falling short of its highest ideals. There is work to do. We can all do better, achieve more as a nation, if we dedicate ourselves to continuing to address our persistently painful inequality of opportunity and justice. For example, in health care and education we have made much progress, but racial disparities and cyclical poverty highlight our nation's unfinished business. And it's a reality that hurts all Americans. Black patients overall receive a lower quality of care than white patients. African-Americans are far more likely than white Americans to use hospitals or clinics as their primary source of care, and about 20% of African-Americans lack any consistent source of health care. Meanwhile, only 54% of African-Americans graduate from high school, compared with more than three quarters of white and Asian students. So what do we do to fix this? The Affordable Care Act is clearly an important step in providing affordable, quality health care for all Americans -- a step that prioritizes lifesaving preventive care. We need to make smarter investments in our schools, and that includes investing where it can make the most difference -- by providing every child with access to a high-quality pre-k program. Closing the classroom achievement gap also means acknowledging that education starts in the home. Providing for better health and better education is a powerful way to break the momentum of poverty, allowing people to reach their potential. And if we want to do more, we have to strengthen families. That, of course, means advancing initiatives such as paid family leave, so parents don't have to choose between taking care of a sick child or parent and keeping their job. It also means doing more to help first-time, at-risk moms through proven programs that provide them and their children with home nurse care. But we also must acknowledge that one of the most important determinants of social mobility and achievement is whether or not a child comes from a two-parent household. Clearly, we need to be doing more to support single parents, but there are also strategies to encourage parents to stay to together. Reforming America's broken criminal justice system is near the top of the list. As the former mayor of Newark, I witnessed countless families torn apart when one parent went to jail for a nonviolent drug offense. That incarceration kicked off a chain reaction of events that impacted not only the person incarcerated, but their entire family: divorce, long-term joblessness and poverty. Our failed criminal justice system has become our country's greatest civil rights and civil liberties challenge. The U.S. incarcerates a greater percentage of its population than any other nation in the world, and the corrections system costs taxpayers about $70 billion a year. And again, we see the black community suffering more than other groups: African-American offenders on average receive sentences 10% longer than white offenders for the same crimes, and they are 20% more likely to be sentenced to prison. More than 60% of the prison population is comprised of racial and ethnic minorities. We need to think creatively about how to fix problems, not just lock people up and look the other way, hoping for a different outcome. We need to think differently about why we punish, how we punish and for how long we punish. We need to think about how to keep families together, make communities safer and save taxpayer dollars. When faced with this array of problems, it is easy to despair. But I am filled with hope, and, particularly during Black History Month, draw inspiration from those who tackled and overcame the challenges of the past. Yes, challenges still exist, even as we celebrate how far we've come. The question now is, how will we meet them? The answer to that question will ultimately define this generation's legacy. Let's rise to this challenge. The future success of our nation depends upon us resolving to carry on the struggle that has brought us this far. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- It's a 1-0 victory to the U.S. In an age when major nations are doing battle for football's brightest talents, the American team has pulled off quite a coup. Julian Green is a dual U.S. and German citizen who has been playing for Bayern Munich in Germany since 2010. The 18-year-old winger's displays since making his debut for Bayern's second team in 2013 have been enough to convince U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann to offer Green the chance to represent the country of his birth. But the Tampa-born starlet has already represented Germany at youth level, meaning football's global governing body FIFA had to clear Green to play for Klinsmann's team. On Monday FIFA did just that, meaning there is nothing stopping Klinsmann from handing Green his international debut against Mexico on April 2 and subsequently taking him to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ""We are obviously thrilled,"" Klinsmann told U.S. soccer's official website. ""We appreciate FIFA's effort in getting his paperwork approved, and are excited to have him on board for the game against Mexico on April 2."" Blog: ""Your country needs YOU!"" But which country? Cases like Green's are becoming increasingly common. In February Spain handed a debut to striker Diego Costa. The Atletico Madrid star has dazzled observers this season, firing his club to the top of the Spanish first division with 23 goals in 27 games. Costa looks likely to spearhead Spain's defense of its World Cup crown later this year, an ironic twist given the tournament will take place in his homeland. Not only was Costa born in Lagarto, Brazil, he played for the country of his birth on two occasions in March 2013. But in September of that year the Spanish federation requested Costa be allowed to play for La Roja after he had been granted Spanish citizenship. FIFA obliged Spain's request, much to the chagrin of Brazil's football authorities. Manchester United youngster Adnan Januzaj is another player who could spark an international incident. The winger, who impressed upon breaking into the United first team earlier this season, was born in in Brussels, Belgium and is also eligible to play for Albania. The Football Association was thought to be exploring whether Januzaj would be eligible to play for England, while the Football Federation of Kosovo would also call upon the 19-year-old should it ever be permitted to play competitively. Like Green before him, it seems likely that Januzaj will have to pledge his allegiance sooner rather than later.","Julian Green cleared to play for U.S. against Mexico on April 2 .

"Paris (CNN) -- Seventy-five additional bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of an Air France plane that crashed off the coast of Brazil two years ago, more than doubling the number of remains that have been found, the vice-president of the French victims' association told CNN Tuesday. The remains have not yet been identified, Robert Soulas said. Air France 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 people aboard. The bulk of the wreckage was found this year after a search by robot submarines of an underwater mountain range. Many bodies were still in the fuselage, investigators said at the time. Only about 50 bodies were recovered in the days following the crash. Soulas got the news from a French government liaison appointed to deal with families of victims, he said. ""Personally, I would have preferred to leave the bodies of our loved ones on the seafloor,"" he added, repeating his long-held view. The Brazilian national news agency Agencia Brasil reported Tuesday that Nelson Faria Marinho, head of the Brazilian victims organization, said that with the latest recovery, the number of bodies found since the accident now totals 127. Details of the doomed plane's last minutes only began to emerge last week as French air accident investigators studied data recorders recovered from the wreck earlier this year. The Airbus A330 plummeted 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds amid conflicting information that may have led the pilots to make bad decisions, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said Friday. The pilots got conflicting air speed readings in the minutes leading up to the crash, according to an interim report. The aircraft climbed to 38,000 feet when ""the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled,"" the report says. Aviation experts are asking why the pilots responded to the stall by pulling the nose up instead of pushing it down to recover. Miles O'Brien, a pilot and aviation analyst, said: ""You push down on the wheel to gain air speed, perhaps they (pilots) were getting information that the air speed was too high. Pulling the nose up will exacerbate an aerodynamic stall."" The speeds displayed on the left primary flight display were ""inconsistent"" with those on the integrated standby instrument system (ISIS), the report says. The aircraft experienced some ""rolling"" before stalling and then descending rapidly at 10,912 feet (3,300 meters) per minute. At the time of the descent, the two co-pilots and captain were in the aircraft cockpit. All 228 people aboard the Airbus A330 Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris were killed on June 1, 2009. The pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence. Air crash investigators at the Paris-based BEA have been working on the theory that the speed sensors, known as pitot tubes or probes, malfunctioned because of ice at high altitude. CNN's Thair Shaikh contributed to this report.","The remains have not been identified, a French relative says .

"(CNN) -- At least 50 officers and civilians were feared dead after Bangladeshi paramilitary troops staged a mutiny, taking dozens of high-ranking officers and military brass hostage, the country's law minister said Thursday. Bangladeshi soldiers take position armed with automatic weapons in Dhaka on Wednesday. As dawn broke, the rebelling troops with the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) allowed government officials entry into the headquarters in the capital city of Dhaka -- the scene of a day-long standoff Wednesday. The troops agreed to lay down their arms after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina agreed to offer them amnesty. Ministers went door to door within the compound's officers' quarters to assure frightened women and children it was safe to come out. ""Nearly 50 people have been killed in sporadic fighting in the headquarters of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR),"" Mohammad Quamrul Islam, state minister for law and parliamentary affairs told reporters. In addition to military officials and BDR brass, the dead and wounded included passersby, including a rickshaw puller, struck by stray bullets during the gun battle, the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said. CNN was not immediately able to confirm the exact casualty count, with medical officials saying a final number will come after they had a chance to comb through the premises looking for bodies. At around 4:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. GMT) Thursday, Bangladeshi TV channels broadcast video of Home Minister Sahara Kahtun telling rebelling paramilitary officers in the room that she could assure them the government would listen to their grievances. As she spoke, officers deposited weapons and ammunition onto a table in front of her and into piles on the floor. The video was initially broadcast on state run TV station BTV. Various private networks picked it up soon after. The Rifles is a paramilitary force responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders. The force, more than 65,000-strong, also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week when officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. At least 5,000 -- maybe more -- BDR personnel were inside the compound in the Pilkhana area of the capital when the mutiny occurred about 7:45 a.m. local time Wednesday, said Mohammed Sajjad Haider, spokesman for the information ministry. Their mobile phones were turned off, making it difficult for the government to get a handle on the situation, he said. The rebelling troops were low-ranking members of the BDR, akin to infantrymen, who were angry at the way they were treated by their superiors, Haider said. ""They have several demands,"" Haider said. ""They want pay parity with the army, they want job security, they want better food rations."" The mutiny is the most serious crisis for Bangladesh's newly elected government, which came into power in December after two years of army-backed rule. Throughout the day and into the night, curious onlookers gathered outside the compound -- only to scramble for cover as sounds of gunfire periodically pierced the air. Plumes of black smoke coming from inside the compound could be seen for miles throughout the capital. Occasionally, the rebelling troops -- red bandannas covering their faces and guns slung over their shoulders -- walked past the closed gates of the compound, chanting, ""We have been deprived for a long time, we have deep grievances."" ""I've been hearing gunfire all morning,"" said Zunaid Kazi, a San Diego, California, resident who is staying at a house a few blocks from the headquarters.  Watch as Kazi describes what he saw and heard » . ""There will be a little lull and then the sustained gunfire will pick up again,"" he said. ""I can hear military helicopters in the sky. It's very rattling.""","NEW: Home minister shown assuring rebel officers their grievances would be heard .

"(CNN) -- Tech helped fuel Egypt's revolution. Now it could put the country get on the path toward a more stable democracy. At least that's the hope of Google, which is kicking off a program called Ebda2 -- Arabic for ""start"" -- to fund and otherwise support emerging technology companies in Egypt. ""We believe technology will actually change the economics of this part of the world -- will change the culture of this part of the world -- and it will have a political impact,"" said Wael Fakharany, Google's country manager in Egypt. ""We believe it is absolutely the right time to give people hopes and dreams -- not to be rich and famous, but hopes and dreams to be helpful."" On Monday, Google employees plan to start a tour of Egypt in a bus that's emblazoned with the Google logo. They'll be searching for would-be tech entrepreneurs who might be interested in entering a 7-month competition for tech start-ups. The winner, which will be announced in May, will get a $200,000 prize from Google. Other finalists will have a chance to pitch their ideas in front of Silicon Valley investors at an event in Cairo, Fakharany said. ""Google is looking for the next Google in the Middle East,"" said Maha Abouelenein, a Google spokeswoman. She added that Google was started by two entrepreneurs who got a check for $100,000 -- half the amount of the Egypt prize. This type of project -- where Google has invested in a start-up competition to support the tech industry of a particular country -- is a first for the Mountain View, California, company, she said. Google employees and Egyptian tech entrepreneurs will offer mentoring and advice to contestants along the way. Two independent organizations will administer the contest, in an effort to allow the start-ups to have a fair shot at the prize even if they build products using technology from Google's competitors -- like Microsoft or Facebook. Hussein El-Sheikh, managing partner at ProSeed Advisory, a consulting group based in Cairo, Egypt, said he thinks the Google program will benefit young people in the country who want to start tech-focused businesses. ""I believe that very soon Egypt will become the tech hub,"" he wrote in an e-mail. Much has been made of the role technology played in toppling the 30-year rule of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in a revolution that began on January 25. Some protestors used Facebook events and Twitter status updates to organize their movement in a country where public demonstrations and organizations were formally banned by the state. In the wake of that successful revolution, some people again are looking to the tech sector to bolster the country's transition to a more-open democracy and economy. Google believes it can support this transition. ""There is a negative sentiment, obviously, about Egypt (after the revolution),"" Fakharany said. ""We want to show people that in spite of the changes and the political turmoil that there is actually hope. There is light at the end of the tunnel."" But the company's plans to invest in Egypt's tech sector actually started in 2009, before the revolution, said Fakharany. At that time, Egypt paid Google $10 million for advertisements designed to better position the country online as a tourist destination, he said. As part of that deal, Google agreed to invest $2.5 million in Egypt's Internet infrastructure. The $200,000 contest for entrepreneurs is the first project that comes as part of that investment, Fakharany said.","A Google bus will travel Egypt looking for tech entrepreneurs .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich may have left it late to beat Mainz but will wrap up the Bundesliga title in super quick time next Tuesday should they defeat Hertha Berlin. The Bavarians were eight minutes away from dropping their first league points since the start of October on Saturday before two late goals ensured yet another win. Bastian Schweinsteiger's 82nd minute strike followed by Mario Gotze four minutes later sealed an 18th league win in a row and a 24th out of 26 this season to give Pep Guardiola's side 74 points -- 23 more than nearest rival Borussia Dortmund who have 51. All of which means that Bayern can make last season's title won with six games to spare look positively sluggish compared to this year's likely margin of seven. ""We've played very good opponents and we've won,"" Guardiola said of the victory over Mainz. ""We've extended our record to 18 wins on the trot. That's the result of a lot of hard work. I'm just pleased about winning today against one of the toughest teams we'll face this season. ""We only need one more win now. It's in our own hands..."" In the battle for second place, Borussia Dortmund retained a one point advantage over Schalke. Jurgen Klopp's side were 3-0 winners at Hannover while Schalke beat bottom side Braunschweig 3-1. In Saturday's remaining Bundesliga fixtures, Stuttgart won 1-0 against Hamburg while Monchengladbach rise to fifth after a 3-0 win over mid-table Hertha Berlin. Wolfsburg and Augsburg drew 1-1. Meanwhile in Spain, four games were played Saturday ahead of Real Madrid's clash against Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Sunday night. Granada moved up to 11th place with a 1-0 win over Elche while the match between Espanyol and Levante ended in a 0-0 draw. Valladolid and Rayo Vallecano also drew (1-1).

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray has won his first match after splitting with coach Ivan Lendl, beating Australia's Matthew Ebden in the second round of the Miami Masters in Florida. The Scot, who is defending the title he won 12 months ago, started life after Lendl nervously, losing the opening set before rallying in the second and third to eventually beat the world No. 67 3-6 6-0 6-1. Murray announced an amicable parting of ways with Lendl on Wednesday bringing the curtain down on a highly fruitful two-year partnership. Lendl, who is leaving to spend time on other projects, is credited with helping turn Murray into a grand slam champion, overseeing victories at the U.S. Open in 2012 and an historic win at Wimbledon last year. The 26-year-old paid tribute to his former coach after victory late on Friday. ""It was very different without him, it's been a hard few days,"" Murray told Sky Sports. ""He's been a big part of my career and to not have him around is going to be tough, but I just need to get on with it now and try to get back to playing my best tennis."" Next up in round three is Spain's Feliciano Lopez who Murray has never lost to in eight previous meetings. Earlier on Friday, Roger Federer came through comfortably against Ivo Karlovic 6-4 7-6 (7/4). The Swiss, who was defeated by Novak Djokovic in the final of BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells last weekend, continued his recent good run of form against the big-serving Croat. ""So, (his serve) can be quite difficult or overwhelming. But if you're in the right mindset mentally, it can also be enjoyable. That's how I approach the match, anyway,"" Federer said, ATPTour.com reported. Federer, a winner in Miami in 2005 and 2006, will face Thiemo de Bakker next after the Dutch qualifier ranked 162 in the world upset world No. 29 Fernando Verdasco in three sets 7-6 (7/4) 6-7 (3/7) 6-2. Djokovic is also safely through to the third round after beating France's Jeremy Chardy 6-4 6-3, as is David Ferrer who saw off Georgia's Teymuraz Gabashvili 6-4 6-0. In the women's draw, Venus Williams recorded a straight sets (6-3 6-3) win over Slovakia's Anna Schmiedlova to set up a meeting with Casey Dellacqua of Australia. Former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic suffered a shock defeat to Varvara Lepchenko of Uzbekistan -- the Serb losing in three sets 6-3 2-6 7-6 (7/2) -- but Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska is safely through to the next round after dispatching Switzerland's Romina Oprandi 6-0 6-4. China's Li Na will face America's Madison Keys in the third round.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You might want to go green, but how do you know what you're buying is truly ethical? Greenwash -- the ignoble art of misleading consumers about a product's true green worth -- is on the rise. But thanks to the work of increasingly vigilant regulators, some of the more curious and downright spurious claims are being weeded out. TerraChoice's ""six sins of greenwashing"" include vagueness, irrelevance and outright fibbing. TerraChoice, a Canadian environmental marketing agency, has devised a guide for consumers which they hope goes some way to eradicating greenwash. They've called it ""the six sins of greenwashing."" Scott McDougall, President and CEO of TerraChoice told CNN: ""The regulatory initiatives in Canada, the U.S., Australia and, I suspect, Europe are rather impenetrable bureaucratic documents, and are not very useful to the average consumer. So we developed it as a tool that would be memorable and useful to consumers."" The sins include ""Vagueness"" -- terms like 100 percent natural and earth-friendly which don't really mean anything, ""Hidden Trade Off"" -- is a product truly sustainable? And the ""Lesser of Two Evils"" -- trying to make consumers feel green about products that have dubious environmental benefit. Set up in 1995 as part of the Canadian Federal Government's program against greenwash, TerraChoice examines the entire life cycle of a product and the science of environmental claims with a view to awarding Canada's environmental certification mark, the EcoLogo. ""Our position is to help genuine environmental leadership win market share,"" McDougall said. TerraChoice is currently completing a 20-year study of green marketing claims. They have discovered that greenwash is more prevalent when public interest in environmental issues is greater, and that there's been a gradual increase in claims over time. ""It's a kind of a sawtooth curve,"" McDougall said. This rise appears to be a global phenomenon. The UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says that complaints about environmental claims ""increased dramatically"" in 2007 -- 561 compared with just 117 the previous year. Car manufacturer Lexus ran into trouble in the UK with its ""High Performance. Low Emissions. Zero Guilt"" advert. The ASA ruled that ""zero guilt"" implied ""little or no damage to the environment."" British Gas was also found to have misled the public by claiming in a television ad that its green energy was ""carbon zero."" The regulator agreed with complainants that the phrase implied that no carbon dioxide was produced. In their 2007 report the ASA concluded that; ""claims about carbon emissions and green tariffs were among those most likely to confuse consumers."" Australia is also clamping down on greenwash. In June 2008, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) demanded that tire manufacturer Goodyear compensate consumers after claiming that their Eagle LS2000 was eco-friendly and cut carbon emissions. The ACCC -- which is also taking Swedish car manufacturer Saab to court over inflated green claims -- has recorded a tenfold increase in complaints since October 2007. So does McDougall think businesses are starting to get the message about greenwash? ""Those sectors under particular scrutiny are educating themselves more quickly about what legitimate green marketing is,"" he said. ""In particular, cleaning formulations and cleaning chemistry. I think there is a great deal of movement towards greening generally."" But should products which are inherently bad for the environment be allowed to promote their improving green status? Well, Norway doesn't think so. In October 2007 they banned all green references in automobile advertising. In TerraChoice's ""six sins"" many motorized forms of transport would fall into the ""Lesser of Two Evils"" category. McDougall thinks that this is increasingly a problem area. ""It has been suggested to us that some of the claims about fuel efficiency and carbon issues are fundamentally deceiving,"" he said. Inevitably, some products are going to fail the criteria needed to achieve an EcoLogo -- McDougall once had to politely reject a bid wanting organic cigarettes certified -- but he says in most cases that TerraChoice has studied there was not a malicious attempt to mislead. With such a barrage of eco-messages slapped on products these days even McDougall concedes that ""the six sins of greenwashing"" might be too much for consumers to remember when out shopping. So, in a nutshell, what's his advice? ""The most essential guide I can offer consumers is; choose the product that appears to be doing its best to educate you, to offer you information and in precise language.""

"(CNN) -- ""J. Edgar"" is the latest in what seems to be a never-ending trend of treating a biopic as being compelling and interesting simply because the subject may be. The thing is, films don't work that way and while J. Edgar Hoover was indeed a fascinating man and important in our country's history, Clint Eastwood's film from a script by Dustin Lance Black (""Milk"") is dull from start to finish and often bears little resemblance to the truth. Let's be clear about one thing up front: J. Edgar Hoover was a bad guy. He was a power-obsessed, racist paranoid with little concern for the working people, immigrants or ethnic minorities that helped build this country. He was the perfect example of someone who believed that in order to protect the United States, he was entitled to shred the document on which the country was founded, the U.S. Constitution. How or more importantly, why, those virtually undisputed facts were twisted into the mockery of history that is Eastwood's ""J. Edgar"" is anyone's guess. It is, quite simply, a poorly conceived and constructed film. The through line, if you can call it that, is Hoover's narration of his so-called memoirs to a series of FBI agents tasked with taking his dictation, each segment of which leads us to a chapter in Hoover's life. His goal is clearly not to represent history -- since much of what he tells the agents is patently untrue -- and more to cement his own legacy as he sees it: A crusading champion of truth (yeah, right) justice (haw!) and the ""American Way."" The problem is, there are also scenes in the film that are not part of his memoirs and at times it's hard to tell the difference between the first person and third person. Considering the film's length, there's a good chance audiences will stop caring at some point. I know I did. CNN Photos: Historical images of J. Edgar Hoover . Blurred political history notwithstanding, ""J.Edgar"" is so boring as to give tedium a bad name. There's no beginning-middle-end -- and while that's not necessarily an issue in and of itself, something has to replace that traditional structure. Here it's an endless stream of flash-forwards and flashbacks of young Hoover, old Hoover, young Hoover again, not-so-young-as-young Hoover, middle-aged Hoover, gay Hoover, momma's boy Hoover, dictating Hoover. It's enough to make you dizzy. Leonardo DiCaprio is at less than his best as the rather unattractive G-Man and his accent is needless. Hoover was from Washington, D.C. and no one cares what he sounded like. Add that to his nervous tics, strange speech patterns and barely hidden stutter and it's hard to see the forest for the trees, as it were. Eastwood prides himself on bringing in films on time and under budget and perhaps that's why the old age makeup was so dreadful. Considering the advances in modern cinema makeup, I can't see any other reason. In portraying Hoover's long-time companion Clyde Tolson, Armie Hammer looks like a burn victim in his later years. The thing is, Hoover was an interesting character and his story could make (and maybe has made) for a compelling literary biography. A film, however, has to have some sort of dramatic structure or tension. The audience needs either someone to root for -- or in this case, against -- and Eastwood and Black don't give this to us. A perfect example of what could have been done is George Clooney's exceptional 2005 film ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" where Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov took the unvarnished villainy of Sen. Joseph McCarthy and crafted a compelling human drama around the bad guy. Granted, it wasn't billed as a biography of McCarthy, but perhaps that's the point. An argument can be made that living your life as a self-loathing closeted homosexual, a life which Hoover has been accused of living, can turn anyone into an unpleasant, unhappy, angry person and let's for a moment assume that the theories about Hoover's closeted homosexuality are true. Add to them what we know as fact about the man: Anti-communist, anti-labor, racist, momma's boy, socially awkward, former stutterer, paranoid, and power-hungry proponent of ""the ends justify the means."" There you have an incredibly complex man and while the movie touches on many of these aspects, they leave it at that. It's like offering someone a steak without mentioning the cut, accompaniments, quality of the meat, cooking method, etc. While Hoover is shown trying to blackmail everyone from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Martin Luther King and routinely circumventing the law, these are not portrayed as particularly bad things to do. Nor, it must be said, are they shown to be good things. Therein lies the film's major problem. It refuses to take any position on Hoover whatsoever, resulting in an overlong and uninteresting slog. The old saying that there are two sides to every story is simply not true. Hoover was not an ambiguous villain. Rather he could be viewed as a despicable man who ruined the lives of many good people and may have caused the deaths of many of his so-called enemies. He routinely broke the law and exceeded his mandate under the guise of protecting America. It's too bad that one of modern cinema's great master filmmakers couldn't do more with such a compelling character and important part of this country's history. Skip this and watch the aforementioned Clooney film again. ""J. Edgar"" is rated R. I assume this is for strong language, as there's nothing else in the film that would warrant the rating. The film opens in limited release today and wide release on Friday.","It is, quite simply, a poorly conceived and constructed film .

"(Wallpaper*) -- It may be tough to teach old dogs new tricks, but perhaps they can learn to live in new houses. Japanese graphic designer and curator Kenya Hara has made it his mission to find out. Debuting at Design Miami in early December, in collaboration with a star-studded cast of designers and architects from America, Europe and Japan, this online venture supplies free blueprints for 13 different DIY doghouses, each one earmarked for a particular breed. Hara hopes that pet enthusiasts everywhere will build them and that their photos will go viral and kickstart an online architectural discourse about the designs when the website launches this month. Hara has been mulling over the idea of designer doghouses for around 15 years, and the project finally caught the attention of American investors at Imprint Venture Lab. Hara knew the pet-related theme would be popular, he said, 'I have the impression that the whole world is interested in babies and dogs.' Building on the ""man's best friend"" bond, he started by matching designers to dogs, choosing only small breeds that like to live inside. Some are random pairings, such as the Dachshund with architects Atelier Bow-Wow and the Toy Poodle with product designer Konstantin Grcic, but others are special requests, like architect Toyo Ito who wanted to build for his own Shiba, and Kengo Kuma who was keen to make a new home for a client's Pug. Because conversation with their canine clients could be a bit one-sided, Hara provided each designer with a dossier of information covering the physical characteristics, temperament and health concerns of their breed. Human needs were considered in the brief, too, which stipulated that the doghouses should be easy for anyone to assemble with ordinary household tools and materials. More from Wallpaper*: Brasilia in pictures - 50 great buildings . Leading the pack, Hara launched the project by designing two doghouses of his own: a hard, paper cone suspended from the ceiling for a Japanese Terrier and a plywood contraption for a Teacup Poodle. Intended to improve contact between pooch and person, the poodle's structure consists of a 70cm-high, wedge-shaped wooden tunnel enclosing a puppy-sized run of stairs. They lead up to a platform at chair height where the dog can recline while gazing adoringly at their owner. ""Putting a dog on the table is not so good,"" says Hara. ""Yet the floor is a little too far away."" Located between these two extremes, Hara's proposal may have conceptual merit. But it took lots of Liver Snaps to coax a live Poodle up the stairs. This reaction is not much of a surprise since the actual dogs did not participate much during the design phase. And when they did, many were more challenging than human clients. Architect Sou Fujimoto's subject, a Boston Terrier rented at a Tokyo dog park, refused to even go inside the prototype. Scrapping that sphere-shaped model, Fujimoto devised an open-frame structure instead, reminiscent of his House NA. Most designers started by presenting a conceptual sketch to Hara and his staff who then investigated ways to realize the projects. ""Architects are very busy so we tried to provide ideas for materials and construction methods,"" explains Hara. Like a fast-paced game of fetch, ideas moved back and forth between the designers and team Hara. Sometimes it took four or five months to develop a realistic solution -- more time than required for many full-fledged buildings. And even then certain proposals, such as Toyo Ito's inflatable, vinyl roof worn on the dog's back, still proved unbuildable. Read related: Fun gifts to spoil your pet this Christmas . Others, however, like architect Kazuyo Sejima's home for a Bichon Frise, met with more success. The Pritzker-prize winner had little time to spare, but knew that she wanted to create something fluffy for her assistant's fuzzy white pup. Running with her idea, Hara's group began exploring soft materials and ways to support them. In due course, all agreed on a curved wooden frame enrobed by a hand-knitted cover. Though it bears little resemblance to the minimalist, glass buildings that have made Sejima famous, her doghouse got a warm reception from its canine resident who crawled inside and took an immediate liking to the soft, protective shell. The Tokyo architecture firm Torafu also sincerely considered the needs of its Jack Russell Terrier, creating an easy-to-build, simple structure that recycles old clothes. Resembling a hammock, it consists of a wooden frame that supports an old T-shirt, preferably one well worn by the dog's owner. ""The smell of the owner is very, very important for a dog,"" says Hara. '""t makes the dog feel safe and want to be here."" But a pooch's response is only one measure of success. ""Architecture for Dogs is not a pet's project,"" explains Hara. ""It is a project for architects."" For that reason, he engaged Yugo Nakamura, one of Japan's leading web designers, to create the interactive, trilingual website where participants can download drawings and view instructional videos, as well as upload photos of their newly built pet palaces, showcasing customizations and material substitutions. ""One idea can create lots of architecture around the world,"" says Hara. And potentially turn Architecture for Dogs into a catalyst for architectural invention.

"(CNN) -- Popular Japanese racer Kamui Kobayashi is back in Formula One with the Caterham team -- and fan power has helped him return to the grid. After losing his drive with the Sauber team at the end of 2012, Kobayashi turned to crowdfunding and asked fans to donate cash in an online campaign to help him pay for a seat in F1. The 27-year-old explained on the ""Support Kamui"" website that he was too late to find a drive ahead of the 2013 season but pledged: ""I will save all the money for 2014."" Patience has paid off as Kobayashi and Swedish rookie Marcus Eriksson have been named as Caterham's race drivers for the looming 2014 season. ""I want to give special thanks to all the fans who have made donations to Kamui Support,"" Kobayashi said. ""Their donations and gestures gave me extra strength to come back fighting and I am very pleased that the money they raised not only helped me but will now go to helping Caterham progress this year. ""Every single one of you who helped with Kamui Support will race with me in 2014 and that makes me very proud. ""It's a great feeling to be back as an F1 race driver."" Kobayashi made his F1 debut with the Toyota team in 2009 before joining the Sauber team, with whom he won his maiden podium in F1 at the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix. He quickly gained a cult status in F1 because of his attacking driving style on track and his quirky lifestyle off track. During his Sauber days Kobayashi, who is the son of a sushi chef from Amagasaki, claimed that he did not have a home but lived out of suitcase travelling the world. Caterham have chosen the ice cool Swede Ericsson to partner Kobayashi. The 23-year-old impressed with his performances in last season's GP2 Series, the official feeder championship for young drivers aspiring to race F1's global stage. ""This is a very proud day for me and everyone who has helped make my F1 dream come true,"" said Ericsson. ""It's obviously great for Sweden that we'll have a Swedish driver back on the grid in 2014. This is what I've been working for since I first started racing karts back when I was nine years old, and now I know I'm ready for the step up to F1. ""Caterham is a young team and together we can take on the challenges the new rules will present in 2014 - learning together and continuing to develop as the season progresses."" The 22 drivers on the grid must grapple with major changes in the 2014 season, which begins in Australia on 16 March. With a reconfigured engine and chassis to consider, as well as new fuel and weight limits, F1 teams will be working flat out to get their cars ready for testing which begins in Spain next week. McLaren will be the first team to launch its new-look 2014 car in an online presentation Friday with Ferrari set to follow on Saturday.","Kamui Kobayashi returns to Formula One with the Caterham team in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has raised fears he may be forced to miss the U.S. Masters at Augusta after withdrawing from the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods announced Tuesday that he will not play at the event because of a persistent back problem which has troubled him since last year. The 14-time major winner has struggled over the past month and failed to finish the Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens where he quit after 13 holes of his final round. Woods, 38, tweaked his back at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami a week later and is facing a race against time to be ready for the U.S. Masters, which starts on April 10. ""It's too early to know about the Masters, and I will continue to be evaluated and work closely with my doctors,"" said Woods, who has won at Augusta on four occasions. ""I feel badly that I won't be able to play in this great tournament this week."" Woods has won the Arnold Palmer invitational eight times, including the past two tournaments. In a statement on his website, Woods revealed he telephoned Palmer directly to tell him he would be unable to defend his title in Orlando. ""I personally called Arnold today to tell him that, sadly, I won't be able to play in his tournament this year,"" Woods said.

"(CNN) -- The rebellion by paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles troops apparently ended Thursday after they handed over their weapons inside their headquarters in the capital city's Pilkhana district, the national press agency quoted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as saying in a nationwide televised address. However, the fate of top military officers who were taken hostage Wednesday was unclear, according to the news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, or BSS, on its Web site. Home Minister Sahara Khatun ""oversaw a rescue campaign along with a government delegation in search of bodies of officers, BDR soldiers, their family members and relatives,"" the agency said. The Bangladesh Rifles is also known as the BDR. Bangladeshi soldiers take position armed with automatic weapons in Dhaka on Wednesday. Earlier Thursday, the country's home minister, Sahara Khatun, said mutinous paramilitary troops were close to laying down their arms and many had returned to their barracks. ""They have raised white flags and the situation is in its last stages,"" added a government official who did not want to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. ""The army presence is a means to secure the area and there is nothing to be worried about."" Still, for a jittery city, the heavy military presence near the gates of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) headquarters in the Pilkhana area raised fears of a potentially deadly confrontation. ""This cannot be good,"" said Palash Chowdhury, who was watching the drama unfold from his uncle's house a few blocks away. ""This cannot be good."" Meanwhile, police in about six other towns reported shooting incidents involving Rifles troops, another government official confirmed to CNN. The incidents do not appear to have resulted in casualties, but had raised fears that the mutiny would spread outside the capital. Bangladesh Police spokesman Kamrul Ahsan disputed the reports to CNN. But concerned residents were not so readily appeased. ""Yesterday, people thought this was an internal BDR grievance and it would be worked out,"" said Rashid Zaman, a Dhaka resident. ""Now, we see the scope is much broader, that it's getting serious. There's an uncertainty. No one knows which way things will turn.""  Watch a witness describe seeing and hearing the gunbattle » . Shops and offices in the capital sent workers home. Adding to the city's paranoia: Dhaka residents suddenly found themselves unable to make or receive calls from elsewhere in the country. ""Many people are finding this troubling,"" said Zahid Hussain, a former journalist who is now part of a U.S.-funded effort to create an investigative journalism center in the country. ""Whenever the army has gone into action in the past, they cut off the mobile connection so nobody can pass information."" The standoff at the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters began Wednesday morning after a gun battle. At least 50 officers and civilians were feared dead in the gunfire, the country's law minister said.  Watch how paramilitary revolt has spread » . As dawn broke Thursday, the rebelling troops with the Bangladesh Rifles allowed government officials entry into the headquarters. They went door-to-door at officers' quarters to assure frightened women and children it was safe to come out. CNN was not immediately able to confirm the exact casualty count, with medical officials saying a final number would come after they had a chance to comb through the premises looking for bodies. At least six bodies were recovered from rivers and drainage ditches Thursday, bringing the total to eight. Many of them had on military uniforms, government officials said. Authorities say the men had been killed and their bodies dumped in sewers. They were recovered after they floated for miles down rivers. The Bangladesh Rifles is responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders. The force, numbering more than 65,000, also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week, when officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. At least 5,000 BDR personnel were inside the compound when the mutiny occurred about 7:45 a.m. local time Wednesday, said Mohammed Sajjad Haider, spokesman for the information ministry. The rebelling troops were low-ranking members of the BDR, akin to infantrymen, who were angry at the way they were treated by their superiors, Haider said. ""They have several demands,"" Haider said. ""They want pay parity with the army, they want job security, they want better food rations."" The mutiny is the most serious crisis for Bangladesh's newly elected government, which came into power in December after two years of army-backed rule.

"Washington (CNN) -- A civilian guard at a new U.S. consulate in China pleaded guilty on Thursday to attempting to sell Chinese security officials photographs and access to the compound so they could plant listening devices. According to a court proffer, Bryan Underwood had lost a significant amount of money in the stock market and hoped to make between $3 million and $5 million by supplying classified photos and information to China's Ministry of State Security. Underwood, 32, appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to communicate national defense information to a foreign government. Under the terms of a plea agreement, the government agreed to drop charges that Underwood made false statements and that he failed to appear at a court hearing last year. In the court proffer signed by Underwood, he admitted writing a letter last year addressed to the Chinese Ministry of State Security. ""I know I have information and skills that would be beneficial to your offices (sic) goals,"" Underwood wrote. ""And I know your office can assist me in my financial endeavors."" Underwood tried to deliver the letter to China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) but a guard turned him away and would not accept the letter. According to court documents, Underwood then ""left the letter in the open in his apartment hoping that the MSS would find it. He believed the MSS routinely conducted searches of apartments occupied by Americans."" Prosecutors said that Underwood's job was to protect the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou -- not to make it vulnerable to Chinese counterintelligence. According to a news release quoting prosecutors, ""The U.S. government has found no evidence that Underwood succeeded in passing classified information concerning the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou to anyone at the Chinese MSS."" Officials said there is no evidence suggesting the Chinese ever tried to recruit him for espionage. In May of 2011 Underwood took 30 photographs in restricted areas. Prosecutors said 15 of those ""depict areas and/or information that are classified at the SECRET level."" He drew a diagram showing the locations of security cameras at the compound and created a schematic listing all security upgrades to the building site. The proffer also said Underwood ""mentally"" came up with a plan in which Chinese agents could get into the compound undetected for approximately six hours to ""install listening devices or other technical penetrations."" In addition to working as a guard at the consulate in February 2011 Underwood was asked by a U.S. law enforcement agent to help on a counter-surveillance project. Underwood was to tell the American agent about ""any suspected attempts by the Chinese Government to recruit him for intelligence purposes."" Underwood later came up with the idea to use his role helping law enforcement as a ""cover"" for contacting the Chinese. According to court documents, Underwood's stock brokerage account dropped from almost $69,000 in February 2011 to a negative sum of more than $89,000 in April 2011. His account was frozen and he ""became panicked about his financial situation,"" according to the court papers. Underwood was interviewed by law enforcement several times and finally admitted he was trying to sell information to the Chinese for financial gain. He was arrested September 1, 2011. Underwood failed to show up for a court appearance in Washington later in the month. The FBI caught up with him a few days later at a Los Angeles hotel, arrested him again and he's been in jail ever since. ""Bryan Underwood was determined to make millions by selling secret photos of restricted areas inside a U.S. Consulate in China,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen. ""His greed drove him to exploit his access to America's secrets to line his own pockets."" Underwood appeared in federal court wearing an orange jail jumpsuit. He answered questions asked by U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle in a calm, clear voice. When asked about any history of psychological problems, Underwood said he takes medication for anxiety and depression. Underwood is scheduled to be sentenced on November 19. The plea agreement recommends a sentence of at least 15 and a half years up to almost 20 years. Huvelle is not bound by the recommendation and could sentence Underwood to up to life in prison.

"(CNN) -- Even though he was ill, Adam Scott could do little wrong in the early rounds at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He led by seven shots at the halfway mark at Bay Hill in Orlando and, despite his advantage being cut entering the final round, still held a comfortable three-shot advantage as play began Sunday. Unfortunately for the Aussie, he faltered and thus missed a chance to overtake the injured Tiger Woods as the world No. 1. Matt Every of the U.S. was the unlikely winner, compiling a strong round to claim his first PGA title. Scott shot a four-over 76, hitting five bogeys, to slip to third, two shots behind Every's total of 275. It wasn't the tournament he wanted ahead of the defense of his Masters crown next month. ""I didn't putt well at all today,"" Scott told the Golf Channel. ""If nothing else it's a good reminder on how much putting practice I need to do before going to the Masters and just how important it is. ""If I think back to last year, I made every putt that you expect to in that last round and ultimately that's what gave me the chance to win."" Every, who trailed Scott by four shots overnight, made up ground thanks to five birdies. But two bogeys on the last three holes gave Keegan Bradley an opportunity to force a playoff. Bradley, however, missed a birdie putt at the 18th that would have forced the playoff. Every's drought was over. ""It's really cool,"" Every, who turned pro in 2006, told reporters. ""I have had a lot of looks (at wins) and I kept telling myself maybe it's going to come somewhere special. I still can't believe I won. ""It's hard, it's tough man.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court decided Tuesday to continue the stay of a judge's ruling that struck down Michigan's same-sex marriage ban, meaning that gay and lesbian couples cannot marry in the state while the appeals process unfolds. U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman issued an order Friday that invalidated a state constitutional amendment restricting marriage to between one man and one woman because, in his view, it violated the U.S. Constitution. His ruling set the stage for same-sex couples to marry immediately. And scores of them did Saturday until the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals -- after a request filed by Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette -- issued an order to temporarily stay, or put on hold, Friedman's decision through at least Wednesday. The same federal court decided to act even sooner than that with its decision Tuesday. It cited an apparently unanimous Supreme Court order from January regarding a similar case in Utah. Utah had asked the high court to intervene last week after 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to stay a lower court ruling in December striking down Utah's voter-approved prohibition of legal wedlock for gays and lesbians. Two 6th Circuit appeals judges signed onto Tuesday's decision, making it binding, while one -- Judge Helene White -- dissented. White said that while the Supreme Court did act regarding Utah, ""it did so without a statement of reasons, and therefore the order provides little guidance."" Voters in Utah, Michigan and nine other states passed constitutional amendments in 2004 defining marriage as one man and one woman. Whether same-sex couples should be allowed to wed was a hot-button issue then and in subsequent years, with polls showing that most Americans favored restrictions. But public opinion shifted over time. An ABC News/Washington Post survey released earlier this month found that 59% of Americans favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. The courts have stepped in as well, most notably the Supreme Court's landmark decision last June rejecting parts of the Defense of Marriage Act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. Friedman's ruling was the latest in a series of recent similar decisions affecting marriage restrictions in states including Texas, Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma. In most all those cases, the judge's orders did not take effect immediately. But Michigan's did and, as in Utah, scores of same-sex couples sought and got marriage licenses before later court decisions halted such unions -- at least for now, as higher courts weigh in. In Ingham County, Michigan, for example, 57 gay and lesbian couples got licenses, according to county clerk Barb Byrum. Their legal status in Michigan, in the wake of the various court rulings, was in limbo until Wednesday. In a statement, Gov. Rick Snyder said these same-sex couples had been ""legally married."" But that does not mean that they'll be afforded the same benefits as married heterosexual couples in the state, at least for the time being. ""Because the stay brings Michigan law on this back into effect, the rights tied to these marriages are suspended until the stay is lifted or Judge Friedman's decision is upheld on appeal,"" Snyder said, referring to the state's ban on gay marriages.

"(CNN) -- It's not a fun way to end a dream vacation. Dozens of passengers on a four-night cruise aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship became sick with a stomach illness, according to a company statement. The Majesty of the Seas docked in Miami Friday after a Caribbean journey that included port calls at Nassau and CocoCay, Bahamas, and Key West, Florida. Sixty-six of the more than 2,500 passengers aboard experienced gastrointestinal issues, such as vomiting and diarrhea, Royal Caribbean International said. Two of the more than 800 crew members also fell ill, the company said. The cruise line suspects the cause to be norovirus, according to the company's statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta describes norovirus as a very contagious bug that can be spread by infected persons, in contaminated food or water, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. The CDC says norovirus affects nearly 20 million people in the U.S. each year, and results in between 570 to 800 deaths. The cruise line said passengers affected by the illness had responded well to over-the-counter medication administered on board the ship. The company said it enhanced cleaning on board the ship during the cruise to help prevent the spread of the illness. After the ship docked, the company said it ""conducted an extensive and thorough sanitizing on board the ship and within the cruise terminal, to help prevent any illness from affecting the next sailing."" Five things we've learned about cruising . Passengers who boarded The Majesty of the Seas Friday received a letter asking if they had experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms within the last three days. Those who felt uncomfortable were allowed to reschedule their trip, the cruise line said. This is the latest setback to hit the cruise industry.

"(CNN) -- Normally, its viewers don't associate ""Eurovision"" with global politics. The annual singing show is a camp retread of the cultural wasteland of the 1970s -- all crashing ballads, gaudy europop and singing penguins. Britain has signaled its contempt for the contest by sending 76-year-old Engelbert Humperdinck as its representative, a man once regarded as a stud but who now looks eerily like one of those Mexican mummies. The crooner was born two decades before Eurovision even started, and it's touch and go whether he'll survive the weekend. However, this year the contest, which holds its finals Saturday, has taken on an unexpected degree of controversy. It is being held in the oil-rich tyranny of Azerbaijan, and while contestants were warming up their acts this week, pro-democracy demonstrators were getting beaten in the streets of Baku. The annual singing contest draws an audience of 125 million across Europe, so the dictatorial regime of Ilham Aliyev had hoped to use it as an opportunity to sell his country to the world. Instead it has been a public relations disaster. Explainer: What is Eurovision? Arguably, the outrages in Azerbaijan have exposed a hidden dimension of Eurovision. It is and always has been a very political event. That's more obvious this year than most because the politics of Europe are so blatantly and unavoidably polarized. The most obvious problem is one of definition. What on Earth, you might ask, is a central Asian country like Azerbaijan doing in a contest called Eurovision? Nothing about contemporary Azerbaijan marks it out as distinctly European -- it's Islamic, undemocratic and many, many miles away from the continent. It's in the contest by an accident of history: Azerbaijan used to be part of the Soviet Union. Its leaders desperately wish to claim some European identity because they want to participate in capital and labor markets -- something that should, theoretically, encourage democracy. But Ilham Aliyev also wants to retain the integrity of a classic Asian despotism. As the European Union engages farther eastward, through Turkey, it has to deal with nations and cultures like these that don't precisely fit its Western, liberal template. There are plenty of divides within continental Europe itself. Voting has always been political. Britain's 1997 victory was widely interpreted as a ""thumbs up"" for having elected the popular liberal leader, Tony Blair; its defeat in 2003 was punishment for the Iraq War. Likewise, Eurovision has traditionally operated a buddy system. Nordic countries often vote for each other and Cyprus typically favors Greece. In a way, that's a good thing, because it means that no matter how awful an entry is, someone is duty bound to vote for it. Britain has been bailed out by faithful little Malta several times. But the end of the Cold War dramatically enhanced the role of politics and favoritism in voting. For many of the new, Eastern participants -- particularly in the war-torn Balkans -- Eurovision became an extension of diplomacy, used to cement alliances with Russia or make amends with former enemies. Songs about regional reconciliation were touching when they debuted in the early 1990s. But now they elicit groans from West European voters because they are interpreted as a plea for geographic solidarity. The results support the contention that this has become an Eastern group hug. From 2001 to 2011, seven out of 11 winners have been Eastern, with a strong preference for the former Soviet bloc (the pattern is just as pronounced in the junior contest). Such is the frustration of Western countries that many of them have opted to send novelty acts. Sometimes that accidentally works (Finland's Hard Rock Hallelujah was surely a joke, yet it came in first in 2006), but it often means the folks back home end up humiliated. Britain's longstanding Eurovision presenter, Terry Wogan, quit the show in disgust after the UK's entrant, who was black, received only 14 points in 2008. Blaming the result on East European racial prejudice, Wogan observed that a contest invented in the 1950s to forge a sense of unity in the Cold War era has actually become a symbol of how polarized the new Europe is. And how poor, too. Spain's entrant, Pastora Soler, has admitted that it would be better if she didn't win on Saturday because she wasn't sure that her country could afford to host the contest. Struggling with soaring debt and unemployment, this former economic miracle is now a pauper state. Directors from Spain's broadcaster, TVE, sent a message to Soler that read, ""Please, don't win!"" Never has a sadder truth been spoken in jest. Eurovision was probably at its most hopeful and exciting in the early 1990s, when Europe was emerging from the nightmare of the Cold War and it had fantasies of a prosperous, democratic, unified future. But Azerbaijan in 2012 offers a very different vision. Modern Europe is struggling to integrate countries that have little cultural affinity for it, it is divided by regional loyalties and it is still a long, long way from recovering from the Credit Crunch. The European dream has ended; the fat lady stopped singing years ago.

"(CNN) -- He is but a dot in the ocean, gathering speed and rapidly rising as a mammoth wall of water expands below and behind him. Simultaneously fearsome and awesome, this may be the moment Hawaiian rider Garret McNamara on Monday broke his own record for the largest wave ever surfed. Caught off the coast of the small fishing village of Nazaré, Portugal, the monster wave was reported to be more than 100 feet high, or 30.5 meters. ""It was just this endless drop and my feet were popping out of the straps,"" McNamara told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""It was like my whole body was shattering. It was really difficult."" If accurate, the wave towers over his 2011 surf of a 78-footer (24 meter) at the same location. Nazaré officials have requested an impartial verification of a possible new world record. Thanks to one of the only deep water canyons in the world that connects to shore, Praia do Norte -- the north beach of Nazaré -- sees abnormally large waves. A group of extreme surfers descended on the Portugal coast this past week, providing some amazing experiences for onshore observers and some very social media-friendly video and photos. McNamara was first invited by the Nazaré Town Hall in 2010 as part of a three-year project to explore the local coast's unique geomorphic phenomenon and to bring more awareness to the area as a destination for big-wave enthusiasts. Though onlookers were spellbound by McNamara's ride, the surfer said he didn't get that much of a rush. ""I don't know what's wrong with me. There's definitely something wrong,"" McNamara said in his interview with Cooper.","Garret McNamara's wave believed to be 100 feet high .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate and the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan deal Friday extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while also avoiding a Medicare fee cut for doctors for the rest of the year. The bill cleared the Senate in a 60-36 vote less than an hour after the House approved it by a 293-132 margin. A majority of House Republicans and Democrats voted in favor of the bill, though 91 Republicans and 41 Democrats in the chamber voted no. Senate Democrats voted overwhelmingly for the bill while Senate Republicans largely opposed it. President Barack Obama has promised to sign the legislation as soon as he ends his current trip to the West Coast, ending debate on the politically sensitive measures at least for the duration of the election. ""This is a big deal,"" the president told an audience in Washington state. ""It is amazing what happens when Congress focuses on doing the right thing instead of just playing politics."" The roughly $100 billion payroll tax cut, a key part of Obama's economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages. Instead of paying in 6.2%, they've been paying 4.2% for the past year and two months -- a break worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000 a year. Without congressional action, all three measures would expire at the end of February. Pay roll tax cuts -- what's at stake . ""Our founding fathers recognized that Washington would not always be united,"" said Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, a top Republican involved in crafting the deal. ""In their wisdom they knew that even divided government must still govern. And that is what we are doing here today -- governing and providing a solution to the very real problems Americans are facing in their daily lives."" ""Today is a good day,"" declared House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. ""This represents a victory for the middle class in our country."" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Thursday called the deal ""a fair agreement and one that I support."" The agreement came together this week after House Republicans dropped a key demand Monday, saying they would accept the extended payroll tax cut without spending cuts elsewhere in the budget to cover the measure's roughly $100 billion cost. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agreement would increase the federal deficit by $89 billion over 10 years, mostly through decreased tax revenue. Numerous Republicans on Capitol Hill are vehemently opposed to any measure that increases the deficit. They are also concerned about diverting more revenue away from Social Security, and believe the unemployment insurance extension will discourage people from seeking work. Boehner defended the decision to move forward with an unpaid extension, a move previously opposed by Republican leaders, by arguing it was the only way to prevent a tax hike demanded by Democrats to help pay the cost. ""We were not going to allow Democrats to continue to play games and cause a tax increase for hardworking Americans,"" Boehner told reporters Wednesday. ""We made a decision to bring them to the table so that the games would stop and we would get this worked out."" ""It's the art of a deal. I mean, it's a compromise,"" Rep. Steve Latourette, R-Ohio, said earlier in the week. ""You have people that didn't get ... 100% of what they wanted."" The other two measures in the package -- the unemployment benefits extension and the so-called doc fix -- are estimated to cost a combined $50 billion. Unlike the tax cut, however, they will be paid for. Funding sources to pay for the benefits extension and the doc fix include savings from broadband spectrum sales, increased pension contributions by new federal employees, and cuts to Medicare hospital and specialist fees that will not affect patients, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Several Democrats from Maryland and Virginia -- near Washington -- voted against the package because, they argued, it treats federal employees unfairly by requiring new government hires to contribute more to their pension. Under the terms of the deal, in states with unemployment rates higher than the national average of 8.3%, the maximum time an unemployed person can receive benefits will drop from 99 to 73 weeks. The maximum length of benefits for people in states with an average unemployment rate or lower will drop to 63 weeks or as far down as 40 weeks. The jobless have been able to collect up to 99 weeks of benefits since November 2009 as part of the nation's unprecedented response to the recession. In addition, states will be allowed to perform drug tests on individuals applying for unemployment benefits if those people lost their previous job because they either failed or refused an employer's drug test. Individuals receiving unemployment assistance could also be tested if they are seeking a job that generally requires a drug test. Also, welfare beneficiaries will be banned from accessing public assistance funds at ATMs in strip clubs, liquor stores, and casinos. The current February expiration date for the payroll tax cut, the additional unemployment benefits and the doc fix were put in place by a short-term agreement reached by Congress in December. That agreement also set up the conference committee that resumed negotiations last month on a longer-term deal. The debate over whether and how to extend the tax cut has been a political loser so far for the Republicans. Democrats have gleefully highlighted the GOP's reluctance to hold down the payroll tax rate, using the issue to portray Republicans as defenders of the rich who are indifferent to the plight of the middle class. A number of conservatives have questioned the economic value of the tax reduction. Political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday has eroded GOP strength on the party's core issue of lower taxes. Fearing negative repercussions, Republican leaders have now backtracked on the issue twice: dropping their opposition to the two-month extension last December and dropping their insistence on paying for a longer extension on Monday.

"(CNN) -- An American man detained in North Korea since last November has been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, North Korean state news reported Thursday. A story on the KCNA website indicated that Pae Jun Ho had been sentenced by North Korea's supreme court. The North has used that name to refer to the man U.S. authorities call Kenneth Bae. A Korean-American, Bae entered North Korea on a valid tourist visa, a senior U.S. official told CNN on Monday. The official -- who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue -- said then that the State Department didn't know the exact charges against Bae. The KCNA report indicated that the American was sentenced Tuesday for ""carrying out serious crimes"" against North Korea, without specifying what exactly he allegedly had done. He was arrested November 3 in Rason City. The U.S. State Department had appealed Monday for Bae's release on humanitarian grounds. Three days earlier, a State Department spokesman told reporters that Swedish diplomats, who represent U.S. interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic relations with the North, were able to visit Bae. Some Americans have previously crossed the border without a visa, either knowingly or by mistake, but in this case, the U.S. official said, ""This was somebody who was a tour operator who has been there in the past and has a visa to go to the North."" Bae's sentencing comes amid tense relations between North Korea and both the United States and its staunch ally South Korea. In recent weeks, the North has intensified threats against its neighbor and the United States.","Kenneth Bae, referred to as Pae Jun Ho by North Korea, is sentenced, KCNA reports .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Rights groups and others have called on Thai authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during mass demonstrations in Thailand's capital, Bangkok. The People's Democratic Reform Committee protest group -- which hopes to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office -- launched its ""Bangkok shutdown,"" intended to last a month, Monday. The protesters plan to achieve their aim by closing seven main intersections in the large and hectic city. They will also surround the houses of Yingluck and some ministers, and they intend to cut off electricity and water supplies at these locations and some government offices. Authorities say eight people have died and 470 have been injured since the protests began in November. Amnesty International warned in a news release Friday that violence could erupt again. ""The situation in Thailand is tense, volatile and unpredictable. There is a real risk of loss of life and injury unless human rights are fully respected,"" said Isabelle Arradon, the rights group's Asia-Pacific deputy director. ""Security forces should ensure that the right to peaceful protest is upheld -- however, they also have a duty to protect the safety of the public. When carrying out their work, law enforcement officials should apply nonviolent means before resorting to the use of force, and always exercise restraint in its use."" Amnesty International also urged protest leaders to ""call on their followers not to commit human rights abuses."" The Thai government has deployed some 15,000 military and police to the capital ahead of the planned shutdown, the rights group said. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Friday in New York that he had spoken by telephone with Shinawatra and opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiv over the past three days ""in an effort to help them bridge their differences."" Ban said he was ""very concerned that the situation could escalate in the days ahead,"" and particularly on Monday. ""I urge all involved to show restraint, avoid provocative acts and settle their differences peacefully, through dialogue,"" he said. Vejjajiv has denied being a member of the PDRC protest group, but has appeared on stage and among the crowds at some of their demonstrations. Travel warnings . In a bid to cool tensions, Yingluck dissolved the nation's parliament in December and called for new elections to be held February 2. Updated info for tourists . But the move has done little to appease protesters. They have called on the Prime Minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" which would see through electoral and political reforms. The national Election Commission has urged the government to postpone elections amid the continuing unrest. Dozens of countries have issued travel advisories amid fears the tensions could erupt into violence. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has urged U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings in the city and to ensure they have a stock of cash and essential items in case the situation deteriorates. ""While protests have been generally peaceful over the last two months, some have resulted in injury and death,"" its online warning said. ""Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational, and can escalate into violence without warning."" The protest group said that on Monday it would still allow ambulances to pass along the roads it intends to block, and that it would not block access to airports and public transportation. Ambitious goal . Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck Shinawatra's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra is strongest among the urban elites and middle class, particularly in Bangkok. Thaksin Shinawatra's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast Thailand. His supporters, known as ""red shirts,"" plan to hold demonstrations in various places in Thailand, but not the capital or south of the country, on Sunday. They support the holding of elections on February 2. CNN's Kocha Alarn reported from Bangkok and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Anna-Maja Rappard contributed to this report.","Amnesty International urges Thai authorities to respect human rights during protest .

"(CNN) -- It was with a heavy heart that I heard Edward Snowden has been granted, and apparently accepted, temporary asylum in Russia for one year. Short of locking him naked in solitary confinement as an example to other leakers, as was done to Bradley Manning, Russia is exactly where the American intelligence community wants Snowden. How better to discredit Snowden's warnings of the threat posed to civil liberties by our ever-growing surveillance state than to ceaselessly point out that he has found sanctuary in the arms of the FSB, the successor to the KGB? I suspect this latest development will nix any possibility of reform of domestic surveillance operations coming out of the House Judiciary Committee. Of course, at this point, where else could Snowden go? He had spent five weeks in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. That had to be a purgatory on earth. By leaning on our allies, America had effectively trapped him there. One should not take too seriously, though, the outrage expressed by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Congress over this latest Russian perfidy. By fleeing to America's traditional bogeyman, Snowden has seriously blunted his own effectiveness. He has become an easy target for the U.S. government to demonize. Into whose hands has Edward Snowden actually put himself? With nowhere else to go, he is now physically under the control of a government whose leadership under Vladimir Putin has raised human rights alarms worldwide for the alleged killing of dissenting reporters, the jailing of performance artists like Pussy Riot and -- most recently --  the criminalization of homosexuality. Putin's thumbing of the nose to the Obama administration may be seen as a great thing for Snowden and his fate, but it's important to bear in mind that today's Russia is no more a bastion of free speech than China. Opinion: How Putin's move could help Snowden and U.S. Years ago, I was convicted of espionage, sentenced to 40 years imprisonment, and packed off in chains to a federal penitentiary. It was more than I could endure, so one cold winter night I escaped through the razor wire. I at once became America's most wanted fugitive. I was hunted high and low by the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service. I was shot at and chased and forever looking over my shoulder. I too contemplated seeking sanctuary in Russia. I thought long and hard about it because there was an easy route through Havana to Moscow. But I could not stomach the thought of it. I decided I would rather live the life of a hunted fugitive in my own country than spend my years controlled as a puppet of the KGB. After my arrest in 1977, I spent 25 years in prison. Contrary to what many believe, my partner and I did not give information to the Soviet Embassy to aid the Soviet Union. I did what I did because I wanted to publicize and strike back at the U.S. intelligence community for the things I saw that outraged me. It was a mistake that cost me dearly, and one that I lived to regret. I suspect Snowden will come to regret his actions just as deeply. This, more than anything else, would be the greatest tragedy of all. Opinion: What's in it for Russia? There is no doubt in my mind that Edward Snowden will rather be anywhere else on earth than in the arms of Putin's Russia. Of course, there are two exceptions to that statement: He does not want to be dead and he does not want to be sitting naked in an American solitary confinement cell. I do not see that his choices were all that great. Meanwhile, the U.S. surveillance state will go on stockpiling the sensitive personal data of the American people. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court will continue to function as a secret rubber stamp to spy on our own citizenry. The bulk collection of our telephone data will mushroom. The addresses of all letters and packages mailed and received will continue to be photographed by the U.S. Post Office. Internet companies will continue to be bent to the secret purposes of the surveillance state. The NSA will go on recording all our e-mail. Opinion: Snowden is an unwanted guest in Putin's Russia . Transparency, public disclosure, and open debate will be stifled as America becomes the world's first cyber-superpower. And politicians of both parties will go on fearing to resist lest they be blamed should a cyber-attack happen. Our surveillance state is only just beginning to flex its technological muscles. We have nothing to lose but our civil liberties. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Boyce.","Convicted spy Chris Boyce: Snowden is right where U.S. intelligence wants him to be .
Boyce: Russia, with such a poor human rights record, discredits Snowden's warnings .

"London (CNN) -- An actor in the Harry Potter movies was jailed for two years Tuesday for his role in riots that swept London last summer. Jamie Waylett, 22, who appeared as Hogwarts school bully Vincent Crabbe in six Harry Potter films, was found guilty of violent disorder at Wood Green Crown Court, in north London. He also pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods during rioting last August, according to court documents posted online. However, the court cleared him of a charge of possessing an article with intent to destroy or damage property in relation to a petrol bomb he was carrying. ""Anyone watching the footage in this case can only imagine the mayhem that took place on the streets,"" Judge Simon Carr said, according to court documents. Waylett had chosen to go out on the streets on what was the third day of the violence, the judge said, and video footage showed him near a supermarket that was being looted. ""You were pictured on a number of occasions with a bottle full of petrol with a rag as a wick,"" the judge said. ""I accept entirely the jury's verdict that you did not throw or have any intention of throwing it but merely being in possession of it would have been terrifying to anyone who saw you."" Waylett was given a two-year sentence for violent disorder and 12 months for handling stolen goods, to run concurrently, according to the court documents. Rioting first broke out in Tottenham, north London, in the wake of a peaceful protest over the fatal shooting of a local man by police. It spread to other parts of London and other English cities over the following days. The disorder was followed by a huge police crackdown on suspected rioters. According to London's Metropolitan Police, across the city there were more than 3,800 arrests for a variety of offenses, including burglary, arson and violent disorder. As of last week, more than 1,300 people had been sentenced, with nearly half of them sent to prison.

"London (CNN) -- The 500-year-old panel is not much bigger than an average flatscreen TV and the wood has split, but what it shows is truly extraordinary. A painting of Jesus Christ that, after centuries of neglect, has been identified as Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi."" It's a discovery so rare, so unlikely, that when New York art dealer and da Vinci expert Robert Simon of Robert Simon Fine Art first saw the painting, he didn't even consider the possibility. ""The whole idea that it might be by him was almost an impossibility; it's kind of a dream,"" said Simon. The painting joins a small collection of surviving paintings by the Renaissance master who lived and worked in Italy in the 15th century, and is the star attraction in a major Leonardo exhibition opening in London in November, following careful conservation treatment to remedy the damage it suffered over the years. ""Salvator Mundi"" (Savior of the World) is known to have been owned by English king, Charles I before moving around various private collections until 2005, when the current owner brought it to Simon to study. ""It was a very interesting painting but it's not something I looked at and thought, 'Oh my god, it must be a Leonardo,'"" said Simon. The true identity of the 66 x 45 centimeter oil-painted walnut panel had lain dormant for years, its distinguishing features hidden under layers of crude over-paint. It was known to have existed from preparatory drawings made by da Vinci and copies by his followers but experts assumed it had been destroyed. That's why initially, Simon and Dianne Dwyer Modestini (Senior Research Fellow and Paintings Conservator for the Samuel H. Kress Program at the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University), thought the painting was by one of Leonardo's associates or pupils -- a fact which, in itself, would have made the work extremely precious and very valuable. Besides, there are only some fifteen surviving Leonardo paintings in the world and the last one to be discovered was the ""Benois Madonna"" more than 100 years ago. So, what first alerted Simon and Modestini to the possibility that the painting they were looking at could be the real thing? ""I and Dianne didn't really allow ourselves to think in terms of attribution,"" he said. ""It's one of the mistakes in any connoisseurship problem (because) it can pervert the intellectual process."" The truth revealed itself little-by-little as Modestini painstakingly removed the layers of varnish and over-paint in her studio and Simon carefully studied the painting's provenance, comparing it with da Vinci's other paintings and preparatory drawings. But there were two important clues. One was a so-called ""pentimento,"" an alteration in the painting showing traces of previous work that Simon discovered by scrutinizing a photo of the painting taken using night vision, and using other techniques. The other was the painting of Christ's curls. ""I was looking at the curls and St. John the Baptist at the Louvre, who has this huge head of massive ringlets and they are exactly the same,"" said Modestini. As to the ""pentimento,"" she said, ""Robert always suspected that it was there."" She describes him using infrared reflectograms to see under the layers of paint, and discovering the thumb in the blessing hand and the stole Christ is wearing painted in different positions. The way the artist had worked out how to position the various elements in the painting suggested da Vinci's way of working. ""When we started adding many things into the equation it started to seem (more likely), we were sort of saying to each other, 'It has to be (a Leonardo),'"" she said. But, says Modestini, she continued to have doubts: ""I just couldn't believe it -- this is the rarest thing imaginable. How could this be?"" She remembers thinking: ""Have I lost my mind completely, have we both lost our minds?"" But as their scholarship deepened, they were able to narrow down their suspicions until they were sure they were dealing with a real Leonardo. It was at this point that the safety of the painting became a priority. ""I had to finish what I was doing very quickly because once it was (revealed to be) a Leonardo, it couldn't stay here (in the studio), it wasn't insured to stay here,"" Modestini said. So, they sent it to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art for safekeeping. Simon and Modestini then called in da Vinci experts from all over the world to further verify the painting. For Simon, the nearly seven-year process has been the pinnacle of an already distinguished career. ""This is not a little ripple in a pond, this is like a boulder,"" he said. ""I'll be pushing on but I have no expectations of making (another) discovery of this level. This is the art history equivalent of a gold medal,"" he continued. ""Salvator Mundi"" is going on public display in London in November, as part of the exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan at The National Gallery.","Neglected for centuries, a Leonardo da Vinci painting is rediscovered .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey waitress who served in the Marine Corps for over two years told CNN Friday she is now getting tips from all over the world after she says a family refused to tip her because she is gay. ""I'm sorry but I cannot tip because I do not agree with what your lifestyle and how you live your life,"" a family member wrote on the receipt for $93.55 at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey. ""I was offended. I was mad at first, and then I was more so hurt,"" 22-year-old Dayna Morales told CNN. Morales, who did a tour with the Marine Corps between 2009 and 2011, said she has been ""out open and proud for years,"" but ""never discussed with them (the family) anything; it was their pure assumption."" ""It's disrespectful and it's hurtful,"" she said. ""I feel bad for their children because that's how they are going to be raised."" She says the trouble began when she approached the table of four -- a man, wife and two girls -- at around 7 p.m. Wednesday. Morales said that when she introduced herself as Dayna and told them she was going to be their server, the older woman ""looked at me and said, 'I thought you were going to say your name is Dan.'"" Morales was so upset about the incident, she vented on Facebook, and the group ""Have a Gay Day"" posted her story on their Facebook page. The response was overwhelming. ""People have sent me tips from all over the world just to show support. I have had people from Germany to South Africa, Australia to the UK, San Diego, everywhere."" Morales says that between the people who have called in to the restaurant to give credit card numbers, those who have mailed tips, or donated to a special PayPal account the restaurant set up, she estimates that she has received more than $2,000 so far. She plans to donate the funds to the Wounded Warrior Project, and the restaurant plans to match the donations and give it to a local LGBT organization. ""It wasn't for the money. I never planned on this. I just wanted to vent,"" she said. ""The purpose was to inform people it wasn't OK."" Morales, noting that gay marriage recently became legal in New Jersey, added, ""It's 2013. This shouldn't be going on."" The general manager of the restaurant, Byron Lapola, did not release the family's names, adding that ""we fully respect our guests' privacy."" Lapola posted support for Morales on the restaurant's Facebook page: . ""Dayna is one of our absolute best servers working here at Gallop. We as a team were deeply hurt by the events that transpired. I myself as the General Manager took it personal as my team treats each other like a family. I made sure that Dayna was compensated for the tip, as for emotionally I wish there was much more I could do. One thing I can say is that people of that woman's kind business is not welcome here at Gallop, and I can assure you that if they decide to dine here again that they will be turned away.""

"(CNN) -- Facebook just purchased a service for sharing your location with friends, according to a CNNMoney report. UPDATE 2:30 p.m. ET: Gowalla has confirmed in a blog post that its service will wind down by the end of January. So what does that mean to those of us who use Facebook or Gowalla? If you're a Gowalla user and love the service the way it is, it's almost certainly bad news. When Facebook acquires a company, it rarely keeps the original product intact. Instead, it voraciously devours these smaller startups to get to the talented developers housed within. Beluga, a recent acquisition, is in the process of shutting down while Facebook works instead on Facebook Messages, a similar service. The initial report suggests this will be the case with Gowalla: Some of the Austin-based team will move to Palo Alto, California, to work at Facebook, while a few will stay behind in Austin. The move also technically means that Facebook owns the data you entered into Gowalla. I'd bet against Facebook importing this information into your Facebook profile without your consent -- they're likely aware that this would result in another privacy scare -- but I do think Facebook will provide time to export your Gowalla data if they do shut it down. Why is this a likely outcome? Because it's exactly what they're doing with Beluga. Existing users can download an archive of their Beluga messages until mid-December. Who knows, they might even provide a way to add your Gowalla check-ins to your Facebook Timeline -- but only with consent. What about Facebook users? Is anything likely to change? One conclusion you could naturally jump to is that Facebook wants you to share your location more often -- and the Gowalla team will build features into Facebook to do so. This would be logical: Facebook already launched a product, Facebook Places, for doing just that -- but they later scaled it back and merged the features into your status updates. Maybe Facebook wants to take another shot? To some extent, perhaps. My guess is that the integration won't be completely literal. I don't foresee Facebook providing ""stamps"" for checking in to certain locations, for instance. I don't think it will generate city guides for major metropolitan areas, either. We know from the initial report that Gowalla employees will work on Timeline, Facebook's new scrapbook-like layout, and I'd guess that their skills will be used more generally, rather than working solely on location-based features. We also know that a source with knowledge of the deal thinks that there's a broader similarity between the two companies. ""Gowalla's vision is about people telling stories, and Facebook's vision for Timeline is about stories about important moments in life,"" said the source. So don't expect Facebook to suddenly launch a wave of new location-based features. I think the fusion of the companies will be less visible than that. What does all this mean to you? If you're a Gowalla user and the deal is confirmed, you may want to switch services. I don't think Gowalla will be around for much longer if this Facebook deal closes. If you're a Facebook user, meanwhile, you probably won't feel a thing. Facebook just bought another group of talented developers and will continue to dominate the world of social networking for years to come. Your Facebook experience may even improve, thanks to the influx of talent into Facebook's ranks. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.","If you're a Gowalla lover, Facebook's purchase is almost certainly bad news .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The daughter of the tycoon who on Tuesday offered HK$500 million (US$64 million) to any man who would marry her found the proposal ""quite entertaining,"" she told CNN. Gigi Chao said her father, property developer Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, ""loves her very much"" and she was aware of the cash offer before it was first reported Tuesday by local Hong Kong media. The tycoon's offer came after Chinese media reports last week that she married another woman, her long-time companion Sean Eav, in a civil ceremony in Paris last week. Asked by CNN to confirm her civil union, Chao said she was ""not in a position to verify that."" Her father, however, was unequivocal, telling CNN ""reports of Gigi being married is not true, it's a rumor."" However, he did confirm that he is offering the multi-million dollar bounty for a future son-in-law: Any nationality or wealth of the suitor is fine, the only requirement is that the man ""loves my daughter, and she loves him."" Asked if she would consider her father's offer, Chao said, ""we will see."" The 76-year-old tycoon himself has never married, and has long earned a reputation on the pages of local newspapers and magazines in the arms of beautiful women, having once bragged of having had 10,000 girlfriends, the South China Morning Post reported.

"(CNN) -- Tetiana Chornovol, a prominent Ukrainian civic activist and journalist beaten on Christmas, said she has a long list of enemies, and that she was sure she would die during the attack. She spoke from a hospital bed Thursday, one day after a group of men dragged her from her car outside of Kiev in the latest attack on government opponents. ""Many people are trying to get me. It was not a provocation against somebody else, I am sure about it,"" Chornovol told Ukraine's Channel 5. ""I mean, I am a revolution activist, a very active one, and I am very well known as a journalist. I've undertaken many journalistic investigations, which are still irritating all of them."" She thinks her attackers were paid to kill her. ""And I was very scared when they were beating me; I thought they were going to kill me,"" she said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department said Washington is watching the case closely. ""We call on the government of Ukraine to uphold its (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) commitments and ensure respect for human rights, including fundamental freedoms of expression ... ,"" Jen Psaki said. ""We urge the government of Ukraine to send an unequivocal message that violence against critics of the government and those who are working towards a modern, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine will not be tolerated."" In Kiev, protesters rallied outside the Interior Ministry. Some held up pictures of Chornovol, while others had photos of Ukrainian Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko with words ""Down with the bloody minister."" Two of three suspects arrested . The Interior Ministry said it had identified three suspects in the beating. The ministry said it had arrested two of the suspects. A dashboard camera in Chornovol's car captured part of the attack on the 34-year-old journalist known for her muckraking investigations into corruption among senior state officials, according to the opposition Batkivshchyna party website. A still image from the dashboard camera footage showed the black SUV that struck Chornovol's car moments before the assault. The freelance journalist suffered a broken nose, concussion and numerous bruises, the online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported. Face battered . Pictures and a video of the journalist posted online showed Chornovol with the right side of her face and her lips swollen and bloody, according to Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Sources on various social media pages said she was hospitalized with a concussion. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych urged police Wednesday to investigate the attack as quickly as possible, the news agency reported. The attack was the second on a Ukrainian opposition activist in as many days, according to RIA Novosti. Dmitry Pilipets, a civic activist and organizer of protests in the eastern city of Kharkiv, was stabbed four times on the street by two unknown male attackers late Tuesday night. He was hospitalized Wednesday in stable condition, according to the news agency. The latest assault could increase tensions between the state and demonstrators who have braved sub-zero temperatures and set up tents and barricades in the city center to voice their opposition to closer ties with Russia.","Activist and freelance journalist tells Ukranian TV she thought she would die .

"(CNN) -- A niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren appeared Tuesday at an Irish court hearing on charges that included air rage related to an incident on Monday, CNN affiliate TV3 reported. A judge was considering a bail application for Jennifer Lauren, 41, the Irish commercial broadcaster reported. Lauren spent Monday night at the Shannon Garda Station and appeared Tuesday at the hearing, which was held in a pub, state broadcaster RTE reported. Local media reported that the unlikely location was because there was no dedicated courthouse in the area. The incident occurred aboard a Barcelona-to-New York flight that was diverted to Shannon Airport. Lauren is charged with engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behavior intended to disrupt the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace might have been caused, RTE said. She is also charged with being intoxicated ""to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that you might endanger yourself or other persons on board on the same date on the same flight,"" RTE said. And she is further charged with engaging in behavior likely to cause serious offense or annoyance to anyone aboard the plane after having been asked by a flight member to stop acting that way, it said. The incident led the captain of the Delta Air Lines Flight 477, with 216 passengers, to land at Shannon, where Lauren was arrested. A Delta spokesman said the diversion was due to ""an unruly customer."" The plane resumed its flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport more than two hours later. A lawyer for Lauren, Sharon Curley, did not immediately return a call or e-mail seeking comment. But she told Killaloe District Court that her client would plead guilty to the charges, RTE said. At Tuesday's district court hearing in the Brian Boru pub in the adjoining Lough Derg town of Ballina, Judge Patrick Durcan said that Lauren's case would be heard Wednesday in Ennis and that he would weigh the disruption to the airline and passengers, RTE added. Lauren was expected to pay bail of 2,500 euros Tuesday. Lauren runs a business in the United States called Jenny Lauren Jewelry. Her 2004 memoir, ""Homesick: A Memoir of Family, Food and Finding Hope,"" describes her effort to overcome an eating disorder and related health problems during her teens and 20s.","Charges include engaging in threatening, abusive or disruptive behavior .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber's iPhone is being searched for clues about his alleged involvement in an egg attack on his neighbor's house, a detective told CNN Thursday. Sheriff's deputies took Bieber's personal smart phone when they used a felony search warrant to raid his mansion Tuesday morning, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson said. The sheriff's technical crew, which is also examining security video seized in the search, are looking for any evidence of Bieber ""bragging or making fun of"" the incident, Thompson said. Bieber should not worry about any nude photos or ""drug talk"" that may be among his text messages, he said. ""It's just the egg matter."" ""We're looking for anything that has to do with this particular incident,"" the detective said. The security video system in Bieber's mansion could be the best witness to alleged egg attack. ""It was extensive,"" Thompson said of the system. ""I believe it was installed very well and covered all areas of Mr. Bieber's house. His security system was well operated."" Deputies seized the computer that recorded the video, he said. The alleged egg-tossing attack happened on the evening of Thursday, January 9, in the exclusive double-gated Oaks community of Calabasas, California. It is home to A-listers from entertainment and sports, including the mother and children of Michael Jackson. Deputies at the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station, which serves an affluent section of Los Angeles County just east of Malibu, have become familiar with Bieber, 19, since he moved into a $6.4 million home two years ago. Neighbors have dialed 911 several times to complain that the teenage multimillionaire was speeding down their residential streets in his high-performance cars. One neighbor accused Bieber of spitting in his face during a heated confrontation last March. Deputies have responded to complaints about loud parties at Bieber's place. Except for warnings, nothing was done. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office concluded that they couldn't prove the spitting or speeding cases in court, so they declined to prosecute. Prosecutors also rejected a misdemeanor battery complaint from a photographer who accused Bieber of attacking him in the parking lot of a Calabasas shopping center as he was taking photos of Bieber and his then-girlfriend, Selena Gomez, in May 2012. ""We didn't do this search warrant to send a message,"" Thompson said Tuesday. ""That's not what we do, but we hope maybe that understanding the gravity of this will change some of the behavior."" If detectives find evidence that Justin Bieber attacked his neighbor with eggs, they will present their findings to the district attorney for possible prosecution. This could happen in a few days or weeks, Thompson said. The estimated $20,000 in damage to the neighbor's house would make it felony vandalism, which could carry prison time. Lil Za's lament . Bieber house guest Lil Za -- a 20-year-old rapper whose real name is Xavier Smith -- is steaming over the media attention and legal troubles that followed his abrupt awakening Tuesday morning. Deputies found suspected illegal drugs ""in plain view"" of Lil Za when they entered his bedroom in Bieber's home, Thompson said. He was arrested on a felony drug charge. To make his bad day worse, he was also charged with felony vandalism after allegedly busting the telephone in the jail while he was waiting to be bailed out. Za tweeted this Thursday: ""Honestly, the media is making me someone I'm not. But only those in my shoes can relate. ... These ppl get paid to make you look bad. Some stuff I've done has been wrong yes. but look at the position I'm in and the color of my skin. Cocaine? Really? All this time I was home in tx nobody gave a f--k about what Za is doing ..soon as he gets to La he's all over the news."" Thompson initially said the Texas native was found with cocaine, but later said the drugs were suspected to be Ecstasy -- aka Molly -- and Xanax.","Deputies took Bieber's phone when they raided his mansion Tuesday .

"Rome (CNN) -- A boat carrying as many as 500 people capsized and caught fire off the Italian island of Lampedusa, the nation's coast guard told CNN on Thursday. At least 110 people died, a doctor with the local health department said. Antonio Candela said that 154 people had been rescued in the ongoing operation. Lampedusa's boat people: One man's story . Lampedusa, not far from Sicily and the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter European Union countries -- and such deadly shipwrecks are all too common. The latest boat to sink is thought to have been carrying up to 500 people. Those aboard include Eritreans, Somalis and Ghanaians, the coast guard said, and the boat is believed to have launched from Libya's coast. CNN forecasters said there were some gusting winds and showers Thursday morning in the region but no weather conditions significant enough to be likely to sink a boat. According to Italian media reports, the vessel sank near Rabbit Beach, also known as Rabbit Island, which was recently voted one of the best beaches in the world by Trip Advisor. The survivors are being taken to Lampedusa's main port, where authorities have the facilities to help them. The bodies of those who didn't make it are also being moved there. Images from the scene showed some lined up in body bags on a quayside. The head of the U.N. refugee agency, Antonio Guterres, praised the efforts of the Italian coast guard but said he was ""dismayed at the rising global phenomenon of migrants and people fleeing conflict or persecution and perishing at sea."" Another 13 men drowned off Italy's southern coast Monday when they attempted to swim ashore, the U.N agency said in a statement. It is working with countries in the region to find ""effective alternatives"" so people don't risk their lives trying to make perilous journeys by sea, it said. Migrant ship sinks in Mediterranean killing 10 . Dehydrated, burned . Last week, the Italian coast guard rescued a ship bound for Lampedusa from Tunisia that had 398 Syrian refugees on board. There is generally a spike in migrants coming to the island -- which has 6,000 full-time residents -- in the summer because the seas are calmer. Migrants who spoke to CNN's Eric Marrapodi last week in Lampedusa said they typically spent a day or two at sea in boats that are barely seaworthy. Those who arrive generally have no papers and seek asylum in Italy. They spend anywhere from a day to a week on Lampedusa before moving to another city on the mainland. At the detention center where they first take the migrants, the coast guard said, they had 1,250 migrants in a space designed for 250. A Navy doctor said that typically those who arrive are treated for dehydration, sun exposure, and gasoline burns, because they're so packed into the boats the fuel splashes and burns the skin. A Navy commander said the service has been working with Thuraya, a satellite phone company, to try to make sure that it gets the coordinates of migrants sent out on boats by traffickers before they come to harm. 12 Chinese fishermen rescued, 58 still missing after typhoon sinks boat . Overcrowded boats . Just under 115 kilometers (70 miles) from Tunisia, the island has been the first point of entry to Europe for more than 200,000 refugees and irregular migrants who have passed through the island since 1999. But boats carrying migrants often are in peril at sea. In recent years, the Italian Coast Guard says it has been involved in the rescue of more than 30,000 refugees around the island. Izabella Cooper, a spokeswoman for the European Union's border control agency, Frontex, told CNN that migrants are often sent to sea in overcrowded vessels without the engine power to make such a long and dangerous journey. Since the start of the year, Frontex -- which supports the efforts of individual EU member states -- has helped save more than 16,000 lives in search-and-rescue operations, she said. While Italy is the current focus of efforts by migrants and asylum-seekers hoping to enter the European Union, Cooper said, that has not always been the case. ""Seven years ago it was the Canary Islands, then the pressure moved to the central Mediterranean, then it moved to Greece -- then with the Arab Spring, it moved back to Italy,"" she said. ""There are definitely too many lives lost and definitely too many tragedies in the Mediterranean."" Rights group Amnesty International called for both Italy and the European Union to do more to safeguard the thousands who risk their lives each year in the hope of protection or a better life. ""It is high time the Italian authorities and the EU increase their search-and-rescue capacity and co-operation in the Mediterranean Sea, rather than concentrating resources on closing off the borders,"" said Jezerca Tigani, deputy director of Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia Program. ""More must be done to prevent further loss of life in the future."" Risk for a better life ends in death for 22 people near Indonesia . Pope's prayers . Pope Francis, who visited the tiny island near Sicily this summer to pray for refugees and migrants lost at sea, echoed that call. During his visit to Lampedusa in July, Pope Francis criticized what he called ""global indifference"" to the island's refugee crisis. And in a statement issued by the Vatican Thursday, Francis called for concerted action to prevent more tragedies like the Lampedusa shipwreck. ""It is a disgrace!"" he said. ""Let's pray together with God for those who have lost their lives: men, women, children and for the families of all the refugees. Let's bring our forces together so tragedies like these ones don't happen again."" A risky journey . According to a briefing published by the U.N. refugee agency in July, the peak crossing period for migrants and asylum-seekers runs from May to September. The agency estimates that 8,400 migrants and asylum-seekers landed on the coasts of Italy and Malta in the first six months of this year, all but 600 of them in Italy. Most departed from North Africa, principally Libya, for the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, one of the busiest seaways in the world. The migrants and asylum seekers chiefly come from countries in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Somalia and Eritrea, it said. Others originate from Syria, Egypt or Pakistan, and smaller numbers from Gambia, Mali and Afghanistan. The U.N. refugee agency recorded some 40 deaths in the first six months of 2013, a figure based on interviews with survivors of the crossing. For 2012 as a whole, some 15,000 migrants and asylum-seekers reached Italy and Malta -- and almost 500 people were reported dead or missing at sea, it said. The U.N. agency credits the efforts of the Italian coast guard and Maltese armed forces for a reduction in migrant deaths in the first half of 2013 compared with the previous year.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber house guest Lil Za appeared before a judge Wednesday but stopped short of accepting a plea deal to settle drug and vandalism charges that stemmed from the January search of Bieber's mansion. A prosecutor agreed to reduce a felony vandalism charge -- which was filed after the rapper allegedly pulled a jail phone off of a wall -- to a misdemeanor, but his lawyer asked for more time before entering a plea. The case was reset for April 30. Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators were looking for evidence that Bieber, 20, attacked a neighbor's home with eggs in January when they arrested Bieber's house guest for possession of suspected illegal drugs. A felony vandalism charge was added after Lil Za -- whose real name is Xavier Smith -- allegedly pulled a phone out of the wall in a jail holding area while waiting to be bailed out. Lab tests confirmed one of the drugs in the 20-year-old rapper's possession was MDMA, also known as Molly or Ecstasy, a sheriff's detective said. The prosecutor acknowledged in court Wednesday that the phone damage did not meet the threshold for a felony vandalism charge. Smith was represented in court by lawyer Shawn Holley, who is also Bieber's attorney. The Los Angeles County district attorney has yet to decide if Bieber will be charged with vandalism for the egg attack. The prosecutor could decide to make it a felony case, since investigators said it caused an estimated $20,000 in damage to a Calabasas, California, mansion. It could also be prosecuted as just a misdemeanor because of the nature of the incident. Sheriff's detectives asked for a felony charge against Bieber, but his lawyers argue that the egging was a childish prank.

"(CNN) -- Bowe Bergdahl, the only American POW in Afghanistan, has doubtless been at the forefront of his parents' minds, if not atop the national conscience. It's not that the American people don't care; it's more that updates about the 27-year-old soldier have been sparse, as his family has remained reticent for fear of jeopardizing his safety. With news that the U.S. will engage in peace talks with the Taliban and encouraging signs that Bergdahl will be included in a prisoner swap, we'll likely be hearing more about the man whom friends and family describe as an adventurer and a gentleman. The U.S. expects prisoner exchange to be a topic of the talks, which are slated to take place ""in the coming days,"" in Doha, Qatar, said State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki during a Thursday briefing. No decisions have been made about transferring any Taliban detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. Any such decision would have to be made with congressional approval and in accordance with U.S. law, she said. Already, Bergdahl's parents, Jani and Bob, have released a statement through a family spokesman, Army Col. Tim Marsano, saying they will speak to the crowd during a ""Bring Bowe Back"" rally in Hailey, Idaho, this weekend, though they're not granting interviews. ""The family is encouraged by the possibility. Anytime that there are discussions and negotiations that may lead to the freeing of their son ... that is encouraging news, especially after not much encouraging news over the past four years,"" Marsano said, adding that the Bergdahls have been talking with military and government agencies. ""They know their son has not been forgotten. My brothers and sisters in uniform know we won't rest until Bowe Bergdahl is safely back with his family."" Those who know Bergdahl say he's gregarious and chivalrous, able to hold a conversation with anyone and prone to spontaneous acts of kindness. Sue Martin, owner of Zaney's Coffee Shop in Hailey, where Bergdahl once worked as a barista, recalled in a 2009 interview how she walked out to the parking lot after a storm and found all the snow scraped off of her car. ""Bowe would have been out there,"" she said. ""He would never say anything."" U.S. POW's dad to Taliban: 'Let there be peace' Longtime Blaine County Sheriff Walt Femling, now retired, said Bergdahl didn't like automobiles and rode his bike back and forth to work, 15 to 20 miles each way, in any weather. Femling, who also rented Bergdahl an apartment, once saw him walking, drenched, with his bike through a rainstorm. The sheriff offered him a ride. ""He turned it down because he didn't want to get my car wet and he continued to walk in the rain,"" Femling said. ""Kind of tells you a little bit about the person."" Home-schooled as a youth and naturally curious, Bergdahl enjoyed martial arts and fencing and was prone to wanderlust, friends and family say. He spent time in Europe before enlisting in the Army and once worked on a sailboat out of Bristol Bay, Alaska, that journeyed along the East Coast and to the Caribbean. Bergdahl was 23 when he was captured June 30, 2009, after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province. Military officials at the time said they believe low-level militants caught the soldier and handed him over to Pashtun warlord Siraj Haqqani's clan, which operates along the Afghan-Pakistani border. Initially, Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said Bergdahl was safe, and a video was distributed showing Bergdahl ""in good shape and good health."" Later, Sangeen issued threats that Bergdahl would be killed if foreign troops continued targeting civilians during searches in Ghazni and Paktika provinces. Shortly after his capture, Bergdahl appeared in a video, saying, ""Scared I won't be able to go home, and it's very unnerving to be a prisoner."" Since then, his captors have released three more videos of the Wood River Valley, Idaho, native assigned to 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, in Fort Richardson, Alaska. The last video was sent in February 2011. The airborne infantryman, who has been promoted twice -- first from private first class to specialist, then to sergeant -- since his capture, has spoken in the videos on occasion, but analysts and those close to him say his statements appear scripted. Such was the case when in December 2009 he appeared on a video saying the U.S. had lost all hope of winning the Afghanistan War and that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama couldn't be trusted. He also claimed America's military opponents in Afghanistan were ""very smart"" and had ""perfected"" the art of warfare. Earlier this month, the family said through another spokesman -- Dwight Murphy of a POW/MIA group in Boise Valley, Idaho -- that they had received a letter from Bergdahl via the Red Cross. It was ""scripted and redacted,"" his father said, but he was in good condition. The statement added that the Taliban was being careful with Bergdahl and that there appears to be disagreement within the Taliban about what to do with its lone American captive. ""It appears at least several parties want to arbitrate captive SGT Bowe, several others ... want to keep fighting until every single Westerner is out,"" the father said. May 2012 marked the first time the U.S. government acknowledged it was engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. The discussions moved in fits and starts because of U.S. concerns that any Taliban prisoners swapped for Bergdahl might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight. In August, however, the White House announced it was willing to send five Taliban prisoners to Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl. There have long been signs that the Taliban is open to diplomacy. James Cunningham, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, told a Senate panel at his July 2012 confirmation hearing that Taliban leaders are ""signaling they are open to negotiations"" but was quick to assert that the Taliban must end its alliances with terrorist groups like al Qaeda. Other officials have said they're encouraged by signs that Taliban representatives are doing just that and by statements suggesting the group is willing to accept ideas supported by Afghan society, such as allowing girls to attend school. Last year, a Taliban representative also attended an international conference on Afghan reconciliation in Japan. CNN's Paul Vercammen, Ed Lavandera, Barbara Starr, Elise Labott, Jill Dougherty and Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","State Department says it expects Taliban to discuss prisoner swap ""in coming days""

"(CNN) -- Belts off, coats off, shoes off and placed in the bin. Every traveler is familiar with the process and the queue that defines TSA security checkpoints at airports across the country. But that procedure may become a thing of the past. The Department of Homeland Security wants to make airport security faster for fliers. To do that, it will need technology companies to develop a new generation of security scanners. The agency recently posted what amounts to a ""help wanted"" ad on the website Fedbizopps.gov. The government website posts federal government business opportunities. In this case DHS is seeking advice and information from technology companies who would develop a newer, more efficient wave of airport security scanners. DHS wants scanners that would add speed to the security process, allowing 250 passengers through per hour without having to remove their shoes and outer garments. ""TSA is always looking for new technology and procedures that will enhance security and increase efficiency,"" the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement. TSA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, began deploying state of the art advanced imaging technology to airports in 2008. Current scanners detect metallic and nonmetallic threats, including weapons and explosives, that may be concealed under clothing. The government wants the new scanners to screen passengers as they walk without passengers being required to ""significantly alter walking paths"" or shed clothing. DHS also wants the new scanners to be able to scan shoes. ""The system will automatically detect the required threats with no operator interpretation required."" That means no need to wait for a TSA officer to review the X-ray images on the monitor. Travelers shouldn't expect fast moving TSA security lines just yet. The government's call to tech companies is just the first step in what could be a multiyear process.","Department of Homeland Security exploring more efficient airport screening .

"(CNN) -- Representing ""a new kind of authentic action genre,"" according to co-director Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy, or if you prefer, the same old, same old wearing a bright, shining sales gimmick, ""Act of Valor"" is the latest co-production between Hollywood and the U.S. military. Such partnerships are a propagandistic tradition that go back at least as far as John Wayne and ""The Sands of Iwo Jima."" Francis Coppola had to go to the Philippines to get the helicopters he needed for ""Apocalypse Now,"" but ""Top Gun,"" ""Transformers"" and even ""Black Hawk Down"" have benefited from the Pentagon's largesse in terms of hardware and expertise. Still, McCoy and his partner, Scott Waugh, (they style themselves ""The Bandito Brothers"") might be correct when they claim this is the first time real-life Navy SEALs have appeared (incognito) on camera in the principal roles. And if that isn't realistic enough for you, we're told they used live ammunition in some of the firefights. There's no official word on how many real-life terrorists were harmed in the making of this movie. In a brief infomercial that serves as a prologue to the main feature, McCoy somehow keeps a straight face as he claims there is no way an actor could reproduce the emotions the real-life SEALs feel whey they leave their wives and ship out on active duty. It's not a very convincing argument -- Mouse, it's called ""acting"" -- and the thesis goes down in flames more or less every time one of the servicemen opens his mouth.

Too bad the Bandito Brothers' nose for authenticity couldn't sniff out the cliches in the stale, dopey screenplay turned in by ""300"" scribe Kurt Johnstad. The screenplay is a globe-hopping fantasy perpetuating the fashionable, paranoid myth that Central American drug barons are the natural allies of Jihadi terrorists.

Whatever you make of its reactionary politics, at least the action scenes are choreographed and filmed by Shane Hurlbut with a level of coherence that's become rare in this genre -- even if the elaborate raids and skirmishes look more like a series of war games than actual combat. For a start, all the high-tech toys and gizmos actually work the way they're supposed to. That goes for the SEALs too of course. There's no equivalent here to the battle scene in the Afghan war documentary ""Restrepo,"" in which we see even battle-hardened combat troops lose it when one of their comrades takes a lethal hit. There's nothing equivalent to the Danish war documentary ""Armadillo,"" either, in which we witness European peacekeepers unthinkingly break the Geneva Convention by murdering enemy casualties in the heat of battle; nor the scenes in the Oscar-nominated documentary ""To Hell and Back,"" in which a seriously wounded American vet struggles to get his life back together on home turf. That kind of authenticity is simply too hardcore for this Mickey Mouse action movie, a recruitment commercial that ultimately does a disservice to the troops by pretending that war is just like a movie -- and not a very good one at that.","""Act of Valor"" is the latest co-production between Hollywood and the U.S. military .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid had goalkeeper Iker Casillas sent off in the second minute but battled to a 1-0 win at Espanyol Sunday to cut Barcelona's lead at the top of Spain's La Liga to five points. Spain World Cup keeper Casillas went for clipping home midfielder Jose Callejon as he raced clear from a through ball, his sending off the quickest ever for a Real player in a Spanish league match. Manager Jose Mourinho had to introduce youngster Antonio Adan from the bench and sacrificed Argentina star Angel Di Maria, but it sparked an impressive display from Los Blancos. With a numerical advantage Espanyol did occasionally threaten and from the resulting free kick Luis Garcia saw his effort saved by Adan, but it was Real who were the more threatening. Marcelo clipped the crossbar with a rising shot before he was found by Cristiano Ronaldo and scored from an acute angle in the 23rd minute. Marcelo then sent Emmanuel Adebayor clear, but the Togo striker slipped as he shot and his effort looped onto the top of the crossbar. Espanyol applied more pressure in the second half and Callejon might have equalized only to send his effort wide of the far post. But in the dying moments Carlos Kameni twice denied Adebayor from point-blank range with superb saves, both times after receiving passes from the hard- working Ronaldo. Barcelona's winning run was halted Saturday as they were held 1-1 by Sporting Gijon, giving arch-rivals Real the chance to close the gap. In other La Liga action Sunday, Villarreal slipped two points behind rivals Valencia in the battle for Champions League places with their second successive league defeat, beaten 1-0 at Deportivo La Coruna. Defender Alberto Lopo's goal on the hour mark sealed three vital points for Depor, who move out of the relegation zone while their visitors stay fourth. Meanwhile, promoted pair Hercules and Levante improved their chances of staying in the top flight with wins over Real Zaragoza and Almeria respectively.","Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas sent off in 1-0 win at Espanyol .

"(CNN) -- One man's fund-raising efforts to publish a book on ""getting awesome with women"" raked in thousands of dollars, but also allegations that it is a guide to sexual assault. Ken Hoinsky describes his book as a self-help book for men seeking advice on interacting with the opposite sex. ""It is a guide for men to get better with women,"" he explains in a video on the crowd-funding website Kickstarter, which he used to raise funds. Hoinsky, who lives in Connecticut, according to his online profile, raised more than $16,000 to publish his book, but the contents have also provoked ire from those who call it a how-to guide for would-be rapists. He writes in the book: ""The concept of 'waiting for signs' or 'indicators of interest' was commonplace in older pickup theory. It is 100% garbage and needs to be erased from the face of the planet."" ""From now on you must assume that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished,"" the book continues. ""Physically pick her up and sit her on your lap. Don't ask for permission. Be dominant. Force her to rebuff your advances."" People turned to Twitter and other social media to criticize not just Hoinsky's project, but also Kickstarter for having hosted it. An online petition demanding that Kickstarter remove the project garnered nearly 30,000 signatures by Wednesday evening. ""'Disgusting' doesn't even begin to describe it: basically, it's a how-to guide on sexually assaulting women,"" the petition states. But Kickstarter says it will not delete Hoinsky's crowd-funding project. ""Some of this material is abhorrent and inconsistent with our values as people and as an organization,"" Kickstarter said in a statement. ""Based on our current guidelines, however, the material on Reddit did not warrant the irreversible action of canceling the project."" The website said the controversy will lead to reviews of their policies, but didn't elaborate. Hoinsky denies that his book is a tool for would-be attackers. He is ""devastated and troubled"" by the allegations, Hoinsky said in a statement. The book excerpts that critics are sharing are taken out of context, he said. They come from a later chapter on physical escalation that follows clear advice that ""no means no,"" he said. ""The gist of the controversial advice is, 'Don't wait for signs before you make your move. Let her be the one who rejects your advances. If she says no, stop immediately and tell her you don't want to do anything that would make her uncomfortable,'"" Hoinsky said. According to his Kickstarter page, because he raised much more than his stated fund-raising goal, Hoinsky is going to take his theories on the road. He plans to host free seminars in New York and San Francisco.","Ken Hoinsky raised funds for what he calls a self-help book .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's best-known judge will be suspended for 11 years from the bench after his conviction Thursday for improperly ordering wiretaps while investigating a financial corruption case, the nation's Supreme Court ruled. Afterward, Baltasar Garzon said he ""rejects"" the sentence, that the court convicted him in ""an unjust and predetermined manner,"" and he vowed to appeal. In a statement late Thursday, Garzon said, ""This sentence, without judicial reason nor evidence to support it, eliminates all possibility to investigate corruption and related crimes by opening spaces of impunity, and seriously contributing -- in an effort to stop one specific judge -- to reduced independence for Spanish judges."" Garzon had ordered wiretaps against suspects who were in jail and under investigation in the case, allowing authorities to listen in on their conversations with defense attorneys and others. Their lawyers later filed a lawsuit, arguing that the wiretapping violated their constitutional right of attorney-client privilege. A seven-judge panel at the Supreme Court convicted Garzon, according to court documents. A second trial against Garzon ended on Wednesday, but judges have not yet ruled in the case. That case concerns his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Francisco Franco in Spain. Human rights groups say both cases, especially the second one, amount to a vendetta against Garzon, who became known internationally for his investigation into human rights abuses under former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Garzon, 56, was suspended provisionally from the bench in 2010, pending these trials. A third case is under investigation, but no trial has been set. At a three-day trial last month in the financial corruption case, Garzon professed innocence. The case implicated some leading conservative politicians, among others, and there have been trials recently against defendants in the corruption scandal known as Gurtel. Garzon said his wiretap orders, in early 2009, were backed by state prosecutors, who did not bring charges against Garzon. He testified that he ordered the wiretaps on suspicion that suspects in the case were involved in money laundering while they were in preventative prison. But the Supreme Court judges wrote, ""The central question to be resolved in this case is related to the fundamental right of defense for the suspect, against the legitimate interest of the State to pursue crimes,"" the sentence said. ""It is not possible to have a just process if the right of defense is essentially eliminated."" The sentence added that Garzon's investigation had the effect of ""admitting practices which now are found only in totalitarian regimes where anything is considered valid to obtain the desired information."" Garzon's possible avenues for appeal include the Constitutional Court -- Spain's highest court, which rules on constitutional issues -- or to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Julio Villarrubia, a leader of Spain's main opposition Socialist Party, said the party ""respects"" the decision of the court but finds it ""troubling that Judge Garzon, who has fought tirelessly against drug trafficking, terrorism and corruption,"" is now convicted. Human rights groups consider the second case against Garzon, for his investigation of mass graves under Franco's rule, to be the more important one. In the second trial, state prosecutors again did not press charges, but a private prosecution, allowed under Spanish law, did. It is led by a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, which charged that Garzon ignored an amnesty law approved in the Spanish Parliament in 1977, two years after Franco's death. In that trial, which ended Wednesday -- just hours before his conviction in the corruption investigation -- Garzon testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities. So he decided to investigate because he considered those to be ""permanent crimes"" which still affect their descendants, since the remains have never been found. He said he began to see evidence that there was a ""systematic plan"" against Franco's opponents, which he said included forced disappearances, illegal detentions and assassinations. Franco's military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco's forces defeated Republican and leftist fighters. Franco's dictatorship continued until his death. Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed, said Emilio Silva, from a group called Historical Memory. Various international observers attended the trial and Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday, ""This is a trial that should never have been held, but which at least served to show that Garzon acted in accordance with international law, which imposes on states a duty to investigate the worst international crimes."" ""The Supreme Court should put an end to this sorry episode for Spanish justice by acquitting judge Garzon of all the charges against him,"" Brody added. ""Investigating state killings and 'disappearances' should never be considered a crime."" Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America.","NEW: Judge Baltasar Garzon ""rejects"" sentence, vows to appeal .

"(CNN) -- The Boston Marathon bombing investigation made use of crowdsourcing to collect photos and video from cell phones and surveillance cameras at an unprecedented level. These pictures were made public a little more than 72 hours after the explosions and the second suspect was arrested 29 hours later. Forensics is the use of scientific or technical information to answer questions in a court of law. Digital forensics is the branch that focuses on the identification, acquisition and analysis of information found on digital devices: computers, cell phones, digital cameras or any computer-based system. The concept of law enforcement posting photos of wanted individuals in a public place and asking for assistance is hardly new; walk into any post office and you will still see the FBI Most Wanted poster. Why the post office? Because it used to be the social center of a town, a place where the government and the people regularly came together. Fast forward to 2013 and we have thousands of people taking pictures and videos of what everyone expected to be an every day event. Law enforcement agencies were able to use these images to observe the comings and goings of hundreds of people at a certain site at a certain time in order to detect a pattern of behavior with which to identify the two suspects. And most of this imagery came from private citizens. Personal computers have been around for nearly 30 years. The Internet has been commercially available for 20 years. Mobile phones have been pervasive for more than 10 years and smartphones, in particular, for more than five. Computers, networks and cell phones have increasingly become the record keeper, instrument or target of criminal activity over the last few decades. Smartphones are everywhere and offer the equivalent of a portable Internet terminal. Not only do cell phones contain a phone book, call history and text messages, but also Web browser history, email, Global Positioning System and other location information. And surprisingly high-quality pictures and video. All of this information will be of value to investigators. They will want to know who the suspects might have been communicating with in the immediate aftermath of the bombings and, again, in the aftermath of their pictures being posted in the media. The larger investigation will undoubtedly examine their text and email messages, social media postings, Web sites visited and calls made over the last few months and years. This digital forensic evidence will help piece together patterns of behavior that could provide insights into the suspects' thoughts and deeds, and even provide new leads. What does this mean for privacy rights? Consider that when a municipality wants to put up a new camera at an intersection, or purchase a drone, there is often a public outcry. Is the camera an invasion of privacy? Where will it be looking? How will the government use the data? How long will the data be kept? Will it be used to track my movements? At some level, these are good and important questions because this kind of discourse is necessary to frame our Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Yet, in Boston, a lot of the images came not from public-sector cameras but from private-sector cameras: our fellow citizens. Fellow citizens who voluntarily shared their information so that law enforcement could do its job. Were these people violating the rights of others by sharing their pictures? Well, no, considering that the Bill of Rights was intended to protect us against a tyrannical government rather than from each other. Indeed, it is not clear that the government could have compelled these citizens to turn over their pictures just in case they might be useful; imagine persuading a judge to sign a search warrant on such pure speculation. Yet, citizens stepped forward to offer their help, a clear sign of a community willing to work together for a greater good and one that does not distrust the government. Although some might claim that these people were surrendering their rights for an element of security, it was the same instinct that made some people run toward the carnage so that they could provide assistance and comfort to friends, family and strangers. They were not surrendering their rights when they helped law enforcement but were empowering themselves as a community. The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly offer citizens a right of privacy, although many court decisions certainly support such an ideal. Indeed, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis is well known for his observation, ""The right to be left alone -- the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people."" Your personal privacy has more to fear from the likes of Facebook and Google than from the government. Commercial entities such as social media sites offer free services and yet make money. How? We, our information, have become their commodity. They have more money, motivation and resources to use our collected information for their own purposes than the government does. We, as users of social media, self-exploit; we post our information voluntarily. Yet, once posted, we usually lose exclusive ownership of the information and always lose control over it. Although the use of the crowdsourcing metaphor may be new as it applies to a criminal investigation, it is almost certain we will see more of this in the future. And it is sure to renew questions about how we all are invading each other's privacy and personal space. It also points to the incredible resiliency of the U.S. Constitution and its ability to guide us in a modern era, yet why it needs constant interpretation. As technologies evolve that the Founders could not have possibly anticipated -- from fully automatic weapons and thermal imagers to satellites and digital technologies -- we have to figure out how to balance our rights as individuals and needs as a society.

"(CNN) -- Who is the first person you call when the sports team you support is experiencing a dire run of results? In the case of one disgruntled Manchester United his first port of call was to British police demanding to speak with the team's former manager Alex Ferguson. The drunken fan had seemingly had enough after Manchester United, now managed by David Moyes, were beaten on penalties by Sunderland in the semifinals of the League Cup -- England's second most prestigious cup competition. The desperate plea was revealed on Wednesday by Great Manchester Police (GMP), who advised against such calls being made to the emergency services. ""A man from the Crumpsall area of North Manchester rang 999 in a drunken state demanding to speak to Sir Alex Ferguson about last night's result,"" read a GMP statement posted on its Facebook page. ""Obviously, it can be a sad and depressing moment when you're football team loses a game, however, can we all please remember that 999 is to be used for emergencies only. ""For any other police-related enquiries that are not an emergency, you can ring 101."" The English champions' recent run of poor form has left supporters clamoring for a return of the success enjoyed under Ferguson. The Scot was in the United dugout for 26 years, winning two European Cups and 13 English titles before handing the reigns over to Moyes at the end of the 2012-13 season. Moyes, formerly the manager of Everton, has endured a torrid start to his tenure. United sits seventh in the English Premier League table, 14 points adrift of leaders Arsenal, and has been eliminated from both the League and FA Cups. GMP warned that calls such as the one made on Wednesday can prevent police from attending genuine emergencies. ""Silly calls like this one are thoughtless and can make a difference in a life and death situation,"" said GMP's business lead for call handling Diane Grandidge. ""As a force we receive thousands of emergency and non-emergency calls, which is why I would urge those considering making such pranks to think twice. GMP suggested that any fan wishing to get hold of Ferguson, who has frequently attended United matches since retiring in May, should contact the club directly. ""If you would like to speak to Sir Alex about recent football results we here at GMP Manchester North can only suggest you try ringing Manchester United FC directly as you will probably (not definitely) have a much better chance of getting through to him there rather than ringing the police.""","Manchester United fan dials 999 asking for Alex Ferguson after defeat to Sunderland on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- If, say, Justin Bieber were to offhandedly announce that he will never record another song; if Kristen Stewart were to proclaim that she is finished acting forever; if LeBron James were to declare that he has played his last game of basketball. ... If any of those things were to occur, they would become the topic of furious, nonstop national conversation. But when one of the most admired and honored authors of fiction this country has ever produced let it be known that he has written his last novel and will write no more, it took weeks for anyone in the United States to notice. Philip Roth told an interviewer for the French publication Les InRocks: ""I'm done."" The interview appeared in early October. This month Salon magazine took note of the French interview and contacted Roth's publisher; the publisher checked with Roth and reported back that it was true. Roth, 79, after more than half a century of brilliant work -- including more than two dozen novels and novellas -- has decided that his most recent book, ""Nemesis,"" published two years ago, would be the last one. In the hierarchy of our contemporary world, popular music, movies and professional sports, as produced and played by the new stars of the moment, far outrank the written word in terms of the public's fascination. No one was exactly breaking into network newscasts with breathless bulletins about Roth's decision. But for those of us who have followed his career and have long been stirred by the breadth and depth of his artistry, the idea that he would voluntarily close the door on writing is a major event. It's not as if the years have caught up with him and sapped his talent; the work he has published since turning 70 not only holds up well against his earlier novels, it reaches new strata of wisdom, perceptiveness and pure storytelling skill. From his first book -- 1959's ""Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories"" -- through ""Portnoy's Complaint"" and ""The Professor of Desire"" and ""Zuckerman Unbound"" and ""American Pastoral"" and ""The Human Stain"" (just to skip around some of the mountain peaks of his career) -- he has never failed to provoke and rouse emotions. For most writers, just the work Roth has produced since that 70th birthday -- ""The Plot Against America,"" ""Everyman,"" ""Exit Ghost,"" ""Indignation,"" ""The Humbling"" and ""Nemesis"" -- is of a quality beyond all reasonable dreams of what a person might accomplish in an entire lifetime. So why is he saying goodbye? Here is some of what he told the French interviewer, as translated by The New York Times: . He has gone back and reread all his own books, and ""After this, I decided that I was done with fiction. I don't want to read any more of it, write any more of it, and I don't even want to talk about it anymore. I have dedicated my life to the novel; I have studied it, I have taught it, I have written it and I have read it. To the exclusion of almost everything else. It's enough. I no longer feel this dedication to write what I have experienced my whole life. The idea of struggling once more with writing is unbearable to me."" And he told The Times: ""Writing is frustration â€” it's daily frustration, not to mention humiliation. It's just like baseball: you fail two-thirds of the time ... I can't face any more days when I write five pages and throw them away. I can't do that anymore."" Of course, even though there will evidently be no more new books, the ones he has written over the last 53 years are still there for new readers to discover. And as much as I admire his writing, there are many of his books that I still somehow haven't gotten to. I'm already making my list. What I find when I read Roth is that as soon as I reach the last page of one of his novels, I have the urge to start it all over again to try to figure out: How did he do it? How did he create this magic? Roth is famously private; several times over the years I have been offered the opportunity to meet him, and have purposely not followed up. Decades ago the owner of an independent bookstore who knew him offered to provide an introduction; in recent years a member of a private club in New York where Roth went regularly to exercise in the indoor swimming pool said he would be a go-between. But I hesitated, probably for the same reason that I have never read a review of a Roth book (not wanting someone's summary to spoil the story I am about to read), and have avoided reading profiles of him. There's a story about a British rock 'n' roll luminary of the 1970s. The musician, it was said, attended an Elvis Presley concert at the Hilton in Las Vegas; he was seated near the front of the showroom. After the last song, one of Presley's Memphis buddies came out and asked the musician if he would like to come backstage and say hello. And the musician, or so the story goes, politely declined. The reason, he said, was: . ""You're not supposed to meet Elvis."" Meaning: The work is enough. Let the work stand, and speak, for itself. When the work is good enough, that's all that should matter. I'm looking over at a bookshelf, where I can see two distinctive yellow dust jackets: the first Roth book I ever purchased, more than 40 years ago -- ""Portnoy's Complaint"" -- and, down the row, the one I purchased most recently, ""Nemesis."" ""Nemesis"" is a heart-stirring and heartbreaking story set against a polio epidemic in Newark, New Jersey, in the summer of 1944. If it does in fact turn out to be Roth's last novel, then these words -- and telling you this here is not giving away the plot -- will be the final sentence in the final Philip Roth novel: . ""Running with the javelin aloft, stretching his throwing arm back behind his body, bringing the throwing arm through to release the javelin high over his shoulder -- and releasing it then like an explosion -- he seemed to us invincible."" Indeed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Philip Roth has said his latest novel would be his last, he won't write any more .
Greene: Retirement of an artist of such stature in movies would have been huge news .
Roth's talent was apparent even in the novels he wrote in his 70s, Greene says ."
"Lahore (CNN) -- Polls closed in Pakistan Saturday, after a day of voting in which bursts of deadly violence aimed at polling stations failed to deter Pakistanis keen to have their say in landmark national and provincial elections. Voter turnout was nearly 60%, the chief election commissioner said early Sunday. The national election marks the first transition between civilian governments in the nation's 66-year history. In its short existence, the nation has experienced three military coups, been ruled by generals for half its life and remains mired in political turmoil. In March, the democratically elected government finished serving a full five-year term, paving the way for the elections. Street parties erupted in the cities of Lahore and Peshawar early Sunday, with people celebrating even before the results of the vote were in. In his stronghold of Lahore, candidate and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he was confident his party will form the next government. He said he hopes his party won enough seats to form a government on its own but that he is willing to work with others to solve the country's problems. The Election Commission extended polling hours in some constituencies in the southern city of Karachi, where there were complaints about the vote. The Election Commission secretary, Ishtiak Ahmed Khan, told a news conference the election was free and fair across much of the country, despite the problems in Karachi. Aside from claims of irregularities, four blasts hit Karachi as people voted, killing 14 people and wounding dozens. Across the country, 29 people were killed in election day violence. Despite pre-election attacks, voters lined up at dawn at polling stations nationwide, eager to send off the caretaker government put in place in March. ""This is the first time I am voting and I am 60; I want change,"" said Shaheen Khan, who was at a polling station in Karachi, the nation's largest city. ""There were thousands of people when I came ... the queue was so long. People in wheelchairs and crutches all waiting to vote."" Waits of three hours or more were reported at some polling stations. Election officials also reported delays in opening at some polls, the official Associated Press of Pakistan news agency reported. A statement from the office of interim Prime Minister Mir Hazar Khan Khoso thanked the people of Pakistan for ""coming out in huge numbers"" to vote, as well as everyone involved in participating in and organizing the elections. He voiced ""confidence that the next phase of counting of votes will also be completed smoothly,"" and reiterated the determination of the caretaker government to hand over to the winners without delay. Vote rigging claims . The leader of the governing Pakistan People's Party, Taj Haider, alleged vote rigging in some constituencies in Sindh province and its capital, Karachi, in a news conference broadcast by CNN affiliate Geo TV. Haider called on the country's election commission to hold a new vote in the affected constituencies. Leaders of the Sindh-based Mutahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), one of Pakistan's largest and most liberal parties, told reporters that they would boycott the elections over allegations of rigging. The Sunni Ittehad Council and Jamaat e Islami parties also announced a boycott, Geo TV reported. Many Pakistanis hope the polls will usher in reform in a country battling issues including corruption, a struggling economy and security threats. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the Saturday's election violence but said the militants' ""cowardly acts"" would not stop people from exercising their right to vote. An open letter from Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was attacked by the Taliban last year for her efforts to promote girls' education, urged everyone, and particularly women, to use their vote. ""If we want education, electricity and natural gas in our country, we must take a step,"" said her letter, published by Pakistan's Dawn website. ""Let's vote for our country. We never realized how much powerful our vote is. One vote can change our country."" Blasts target voters . In some cities, the insecurity was evident Saturday. Two of the blasts in Karachi targeted the Awami National Party office, killing 11 and wounding 36, said Naeem Shah, a spokesman for Karachi police. A third explosion was in the Karachi suburb of Landhi. It killed three people and wounded nine, according to the deputy commissioner of Malir district, Qazi Jan Mohammed. Voting continued afterward, he said. A fourth explosion, which wounded four people, was in the Peerabad area of Karachi, Shah said. Fakhruddin Ebrahim, the chief election commissioner for Pakistan, said he contacted the military over security concerns in Karachi and the harassment of polling station staff in the city. He said polling material was stolen in several areas. Eleven people were killed in two separate bombings in Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province, district police officer Allauddin Kasi said. One of the attacks was on a vehicle carrying voters who had cast their ballots, he said. Another targeted independent candidate Khadim Shah, the prime minister's office said in a statement condemning the bombing. Elsewhere in Balochistan, at least four people were killed and eight injured in a clash between two groups at a polling station, police official Sardar Muhammad said. In another incident, 12 Awami National Party supporters were hurt by hand grenade thrown at a party electoral office in Quetta, said Syed Mobeen Ahmed, a deputy inspector general of police. Brig. Muhammad Abdur Raheem, the military spokesman for Balochistan, said polling still went well in the province apart from interruptions caused by a few incidents. There was a good turnout, including by women voters, he said. In the northwestern city of Peshawar, 12 people, children among them, were wounded when a bomb exploded at a polling station in a school, said Habibullah Arif, a local deputy commissioner. Record numbers . Of the 86 million voters registered to cast ballots, there were 36 million new voters, according to the Election Commission of Pakistan. More than twice as many candidates are women than was the case five years ago, with 161 running compared with the 64 who contested the 2008 poll, according to the United Nations . As the nation makes the transition after years of mostly military rulers, the economic, political and security situation remains unstable. As well as high inflation and poverty rates, Pakistan has seen outbreaks of violence, in some cases by Islamic extremists. Since April, the Taliban in Pakistan have killed dozens in attacks on the three main political parties. Many urban voters and parties regard resurgent fundamentalism as one of country's biggest threats. More than 600,000 security personnel were deployed nationwide leading up to the election, Information Minister Arif Nizami said Friday. Pakistan's army, which helped deliver 650 tons of ballots to polling stations, deployed 91,000 troops around the country, a military spokesman said. Fractured nation . The ruling Pakistan People's Party is led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated former prime minister and party leader Benazir Bhutto. While his party became the first civilian government to complete a full five-year term -- the three governments after the death in 1988 of military strongman Zia ul-Haq were all brought down by the army -- its legacy is a deeply fractured country with a faltering economy. The party's main opposition came from Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N. One of the country's leading industrialists and richest men, Sharif has been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup when Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999. Viewed as a religious conservative, his party -- Pakistan's second largest -- believes it would have won elections in 2008 had the assassination of Bhutto not given a massive boost to the ruling party. Another contender was Imran Khan, the former cricket star and heartthrob who leads the Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party. Not in contention is Musharraf, who returned in March from four years of self-imposed exile to take part in the elections. A court banned him from taking part in politics and his party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, announced a boycott.

"TIANJIN, China (CNN) -- Mao Zedong once said, ""He who has not climbed the Great Wall is not a true man."" Participants in the Great Wall Marathon look over the not-so-typical course to run on May 17. Mao likely never anticipated the scene on May 17, when more than 1,600 athletes from 49 countries not only climbed but ran The Great Wall of China Marathon. The race was held for a ninth year in Tianjin, a rural province three hours outside Beijing. ""For most people just seeing the Great Wall of China is a big deal,"" explained Cliff Jennings, an agent for Marathon Tours, a Boston-based adventure-running company. ""But, for a few hours one day a year, people can actually run over 2,000 years of history on a portion of the Great Wall."" Revered as one of the most challenging marathons in the world, runners clambered over thousands of steps, varying in length and size, to complete the course. In addition to the marathon, participants also had the option to run a half marathon, 10K, or 5K. Far from the pollution in Beijing over which the Olympic marathon runners are fretting, these runners enjoyed a mild smog-free day. The event's diverse participants span the globe and represent generations, with ages ranging from 14 to 85. Margaret Hagerty, who at 85 competed in the 10K race, now holds the record for the oldest woman to ever run the wall. Hagerty is already a 2007 Guinness Book World Record holder for the oldest woman to run a marathon on seven continents, including Antarctica. ""I've run over 80 marathons across the world but climbing all those steps for the 10K race on the Great Wall was the hardest thing I have ever done,"" Hagerty, a North Carolina native, admitted. She began her running career at 64 after she went to a clinic to quit smoking. ""The Doctor told me to stop smoking and start moving,"" Hagerty said. When asked why she chose to run the Great Wall she replied, ""Why not?"" Despite the difficulty of the course, runners such as Terry Theobald, who did not finish the 2007 marathon in the eight-hour time requirement necessary to get official credit for the run, managed to complete the challenge this year. ""There were so many times I wanted to quit along the way, but I was determined to not let the wall get the best of me this year,"" Theobald, 41, who lives in New York said. ""When I crossed the finish line with a time of seven hours and fifty two minutes with just eight minutes to spare, I was thrilled."" Theobald had a tattoo of the Great Wall Marathon designed on her back as a reminder of her desire to complete this year's marathon. The Great Wall marathon typically takes runners 50 percent longer to complete than their average marathon. This year Romualdo Sanchez Garita, a 37-year-old runner from Mexico, set a new marathon record of 3 hours, 18 minutes, 48 seconds. The event highlighted the diversity of the runners and the richness of Chinese culture. In addition to the Great Wall, the course also took competitors through traditional Chinese villages. ""This is more than just a running event, it is also an exchange of culture,"" said Thomas Orr, a South African who has been working in Beijing the past three years and ran the marathon last year. ""The highlight of the year for the people in these villages is seeing hundreds of runners from around the world come through their towns. It is also a great opportunity for runners to see another part of China."" Each year the number of runners who take part in the event increases, but this year participation in the marathon saw unprecedented growth. ""The number of participants in this year's race increased by 50 percent,"" announced Lars Fyhr, the International Sales and Event Manager for Albatros Travel, the tour agency that organized the race. ""We think the sharp increase could partially be due to people having more interest in China this year because of the Olympics in Beijing."" With just three months to go before the Olympics in Beijing begins, some runners said they feel they have already taking part in this year's Games. ""Though I will not be here when the Olympics conclude with the marathon event,"" an unidentified runner joked as he finished the final section of the wall, ""I can say that I was already there, and my marathon in China was on the Great Wall.""","1,600 runners from 49 nations compete in May 17 race .

"(CNN) -- ""We must be on you but cannot see you."" That was one of the very last voice signals transmitted by Amelia Earhart in the summer of 1937, somewhere over the vast Pacific Ocean during her ill-fated flight around the globe. An intense search led by the U.S. Navy was launched to find Earhart and her plane, but after several weeks, nothing was found. ""All right, good night."" Those were the last words transmitted 17 days ago from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, somewhere over the South China Sea between Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City. An international search led by the Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines and joined by governments and private companies from the United States, Great Britain, China, Australia, Norway, Japan, New Zealand and others have narrowed down a possible search region to a vast chunk of the Indian Ocean southwest of Perth, Australia. ""This is probably the one of the largest efforts you'll ever see in terms of maritime surveillance and joint operations,"" Australian Defense Minister David Johnston said Tuesday. Reports now seem to support the theory, popularized by pilot instructor Chris Goodfellow, that an incapacitating emergency led the pilots to divert the Boeing 777 toward the closest airport (hence turning south) while simultaneously trying to fight an electrical fire of some sort until they were overcome. Experts believe that the jet continued on dumb autopilot until it was, like Earhart's Lockheed Electra, out of fuel, plunging into the sea. Opinion: Flight 370's resting place is best clue . Earhart was lost on July 2, 1937. MH370 disappeared March 8, 2014, more than two weeks ago. In those 77 years, almost everything about the world has changed. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared just a few years before World War II erupted and a new world order emerged: what is often called the American century. And the three-week search effort for Earhart was entirely American, directed by the Navy. Flight 370 was operated by Malaysia's national airline, en route to Beijing. The flight was the opposite of pioneering, instead a routine long haul of 227 passengers, with a coach class ticket costing about $530. But in this case, the search effort is extraordinary and much more international in scope. This time, it's not just the Americans. The Australians, the Chinese and the Norwegians are deploying their air forces and navies with cutting-edge technologies for weeks on end to help. Pakistani radar, Chinese satellites, even NASA aided the search. Add to that countless hours of analytical personnel. In the end, it was a private British satellite company, Inmarsat, that confirmed the likely flight path and terminus. According to some reports, this is the most expensive search effort in history. Although there was strong criticism against the Malaysian government for delays and missteps during the initial days of the investigation, it seems as if the international community has largely united in focusing massive resources on finding the plane. There was nobody famous on the flight and yet it is somehow unremarkable that dozens of nations are expending millions of dollars to solve the mystery. Together. Pilot: How mechanical problem could have downed Flight 370 . All this stands in stark contrast to Russia's opportunistic conquest of the Crimean peninsula, a major part of the neighboring nation of Ukraine. That sort of nationalist land grab reminds me less of the Cold War than of norms of the 18th century and just about every century of history prior. Certainly, there's something extraordinary and dangerous going on in the Crimea, but a calmer, more patient, more historical assessment distinguishes the reflexive nationalism of a weakened ex-empire from the larger trends in a globalizing world. Or what about the civil war in Syria? Or the heightened tensions on the North Korean peninsula? Or the disputes between Japan and Korea over the ""Sea of Japan"" versus the ""East Sea""? Or the uprisings in Venezuela? All are hot spots where the international community has largely been paralyzed, unable to do much more than call for multilateral inquiries and issue hollow condemnations. So what's left to be seen is whether this unprecedented international coalition assembled to scour the ocean for the remains of Flight 370 is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise devastating tragedy for the families of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Or whether this is merely a one-off proposition where each nation is acting in its own self-interest to do what it must for its own citizens, while feigning cooperation for the world stage. I prefer to see the goodness here, that the world can come together and work together when it counts. Sometimes it takes a tragedy to remind us of the everyday miracles of our time.

"Washington (CNN) -- An influential group of House conservatives, unhappy with the midterm strategy of Speaker John Boehner and other top Republicans, outlined its own election-year message on the economy on Wednesday. ""I think our leadership has been good about showing what we're against. I think one area where we've had weakness is we really haven't shown what we're for,"" Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise told CNN in advance of introducing a new jobs bill. Scalise doesn't call out leaders by name, but in an interview in his Washington office, he sent a clear message that he believes there is a tendency for top House leaders to play it safe. He heads the powerful Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives that includes the vast majority of rank and file House GOP members. Since its inception, the RSC's main objective is to move House GOP leaders to the right on policy measures. ""I would like to see our leadership be bold. I would like to see us as a House majority be bold because I think the American people are hungry for bold ideas that will solve big problems because I think our country has big problems."" Scalise said he's confident voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the agenda of President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats, but he admits his own party has low approval ratings, too. ""They don't trust us because they don't know what we stand for,"" Scalise said. Contract With America, Part II . Idaho Republican Raul Labrador agrees. While he didn't work on the major jobs bill that Scalise and other conservatives unveiled Wednesday, he echoes concerns that his party isn't presenting a more aggressive election year campaign to educate voters about what Republicans stand for. Labrador says he is talking to leaders about a package of ideas ""kind of like a 'Contract With America' "" that would spell out bills congressional Republicans would pass in the first 90 days of the next session of Congress. In the 1994 midterm election, many credited Newt Gingrich's ""Contract With America"" as a key component in helping the party retake control of the House after 40 years in the minority and helping Gingrich become speaker. Conservatives have clashed with House Republican leaders repeatedly on policy differences over the debt ceiling, the budget and spending bills. But in this case, there isn't a major disagreement over substance -- it's about strategy. They believe continuing to pass piecemeal economic bills and sending them to the Democratic Senate gets lost with voters and dilutes their message. That's why the jobs measure is a big bill that rolls together roughly 15 proposals. He and others admit they are not new, but that's not the point. They believe the impact is greater by packaging them. ""The fact that we're putting so many of our good ideas together in one bill shows that we want to have a sharper focus on not just the broad problems that are holding our economy back, but actually put a comprehensive plan to the fact that our economy is still struggling,"" Scalise said at a news conference after filing the bill. Democratic pollster predicts 'huge turnout disadvantage' in 2014 . The list includes a plan to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, a proposal to authorize more offshore drilling, measures to roll back some regulations on coal plants and expedite permits for natural gas exploration. It also lists bills rolling back some financial services reforms that conservatives believe hurt the ability of small businesses to expand and get more access to capital. The push for one overarching economic plan mirrors the playbook conservatives used recently to press their leadership to agree to hold a vote on a GOP alternative to Obamacare. The RSC introduced its own proposal to repeal and replace the health care law last year. Again they pulled together a number of ideas that Republicans previously proposed into one package. Now House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is leading an effort with key committee chairs to draft a Republican alternative to the current system. Boehner: We're pushing for more jobs . Asked about the criticism from conservatives on the speaker's jobs message, Boehner said Wednesday ""we've been focused on jobs for three years and three months."" He said he welcomed ideas from conservatives and said ""if they want to package it in a way that they think is best, I'll pat 'em on the back. Job well done."" Boehner agreed on the need to present a contrast for voters, saying that ""I think we've got a challenge to show people what party has better ideas - we've got ideas."" But pressed on when the GOP leadership would unveil it's health care bill or any other broad agenda, Boehner said proposals would come out ""as we develop them."" Cantor has been scheduling floor votes on targeted measures, such as a bill to reduce home heating prices. In a memo to House Republicans about the spring schedule, the majority leader touted several measures under his ""American That Works"" agenda and pledged more items were scheduled to address the ""middle class squeeze."" Not all conservatives are worried that the party needs to present a comprehensive economic solution this fall. Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina says it is important to repeatedly tell voters what you support. But he says the Democratic Senate won't take up any House GOP bill, and he believes the 2014 midterm election will center just on the problems with Obamacare. Asked if that issue alone is enough to help Republicans expand their majority in the House, Gowdy replied, ""Right now it is."" Freshman Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina admitted that internal divisions among House GOP members make it hard to coordinate any unified message. He pointed to how then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi kept her members on the same page when Democrats controlled the House. ""They all had a message of the day, and they all sang out of the same prayer book. We're all a bunch of individuals, so I don't think we could ever have that same kind of message discipline,"" Hudson said. He also said, ""Our leadership doesn't rule with an iron fist and say 'this is what you are going to say today.' It makes it harder to have a unified message to break through the noise."" Scalise thinks a more comprehensive statement of what Republicans would do for the economy is critical to helping the party in its quest to take control of the Senate. ""Right now, there is no head of the party and the House is the only majority,"" Scalise said. ""It would excite people more to know what we would do if we were in the majority than if you just say put us in the majority so we'll block this President's agenda.""","Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana: ""We really haven't shown what we're for""

"(CNN) -- Through some highly successful crowdfunding and skillful negotiation, the last remaining laboratory of futurist inventor Nikola Tesla is now in the hands of a nonprofit group that wants to preserve the site and make it a museum honoring ""the father of the electric age."" The Tesla Science Center announced that it's completed the purchase of the building and land of Wardenclyffe Tower in Shoreham, New York, after trying for more than 18 years. The original asking price was $1.6 million, but the deal closed for $850,000. Last year, the nonprofit made a plea on the Internet for donors. Tesla fan Matthew Inman, creator of the Web cartoon ""The Oatmeal,"" started an IndieGoGo crowdfunding effort irreverently titled ""Let's Build A Goddamn Tesla Museum."" Fans of Tesla's responded, raising more than $1 million in about a week before wrapping up with $1.37 million. The Wardenclyffe Tower was to be where Tesla realized his dream of developing wireless communications and clean, free energy for the world. It was never completed, and the building was later used by a photo processing company, leaving the area tainted with chemicals. The money left over after the purchase will be used to clean up and renovate the property. The ultimate goal, an interactive science museum honoring Tesla, will require much more cash. ""Now begin the next important steps in raising the money needed to restore the historic laboratory,"" Mary Daum, treasurer of the Tesla Science Center, said in a statement. ""We estimate that we will need to raise about $10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of Tesla and his legacy. We invite everyone who believes in science education and in recognizing Tesla for his many contributions to society to join in helping to make this dream a reality."" On his website, Inman thanked donors and said an event is planned this summer in Shoreham to help finance the science center. Musical performances, lectures, interactive exhibits and tours -- with Inman as one of the guides -- are planned during the two-day event. Inman also plans a special Tesla demonstration during the event. ""I own a fully functional Tesla coil cannon and I plan to BBQ some Sriracha-bacon sandwiches by shooting them with its 20,000 volt electric arc, so the event will be both scientific and delicious,"" Inman wrote on his site. ""Again, we're shooting for this summer but we haven't pinned down a date yet."" The Tesla Science Center is also calling on volunteers to come out Saturday to assist in the cleanup along the perimeter of the site. Interested people can sign up using VolunteerSpot.com, which is helping organize the event. Largely forgotten for decades in the shadows of inventors like Thomas Edison, Tesla has emerged in recent years as a sort of unsung hero among the science-minded. Tesla foresaw the need for wireless transmissions in the late 1800s -- a hundred years before anyone picked up a cell phone. But Tesla's work lost much of its financial backing after inventor Guglielmo Marconi sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean, and the lab site was lost in 1915. Now, the nonprofit group hopes to soon be welcoming visitors who can understand and appreciate all the accomplishments and ideas envisioned by the inventor. ""This is a major milestone in our almost two-decade effort to save this historically and scientifically significant site. We have been pursuing this dream with confidence that we would eventually succeed,"" said Gene Genova, vice president of the Tesla Science Center. ""We are very excited to be able to finally set foot on the grounds where Tesla walked and worked."" More information about fundraising events and the Wardenclyffe site can be found on the Tesla Science Center website, Facebook page and Twitter feed.","Nonprofit group has purchased former lab of inventor Nikola Tesla .

"LONDON, England (CNN) --  -- The World Health Organization has called the swine flu outbreak spreading around the world a ""public health emergency of international concern."" Swine flu is usually diagnosed only in pigs or people in regular contact with them. Health workers worldwide are racing to prevent what may potentially become a pandemic. An influenza pandemic occurs when a new virus appears against which the human population has no immunity, according to the WHO. Christine Layton, a public health expert who specializes in influenza at research institute RTI International, told CNN the swine flu has ""pandemic potential."" ""Unlike the avian flu that people were concerned about a few years ago, a lot more cases are occurring in a lot more different places,"" she said. ""The mortality rate is lower with swine flu, but it seems to be cropping up in a lot more different places.""  See photos of the outbreak in Mexico » . Previous influenza pandemics have been deadly. According to current projections, a pandemic today could result in up to 7.4 million deaths worldwide, the WHO says. Since 1900, three pandemics have occurred, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Spanish flu was the worst pandemic of the 20th century. Up to 40 percent of the worldwide population became ill when it occurred in 1918-1919. The WHO estimates the Spanish flu resulted in upwards of 50 million deaths -- or more deaths than those during World War I. A virus as severe as Spanish flu has not been seen since. Although 10 times deadlier than other pandemics, Spanish flu was far less contagious than diseases such as measles or chicken pox, according to Harvard epidemiologists Christina Mills and Marc Lipsitch, who carried out a study in 2004. In 1957, another influenza pandemic surfaced. The 1957 pandemic was known as the Asian flu.  Watch Dr. Gupta report from the epicenter of the outbreak » . It was sparked by the H2N2 strain and was first identified in China. There were two waves of illness during this pandemic: The first wave mostly hit children, while the second mostly affected the elderly. It caused about 2 million deaths globally. But the medical community was able to identify that pandemic more quickly because of improvements in scientific technology, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The most recent pandemic occurred in early 1968 when a flu pandemic surfaced in Hong Kong. About 33,800 people died between September 1968 and March 1969 -- making it one of the mildest pandemics of the 20th century. While no pandemics have surfaced since 1968, other pandemic ""threats"" have occurred in the 20th century, including the 1976 ""killer flu"" (later named ""swine flu"") threat in the United States, which led to a mass vaccinations amid fears it was related to the Spanish flu virus. The most recent pandemic threats occurred in 1997 and 1999. Hundreds of people became infected with the avian flu virus, or bird flu, which killed six people and infected hundreds. This virus was different as it moved from chickens to people, rather than moving through pigs first. Around 1.5 million poultry were slaughtered in Hong Kong to contain the threat. The rise of global air travel has raised the ability of disease to spread more rapidly than ever before. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, better known as SARS, was the first severe transmissible disease to hit the globalized world when it hit in 2003. But outbreaks like SARS, which saw the application of control measures like quarantine, travel restrictions and fever checks at airports, have helped the health community better prepare for emergencies.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is withholding some military aid to Egypt as it reviews how to proceed with any future help as deadly political violence continued to flare, a U.S. official told CNN. But the White House said repeatedly on Tuesday any suggestion aid had been halted beyond two areas that have already been announced was inaccurate, and that a review of all assistance programs to Egypt is ongoing and no determination had been made involving the results of that assessment. ""Providing foreign assistance is not like a spigot. You don't turn it off and on or turn it up or down like a faucet. Assistance is provided episodically. That is, it's provided in specific tranches,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. ""There are tranches of assistance that have gone to Egypt. There are also some that have been stopped,"" he said, noting the cancellation of military exercises in September and the delay of fighter jet shipments. But David Carle, a spokesman for Sen. Patrick Leahy, confirmed to CNN on Monday that his office was told that military aid has been halted. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, is chairman of the committee that oversees such funding. ""As we noted yesterday, the State Department and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee was told that the transfer of military aid was stopped, that this is current practice, not necessarily official policy, and there is no indication of how long it will last,"" an aide to Leahy reiterated in a statement on Tuesday. But the U.S. official who spoke anonymously said the move is being described as a ""reprogramming"" of some funds to Egypt. In effect, Washington is temporarily holding up some assistance as it prepares for the possibility future help could be cut. That official emphasized no decision has been made to permanently halt assistance and the administration would consult with Congress before deciding how to proceed once its review is completed. But Earnest said the term ""reprogramming"" is not correct, and that the current approach is partly designed to ""preserve some flexibility"" so that the review can give President Barack Obama a ""range of options"" once it's finished. ""I think that would probably be maybe a more accurate way of describing this,"" he said. What it means . The situation is an enormously sensitive matter, seeing that Egypt is a key ally at peace with Israel and a strategic lynchpin in the volatile Middle East. If the United States were to designate the military's ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy a ""coup,"" it would have to cancel aid and couldn't restore it until a democratic government is established. So far, it hasn't applied that designation, but stepped up clashes over the past week between security forces and pro-Morsy demonstrators that have killed 900 people has heightened pressure to take stronger action. Egyptian security forces may have upped the ante on Tuesday by arresting Mohamed Badie, a spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, the long-repressed political movement that propelled Morsy to office. State-run Nile TV said Badie is accused of inciting violence. But if Washington continues with its current approach, it can withhold aid as long as it thinks doing so would be in its best interest. The United States could restore the aid without needing a legal determination that a democratic government has returned. If, for example, Egypt stops the bloodshed, the aid could quickly resume. Earnest said on Monday the purpose of the review is to determine the potential impact on U.S. national security, whether the law is being followed and what will result in the ""kind of outcome"" that the United States is pressing for, a prompt return to a democratically elected civilian leadership. He said U.S. involvement extends beyond a military relationship and includes influence at the International Monetary Fund as well as on tourism. Billions in aid on the line: What will the U.S. do? 'Damned if you do...' More than half of Americans in a new poll believe the United States should halt military aid. But the situation is complex. ""The United States is kind of in a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation,"" said Tarek Radwan, associate director for research at the Atlantic Council. Analyst Jon Alterman said the issue centers on what Washington wants to accomplish. ""If you are trying to change the decision-making process of the Egyptian military -- that is very hard to do right now because they believe they are locked in an existential struggle,"" said Alterman, Middle East program director at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. ""If what you are trying to do is demonstrate our resolve to the rest of the world and people looking on, that is another issue."" But the aid isn't one-sided. The United States has been granted preferential use of the Suez Canal -- an economic hub that connects the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. It also has overflight rights, which gives the U.S. military the ability to fly over Egypt on the way to bases in the region. Will cutting aid do anything? Cutting aid will probably not accomplish much, some experts say -- particularly because Saudi Arabia has said it would consider matching the U.S. assistance if the Obama administration decides to cut it. ""Our Congress is not about to compete with that amount of money in Egypt,"" said Isobel Coleman, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""(The Saudis) have deep pockets, and they are ready to put them in Egypt's disposal."" But Radwan said there could be a net effect. If the United States diversifies its engagement with Egypt, ""not only the Obama administration, but any administration after would have for more policy flexibility,"" he said. CNN's Chris Lawrence, Dan Merica, Kevin Bohn and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Congressional office said the United States has halted military aid to Egypt .
White House said some aid stopped, but it cannot be turned on and off like a faucet .
Obama spokesman said review of aid to Egypt ongoing; no decisions made on future assistance .

"(ELLE DECOR) -- When Amy Mellen set out in search of a weekend house 15 years ago, what she wanted was a place to see and be seenâ€”by crickets, sparrows, coyotes, and frogs, as well as by a few dear friends. ELLE DECOR: 14 one-of-a-kind fireplaces . To Mellen, already a rising star in the design world at the time, weekends were a chance to recharge her creative batteries. And for that, nothing worked as powerfully as time spent outdoors, which meant that a quiet corner of Dutchess County, in upstate New York, was a better setting for her downtime than, say, the Ã¼ber-social Hamptons. ELLE DECOR: 9 rooms with awe-inspiring views . ""I love, love, love being outside,"" she says. ""I take inspiration constantly from things I see in nature."" ELLE DECOR: 8 most unique homes you can rent on airbnb . Today Mellen is the creative director for Calvin Klein Home; as such, she oversees nine different product categories encompassing everything from teacups to sofas. Yet she still trades in her leather pumps for Blundstone work boots every Friday evening before heading north to the cottage that captured her heart. ELLE DECOR: 7 inspiring bathroom makeovers . She remembers the first time she saw it: ""The Realtor and I drove up the drivewayâ€”it's really long and goes over a stream, and all the trees were weighed down with snow. It was so tucked back; we were like, 'This has to be a mistake.' Inside, the owners had left a fire going in the fireplace. I fell in love with the place immediately."" ELLE DECOR: Here's the newest surprising 'it' color to decorate with . She also fell for the sellers themselves, an older couple who had lived in the house since it was first built as a fishing cabin in the 1960s, and had painstakingly cared for it ever since. ""They had records for everything: how much they'd paid, every repair, every warranty. And all the tools in the shed were meticulously labeled: 'potato hoe,' 'garden hoe.'"" When they moved out, they left her a canoe, a lawn mower, and a sense of reverence for the spirit of the place. ELLE DECOR: You know your decorating style is preppy when ... ""I told them, 'I'll never touch anything,'"" says Mellen. And for a long time, she kept her word. But Mellen's creativity, it turns out, is not just a contemplative or reactive practice. She creates. Constantly. Gradually she began making the house her own, installing windows in the back rooms and painting the walls, which were paneled in dark, knotty pine. She planted a garden and, because she longed for a new porch, got out a shovel and dug the foundation for it herself, then used the rocks she'd unearthed to make a stone wall. And when a cherry tree started encroaching on the house and had to be cut down, she had the wood milled and used it to make her dining room table. An ash tree, meanwhile, became paneling for the bathroom walls. Finally, two years ago, she undertook a major renovation. Even then, her motivation was practical as much as it was aesthetic. ""There was frost on the bedroom windows in the wintertime,"" she says. ""It wasn't energy efficient. And if you took a bath, you ran out of hot water."" She built a studio onto the garage, and outfitted it with a potter's wheel and supplies to paint and dye fabrics. The kitchen, meanwhile, needed a deeper rethinking. ""The cabinets had scallop edges,"" she says. ""Plus it was small, and I love to cook. I entertain a lot."" Indeed, Mellen is known for exotic meals inspired by her frequent travels. ""My friends joke that I could make food from any country just from what's in my pantry,"" she says. The influence of her international travels is evident beyond the pantry as well. All over the house are objects and furnishings Mellen acquired abroad, including rugs from Morocco, copper faucets from Italy, a set of nesting tables from England (made of elm, ""they're incredibly fragrant,"" she says), and a mirrored panel from India. Interspersed throughout are numerous pieces from the Calvin Klein Home collections, which, despite the company's reputation for austere minimalism, blend happily into the eclectic, rustic mix. ""Our furniture is modern, but not super--hard-edged modern,"" says Mellen. ""The materials and finishes make it warm. ""One of my philosophies at Calvin Klein is: You can't really expect someone to go out and buy all brand-new matching furniture,"" she continues. ""Everyone has heirlooms or meaningful pieces with journeys and stories behind them. You want to be able to mix them with what is new and modern."" At Mellen's house, that mix is constantly changing in small and subtle ways. ""I'm always making little vignettes out of things I find,"" she says. ""Last weekend, I found a dead beetle and set it on top of a rock. I'll have that next to a bird's nest that blew out of a tree, and a feather that I found in the yard."" Creating keeps her happy; it always has. ""When I was little, I had a dollhouse I made myself,"" she says. ""And I loved decorating it. I was always working on it. Then my parents bought me a really swanky new dollhouse, and it wasn't as fun."" Collecting, building, designing, inventing, and playing in the woods: ""All the stuff that kids do,"" she says. ""I just made a career out of it."" Reprinted with permission of Hearst Communications, Inc.","A rustic retreat got a modern makeover from a Calvin Klein exec .

"(CNN) -- ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"" is an aphorism attributed to the great baseball player Yogi Berra. But one topic where pundits, politicians and prognosticators of every persuasion don't have any problem about making pessimistic predictions is terrorism. The Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was an Olympic-level example of this. In the lead-up to the Games, the airwaves were filled with glum predictions that Sochi would be the 1972 Munich Olympics on steroids. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News, ""There's a high degree of probability that something will detonate, something will go off. ... But I do think it's probably, most likely going to happen outside the 'ring of steel' at the Olympic Village."" Similarly, Michael G. Grimm, co-chair of the House Russian Caucus, issued a press release headlined, ""Sochi Olympics Cannot Become a Benghazi Nightmare."" The New York Republican warned, ""We cannot sweep these threats under the rug, like we did with Benghazi or the warnings from Russia on the Tsarnaev brother behind the Boston Marathon bombing. Each time we fail to recognize these threats, we not only risk the lives of innocent Americans, but appear weaker and vulnerable in the eyes of the enemy."" Bill Rathburn, who directed security for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, in an interview with Yahoo News predicted of Sochi, ""It's not a matter of whether there will be some incident, it's just a matter of how bad it's going to be."" No wonder that two days before the Sochi Olympics, more than half of Americans believed a terrorist attack on the Games was likely, according to a CNN/ORC poll. Now cue up the swarms of ""black widows"" descending on Sochi to kill themselves along with many Olympic spectators. And then the Games were held and ... nothing happened . It turned out that the most terrifying image from Sochi was the look of disgust on the face of American figure skater Ashley Wagner when she learned of her lower-than-expected score. Sochi is only the most recent example of the hyperventilating hyperbole of the doomsday terrorism prognosticators. Because so many folks were caught flat-footed by 9/11, some seem to overcompensate by keeping up a steady drumbeat of dire terror warnings. In November, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told CNN that al Qaeda ""poses a bigger threat to attack inside the U.S. right now than it did before 9/11."" Rogers' statement defies common sense. Before 9/11, al Qaeda had an entire county, Afghanistan, as a safe haven; its training camps there churned out thousands of militants every year; it had access to funding substantial enough so that it could spend several hundred thousand dollars on the 9/11 plot. It was a formidable enemy. Now al Qaeda's safe haven is long gone; the group hasn't mounted any successful attack in the States since 9/11 or, for that matter, anywhere in the West since the London transportation system bombings in 2005. On 9/11, the United States had never used armed drones in combat. Since then, the CIA has launched 370 drone strikes at suspected militant targets in Pakistan. During President Barack Obama's tenure alone, those drone strikes have killed more than 30 of al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan. Not only that: The United States is a much harder target than it was on 9/11. Then there were 16 people on the U.S. ""no fly"" list. Today there are more than 20,000. In 2001, there were 32 Joint Terrorism Task Force ""fusion centers,"" where multiple law enforcement agencies worked together to chase down leads and build terrorism cases. Now there are 103. The U.S. intelligence budget also grew dramatically after 9/11. In 2010, the United States spent more than $80 billion on intelligence collection and other covert activities, much of it directed at terrorist groups -- more than three times what the country spent in 1998. At the time of the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Transportation Security Administration all didn't exist. All these new post-9/11 institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the United States. The gloom and doom about terrorism becomes much worse when the specter of terrorists deploying chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons is added to the mix. Graham Allison, the respected political scientist and founding dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, published a book in 2004 titled ""Nuclear Terrorism, which garnered considerable attention with its prediction that ""on the current path, a nuclear terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than not."" Of course, now we are a decade later, and nothing of the sort has happened. Indeed, a striking finding of a database of every jihadist terrorism case in the United States since 9/11 maintained by the New America Foundation is that not one of the more than 200 individuals who were indicted or convicted of a jihadist terrorism crime acquired, manufactured or deployed chemical, biological or radiological weapons, let alone a nuclear device. It's relatively easy to say the sky is always falling. Indeed, given the human capacity for evil, bad things are, indeed, going to happen. But when the sky doesn't fall, which is much of the time when it comes to terrorism, the doomsday prognosticators are rarely held to account. In any event, they are too busy warning of the next catastrophe.","Before Sochi Olympics, predictions of terrorist action were rampant .

"(CNN) -- Ugandan health officials are declaring the country free of an Ebola outbreak blamed for 17 deaths since late July. The last patient with a confirmed infection was released on August 24, the World Health Organization said in a statement. ""WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Uganda with respect to this event,"" it said. The outbreak's initial confirmation at a hospital in the western town of Kagadi sent patients fleeing and the facility scrambling to contact those who may have had the disease. In a separate incident, a convict brought to the hospital on suspicion of an infection escaped. Less than a third of the outbreak's ""24 probable and confirmed cases"" survived, according to the WHO. More than 350 people were isolated for testing on suspicion of having the disease. Ebola is caused by a highly infectious virus that spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, a measles-like rash, red eyes and, at times, bleeding from body openings. Initial symptoms of Ebola can be mistaken for other illnesses such as the flu. The Ebola virus was first detected in 1976 in the central African nation of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Uganda's neighbor to the west. The virus is named after a river in that country, where the first outbreak of the disease was found. At least 10 people died in a separate Ebola outbreak in late August in the Democratic Republic of Congo.","17 people died in Uganda's Ebola outbreak .

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government will recognize gay marriages in Michigan that occurred between recent conflicting court rulings, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Friday. Holder's statement said couples married on March 22, before an appellate court blocked a previous ruling allowing gay marriage in Michigan, ""will be eligible for all relevant federal benefits on the same terms as other same-sex marriages."" His decision is the latest move by the Obama administration toward legalizing gay marriage in the United States. The divisive issue pits social and religious conservatives against liberals and moderates, with polls showing a majority of Americans in support of gay marriage. On March 21, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman struck down Michigan's gay marriage ban as unconstitutional. His ruling cleared the way for same-sex couples to marry immediately, and scores did the next day until the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order to temporarily stay, or put on hold, Friedman's decision. The same appeals court extended its stay on Tuesday, causing confusion over the status of the couples married over the previous weekend. Holder noted that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder ""has made clear that the marriages that took place on Saturday were lawful and valid when entered into, although Michigan will not extend state rights and benefits tied to these marriages pending further legal proceedings."" ""For purposes of federal law ... these Michigan couples will not be asked to wait for further resolution in the courts before they may seek federal benefits to which they are entitled,"" Holder said, citing a previous decision in a similar situation in Utah. Voters in Utah, Michigan and nine other states passed constitutional amendments in 2004 defining marriage as one man and one woman. Friedman's ruling was the latest in a series of recent similar decisions affecting marriage restrictions in states including Texas, Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma. In most of those cases, the judicial orders did not take effect immediately. However, Michigan's did and, as in Utah, same-sex couples immediately got marriage licenses before later court decisions halted such unions -- at least for now, as higher courts weigh in. Last June, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision that rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits.","After a court ruling, scores of same-sex marriages occurred in Michigan .

"(CNN) -- If this is one of the perks of being a crooked stockbroker, then perhaps it's not such a bad career choice after all -- just ask Leonardo DiCaprio. Champagne flute in one hand, lobster in the other, the Hollywood actor was the picture of outrageous excess when he played the lead role in Martin Scorsese's ""Wolf of Wall Street."" And the jewel in his corrupt crown? A 45-meter superyacht called Nadine. But the high life isn't just for the cinema screen. In fact, you could be sailing the seas on the very same boat that appeared in the Oscar-nominated film -- if you can stump up $125,000 a week to charter her. Featuring a hot tub, cocktail bar and enough bedrooms to accommodate 10 guests, the lavish vessel -- called Lady M -- was used to depict the real-life yacht owned by infamous stockbroker Jordan Belfort. In the real world, Nadine sank in 1997 after Belfort ordered the captain to sail her into a storm off the coast of Italy, while supposedly high on drugs. But if you want to retrace DiCaprio's ostentatious footsteps -- without the near-death experience -- you can now charter the yacht, which will tour the Bahamas from April. Star struck . Why would someone fork out hundreds of thousands of dollars to rent such a vessel? ""I imagine it's much like being in the presence of the actual movie star -- you will get to sit where they did, walk where they did, maybe even look at memorabilia if the crew were allowed to take pictures,"" says Nicci Perides, editor of search site Charterfleet.com, which features Lady M and other film boats. ""It adds something extra special to that charter. I guess it's similar to how restaurants that are frequented by A-listers are always very popular with us mere mortals."" From Daniel Craig to Demi Moore . Of course, Lady M isn't the only big-screen vessel available for hire. Fancy cruising the high seas like James Bond on a mission to save the world? Elegant 56-meter Regina -- which Daniel Craig sailed in 2012 film ""Skyfall"" -- could be yours for a mere $96,000 a week. Then there's Big Eagle, the 52-meter yacht on which Demi Moore performed a tabletop striptease for Burt Reynolds in the 1996 film aptly titled ""Striptease."" What goes on in Big Eagle, stays on Big Eagle, particularly if you're paying $165,000 per week to charter it. An African Queen . If you're looking for a big-screen boat, without the big price, then look no further than the African Queen. The rickety steamboat ferried film legends Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart down the Congo in the 1951 classic, ""The African Queen."" The ramshackle eight-meter wooden vessel was saved from the scrapyard almost a decade ago, and now attracts film buffs from across the U.S. for joy trips at the more reasonable price of $49. ""People will drive eight hours to get here, just to ride her. They'll go out in rain, thunderstorms. They're just so desperate to go on-board,"" says co-owner Suzanne Holmquist, who runs river cruises in Key Largo, Florida. ""A lot of people say it was the first movie they ever saw in theaters, so the boat means a lot, to a lot of people. I think she's as much a star of the film as Bogart was."" Lights, Camera, Action . But before a yacht even graces the big screen, it needs a dedicated team of cameramen to brave the elements. For Superyacht Media creative director Jeff Brown, that often means hanging out of a helicopter to get the perfect shot. ""To get the best aerial shots you need a good pilot, it's very important. The more they understand the shot I'm after and know how to maneuver the helicopter, that really helps,"" he says. ""There are not many restrictions, other than your imagination."" And much like the ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" it seems the only restriction to living out your cinematic sailing dream is how much you're willing to pay. See: Introducing the word's biggest superyacht .

"(CNN) -- As nearly 600 days under siege sap the life and dignity out of the Old District in the Syrian city of Homs -- leaving malnourished men with legs like noodles and soot-stained children to dig through homes turned into rubble for bits of firewood -- diplomats in a picturesque Swiss city bicker over aid. ""The situation is unbearable and inhuman. Food, there is none. Medical supplies, there is none. Milk for children, there is none. It is beyond words."" Mohammed Abu Yahay tells CNN through a crackly Skype connection. Diplomats at the Geneva II peace negotiations in the Swiss city reached a yet to be executed deal to evacuate some women and children, according to United Nations mediator Lakhdar Brahimi, but for those affected, the meek agreement is little more than a consolation prize. ''We will fill our stomach with stones. We don't want to eat. We do not want your food or your aid supplies. We want to break the siege. There is nothing here anymore!'' an angry resident yells in one of several social media videos posted online this week by activists hoping to draw attention to their plight. The Geneva peace talks seemed to matter little to residents living on perpetually empty bellies who demanded all parties put aside their differences to break the almost two-year siege of Homs rather than agree to a temporary solution from a reluctant regime. ''We ask Geneva to break the siege and make us safe roads and get us out of here. I need an urgent operation on my leg. ... We have been around one year and eight months under the siege, and also we don't want Ban Ki-moon ... to be worried about us anymore. They have been worrying for more than a year and seven months. Poor them,'' an elderly man with crutches sarcastically says in a video posted on social media websites. The International Committee of the Red Cross also urged more action, saying that while the aid organization welcomes the agreement to evacuate women and children from the Old City, ""a one-shot evacuation will not solve all the problems on the ground,"" adding that ""it is very crucial to allow impartial humanitarian aid into Homs,"" Dibeh Fakhr, an ICRC spokesman, told CNN Monday. The appeals appeared to fall on deaf ears, as the opposition Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian government delegation complained to the media Monday about the failures of the other party. Inside Syria's most dangerous city . The United States blamed the Syrian government for the dire situation, accusing it of waging a ""kneel or starve campaign."" ""The regime is blocking all convoys of aid to Homs, and has been doing so for months. The U.N. with the Red Cross has been trying to get aid these aid convoys through to the city of Homs; the regime is blocking it. The situation is extremely urgent. Anything the regime says to the contrary is wrong,"" a senior U.S. official told CNN. As the bitter winter cold retains its hold on the restive city, activists and residents say starvation and the lack of basic medical care claim lives regularly as Syrian troops and some opposition forces prevent the delivery of aid, according to a report from Human Rights Watch last month. ""Protein, all types of vitamins, vegetables, fruits -- all this is has been extremely scarce over the past eight to 10 months. So for children above the age of 2 and the elderly above 60, they are most vulnerable to the symptoms of malnutrition, and this is where we see the highest rates of mortality."" Dr. Mashwan Abo Abdu a neurologist residing in the Old City told CNN. Tree leaves, grass, olives and stale grain are all that's on the menu at many homes in the old districts of Homs, where many residents say they struggle to get just one meal a day on the table while loved ones with preventable diseases languish in a makeshift medical clinic with ""medieval health care."" ""The world must help us; they can't watch us drown in a sea of suffering, pain and death and do nothing after more than one and a half years of being under siege"" the Rev. Frans, a Dutch Jesuit and longtime Syrian resident, said in broken Arabic on social media. Months after the start of an uprising against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, the western city and once-thriving industrial center gave birth to an armed rebellion. That triggered a brutal Syrian troop bombardment in what human rights groups called an act of collective punishment on the city. Over the course of several months, Syrian forces, backed by Hezbollah militants, moved in on the so-called capital of the revolution. They pushed insurgents out of one neighborhood after another until troops established a chokehold around the neighborhoods of Old Homs, separating the district from the Khalidiya area and wresting control of the strategic border city of al-Qusayr. The approximately 3,000 people left behind suffered in silence for months without a single international aid convoy or international observer breaching the siege as food and medical stores dwindled along with the calcium in children's bones, the milk in mothers' breasts, and the protein in fathers' muscles. ""I have personally seen so many infants die due to lack of adequate treatment or professional care because we have no pediatricians, incubators, or obstetricians. So from the moment a child is conceived, they suffer under this siege,"" said Dr. Abo Ramez, who along with colleagues, issued a list of needed medical supplies to the international community, including powdered milk for infants and vials of electrolytes. In the gray ruins of the Old City, a simple fall may shatter a child's thin, malnourished bones, and stunted toddlers smile with teeth blackened by decay as they play hide-and-seek. Doctors tell CNN that without intervention from the international community, ""more people will die."" ""I think that there is a lack of pressure from the international community on the barbaric regime. It is inhuman that they are fighting us over a loaf of bread. Cutting of water, electricity, and preventing any aid organization from entering. This situation reflects poorly on the international community to help these besieged areas,"" Ramez said.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- As three Malaysia Airlines executives and their interpreter looked on with stoic faces, a Chinese man in his 50s yelled: ""Time's flying and you need to search for the people!"" before wailing uncontrollably. The man's son was on Flight MH370 -- still missing after the Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 jet disappeared from radar screens early Saturday morning, not long after it took off from Kuala Lumpur's international airport. As their agonizing wait enters day four, family and friends of the 227 passengers on board -- of whom 153 were from mainland China -- have become increasingly frustrated and angry, especially those who have been holed up in the Lido Hotel, a short drive from Beijing's Capital International Airport. The bawling man broke down in the middle of a Malaysia Airlines briefing for the passengers' relatives. He demanded to know why he could hear his son's mobile phone ring when dialing the number, even as search and rescue crews continued to return empty handed. Several other Chinese passengers' mobile phones were still connecting but going unanswered, state media has quoted their families as saying. Some experts have attributed this to the configuration of call-forwarding service by certain phone carriers, but their opinion has little sway on the crowd at Lido. Four possible scenarios . Continuous coverage . Most relatives of passengers spend their waking hours in the hotel's ballroom, where Malaysia Airlines has established a support center. Journalists are not officially allowed to enter, but some manage to quietly walk in. Different Chinese dialects resonate in the room as people exchange information and plans, with others glued to television screens broadcasting continuous coverage on the missing plane from local channels. Food, snacks and bottled water are laid out on tables, as Buddhist volunteers from Taiwan hand out fruit, remind people to eat properly and offer warm hugs. Staff behind desks help those applying for Chinese passports and Malaysian visas, with an ID photo booth set up in the corner. The seemingly calm air was punctuated by the cry of pain and desperation Tuesday afternoon. A woman suddenly screamed, prompting her family to rush to her side. ""You need to stay healthy -- it's no good if he comes back and sees you like this, right?"" A young man comforted the woman, as her husband sobbed next to her. ""You're right,"" said the woman, wiping her tears and nodding. Who were the mystery men on the flight? 'Sincere attitude' The atmosphere in the room turned contentious as Malaysia Airlines representatives walked in for the briefing. The carrier's offer of $5,000 immediate financial assistance to each family member was met with boos in the audience. Many in the crowd vented their dissatisfaction with the airline, calling its updates infrequent and its assistance inadequate. They voiced frustration of being kept in the dark and suspicion over the motive of the airline's money offer. ""I hope you treat us with a sincere attitude, otherwise there will be serious consequences!"" declared a relative in a black shirt. ""Yes!"" others shouted in unison. The man in black then laid down five demands for the airline, including a 24/7 coordinator for passenger families, more flexibility on the relatives' travel to Kuala Lumpur and a meeting with Malaysian government officials. ""We're trying to deliver with limited resources,"" said Ignatius Ong, a senior executive with Malaysia Airlines, pledging a thorough review of the family demands. ""My personal apologies to everyone here, but I ask you to support us."" ""Please,"" he added.","Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared from radar screens early March 8 .

"(CNN) -- Swedish tennis legend Bjorn Borg has been credited with changing how the modern game is played. In this month's Open Court program, Borg sits down with fellow-Wimbledon champion Pat Cash to discuss his life and the impact he had on tennis in Sweden and the world in general. Borg's domination in the 1970s left a long-standing legacy in Swedish tennis, carried on by Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg -- with Robin Soderling flying the flag for the nation in the present day. But it wasn't just Borg's success that inspired a generation and a nation -- his use of the double-handed backhand shot had never been seen before, and was to change the way tennis was played from then on. ""Basically I started playing double handed on both my forehand and backhand side because my first racket was very heavy,"" said Borg. ""Those old wooden rackets were heavy which is the reason why a lot of people started playing double-handed, for instance Connors and Chris Evert. ""The difference with my backhand was that I was playing it with top spin which was something of a revolution. People kept telling me I couldn't play them top spin and had to play the shots flat,"" Borg added. ""I remember a guy once gave me a book on tennis and said 'read this, it shows you how you are supposed to play' -- but you know I am a bit stubborn and did not listen, so I carried on playing my backhand with top spin and that is how the whole thing started."" Wilander, himself a winner of seven grand slam titles, told Open Court that Borg's success, and the way he played, directly contributed to Sweden's subsequent production line of great players. ""The reason why Sweden has had so many great players is because of Borg. We saw the success he had and we decided to copy his style,"" said Wilander. ""Other players were stuck in the 1960s and 1970s with an old fashioned way of playing and we were lucky to come into tennis at that time."" Although Borg's unique double-handed backhanded helped make him the world greatest player, the 55-year-old -- a winner of six French Open titles and five Wimbledon crowns -- credits his first coach, Percy Rosburg, with turning him into a top player. ""When it comes to technique, nobody has more knowledge in the whole of Sweden than Percy,"" continued Borg. ""He can see immediately what kind of problem you have, or what you are supposed to do, and rectify it. ""He was the Swedish national coach when he came to my hometown, which was a real big deal back then. He told me that I had some potential and he was the person who took me to Stockholm to launch my career."" But it was not just Borg's style of play that made him so successful, the Swede also became the first player in the modern era to be able to switch from the slow clay of Paris to the grass courts of London with almost seamless transition, a skill he puts down to the Swedish climate. Borg continued: ""You know growing up in Sweden meant we had a lot of rain when we played tennis. We were taught on clay courts but because of the weather, we had to go indoors a lot. ""Those indoor courts were very fast and that is how I learned to play on grass, even though clay was certainly my favorite surface. ""At the beginning people would say about me, 'oh this guy will never be able to play good on grass because it is so different'. But I improved and learned how to adapt."" Many experts believe Borg was the greatest player of all time, winning 11 grand slams despite retiring aged just 25. At the time, Borg's decision to quit tennis while he was at the top of his game caused controversy, but the man himself has no regrets and still feels he made the right choice. ""I was very young when I stepped away from the game and if I had played another five more years I am sure I would have won more tournaments -- but we can only speculate about that,"" added Borg. ""I had great rivalries back then, with people like Connors and McEnroe, but off the court we really respected each other and when I quit John kept on ringing me to say 'I don't understand what you are doing'. ""In the end, I just had to tell him to stop ringing me, because I wasn't going to change my mind,"" said Borg. ""I had just had enough and I lost the motivation to play. Even If you just lose even a little bit of your motivation, it's very difficult to carry on playing. ""It came to a point when I didn't care if I was winning or losing -- and if you get to that situation then something is seriously wrong.""","Bjorn Borg led the way for Swedish players to become a success in the game .

"(CNN) -- Your tax dollars that fund Medicare may be going toward excessive amounts of name-brand drugs when cheaper generics could be prescribed instead, a new report suggests. A small portion of doctors nationwide is costing American taxpayers big time because of their tendency to prescribe name-brand medications through Medicare even when generics are available, according to an analysis by ProPublica, a nonprofit organization producing ""investigative journalism in the public interest."" The biggest offenders are 913 practitioners who, thanks to disproportionately prescribing name-brand drugs, cost taxpayers an extra $300 million in 2011, say ProPublica's Charles Ornstein, Tracy Weber and Jennifer LaFleur. Each of these doctors wrote at least 5,000 prescriptions that year, according to the report. Many of these doctors also had financial ties to the companies that manufacture the drugs they prescribed, ProPublica reports, and have accepted thousands of dollars from drug companies in the form of promotional or consulting fees. Although Medicare's drug program has been considered an achievement in government health care, ""this seeming fiscal success has hidden billions of dollars lost to unnecessarily expensive prescribing over the program's eight-year history,"" the report said. The detriments of Part D . Part of the wasted money results from well-intended aspects of Medicare. A provision called Part D, which has given individuals with low incomes access to cheap medications, has at the same time enabled doctors to prescribe name-brand drugs without complaint from low-income patients, ProPublica said. Regardless of the medication's cost, Part D allows patients to pay less than $7 per prescription if they have low incomes. The lack of incentives for cheaper drugs for low-income patients is an important point raised by the report, said Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economics professor who was not involved in the study. Insurance companies can use financial incentives to sway participants who are not impoverished toward generic coverage, Gruber said, which has generally prompted a shift toward lower-cost generic coverage. But low-income populations are covered by the subsidy, which caps what they pay for prescriptions anyway, so there aren't financial incentives for the use of generics. ""Medicare needs to find a different way to monitor prescribing patterns and lower costs for this population,"" Gruber said in an e-mail. Part D cost taxpayers $62 billion last year, and more than a third of that went toward this low-income subsidy, ProPublica reported. More than 11 million people receive the subsidy. The ProPublica piece pointed to an analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, which reports to Congress on Medicare, showing that Medicare could save $1.3 billion a year in seven drug categories if generics were prescribed to low-income patients and other Medicare enrollees in the same proportion. The savings might be even more, to the tune of $44 billion in a decade, according to the Washington think tank Bipartisan Policy Center. Medicare pays for one in four prescriptions in the United States, ProPublica said, but it does not limit the name-brand drugs that physicians can prescribe. Who are the doctors prescribing so many name-brand medications? ProPublica found some patterns in ethnic neighborhoods and areas around large cities. For instance, a stretch of Koreatown in Los Angeles has seven of the doctors with high rates of name-brand prescribing, and a building in Brooklyn with six such doctors is in a Russian community. The ""average cost of a Part D prescription in these enclaves can be more than 50 percent higher than that of surrounding areas,"" ProPublica said. A challenge for the medical community . The report's findings about money wasted on brand-name drugs aren't too surprising, said Dr. Tara Bishop, assistant professor of public health and medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. ""I think that there's a lot of marketing and misconceptions about how good is the newest, latest drug for which there's not a generic alternative,"" said Bishop, who was not involved with the ProPublica report. There are few instances where brand-name drugs are superior to their generic alternative, Bishop said. She could not think of a specific example. ""By and large, if there is a generic, it should be prescribed,"" she said. There are some efforts already in place toward addressing the problem. For instance, the way Bishop's electronic health records are set up, when she enters a medication into her system, a generic gets automatically prescribed if one is available. She also noted that sometimes pharmacies will give patients the generic version of a drug even if the brand name has been prescribed unless the physician has specified otherwise. There are also drugs that have no generic equivalent, Bishop noted. But for those that do have generic alternatives, marketing efforts are generally stronger for the brand-name versions. ""Many of us who practice medicine and know about the issues of rising health care costs, know that we spend a lot on brand-name medications when we don't necessarily need to,"" she said. ""This is an interesting study because it quantifies it with a very small group of doctors."" Variations in prescriptions for brand-name drugs have been on the radar of many insurance companies and health care researchers, Bishop said. They should look at the issues presented in the ProPublica report to help control rising health care costs, she said. Why some doctors continue prescribing brand-name versions of drugs that have generic equivalents is an important question, she said. ""That's a question that the medical community has to come to terms with,"" she said. ""Are we not being good stewards of the resources that are available by prescribing things that could have cheaper, as effective alternatives?""","ProPublica report: Hundreds of millions of dollars wasted on name-brand drugs .

"New York (CNN) -- In the wake of the failed Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Flight 253, authorities are ramping up air passenger screening, particularly for those flying from 14 nations that the U.S. describes as ""state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest."" Hundreds more full body scanning machines are on order for U.S. airports. But some airline security experts say the real answer to greater security is to follow the approach used by Israel's airline, El Al. Isaac Yeffet, the former head of security for El Al and now an aviation security consultant in New York, said El Al has prevented terrorism in the air by making sure every passenger is interviewed by a well-trained agent before check-in. ""Stop relying only on technology,"" Yeffet told CNN. ""Technology can help the qualified, well-trained human being but cannot replace him."" Yeffet spoke to CNN Friday. CNN: What do you think we've learned about airport security from the failed bombing in Detroit? Isaac Yeffet: We learned one thing. We do not have a good security system to be able to prevent tragedies in this country. After Lockerbie, everyone thought, now we've learned the lesson of how to be proactive instead of being reactive. Unfortunately, September 11 came and we know the result. Thousands of people lost their lives. Security totally failed, not at one airport, at three different airports around the country. In 2002, we had Richard Reid, the shoe bomber. This man gave the security people all the suspicious signs that any passenger could show. The man got a British passport in Belgium, not in England. Number Two: he flew to Paris, he bought a one-way ticket from Paris to Florida. He paid cash. He came to the airport with no luggage. What else do I need to know that this passenger is suspicious? What did we learn from this? Just to tell the passenger from now on, you take off your shoes when you come to the airport? This I call a patch on top of a patch. Now we face the story with [Umar Farouk] AbdulMutallab. We had all the information that we could dream the security people could get. He was on the list of people connected to al Qaeda. I don't need more to understand that when he comes, I am not looking for more evidence. He is suspicious; I have to take care of him. His father called the U.S. Embassy a month before he took the flight and told the U.S. Embassy that his son had called and said this was the last time you were going to hear from me. And the father warned the U.S. Embassy that his son was going to do something bad, watch him. What happened to this information? The guy bought a ticket and paid $3,000 cash. ... No one knew the information that we had about him, no one could interview him and to ask him why is he flying to America. CNN: What needs to be done to improve the system? Yeffet: It's mandatory that every passenger -- I don't care his religion or whatever he is -- every passenger has to be interviewed by security people who are qualified and well-trained, and are being tested all year long. I trained my guys and educated them, that every flight, for them, is the first flight. That every passenger is the first passenger. The fact that you had [safe flights] yesterday and last month means nothing. We are looking for the one who is coming to blow up our aircraft. If you do not look at each passenger, something is wrong with your system. CNN: What is El Al's approach to airline security? How does it differ from what's being done in this country? Yeffett: We must look at the qualifications of the candidate for security jobs. He must be educated. He must speak two languages. He must be trained for a long time, in classrooms. He must receive on-the-job training with a supervisor for weeks to make sure that the guy understands how to approach a passenger, how to convince him to cooperate with him, because the passenger is taking the flight and we are on the ground. The passengers have to understand that the security is doing it for their benefit. We are constantly in touch with the Israeli intelligence to find out if there are any suspicious passengers among hundreds of passengers coming to take the flight -- by getting the list of passengers for each flight and comparing it with the suspicious list that we have. If one of the passengers is on the list, then we are waiting for him, he will not surprise us. During the year, we did thousands of tests of our security guys around the world. It cost money, but once you save lives, it's worth all the money that the government gave us to have the right security system. I used to send a male or female that we trusted. We used to give them tickets and send them to an airport to take a flight to Tel Aviv. We concealed whatever we could in their luggage. Everything was fake, and we wanted to find out if the security people would stop this passenger or not. If there was any failure, the security people immediately were fired, and we called in all the security people to tell people why they failed, what happened step by step. I wanted everyone to learn from any failure. And if they were very successful, I wanted everyone to know why. CNN: Let's say all the airlines instituted the system that you're talking about. So let's say I go to an airport for a flight to London. What should happen? Yeffet: When you come to the check-in, normally you wait on line. While you wait on line, I want you to be with your luggage. You have to meet with me, the security guy. We tell you who we are. We ask for your passport, we ask for your ticket. We check your passport. We want to find which countries you visited. We start to ask questions, and based on your answers and the way you behave, we come to a conclusion about whether you are bona fide or not. That's what should happen. CNN: Every passenger should be interviewed, on all flights? Yeffet: Yes, 100 percent... I want to interview you. It won't take too long if you're bona fide. We never had a delay. Number two, I have heard so many times El Al is a small airline. We in America are big air carriers. Number one, we have over 400 airports around the country, why hasn't anyone from this government asked himself, let's take one airport out of 400 airports and try to implement El Al's system because their system proved they're the best of the best. For the last 40 years, El Al did not have a single tragedy. And they came to attack us and to blow up our aircraft, but we knew how to stop them on the ground. So let's try to implement the system at one airport in the country and then come to a conclusion... CNN: What do you think of using full body scanners? Yeffet: I am against it, this is once again patch on top of patch. Look what happened, Richard Reid, the shoebomber, hid the explosives in his shoes. The result -- all of us have to take off our shoes when we come to the airport. The Nigerian guy hid his explosives in his underwear. The result -- everyone now will be seen naked. Is this the security system that we want? We have millions of Muslims in this country. I am not Muslim, but I am very familiar with the tradition, I respect the tradition. Women who walk on the street cover their body from head to toe. Can you imagine the reaction of the husband? Excuse me, wait on the side, we want to see your wife's body naked?... This is not an answer. I appreciate what the president said, but we need to see the results on the ground at the airports. ... I strongly recommend that TSA call experts ... and not let them leave before they come to conclusions about what must be done at each airport to make sure that we are really pro-active. Let us be alert, let us work together, and show no mercy for any failure, no mercy. If we do this system, believe me we will show the world that we are the best proactive security system and the terrorists will understand that it's not worth it to come to attack us. CNN: Would it be more expensive to provide the kind of security system you recommend? Yeffet: For sure El Al spends more money on security than the American air carriers. But the passengers are willing to pay for it if we can prove to them that they are secure when they come to take a flight.","U.S. authorities have stepped up airport screening after failed Christmas Day attack .

"(CNN) -- A Las Vegas cabbie had no second thoughts when he found $300,000 in cash in a brown paper bag in his cab this week. He made sure it was returned to the forgetful owner. ""I don't care from $10 to higher. My dignity is not for sale, and that's the way I am. That's the way our parents taught us when I was a kid,"" cabbie Gerardo Gamboa told CNN affiliate KVVU. ""All I wanted to do was just call my dispatcher and return it, and this is the only chance I have to show cab drivers in Las Vegas are not bad people."" The loser of the money -- at least temporarily, thanks to Gamboa's good deed -- was a famous 28-year-old professional poker player, whom officials weren't publicly identifying, according to another CNN affiliate, KLAS. The gambler was so devastated at his loss Monday that ""he wanted to shoot himself in the head,"" a cab company official told KLAS. ""He was grateful. He was very understanding; he wasn't irritated. To a point he was irritated, but he wasn't mad or aggressive or anything. Maybe a little more embarrassed than anything. I mean, he left $300,000 in a cab, but he was an awesome guy,"" Yellow Checker Star field operations manager Joel Willden told KVVU. The chief operating officer of the cab company described the sum as the most found in a cab in his 32 years in the business. ""We had to be as a company extremely cautious that the right person got the money,"" cab firm CEO Bill Shranko told KLAS. ""It's the Christmas season and we think it's the best story that I've seen in 32 years, and cab drivers worldwide are going to be very proud."" It all began when Gamboa drove a man about two miles between casino-hotels, from the Cosmopolitan on the Las Vegas Strip to Palms Place, KLAS reported. The man gave him a $5 tip. Gamboa then went back to the Strip -- the Bellagio casino-hotel. ""When the doorman at the Bellagio opened up the door for the next passenger, he said, 'There's a bag in here. It's full of chocolate,'"" Gamboa told KLAS. When he opened the bag, Gamboa was stunned at the six bundles of $100 bills inside. His next fare was already in the cab, and Gamboa told the passenger, ""Look sir, you are my witness. I didn't touch anything here,"" Gamboa told KLAS. Meanwhile, the poker player went to the cab company looking for his lost money. Gamboa took the small fortune to the office of his Nevada cab company, which contacted authorities. After a four-hour police investigation, officials confirmed the gambler was the rightful owner of the money, KLAS reported. Yellow Check Star gave Gamboa a $1,000 reward, made him driver of the year, and gave him a steak dinner for two, the affiliates reported. ""I did the right thing, that's it,"" Gamboa told KLAS.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Two Nigerian trade unions accused the country's president of using ""armed thugs"" to attack protesters, and urged demonstrators to continue their nationwide strike against high fuel prices on Wednesday and beyond. ""In a Mubarak-style response to the peoples' protests, the Jonathan administration brought into Abuja, thugs armed with various weapons including guns,"" the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria said in a joint statement late Tuesday night. The unions were comparing President Goodluck Jonathan to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters in Egypt last year. ""Labour warns the Presidency that it will be held responsible for whatever atrocities these thugs commit,"" the statement said. ""We call on Nigerians to continue the strikes, rallies and protests ... Wednesday ... and subsequent days until the Jonathan government listens to the voice of the Nigerian People."" Government spokesman Reuben Abati denied the accusations and said negotiations between the labor unions and the government are under way. ""If these claims are properly investigated, you will find out that failed and bitter politicians have not only hijacked this protest, but have diverted it from a protest against deregulation policy,"" he said Reuben Abati. Wednesday will mark day three of the strike, which was spurred by a government decision to remove fuel subsidies -- a move that resulted in more than doubled fuel prices in the largely impoverished country. So far, clashes have left at least 16 people dead and 205 injured, according to a tally collected by the Nigerian Red Cross Tuesday. The strike, continued religious violence in the north and a long-simmering separatist movement are all issues that have created growing problems for Jonathan and fueled tensions on the street. The southern state of Edo was a focus for much of the violence, according to the Red Cross, with five people killed and 83 injured. ""Revolution has come to Nigeria and the youth will spearhead it. Until our demands are met, we are ready to protest every day and make sacrifice,"" said Eromo Egbejule, a Nigerian freelance journalist. Other violence erupted in northern Nigeria Tuesday and Wednesday, although it was unclear whether the incidents were related to the strike. In Yobe state, four people died Wednesday after two gunmen on a motorcycle stopped next to a car filling up at a gas station and opened fire on the occupants in the town of Potiskum, about 600 kilometers northeast of Abuja, said Lawan Tanko, Yobe state police commissioner. ""We don't know if it's Boko Haram or other criminal elements,"" he said. ""We are still investigating."" The victims' ethnic groups had not been confirmed, he said. Boko Haram, a shadowy militant Islamic group that is said to favor strict Sharia law, is frequently blamed for sectarian violence. Also in Yobe state, eight people drinking in an open-area bar, including a police officer, were shot to death Tuesday by several unidentified gunmen in Potiskum, Tanko said. The gunmen opened fire without announcing their presence, he said. No one has claimed responsibility, and police are not sure who was behind the attack, he said. In a recent address, Jonathan tried to explain the need for ending the subsidies, telling Nigerians that the government would invest the money in the country's crumbling infrastructure. ""My fellow Nigerians, the truth is that we're faced with two basic choices with regards to the management of the petroleum sector,"" Jonathan said. ""Survive economically or continue with a subsidy regime that will continue to undermine our economy."" Some analysts say the changes could help Nigeria in the future. ""If they're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform too. If they do that, Nigeria's growth can be instead of 7%-8% a year, 10% or 11%,"" said Charlie Robertson, a chief economist at the global investment firm Renaissance Capital. But assurances from the president did not allay fears from many Nigerians who do not trust the government to use the money to improve the country's infrastructure. Many Nigerians view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil-producing country that has little infrastructure, poor roads, high unemployment and intermittent electric power. ""Though we know that in the long run, removal of (the) subsidy will help the economy, for now it is a high-profile lifestyle that is unbearable for most Nigerians, and soon the poorer ones will die out,"" said protester Diane Awunah. CNN's John Defterios, Jack Maddox and Michael Saba, and journalist Vladimir Duthiers contributed to this report.","Unions: ""We call on Nigerians to continue the strikes""

"(CNN) -- When my friend Elaine Rivera died, it felt almost like the end of a fireworks show, when the smoke hangs in the air and crowds walk slowly home. The fun was over in a flash. Elaine was the life of the party, the girl who urged you to stay for just one more drink, a journalist who could splash life into a good story. She was also, as it turned out, an alcoholic whose drinking was so severe it corroded her liver until it just stopped working. Just a few weeks before her October 26 death from cirrhosis, she looked out the window of her condo in the Bronx at a stunning view of the crowds whooping it up at Yankee Stadium. ""Here I am, just another Puerto Rican in the Bronx watching the Yankees. Every one of those people has a beer in their hand,"" she rambled on, noting how Puerto Ricans are big baseball fans. ""What is it about Puerto Ricans and drinking?"" That was the same day she said: ""Rose, I don't think I'm going to make it."" And then she didn't. Elaine, 54 when she died, was a well-educated Latina who had devoted her career to reporting on the neglect of poor, ethnic communities. Now she'd ended her life like the anecdotal lead to one of her stories -- this one on how Latinos are dying from alcoholism-related cirrhosis at higher rates than other ethnic or racial groups, and no one seems to know precisely why. Video: Oscar De La Hoya: I started drinking at 8 . Latino men die at 1.7 times the rate of whites and Latinas at 1.5 times the rate, according to statistics compiled by the National Institutes of Health. Both genders die from alcoholism-related cirrhosis at twice the rate of African-Americans. Only Native Americans suffer mortality rates at higher levels. ""You probably have a bed here where you put the Puerto Rican from the Bronx,"" she had yelled sarcastically, irascible during her first visit to a New York emergency room. She wasn't far off when it comes to cirrhosis. Puerto Ricans have a higher rate of alcohol abuse than other Latinos, says Dr. Raul Caetano, who has studied alcohol abuse in minority groups for the University of Texas. There are few explanations as to why. ""Yes, it's binge drinking, and drinking in general, but as to why (no one knows),"" Caetano said. Some of the problem may begin on the island and get worse as Puerto Ricans move stateside, says Hector Diaz, who co-authored a 2005 book on alcohol abuse among Puerto Ricans. ""In Latin America, the tendency is for people to drink in large amounts but less frequently. When they drink, they get drunk,"" Diaz said. ""Then they come to the U.S., where people drink with more frequency, and Latinos adopt both habits."" Diaz, who has a doctorate in social work, believes that colonization and migration leave some Puerto Ricans feeling like they are immigrants even though they are born U.S. citizens. They feel beaten down as they face new economic and social challenges without the strong family structures they left behind on the island. ""All that drives people nuts,"" he said bluntly. ""You are always having to reinvent yourself."" He thinks studying why Latinos, and Puerto Ricans in particular, seem prone to drink will help social workers like him develop better prevention and treatment. Video: Alcoholism, eating disorders may be genetically linked . Elaine knew all about Puerto Ricans fighting off a culture of drinking. In the weeks before she was diagnosed, she raged about a dustup between some Puerto Rican leaders and Coors. The beer company had apologized after some Puerto Ricans felt insulted by a Coors can emblazoned with the Puerto Rican flag in honor of the community's 2013 annual pride parade. The parade theme was ""Salud: Celebrating Your Health."" ""The hypocrisy of this!"" she would say, screaming at the TV set, noting the Puerto Ricans organizing the parade supported Coors. ""I'm going to have my students look into it."" Coors later issued an apology, noted its sponsorship of scholarships for Latinos and said it was trying to celebrate culture. It stopped production of the cans. Elaine had left full-time journalism to teach journalism at Lehman College and was hoping her students would adopt her passion for covering racial and ethnic minorities. She noted that in 2011, Puerto Ricans were divided over another Coors ad campaign titled ""Emboricuate."" Boriqua is a slang term for Puerto Ricans and ""Emboriquate"" was an obvious play on the Spanish word ""Emborrachate,"" meaning ""get drunk."" Coors later apologized for offending anyone and dropped the ad, and the partnership between the Puerto Rican parade and the beer company continued. Even as she talked about the community's divisions, though, Elaine never fully acknowledged she had a drinking problem. Alcohol abuse is often a disease that can hide in plain sight in Latino communities, says Judith Arroyo, who studies minority health disparities for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Latinos sometimes diminish heavy drinking, said Arroyo, believing that people who drink excessively once a month or every six weeks have nothing more significant than ""un vicio,"" just a vice. Elaine's family didn't see it coming until very late. ""She'd have a little traguito, (drink) as they say, but I didn't think she was an addict,"" said her brother, Randy Rivera. Elaine came from a solid working-class family from Cleveland, a destination for Puerto Ricans searching for manufacturing jobs in years past. She called it ""the Puerto Rican Brady Bunch"" -- three boys and three girls, living in a house with one bathroom. Last Christmas, her brother said, ""she came home looking white like a ghost. She looked swollen. She didn't eat well at dinner."" The family always bought a bottle of liquor for guests, and when her brother woke up the morning after her arrival, it was mysteriously empty. The year before, their sister Joyce had died from cirrhosis. Randy Rivera remembers trying to wrench a bottle of alcohol from Joyce's hands. ""I told Joyce, 'The only way you'll stop is in the grave,' and that turned out to be true,"" her brother said. They recognized the physical signs in Elaine, but didn't connect it to heavy drinking. ""We knew Joyce was an alcoholic. She wouldn't go to rehab. It was gradual, but we knew it was her destiny,"" said her other sister, Marisel Rivera. ""With Elaine, we didn't know the severity of her drinking. She'd be up late drinking when she visited, but we thought she was just stressed from work. Now I can't believe this disease has taken two of my sisters."" The next time Elaine's family visited, she was in Mount Sinai Hospital having fluid drained from her body because her liver was not filtering fluids adequately. Not targeting discreet communities for early prevention can have devastating consequences once they are diagnosed with cirrhosis. Dr. Gene Im, who treated Elaine at Mount Sinai in New York, said concerns over continued alcoholic behavior among cirrhosis patients means most doctors won't provide life-saving transplants unless a patient has stopped drinking for six months. Elaine was in rehabilitation when she died suddenly. Im describes cirrhosis as a particularly cruel disease because it's caused by scarring in the liver as it's trying to regenerate and maintain its function against the onslaught of abuse. It basically hurts itself trying to survive. ""This comes about over decades of injury to the liver, and often times it's silent,"" Im says. The millions of people in the United States who suffer from alohol-related cirrhosis, an indicator of heavy drinking, face more than just a grave health risk, particularly if they are a member of a vulnerable minority group. Drinking excessively has also been linked to increased criminality, family and work life issues and health consequences. ""Alcoholism is one of the preventable agents that keeps Latino people from being able to advance in this country,"" Arroyo said. ""It affects families, it's money that should be spent on education and providing a good household. If we can address and prevent this, I truly believe we would see Latinos advance economically much more rapidly in this country."" While liver disease results from long-term abuse, Arroyo said, not enough research has been done as to whether higher rates of hepatitis C and fatty liver disease among Latinos weaken the liver and increase the rates of cirrhosis. She also said that poor diet and lack of exercise might also be contributing factors. ""Latinos suffer alcohol use disorders, both dependency and abuse, in smaller numbers, but for those of us who drink, tomamos con ganas (we do it with gusto),"" she said. ""And there are all those things that can contribute."" Elaine was a journalist, a profession where much-romanticized pub crawls are legendary. As I told her former colleagues of her death, many asked whether something else might have caused cirrhosis or how much drinking might make you sick. When I told them the autopsy firmly connected her death to long-term alcohol consumption, they seemed incredulous. Hers had been a slow, unintentional suicide, aided by the many drinks she shared with her reporter buddies in celebration of the last big story. In that other culture of hers, no one had seen it coming either. Problem teen drinking is not just a phase . Elaine's friends and family gather will Saturday to celebrate her life and work and raise money for a scholarship fund for poor, minority journalism students devoted to continuing her work. I find it all so heart-crushing I can't bring myself to join the speech-making. There will just be too much talk of the importance of her kind of reporting, but little, if any, about why she died. I'll remember her by telling the story of how her easy smile and zest for justice was snuffed out by an awful disease plaguing her own community. I just wish she were here to have written it herself.","Journalist Elaine Rivera died October 26 at age 54 .

"(CNN) -- With 2013 firmly in the rearview mirror, the movers and shakers of the video gaming industry are focusing on where the next 12 months will take us. With new platforms and consoles available and more people playing games on smartphones and tablets, the future appears to be open to a vast array of possibilities. We asked four industry players what they think the next year will look like. Each offered a few specifics and a broader view about what will be important to game makers and players. Many expect 2013's releases of new hardware and software platforms -- most notably, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles -- to spur creativity in game development and delivery. Here's what they told us: . Ken Levine, creative director, Irrational Games . ""2013 was the year of the left field: crowdfunding, the Steam box, in-house streaming. 2014 is the year we're going to start to see how that changes the space. The majority of old-school developers I know now have gone into more personal, niche titles; (it) reminds me of when many of the great PC studios (BioWare, Bungie, Bethesda) started developing console games in the early 2000s. ""Being in gaming is like being in music in the '60s, but there's a new British invasion like every three years. I think disruption is generally a good thing. It keeps us on our toes as developers and usually yields dividends for gamers."" Jean-Michel Detoc, managing director, Ubisoft Mobile . ""We've seen the mobile industry consistently evolve over the past five years and, in my opinion, 2014 will be no exception. I anticipate the trends in 2013 -- increased time spent playing games on mobile devices and a shift to 'freemium' pricing in games -- will continue to grow in 2014. ""With more than 2 billion smart devices currently activated and the increased availability of low-end smart devices, the mobile market has never been stronger or reached such a mass audience. Gaming has expanded to represent around a third of time spent on connected devices, and I am confident gaming will confirm its position as one of the core uses on those devices in 2014. ""Additionally, as app quality as a whole continues to improve, we will see fewer applications, but with more budget and ambition put behind them. The last important trend I believe we will see is the extension of 'freemium' mobile games to new devices such as smartwatches and smart TVs."" Geoff Keighley, host, Spike TV . ""2014 will be a monumental year for the gaming industry. Both the Xbox One and PS4 will continue to grow their install base, and we will begin to see more games built specifically to take advantage of the next generation hardware. Already fans are anticipating the birth of new franchises like 'Titanfall' and 'Destiny.' ""That said, 2014 will be a year of experimentation. We will see more games on tablets, new business models birthed by the rise of digital distribution, the continued growth of eSports and exciting new ventures like Valve's Steam box. ""What used to be a race between three console manufacturers for dominance has diversified into dozens of companies carving out their own market segments."" Wallace Santos, CEO and founder, Maingear . ""2014 is going to bring a lot of new and exciting technologies to gamers. The big story this year is the advances that AMD and NVIDIA are making with GPUs (faster processors for graphics) that make 4K gaming a reality. Next year we'll see those 4K panels come down in price. ""With exciting technologies like AMD's Mantle API, designed to max out the performance capabilities of your graphics card, and NVIDIA's G-SYNC, designed to deliver silky smooth gaming, there's a whole lot to get excited about. ""And then there's the peripherals like the Oculus Rift. With gaming legend John Carmack joining the company, we can be sure to see great things from them as well. And let's not forget the Steam OS. It'll be interesting to see how this new entrant into the gaming market fares alongside the next generation gaming consoles. As always, it's a great time to be a gamer.""

"SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (CNN) -- In skeletal form, they look like gargantuan honeycombs, rising 20 feet into the air. They are the largest incarnations of the Philippines' parol, an eye-dazzling electric Christmas lantern that symbolizes the Star of Bethlehem. In action they're truly a sight to behold. Each giant parol features a series of thousands of spinning lights synchronized by seven large steel drums -- the rotors. When the parol spins, the rotor hits a row of hairpins, electrifying the bulbs. Though smaller parols for household use have more latitude in covering, with choices like capiz shells and fiberglass, the giant lanterns usually stick to polyvinyl plastic. Only 10 or so of the giant parols are produced a year to compete in San Fernando's Ligligan Parul, or Giant Lantern Festival. It has been held every December for the last 80 years in Pampanga province, about 75 kilometers outside of Manila. It's this yuletide fervor for the nationally loved electric star that has lent credence to San Fernando's cachet as the ""Christmas Capital of the Philippines."" And likely even Asia. More: 12 of the world's most spectacular Christmas trees . Five generations of parol makers . When visiting the San Fernando barangay (village) of Santa Lucia, the ""home of giant lanterns,"" it's not unusual to behold a parol behemoth under construction right on the curb no matter what time of year. The legend behind some of the biggest and best parols to come out of Santa Lucia in recent times is Ernesto 'Erning' David Quiwa, 66. Quiwa is the great grandson of the first known maker of the famed parol -- Francisco Estanislao. On a recent visit to Quiwa's workshop, the parol master was busy overseeing the production of two giant lanterns. A worker was scaling the scaffolding to configure the 16-footer's 5,250 light bulbs. Quiwa learned the craft from his uncles, one of whom in 1957 introduced the first parol rotor. All five of Quiwa's children have ventured into the parol business. ""I never really taught my children,"" Quiwa says. ""They learned on their own. Maybe it's in the blood."" More: World's best Christmas store windows . A cost prohibitive hobby . One giant parol costs around 500,000 to 700,000 Philippine pesos ($11,300-15,820) to build. The city government subsidizes each barangay that builds one for the competition with 150,000 pesos ($3,390). Some barangays defray the remaining expenses relatively quickly with the help of affluent residents and local businesses. Others need to haggle with lantern makers. Quiwa, for one, obliges barangay leaders he considers kindred -- the caveat being he's allowed to rent out their entries after the Giant Lantern Festival to offset his loss. Mounting the festival is an expense in itself. The San Fernando government seeks 3 million pesos ($67,760) in sponsorships from the private sector. The figure does not include expenses at the grassroots level, let alone the work of volunteers, some of whom lead sizable companies or drive in from Manila, an hour away. To these people, the sight of a completed giant parol is a reward in itself -- although winning first place, or a prize of 120,000 pesos ($2,720), is always welcome. At this year's Giant Lantern Festival, held on December 14, Quiwa's team came in second place. A colorful history . In a country with dozens of festivals celebrating this or that native product, San Fernando breaks a mold, says Maria Lourdes Pangilinan-Gonzales, tourism and investment promotion officer with the San Fernando city government. ""Here there was a festival before there was an industry,"" she says. ""Nobody else makes Christmas lanterns the way we do."" San Fernando's lantern-making tradition dates back to the late 18th century, when Spanish colonists in Bacolor -- San Fernando's mother town and the country's one-time capital -- encouraged people to hold lantern processions to honor Our Lady of La Naval -- the blessed virgin Mary. These are believed to be the precursors to the Lubenas -- nightly parol parades held in the provinces of Pampanga and Tarlac provinces before Christmas Day. Out of this came the first parol festival in 1930, around the time electricity dawned on San Fernando. Early on, the festival showcased the ability of the parols' nascent bulbs to last the night without going out, hence the name Ligligan Parul or ""lantern showdown."" In the late 1950s, parols in San Fernando began transcending the classic five-pointed, stellate design of bamboo and papel de Japon (Japanese rice paper) favored by inmates and students today for their Christmas projects. San Fernando parols, in comparison, now recall psychedelic kaleidoscopes, brilliant stained glass windows, prismatic pinwheels, oversized snowflakes or batik textiles. They are also distinguished by name: parul sampernandu. Parul sampernandus vaulted to cottage-industry status in the 1960s. In 1964, Quiwa began selling them in gasoline stations, delicacy centers and restaurants around Manila. Mass-produced parul sampernandus, found in homes all over the country to mark the Christmas holiday, currently retail for 800 to 4,000 pesos ($20-90) and range from 20 inches to 4 feet in diameter. Arnel Cayanan, 30, says he earns around 15,000 pesos ($340) a night from selling parols by the road in San Fernando. Once, he says, a Swedish client splurged 20,000 pesos ($450) on his products. ""Even Muslims here buy parols -- probably secretly,"" says Cayanan. These handicrafts remain commercially viable after Christmas, used in events as diverse as Earth Hour and the Santacruzan. Parols are also bestsellers for artisan Quiwa during Holy Week, when San Fernando gives tourists a lesson in extreme Catholic guilt tripping: live crucifixions. Hospitality businesses also fuel demand for lanterns all year. More: 10 most Christmassy places on the planet . The plight of Paskuhan . Though pretty much every Filipino associates San Fernando with Christmas decorations, not every yuletide venture in the city has fared so well. Case-in-Point: Paskuhan Village, built in 1990. Envisioned as a life-size tropical Christmas park, Paskuhan hosted the Ligligan Parul for nearly a decade thereafter. The place itself was even designed to look like a parol from the air. Nowadays the 9.3-hectare complex stands a rundown ghost of Christmas past, wanting of visitors. Monthly subsidies by the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA) largely sustain operations. Marketing officer Hiyasmin Viray, who has worked in the park since opening, feels the pang of bygone time. ""I love, love the place,"" she says through tears. ""Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who cares."" There is hope of a revival. Pangilinan-Gonzales reveals that local business leaders may use Paskuhan -- now also referred to as Hilaga Park -- as part of a plan that would see San Fernando host an international lantern festival during the 2015 APEC summit. Decking the global halls with parols . It won't be the first time the Philippines parol shines on the global stage. In 1993, an island-shaped float featuring a 10-foot parol by master artisan Quiwa won the Hollywood Christmas Parade. A year before, at the World Expo in Spain, the Philippines vaunted four giant parols, pleasing crowds that included former Philippine president Corazon Aquino. ""She told me: 'If I didn't come to Spain, I would never have seen the lavish parols of Pampanga,'"" says Quiwa. Parul sampernandus have decked the Philippines' embassies and consulates in, among others, Canada, China, Malaysia, Poland, Russia, Thailand and the United States. They've also bedizened such Austrian landmarks as the Rathausplatz and Ethnology Museum in Vienna as well as the Stadtturm in Innsbruck. The beacons have also twinkled at the Lord Mayor's House in Dublin and the Good Shepherd Cathedral in Singapore. For Filipinos at home, the parol's electromagnetic message of triumph over adversity sparkles brightest. In 1995, Typhoon Sybil (Mameng) brought mudslides from Mount Pinatubo down on San Fernando. Nevertheless, the Ligligan Parul pushed on that year. Star crossed by typhoons and volcanoes, Filipinos know where to look for a scintilla of hope when the stars go out.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych will return to work on Monday, after taking ill amid political unrest that has paralyzed the eastern European country. Yanukovych went on sick leave on Thursday with ""acute respiratory disease,"" his office said. He is now feeling ""good"" after treatment and his condition has been assessed as ""satisfactory,"" a statement on the presidential website said. Ukraine has been plunged into a deep political crisis that in the last week saw the Prime Minister and Cabinet resign, a controversial anti-protest law repealed, and the President signing off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters. Thousands of demonstrators have packed Kiev's Independence Square since November, when Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union and turned instead toward Russia. The government's attempts to crack down on protests appear only to have strengthened the opposition's resolve. Violent confrontations flared after a sweeping anti-protest law was signed two weeks ago, followed by an uneasy standoff on the streets as the battle in the political arena has heated up. On Sunday, the demonstrators showed no signs of leaving, again massing in Independence Square despite freezing temperatures. Amnesty bill . Despite concessions last week from Yanukovych, including repeal of the controversial law, Ukraine's opposition parties continue to call for constitutional reforms to shift power away from the president. They say the new amnesty bill -- which only comes into force if protesters vacate seized government buildings and unblock roads and squares -- is unacceptable. A special parliamentary session is scheduled for Tuesday. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States and the European Union ""stand with the people of Ukraine"" in their fight for the right to choose alliances with countries other than Russia. After his address, Kerry met with three Ukrainian opposition leaders -- Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Fatherland party, Vitali Klitschko of the UDAR party and Petro Poroschenko of the ""Euromaidan"" street protest movement -- the State Department said. Ukraine, a country of 45 million people, is split between pro-European regions in the West and a more Russia-oriented East. Also speaking at the conference, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the United States and the European Union appeared to be trying to push their own ideas on Ukraine. Deadly clashes last month were an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and favor Russia instead. He and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price of natural gas. Yanukovych has resisted calls for him to step down and defended the government's handling of the political crisis. READ: What's behind Ukraine's crisis . READ: Ukraine through a protester's eyes .

"Moscow (CNN) -- A suspected mastermind of twin bomb attacks in the Russian city of Volgograd was killed in a police operation in the restive North Caucasus republic of Dagestan, state media reported Wednesday. The man died in a shootout at a house in the town of Izberbash, the official Itar-Tass news agency said. One accomplice surrendered to police, but others were killed alongside the suspected mastermind, the news agency said. The attacks on Volgograd's public transit system in late December, which killed 34 people and injured about 100, shocked Russia and fueled security concerns ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics. 57% of Americans think terror attack likely at Sochi Games . One bombing targeted the city's main train station and the second, carried out within 24 hours, hit a trolley bus. Two other people were arrested last week on suspicion of transporting the suicide bombers to Volgograd. Russian security forces have carried out a number of operations in Dagestan in recent weeks. The southern republic is the hotbed of an ongoing Islamist insurgency blamed for previous terror attacks in Russia.

"(CNN) -- Arizona's divisive SB1026 -- which supporters claim protected religious freedom, and critics say served as cover for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians -- didn't come from nowhere. It took time to hash out among both state lawmakers and interest groups. In this case, advocates from the Arizona Center for Policy and Alliance Defending Freedom -- whose website says it ""coordinates legal efforts (for) Christian legal and policy organizations"" all across the United States and in 31 countries -- were among those who played a part in crafting the legislation. But from where, or from whom, did the impetus come? And who paid for the Arizona push and similar ones in a host of other states? America may never know. The reason has to do partly with the often collaborative, coordinated way that legislation takes shape. Numerous players inside and outside government, and based inside and outside of Arizona, helped make it happen. Some of them spoke publicly; others worked behind the scenes. Plus, it takes money to coordinate and spread such a message and legislative proposals nationwide. Good luck tracking such funds, given the ways that groups -- known as 501c4s -- can pop up overnight, spend money on causes and campaigns (without disclosing their donors), then disappear. ""Because there are holes in the disclosure regime,"" said Ian Vandewalker from New York University law school's Brennan Center for Justice, ""there are things that we just don't know."" Efforts under way in at least 14 states . Other states have proposed legislation aimed at protecting what their authors call ""religious freedom."" Some essentially use identical language. For instance bills in Arizona, Georgia and Ohio all contain these words: ""'Exercise of religion' means the practice or observance of religion ... including the ability to act or refusal to act in a manner substantially motivated by a ... religious belief."" This congruence isn't a coincidence. It's not uncommon for legislation born one place to be copied -- sometimes word-for-word -- somewhere else. State-by-state breakdown of 'religious freedom' initiatives . But absent explicit proof, it's hard to say that one person or one donor is behind any such effort. As the head of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center's American Religious Freedom program, Brian Walsh, says, ""a couple of dozen organizations (might be involved) with any legislation."" Walsh, who says his group ""defends religious freedom for all faiths"" and has ""probably consulted on 12 to 15 different types of legislation in states over the past couple years,"" says the push for such bills stems from a belief that, since 1990, the U.S. ""Supreme Court does not protect religious freedom as a matter of constitutional law."" (His group was more deeply involved in pending legislation in places like Kansas, according to Walsh.) ""At that point, ... anybody who had any degree of foresight knew you were going to have conflicts over religious freedom,"" Walsh said of what he calls the fateful Supreme Court ruling, Employment Division v. Smith. In that case, the plaintiffs were denied unemployment benefits in Oregon after being fired from their jobs for using peyote in a ceremony associated with their Native American Church. The Supreme Court sided with the state, saying the plaintiffs still had a responsibility to follow state law if that law is not specifically targeted toward that religion. Not everyone agrees that there's a crisis at hand, including conservative Republicans like Brewer. ""Senate Bill 1062 does not address a specific and present concern related to religious liberty in Arizona,"" Brewer said Wednesday to explain her veto. ""I have not heard of one example in Arizona where a business owner's religious liberty has been violated."" The money trail . Regardless of whether one thinks it's justified, there's no doubt that many efforts are actively under way along similar lines. CNN counted 14 legislative initiatives in various states similar to Arizona's. But it typically takes more than ideas for such a national push: It takes influence and money. But where that influence and money are coming from is hard to decipher. That's because of how money moves, and is spent, in politics -- especially on hot-button issues that, from the standpoint of many in the public, emerge out of nowhere. For one thing, as Vandewalker notes, the federal government ""has its own set of rules and each state has its own set of rules about what has to be disclosed and what can be spent."" Under the federal rules alone, a lot of information doesn't have to be released, says Robert Maguire from the Center for Responsive Politics. The groups known as 501c4s are officially corporations that, per the law, can spend as they wish. At some point, they might spell out their spending in tax forms but, by then, the issue may be over and the group -- which needs little more than a P.O. Box to set up shop -- might no longer be operational. ""With an issue like (the 'religious freedom' issue), where there is suddenly ... a large number of debates, it's entirely possible that groups have popped up, and nobody knows anything about them,"" Maguire said. ""... It's becoming more common to have these churning networks of money so that nobody can track it."" He and Vandewalker both say this kind of spending is ""happening more and more"" since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, which gave big businesses, unions and nonprofits more power to spend freely in federal elections. ""There was a kind of cultural change after that, it opened this Pandora's box about outside spending,"" said Vandewalker. ""Outside spending exploded."" What's next? So what are the chances that any of this -- whether it has to do with movements of religious freedom/anti-gay bills or the sometimes mysterious players behind them -- changes? While some are demanding change, there appears to be no real momentum in Washington for significant campaign finance reform that might make it easier to determine who is behind these efforts. While some key figures may come out publicly in support of reform, it's hard to tell who exactly is leading the way behind the scenes or even how widespread this push is. What will happen with these bills in other states, though, remains to be seen. It's not a good sign when a Republican governor -- a conservative widely known nationally for her support for a controversial law that some felt unfairly targets Hispanics -- not only vetoes a proposal, as Brewer did in Arizona, but blasts the proposal so thoroughly as ill-timed and unnecessary. Everyone acknowledge that times are changing. The issue of gay rights is example No. 1: Year after year, voters in state after state passed initiatives overwhelmingly to codify gay marriage bans in their states' constitutions. But the views have been shifting. Last June, for the first time, a CNN/ORC International poll found a majority of Americans -- 55% -- backed same-sex marriage, up 11 percentage points from 2008. A total of 17 states now allow such legal unions, due to actions by voters, state courts or their legislatures. Federal courts have also helped move the needle on the issue, especially over the past year, with district judges striking down constitutional bans and the Supreme Court ruling that same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. Walsh, the American Religious Freedom program's executive director, believes the ""religious freedom"" initiatives now working their way through the various states can succeed even if the Arizona one did not. ""Ten years ago, the bill would have been innocuous and no one would have thought twice about it,"" he said, blaming a high ""level of misinformation"" for sinking the Arizona bill. ""The whole dialogue about it was unproductive."" In light of what happened, Walsh said there has to be better ""public education"" to avoid a repeat of what he called ""this hysterically uninformed approach"" by making sure ""the intent of what the legislation says is clear."" He added that there also has to be a deeper, broader discussion within the ""faith community"" about their top priorities as well as a need for all ""to bend over backwards and take stock of the minority (faiths') interests."" However this process unfolds, Walsh said the fight isn't over. ""The faith community, in general, needs to take stock in the state of religious freedom,"" he said, ""...so that the public gets a better idea of what religious freedom is (and that it) needs to be addressed."" CNN's Halimah Abdullah contributed to this report.","Arizona's governor vetoes a ""religious freedom"" bill that critics ripped as anti-gay .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, Ohio executed Dennis McGuire by injecting him with midazolam and hydromorphone, a combination of drugs that has never before been used in an execution. Lawyers for McGuire contend that he will suffocate to death in agony and terror. The state disagrees. But the truth is that no one knows exactly how McGuire will die, how long it will take or what he will experience in the process. At a hearing on January 12 about the new execution procedure, the state's expert, Dr. Mark Dershwitz, said, ""I truly don't know how many minutes it will take the inmate to stop breathing,"" and later, ""There is no science to guide me on exactly how long this is going to take."" This type of uncertainty is commonplace in executions today, as departments of correction scramble to find new drugs and new procedures to carry out executions in response to pharmaceutical companies taking steps to prevent the use of their products in executions. Legal expert Deborah Denno compared the states' process of selecting an execution method to trying to figure out what to make for dinner. ""It's like going to your kitchen cupboard trying to look for something to prepare for your next meal and just looking for anything,"" she said. Many states have grappled with sourcing execution drugs, particularly pentobarbital. Increasingly, the states are turning to compounding pharmacies, which traditionally mix small batches of drugs to meet the specific needs of patients who require special formulations of their medicines. (Think of a child's antibiotic that tastes like a bubblegum drink, or a pet's medication formulated to taste like a meaty treat.) When executions are carried out using compounded drugs transparency is lost, and even the most basic questions about the drugs to be used -- including where they come from, what they are made of and whether they will work as intended -- are shrouded in secrecy. Oklahoma's Department of Corrections buys pentobarbital for executions from an unnamed compounding pharmacy. Missouri's Department of Corrections also buys its pentobarbital from an unnamed compounding pharmacy in Oklahoma, and lawyers in Louisiana believe the state's Department of Corrections intends to buy pentobarbital from an unnamed pharmacy in Oklahoma. Lawyers for Herbert Smulls, who is scheduled for execution on January 29 in Missouri, know that the pharmacy is not licensed to sell drugs in their state, but the lawyers and the courts are prevented from knowing any details about the product the pharmacy produces, including whether the raw ingredients come from a reputable producer or whether the finished product is pure, potent and sterile. Last week Michael Lee Wilson was executed in Oklahoma. Just after the compounded pentobarbital was administered to him, Wilson said, ""I feel my whole body burning."" Those were his last words. Is one pharmacy in Oklahoma supplying all three states without regard for state and federal laws that prohibit several of the actions it is taking? Only the states can answer this question, and they aren't talking. This level of secrecy is unfortunately nothing new when it comes to lethal injection practices. In the past year, several states have passed new laws making information about execution drugs and their suppliers confidential. Meanwhile, states are changing their execution practices to include never-before-used drugs and compounded drugs with no public input or oversight. In other words, states are simultaneously turning to less reliable, more questionable drugs and taking steps to more stringently hide what they are doing. When corrections departments obtain execution drugs from compounding pharmacies, they are likely to violate state and federal laws - by asking the compounder to make ""copycat"" versions of an FDA-approved drug, by obtaining the drugs without a prescription, or, conversely, by using a fraudulent prescription written by a doctor who is paid for the service but who has never met the prisoner. It's not surprising, then, that the departments don't want anyone to know what they are doing and refuse to reveal information about the drugs or the pharmacies where they get them, effectively preventing condemned prisoners from determining if the compounded pentobarbital is likely to cause unnecessary pain and suffering prior to causing death. There are too many unknowns in states' current lethal injection practices. Novel drug combinations and compounded drugs present untoward risks of an unconstitutional execution and shield the general public from the truth of how the ultimate punishment is carried out in its name. This destructive cycle of secrecy around lethal injection practices must end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elisabeth A. Semel.","On Thursday, Ohio will execute a man by using drugs never before used in lethal injection .
Elisabeth Semel: Lethal injection is bad enough, why shroud the process in secrecy?
She says we need more public input or oversight on states' execution practices .

"(CNN) -- An American man accused of kidnapping his two young sons and sailing to Cuba was declared insane by a Florida judge. Josh Hakken is insane and will likely be sent to a hospital for treatment before he can stand trial for the alleged kidnapping, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Chet Tharpe said Wednesday, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported. The ruling adds another chapter to the bizarre story of Hakken, his wife and their two sons. Some of the tale unfolded last year on CNN. Last April, Florida authorities said Josh and Sharyn Hakken kidnapped their two boys, ages 2 and 4, after losing custody of them. The boys were taken from the Tampa home of their grandmother. The story gained international attention when authorities said there was evidence that Hakken could have fled the country with the boys. Later that month, CNN found the family of four on a small sailboat in Havana. Josh Hakken glared through his sunglasses at the CNN reporter who found him and said nothing beyond confirming his identity. The two boys are OK, said a woman matching the description of his wife, and she left it at that. Cuban security officials wearing sidearms appeared as a CNN video crew was filming and ordered them to stop. Cuban authorities then detained Josh and Sharyn Hakken. The boys were returned to their grandparents. Both Hakkens were also returned to U.S. to stand trial. As for the fate of Sharyn Hakken? Her trial has been postponed, Bay News 9 reported. The judge also wants to check her psychological reports. 'Back to normal' for abducted kids, grandmother says .","Hakken and his wife are accused of abducting their sons after losing custody .

"(CNN) -- After decades of economic stagnation bling is back in Japan. Many Japanese are loosening their purse strings and don't hesitate to splurge $10,000 or more on precious things like a gold and diamond ring. Just 14 months ago, there was hardly anyone like Jesper Koll, the Japan director of research at JP Morgan and self-declared ""Japan's last optimist."" ""If you're bullish on Japan, it's kind of like somebody coming up to you and whispering in your ear, 'You know, Elvis Presley is still alive,'"" he says. What has turned Japan around? The answer lies in the country's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his bold measures to jump-start the economy, known as ""Abenomics."" Abe, who assumed office in December 2012, has vowed to revive the country's sluggish economy with ""three arrows."" The first arrow is printing money and easing monetary policy to jolt consumer spending and weaken the yen, thus boosting exports. The Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, said in April that it would boost the money supply, by 60 trillion yen to 70 trillion yen ($589 billion to $688 billion), in a bid to reach 2% inflation in two years. The second arrow is spending money by revving up fiscal stimulus. Abe announced ambitious spending packages this year: one that is worth 10.3 trillion yen ($101 billion) in January and another 5.5 trillion yen ($54 billion) that was unveiled on December 5. See more: Better Japanese economy = shorter skirts . Abe's two arrows have proved an effective weapon. In October, inflation rate was recorded at 1.1%, while core consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.9% from a year earlier, a five-year high. The world's third largest economy expanded in the first half of 2013 -- 4.3% annual growth rate in the January-March quarter and 3.8% in the April-June period. Although Japan's growth rate halved in the third quarter, it was still higher than expected. But Abe's toughest battle yet is to deliver the third arrow: structural reform. ""We're not talking about small technological innovations, we're talking about a big economic reform,"" says Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse. See more: Japan's Abe makes economy top priority . Foreign investors have called for Japan to open up its many protected sectors; to loosen labor rules, to make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers; relaxing immigration rules -- but these have left many Japanese cautious. And there is also concern about how Abenomics would affect wages. ""We only hear lots of slogans, but in reality, our salary and bonus hasn't gone up,"" says Tomohiko Kuramochi, an employee at the Japan Transport Institution. But some are optimistic. As one Japanese consumer puts it: Abenomics has been like water on scorched earth and it may take some time to sink in.

"(CNN) -- Nigerians took to the streets for the second day of a nationwide strike Tuesday, showing their anger over a government decision that has more than doubled fuel prices in the largely impoverished country. Some protests over the end of fuel subsidies were marred by clashes that left 16 people dead and 205 injured, according to a tally collected by the Nigerian Red Cross Tuesday. The strike, continued religious violence in the north and a long-simmering separatist movement are all issues that have created growing problems for Goodluck Jonathan, the country's president, and fueled tensions on the street. The southern state of Edo was a focus for much of the violence, according to the Red Cross figures, with five people killed and 83 injured. The situation is tense amid rumors that people from the north will be attacked, and some 4,000 people have fled their homes and sought refuge in camps, the Red Cross report says. Dan Enowoghomwenma, joint secretary of the Edo state branch of the Red Cross, told CNN three people had died Monday and two Tuesday, as different communities clashed in the state capital, Benin City. One mosque building was burned and another vandalized, with cars and buses also set alight, before the police and military restored calm, he said. He told CNN he did not know if there was a religious motivation for the clashes. Meanwhile, the situation in the northern Nigerian state of Kano was ""generally chaotic"" Tuesday, the Red Cross reported, with three people killed and 55 injured, some with gunshot wounds. Police in the neighboring state of Kaduna, where one person was killed and three injured, used tear gas to try to disperse protesters gathered in front of the government house, the Red Cross said. In the southwest, violence flared at some rallies in Lagos, the country's commercial capital, as protesters clashed with police, resulting in seven injuries and three deaths, the Red Cross said. Three deaths were also reported in Bauchi, and one in Kwara, according to the Red Cross figures. Other states reported protests that were largely peaceful, despite outbreaks of vandalism and protesters burning tires or blocking roads. CNN iReporter Eromo Egbejule, a Nigerian freelance journalist, attended a protest concert in Lagos Tuesday staged by musician Femi Kuti, son of the legendary Fela Kuti, and said he was proud to be there. ""Nigeria loves peace and this is why we are peacefully protesting, even though the Nigerian police and army have inflicted injuries and in some cases, killed innocent people,"" Egbejule said. ""Revolution has come to Nigeria and the youth will spearhead it. Until our demands are met, we are ready to protest every day and make sacrifices."" Jonathan tried to explain the need for the end of subsidies in a recent address, telling Nigerians that the government would invest the money in the country's crumbling infrastructure. ""My fellow Nigerians, the truth is that we're faced with two basic choices with regards to the management of the petroleum sector,"" Jonathan said. ""Survive economically or continue with a subsidy regime that will continue to undermine our economy."" But assurances from the president did not allay fears from many Nigerians who do not trust the government to use the money to improve the country's infrastructure. Another CNN iReporter, 38-year-old filmmaker and web designer Oladapo Bamidele, who filmed protests in Lagos Monday, said Nigerians have lost faith in Jonathan's government. ""Nigerians are united in this cause to see corruption dealt with, and eventually removed,"" he said. There have also been complaints from demonstrators that the police have responded too aggressively. In Kano, a physician who was among the protesters Monday said police there fired on the crowd, injuring at least 13 people. Demonstrators were gathered listening to speeches when police ""suddenly came and some were shooting and some were throwing tear gas,"" said Shehi Ali, vice chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association. Ali said one protester, a 12-year-old boy, was shot in the neck. Another protester was shot in the groin, he said. But Kano Police Commissioner Ibrahim Idris denied that officers fired on protesters. He said that officers were forced to use tear gas on ""miscreants and drug addicts"" who had tried to storm the governor's residence. Elsewhere, there have been more conflicting reports about the violence. Sanya Femi, a union official, said three union members had been killed by police gunfire during a peaceful protest in Lagos Monday. But Sunday Salailo, a trade union president, said he had no reports of union members dying. Some analysts say the changes could help Nigeria in the future. ""If they're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform too. If they do that, Nigeria's growth can be instead of 7%-8% a year, 10% or 11%,"" said Charlie Robertson, a chief economist at the global investment firm Renaissance Capital. But many Nigerians view the subsidy as the only benefit of living in an oil-producing country that has little infrastructure, poor roads, high unemployment and intermittent electric power. ""Though we know that in the long run, removal of (the) subsidy will help the economy, for now it is a high-profile lifestyle that is unbearable for most Nigerians, and soon the poorer ones will die out,"" said protester Diane Awunah. CNN's John Defterios, Jack Maddox and Michael Saba, and journalist Vladimir Duthiers contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Revolution has come to Nigeria and the youth will spearhead it,"" a local journalist says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Five years ago, not many people knew of Ted Cruz or sequestration or had seen a tricorne hat. Today, all are familiar in the political arena because of the tea party movement that emerged in 2009. For better or worse, the coming together of frustrated conservatives fearing American ruin due to rising debt has altered the national discussion to raise the profile of people and policies previously relegated to the right-wing fringe. Republicans fear tea party challengers in primaries. Democrats complain about the tea party caucus. The fiscal conversation focuses on reducing deficits and even reforming entitlement programs that make up the social safety net. Here's a kind of ""greatest hits of the tea party, volume one"": . 1) Protesting patriots . Never in the past 200 or so years have so many worn tricorne hats and other Revolutionary War-era garb to make their political point. At protests and rallies that began in February 2009 to spawn the tea party movement, the overwhelmingly white, middle-aged and older participants dressed the part of past patriots protesting against taxation without representation. They also adopted the Gadsen flag of the the 18th Century -- a coiled snake warning ""Don't tread on me."" It reflected the movement's link to the Boston Tea Party of 1773 that helped launch the War of Independence, while some note that the word ""tea"" in the label is a backronym for ""taxed enough already."" Top tea party group celebrates five years . Such romanticism ignores the private funding from big conservative donors, such as the billionaire Koch brothers, that helped amalgamate scattered local organizations into a more coherent movement with national focus. 2) Obamacare fury . Daily headlines scream with Republican rage over President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms that passed in 2010 with zero GOP votes. The roots of such fury emerge from the origins of the tea party movement -- conservative anger over the stimulus bill that contained more than $800 billion in tax relief and spending to help the economy recover from recession. Tea party zealots as well as mainstream Republicans and independents also disliked the auto industry bailouts and financial sector rescue started under the previous administration of Republican President George W. Bush. That anger helped Obama and Democrats win big in 2008. With control of the White House, Senate and House, Democrats pushed through the stimulus bill in 2009 and the Obamacare bill a year later. Anyone who attended or watched can't forget how opponents of the health reforms flooded public hearings on the proposal to spew full-throated attacks. Supporters got shouted down, shoving matches occurred, and the resulting perception was that middle-class America would never accept Obamacare. Today, Republicans and conservative groups try to maintain that perception with mixed results. 3) Republican control of the House . Tea party anger over the stimulus bill and Obamacare translated to a conservative campaign onslaught in the 2010 congressional elections, with private groups freed from previous funding restrictions because of the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court. Cruz angers GOP colleagues -- again . Republicans won back the House by gaining 63 seats in a major shift, with dozens of tea party-backed newcomers joining the GOP caucus. Advocating showdown politics and brinksmanship over federal spending and raising the federal borrowing limit, the Republican-led House forced a rightward shift on fiscal issues that resulted in more austere policies, more fights between the parties and mounting public disgust with dysfunction in Washington. 4) Democratic control of the Senate . ""I'm not a witch,"" declared Christine O'Donnell, a moment that symbolized how the tea party movement doomed Republican chances to gain control of the Senate in 2010. A conservative activist, O'Donnell entered the Republican primary to fill the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Joe Biden. So did former Delaware Gov. Michael Castle, a nine-term U.S. congressman, who was heavily favored to win and refused to debate her. With strong tea party support, O'Donnell beat Castle by 6 percentage points with strong backing from conservative southern Delaware, but she proved too inexperienced and downright flaky for the pressures of a full-fledged Senate campaign. Comedian Bill Maher unearthed a 1999 clip from a TV show he hosted in which O'Donnell talked about dabbling in witchcraft, and she responded with a commercial that opened with her flat-out denial. Senate passes debt-ceiling plan in blow to tea party . It went downhill from there, and Chris Coons easily defeated O'Donnell by 57%-40% in November. A similar scenario occurred in Colorado, where conservative Ken Buck defeated favored Lt. Gov. Jane Norton in the GOP Senate primary, then lost to Democrat Michael Bennet in the general election. Two years later in Indiana, Republican Richard Mourdock beat veteran Sen. Richard Lugar in the primary, then lost the race for the seat Lugar had held for six terms to Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly. 5) Ted Cruz and Michele Bachmann . Who had heard of either politician back in 2009? Today, both are household names after Michele Bachmann used her status as a tea party favorite to run for president in 2012 and Cruz rode tea party backing to get elected as a senator from Texas the same year. Bachmann railed against Obamacare and federal spending in her energetic but short-lived campaign best remembered for her frequent outlandish and accuracy challenged statements. She won the Iowa straw poll in August 2011 to get an early jump on the crowded GOP field, but her novelty flamed out and she finished sixth in the Iowa caucuses the following January. Bachmann dropped out of the race shortly thereafter, and now is leaving Congress altogether at the end of 2014. Cruz is on an opposite trajectory. More than any of the other tea party stalwarts elected in recent years, he has walked the talk by repeatedly taking on the Washington establishment of both parties in Quixotic escapades that gain him notoriety at the expense of GOP clout. Texas tea partier wants GOP on Cruz control . Last September, Cruz waged a 21-hour filibuster against a government spending extension, at one point reading aloud the Dr. Seuss book ""Green Eggs and Ham"" to his children back home, as part of his crusade against Obamacare. His tactics led to a 16-day government shutdown in October that failed to gain Republicans anything but public scorn for the political shenanigans involved. Undeterred, Cruz recently forced fellow Republicans in the Senate to join Democrats in overcoming his filibuster of a measure to raise the federal borrowing limit so the United States wouldn't default on its bills. GOP leaders wanted to let the measure pass with no Republican support so they could blame Democrats, but Cruz's filibuster threatened an impasse that could have rattled financial markets and possibly brought a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Fearful that Republicans would again be blamed for Washington dysfunction, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell led a dozen aisle-crossers who voted with Democrats to end the Cruz filibuster, then rejoined fellow Republicans in opposing the measure in the final vote that only needed Democratic support to pass. Afterward, Cruz complained that such political ""show"" votes hurt the party much more than his ideological purity of trying to wring more spending cuts out of Democrats in order to pass the debt ceiling hike. In the end, it remained unclear whether such antics will hurt or help the freshman senator considered a possible GOP presidential contender as soon as 2016. 6) New vocabulary . Who had heard of sequestration five years ago? Today it is part of the political-policy vocabulary, thanks in part to the way that the tea party changed the conversation through its laser focus on issues such as the national debt, the federal budget and entitlement spending. The refusal by tea party Republicans in the House to accept business-as-usual compromises on federal spending caused a series of showdowns with Obama and Democrats. One brought a compromise that included sequestration -- across-the-board cuts in government spending, including the military. While sparing entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the sequester cuts came closest to the tea party goal of shrinking government to lower deficits. Now Congress has started undoing the sequestration limits, angering tea party conservatives and putting pressure on Republican candidates in November congressional elections who supported the December budget compromise. 7) Poor John . Few sights have been as politically expressive as House Speaker John Boehner repeatedly having to drop legislation he supported because he was unable to get his own caucus to back him. The ability of tea party Republicans to undermine compromises with Democrats pushed by Boehner demonstrated the GOP split between the mainstream leadership and more extremist newcomers. Tea Party SOTU Response: 'Obamacare is an inequality Godzilla' After the government shutdown in October, Boehner adopted a tougher stance by criticizing tea party tactics that harmed Republicans. Earlier this month, he joined 27 other Republicans to vote with 193 Democrats in passing the debt-ceiling hike over the objections of 199 Republicans. Even Boehner's long-time political foe, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, sounded sympathetic on Thursday, calling on Republicans to ""take back your party"" from what she described as extremists. ""I think (the tea party) considered it a success when they shut down government and I don't think that was for the good of the nation,"" Pelosi said, adding that the tea party ""hijacked the name Republican."" 8) IRS targeting . Without a tea party movement, there would have been no tea party groups for Internal Revenue Service officials to screen out when checking applications for tax-exempt status. It turns out that liberal groups also were targeted for extra scrutiny, based on specific words in their names, as the IRS tried to figure out if new organizations were trying to skirt election funding limits by claiming they were 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations. Conservative Republicans continue crying foul, but investigations so far found no deliberate political machinations by the IRS. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Shannon Travis, Ashley Killough and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","For better or worse, the tea party movement has made a difference .
Who heard of Ted Cruz or sequestration back in 2009?
Protesting patriots or political obstructionists?
Mainstream Republicans are pushing back ."
"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Early this year Ukraine -- along with much of eastern Europe -- was caught in a deep and protracted cold snap. Many froze to death, energy demand spiked, and to top it all Russia accused Ukraine of stealing gas from transit pipes destined for western Europe for the second time in three years. Ukraine issued a firm denial, adding another blot to the two nations' fraught -- but highly dependent -- relationship. The fact remains that Ukraine needs Russian gas while Russia needs Ukraine's transit pipeline to export west. The spat came on the heels of a disastrous relationship meltdown in 2009, when for two nerve-wracking weeks Russia abruptly stopped pumping gas to Ukraine and Europe. The Russian energy giant Gazprom claimed Ukraine's gas company -- Naftogaz Ukrainy -- owed it huge sums of money in missed payments and fines. However, Naftogaz countered that it had paid the bill and claimed that Gazprom was in fact trying to force it to accept a new price for gas which it could ill afford. They eventually reached a deal, but Ukraine's Prime Minister Mykola Azarov still maintains that the terms are unfair: . ""Americans pay $70 for 1000 cubic meters of gas when Ukraine pays $550 to Russia for the same amount. It means almost ten times more. Tell me what kind of economy can take this?"" He told CNN. However, America benefits from its own vast reserves of natural gas, and Russia argues that still Ukraine gets it for less than consumers in Poland, Hungary, Turkey and Romania. So, while Ukraine tries to negotiate a better deal with Russia, it's also working to break its dependency on Russian gas and diversify its sources of energy. A key part of the plan is to import liquid natural gas from other countries -- such as Azerbaijan -- which will be processed at a terminal built near the vast port of Odessa on the Black Sea. The head of the project, Vitaly Demyanin, says that by 2018 it should have replaced 30% of existing Russian gas imports. ""It will have 10 billion cubic meters of alternative gas. It will help us to negotiate with our main supplier,"" he said. At the same time Yury Boiko, the Ukrainian energy minister, has high hopes that shale gas -- formed deep underground within large shale rock formations -- could also be a major alternative source of power in the decades to come. He told CNN that shale gas exploration in western Ukraine has ""very large potential."" But it's not just alternative gas supplies that the energy-hungry nation of 44.8 million residents has in its sights. The government has pledged to invest heavily in green energy. However, this won't do much to bolster their eco-credentials, as they are also planning to burn a great deal more coal too. It's all testament to their increasing desire to generate power without recourse to gas. Meanwhile, as Ukraine looks for other energy supplies, Russia is looking for other ways to get its gas to Europe. Russia is the world's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with nearly 40% of its imports, according to the European Commission . It has already built one pipeline that bypasses Ukraine.  The 765-mile long ""Nord Stream"" pipeline -- costing more than $12 billion -- directly links Russia with the European Union via the Baltic Sea bed. At its launch in 2011, the then Russian Prime Minister, now President, Vladimir Putin, made an ominous and thinly-veiled reference to his Ukrainian neighbors. ""Any transit country has always the temptation to take advantage of its transit status,"" he said. ""That exclusivity is now disappearing."" At the end of this year, Russia plans to begin construction on another gas pipe to Europe -- the ""South Stream"" -- running through the Black Sea to Bulgaria and on to Greece, Italy and Austria. The projects threaten to strip Ukraine of billions in revenue and any remaining leverage it might have over future gas prices. But in an effort to salvage long-term relations, Ukraine is now proposing a new model that would allow themselves, Europe and Russia equal control of their transit system. ""So the consumers, the sellers, the supply and transit country is together. It's a good model and it's convenient for everybody,"" says energy minister Boiko. Only time will tell if these major energy reforms will change Russia's position in future negotiations and transform the horizon of Ukraine's economic future.","Ukraine and Russia have long-standing feud over gas supply lines .
Ukraine is big importer of Russian gas, while Russia depends on Ukraine pipeline .
In recent years, Ukraine has tried to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependence .
Liquid gas imports, underground shale gas and green energy are among new sources ."
"Santa Clarita, California (CNN) -- Paul Walker fans came by the thousands Sunday to mourn for the actor at the site where he and a friend died last weekend. Many of them drove by in souped-up cars fit to be used in Walker's ""Fast & Furious"" street race scenes, but others parked blocks away and walked to the business park about 30 miles north of Hollywood where eight days earlier Walker and Roger Rodas died in a fiery car crash. A Christmas tree now stands where the red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT burned after clipping a light pole on the afternoon of November 30. Candles, flowers, signs and other mementos left by fans cover the ground. The miles-long line of cars was allowed to drive slowly by the the normally quiet spot on Hercules Street in Santa Clarita.

The memorial, loosely organized through Facebook pages and Southern California car clubs, was not sanctioned by the families of Walker or Rodas. A spontaneous memorial began the moment Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies removed the yellow tape around the crash site eight hours after last weekend's wreck. Fans were already waiting with flowers that piled up and candles that burned on the roadside where Walker and Rodas died. Every night and day since the crash, fans have gathered and left mementos. Walker's co-stars joined them at times. Vin Diesel used a police car's loudspeaker Tuesday to thank a crowd of mourning fans, calling Walker an ""angel up in Heaven."" Actor-singer Tyrese Gibson broke down sobbing as he laid a yellow flower at the site. The Los Angeles County coroner's office on Wednesday said Walker died of ""the combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries."" Speed was a factor in the crash, the sheriff's office has said. On the day of the crash, Walker was attending a holiday toy donation event for his charity, Reach Out WorldWide, when he hopped into the car with Rodas for a ride, witnesses said. The Porsche, which was one of only a few hundred made, was on display at the event, which was held at a high-performance car shop owned by Rodas.

"(CNN) -- With military pomp and traditional rituals, South Africa buried Nelson Mandela on Sunday, the end of an exceptional journey for the prisoner turned president who transformed the nation. Mandela was laid to rest in his childhood village of Qunu. Tribal leaders clad in animal skins joined dignitaries in dark suits at the grave site overlooking the rolling green hills. As pallbearers walked toward the site after a funeral ceremony, helicopters whizzed past dangling the national flag. Cannons fired a 21-gun salute, its echoes ringing over the quiet village. Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief as she watched the proceedings. ""Yours was truly a long walk to freedom. Now you have achieved the ultimate freedom in the bosom of God, your maker,"" an officiator at the grave site said. Military pallbearers gently removed the South African flag that draped the coffin and handed it to President Jacob Zuma, who gave it to Mandela's family. At the request of the family, the lowering of the casket was closed to the media. A peek into Mandela's memorial garden abloom with symbolism . The funeral ceremony . Before making their way to the grave site, mourners attended a service in a tent set up at the family compound. They wept, sang and danced in what has become a familiar celebration of his life. Mandela's coffin, draped in his country's flag, lay atop black and white cattle skins in front of a crescent of 95 candles, each marking a year of his life. As the national anthem ""Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika"" or ""God Bless Africa"" drifted over the village, a giant picture of Mandela looked down with a smile. Mourners placed their fists on their chests, some with tears streaming down their faces. ""Today marks the end of an extraordinary journey that began 95 years ago,"" Zuma said during the ceremony. ""It is the end of 95 glorious years of a freedom fighter ... a beacon of hope to all those fighting for a just and equitable world order."" The president thanked Mandela's family for sharing him with the world and said his memory will live on. ""We shall not say goodbye, for you are not gone,"" Zuma said. ""You'll live forever in our hearts and minds."" About 4,500 people gathered in the tent, including Machel, who sat next to Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Mandela. In other major cities including Johannesburg, crowds watched the funeral at special screenings in stadiums. 'I've lost a brother' Mourners represented all spheres of Mandela's life. There were celebrities, presidents, relatives and former political prisoners. ""You symbolize today and always will ... qualities of forgiveness and reconciliation,"" said a tearful Ahmed Kathrada, a close friend who served time in prison with Mandela for defying the apartheid government. ""I've lost a brother. My life is in a void, and I don't know who to turn to."" Talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Prince Charles and business mogul Richard Branson were also among the attendees. Final chapter . The funeral and burial cap 10 days of national mourning for a man whose fame transcended borders. ""Nelson Mandela was our leader, our hero, our icon and our father as much as he was yours,"" Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said, regaling mourners with tales of a secret visit Mandela made in 1962 to Dar es Salaam to gather support for his party, the African National Congress. During his fight against apartheid, Mandela fled to Tanzania, which housed the headquarters of the ANC. The white minority government had banned it in South Africa. In sharp contrast to the days of apartheid, the events honoring Mandela included a great deal of pageantry, as well as state honors. Mandela's body arrived Saturday in the tiny village in the Eastern Cape province, where he grew up surrounded by lush, tranquil hills and velvety green grass. Before arriving in Qunu, the body lay in state for three days in Pretoria. After an emotional service at the air base there, which included the handing over of his body to the ruling African National Congress, it was put in a military helicopter for the final leg of his journey. Though he dined with kings and presidents in his lifetime, the international icon relished his time at the village. He herded cows and goats there as a child, and always said it's where he felt most at peace. Some of his children are also buried there. ""He really believed this is where he belonged,"" said his daughter, Maki Mandela. Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years for defying the racist apartheid government that led South Africa for decades. He emerged from prison in 1990 and became South Africa's first black president four years later, all the while promoting forgiveness and reconciliation. His defiance of white minority rule and his long incarceration for fighting segregation focused the world's attention on apartheid, the legalized racial segregation enforced by the South African government until 1994. Years after his 1999 retirement from the presidency, Mandela was considered the ideal head of state. He became a yardstick for African leaders, who consistently fell short when measured against him. ""Thank you for being everything we wanted and needed in a leader during a difficult period in our lives,"" Zuma said. In keeping with tradition, Mandela was laid to rest in the afternoon, when the sun is at its highest.","NEW: Mandela is laid to rest in his childhood village .

"(CNN) -- The American Hispanic population is dispersing across the country, but is still anchored mainly in three states, according to a new study released Thursday. More than half the U.S. Hispanic population resides in three states: California, Texas and Florida, according to the Pew Research Center's Hispanic Trends Project. California is home to the largest Hispanic population -- one in four U.S. Hispanics are also Californians. Those three states, plus New York, Illinois, Arizona, New Jersey and Colorado, contain three-quarters of the nation's Latino population, according to Pew's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. While those eight states retain a high Hispanic population, new opportunities are beckoning people to the West and South, said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at Pew. The study points out that over the last decade, some of the fastest growing Latino populations are in the Southeastern United States. Georgia, for example, experienced an explosive growth, because a housing boom in Atlanta attracted people, Lopez said. ""People are willing to look across the country for new job opportunities and educational opportunities,"" he explained. ""I think this has huge political implications -- it means that more Latinos will be voting, running for office, and being part of the political culture in many more states."" Other key findings from Pew: . -- New Mexico has the the highest Hispanic population share, among the 50 states and District of Columbia, with 46.7% of the state's population counted as Hispanic. -- Maine, West Virginia and Vermont were among states with the lowest shares. -- Nationally, Mexicans are the largest national-origin Latino group in the United, accounting for 65% of the Hispanic population. -- Stewart County in southwest Georgia experienced the most growth in the Hispanic population since 2000, growing 1,754% over 11 years.","Study: Some of fastest growing Hispanic populations are in Southeast states .

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian military forces will not interfere in the current political unrest, a government minister said Sunday, despite ongoing protests and clashes that threaten to bring the eastern European country to a standstill. Opposition leaders have vowed to pursue their demands after rejecting a package of concessions, including government posts, offered by President Viktor Yanukovych. Thousands of protesters have continuously massed in central Kiev -- the power base of the opposition, which seeks the government's ouster and snap elections -- at times clashing with police. On Sunday, a memorial service was held for a protester was killed in the violence last week. His coffin was carried through snowy Kiev streets amid chants of ""Hero"" and ""He died for us, he died for Ukraine"" from the thousands of people, including protest leaders, who had gathered to pay their respects. Ukraine, a nation of 45 million people, has been thrown into a deepening political crisis after weeks of protests by pro-Europe demonstrators that have escalated into deadly clashes. But Defense Minister Pavel Lebedev said the military would not intervene. ""The army will abide strictly by the constitution and laws of Ukraine that set clearly its role, functions and tasks, including use of armed forces,"" he told Russian state news agency Itar-Tass in an interview on Sunday. Among the snowy rooftops of the capital, Kiev, smoke can often be seen billowing from the center, where thousands of demonstrators have massed despite the freezing temperatures, setting up makeshift barricades and bombarding police with gasoline bombs. Scenes of fires, burnt tires, smashed windows and the drumbeats of sticks on corrugated metal have become familiar occurrences on the city's central arteries. Offer rejected . On Saturday, opposition demonstrators smashed out windows and doors of a government building in Kiev and used fireworks to smoke out police, according to a journalist at the scene. Opposition leaders said the demonstrators targeted the Ukrainian House because police were launching attacks against them from there. This came after opposition leader Vitali Klitschko rejected concessions from the government. On Saturday, Yanukovych offered government posts to Klitschko and another leader of an opposing party, the presidential website said. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who heads the Fatherland Party, would have become the prime minister and, under the president's offer, would have been able to dismiss the current government, which has been one of the protesters' demands. The president also offered the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues to Klitschko, a former champion boxer known as ""Dr. Ironfist."" Yanukovych also said he would agree to a working group to look at changes to the constitution, according to the president's website. However, speaking on a public stage where he was joined by heads of other opposition parties, Klitschko rejected the offers. His announcement was greeted by loud cheers from the crowd. Emboldened, the opposition leaders have said they would press for more concessions -- elections and the abolition of sweeping new anti-protest laws. A special session of parliament is scheduled for Tuesday. Tent cities . The thousands of protesters who have packed Kiev's central Independence Square and surrounding streets have shown no signs of leaving. They have set up tent cities and put up barricades, outside of which police have massed. The clashes are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead. More recently, protesters, old and young, have been voicing their anger over new anti-protest laws, passed earlier this month. The controversial new laws have sparked concerns they could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech. Klitschko's party, the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms, warned on Saturday that authorities are preparing to provoke peaceful protesters and may plant provocateurs among the crowds in an effort to enact emergency rule. A group of protesters blocked the entrance to the Energy Ministry on Saturday, a move Energy Minister Eduard Stavytsky called a direct threat to the entire energy system. Some protesters entered the building and argued with Stavytsky. The protesters left the building saying they did not intend to undermine the work of the ministry in any way. Foreign governments have condemned the escalating violence and the European Union is getting involved in the crisis. The EU's commissioner for enlargement and European neighbourhood policy, Stefan Fule, visited Kiev on Friday and Saturday.

"(CNN) -- With the passing of Steve Jobs earlier this month, the tech industry lost one of its most revered icons. So where will the industry turn for inspiration now that Jobs is gone? New Apple CEO Tim Cook will keep the business cranking along, but he's unlikely to inspire the same kind of devotion as Jobs. Facebook leader Mark Zuckerberg has star power, but he and his company are still too young and untested. At Google, Larry Page is too awkward and Eric Schmidt too slick, and a lot of the company's recent products are too unfinished. But there's one tech leader who just might fit the bill: Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Bezos runs his business the same way Steve Jobs ran his, with a relentless focus on long-term value over short-term profits and a willingness to place big bets in seemingly unrelated new areas. Steve Jobs took Apple on a detour from personal computers into music with the iPod, and then into cell phones with the iPhone. It worked, and made Apple into the biggest and richest tech company in the world. Jeff Bezos is doing the same thing at Amazon. About five years ago, Amazon noticed it had a lot of spare capacity in its data centers that was only used during the holiday season. So it started renting out some of that capacity to other companies. Now hundreds of high-profile Internet startups, including big names like Foursquare and Yelp, run their businesses on Amazon Web Services. Somehow, an online bookseller became the most important provider of ""cloud computing"" -- a fancy term for running other companies' online services. In 2007, Amazon introduced its electronic reader, the Kindle. The product limped along for a couple of years, then started to take off in 2010 with the third generation. But next month Amazon will unveil Kindle Fire, a color version that is more like a full tablet computer, with an app store, music store, video store, and new kind of Web browser designed to load Web pages faster. And it sells for $199, which is hundreds of dollars less than Apple's iPad. No wonder Amazon is having to build millions more than it expected to meet demand. Somehow, an online bookseller could become one of the dominant players in tablet computing. Bezos not only resembles Jobs in his business practices. He's also got a lot of the same personal traits. He's a control freak . Google engineer Steve Yegge, who formerly worked at Amazon, accidentally published a post criticizing his current employer and praising Amazon and Bezos. (The post was supposed to be for Google's eyes only.) He said Bezos was a micromanager who ""made ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies."" A Portfolio.com profile in 2009 said Bezos wanted to know the details of every contract Amazon signed and had to sign off on how he was quoted in every press release. He doesn't like dissent . Bezos often tells employees that they're lucky to work at Amazon and leaves sticky notes reminding them who's in charge if they disagree with him, according to Yegge. He has otherworldly smarts . In a follow-up post, Yegge explained how Bezos was so smart that you could only impress him in presentations if you deleted every third paragraph to keep his brain occupied -- and even then, he'd figure out something you missed. ""People like Jeff are better regarded as hyper-intelligent aliens with a tangential interest in human affairs."" He always wanted to change the world . According to a 1999 profile in Wired, a high school girlfriend says that Bezos wanted to make money from an early age, but not to be rich -- he wanted to use the money to change the future. He is obsessed with secrecy . Some companies are like leaky sieves -- Hewlett-Packard can't keep an internal secret to save its life, and Google and Facebook products leak all the time. The tech press publishes all sorts of rumors about Apple, but most of them turn out to be wrong because the company places a high premium on secrecy. But Amazon is even more secretive than Apple. He was born in hard circumstances . Jobs was born to a young mother out of wedlock and given up for adoption. Bezos was born to a teenage mother whose marriage to his biological father lasted little more than a year. (Bezos has his adopted father's last name and considers him his real father, just as Jobs considered his adoptive parents his real parents.) To be sure, there are some major differences between the two men. Jobs dropped out of liberal arts college Reed and bummed around for a few years before figuring out what to do with his life; Bezos graduated from Princeton and went straight to work on Wall Street. Jobs had a bit of the California hippie in him, practicing Buddhism and trying natural remedies to cure his cancer; Bezos is more of a classic computer scientist, obsessed with space travel and mechanically adept. Most important, Amazon hasn't yet created many products that inspire the kind of love that the iPod, iPhone and iPad do. There aren't any Amazon fans -- or at least they're nowhere near as obsessed as Apple's. But give Bezos another five years and a few more new product areas, and that might change, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Rosoff. Copyright © 2011 Business Insider.","Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs share more similarities than differences .

"(CNN) -- British and American scientists watching Greenland's massive ice sheet have found what appears to be a 460-mile ""megacanyon"" far beneath the frozen surface of the world's largest island. Airborne radar images taken by the U.S. space agency NASA and compiled by scientists at the University of Bristol revealed the canyon's existence, Bristol glaciologist Jonathan Bamber said Thursday. It's buried under the layer of ice that blankets Greenland, a covering up to 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) thick. The gouge is about 50% longer than Arizona's 277-mile Grand Canyon, but not as deep -- ranging from 650 feet to about 2,600 feet (200 to 800 meters), Bamber said. It runs from the middle of Greenland to its northern shore, on the Arctic Ocean, and it's likely to have been covered over by ice for 4 million years. ""It's a continuous canyon. It's pretty deep. It very much looks like it predates the ice sheets,"" Bamber said. ""We think it's indicative of a river system that was here before the ice sheet was there, and which perhaps was modified by the ice sheet cover some, but not much."" The discovery is a byproduct of the intense scientific focus on Greenland amid concerns about rising global temperatures. The radar images were shot by NASA's Operation IceBridge, which flies aircraft over the island because the ice sheet is too thick for satellite-based radar to penetrate, said Michael Studinger, the project's lead scientist. Bamber and colleagues from Bristol, the University of Calgary in Canada and Urbino University in Italy published their findings Thursday in the journal Science. They were trying to compile an updated set of ice-sheet records when they noticed ""this long linear feature that seemed to be pretty continuous,"" Bamber said. ""It looks like it was a pretty extensive river system millions of years ago,"" he said. The find isn't a ""first-order concern"" for scientists studying climate change but will help researchers understand how the ice ebbs and flows across the face of Greenland and other polar environments, Bamber said. The main reason Greenland is under study is to record the height of the ice above it, not to map the land beneath, Studinger said. The existence of the canyon is ""basically a tiny piece in the big puzzle of what's going on in Greenland,"" but still an exciting find, he said. ""We live in the 21st century, and we are still discovering 750-kilometer features under the Greenland ice sheet that we didn't know about,"" he said. As climate warms, Arctic spawns massive ice islands .","A 460-mile canyon up to half a mile deep lies beneath Greenland's ice .

"(CNN) -- When you're on a roller coaster, thrills and chills are to expected. Standing still -- for hours, high above the Earth? Not so much. But that's the experience riders on the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit got Wednesday night, when the Universal Orlando attraction stalled due to what park spokesman Tom Schroder called a technical glitch. The coaster did what it was supposed to do, when that happened around 7 p.m: It came to a stop about 140 feet above the ground, Schroder said. What the ride -- which towers, at its highest point, 17 stories above the theme park -- didn't do was promptly start again. While the cars toward the front were at least closer to level, with a view over the hill, those farther behind were ""sitting straight back with no way to move, because it's straight down,"" one park visitor, Ray Downs, told CNN affiliate WESH. Most riders were able to be safely taken off but, more than two hours later, about 10 still remained. The Orlando Fire Department was called in to pluck off these stranded few about 2Â½ hours after the ordeal began. One female rider was transported to the hospital complaining of neck and back pain, according to Schroder. Asked whether this had happened before, Schroder said, ""Yes, we've had similar incidents."" On its website, Universal Orlando bills the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit as the tallest roller coaster in the theme park-filled central Florida city. Peaking at 65 mph, the coaster features what the park calls a ""record-breaking loop"" about other twists and turns. ""We are going to work to understand what happened tonight before we reopen the ride again,"" Schroder said. Downs, for one, is open to hopping on the coaster again, feeling that mechanical issues will happen no matter how well maintained a ride is. But his daughter -- who was ""scared half to death"" before they rode the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit just before it got stuck -- might not feel the same. ""I said, 'It will be OK, they took good care of their stuff,'"" Downs said. ""Thank goodness it wasn't us.""

"Oakland, California (CNN) -- A judge has concluded that 13-year-old Jahi McMath, who suffered complications after tonsil surgery, is brain dead. But it's unclear what will happen next to the California teen. An attorney representing her family told reporters they haven't decided yet whether to appeal the judge's decision, which came after a court-appointed doctor testified Tuesday that Jahi was brain dead. The judge has ruled that Jahi will remain on life support at least until December 30. Family members said they planned to spend Christmas in her hospital room, opening gifts and sipping hot chocolate. Earlier Tuesday, Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland argued that the court should lift a restraining order that requires life support for the girl. ""Because Ms. McMath is dead, practically and legally, there is no course of medical treatment to continue or discontinue; there is nothing to which the family's consent is applicable,"" the hospital wrote in court papers. Standing outside the courthouse on Tuesday, family members said they were hoping for a holiday miracle while Jahi remains hospitalized. ""Christmas is tomorrow, so it'd be great if she woke up tomorrow. ... If this was your daughter, wouldn't you want her to wake up in the next five minutes?"" said Omari Sealey, the girl's uncle. Mother: 'I won't stop fighting' for daughter . Complications after tonsil surgery . Jahi was declared brain dead December 12, three days after tonsil surgery. The case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital should have provided better care. On Monday, a judge appointed Dr. Paul Fisher, chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford Children's Hospital, to evaluate Jahi as an independent expert. Fisher testified Tuesday that Jahi meets the criteria for brain death. Alameda Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo previously ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until December 30 and encouraged both sides to work together. ""This is a very, very charged case. The stakes are very high. There is a young girl involved, and I think it would suit both parties well if you would speak with each other about how we are going to get through the next few days,"" Grillo said. Attorney: Family needs to process judge's ruling . Attorney Christopher Dolan said family members need to evaluate what the judge said on Tuesday before they decide on their next move. ""This involves some very serious religious beliefs about life and death,"" he said. But he said he hoped the judge's decision sends a message to hospitals everywhere: ""The parents come first."" ""What this case represents legally is that parents can say no when a hospital says, 'We're pulling the plug.' They thought that a hospital shouldn't tell them their child was going to be removed from a ventilator,"" Dolan told reporters. Mom vows to keep fighting . Mother Nailah Winkfield has said she'll keep fighting no matter what. ""I'm going to support her. It's my job to do it. Any mother would do it,"" Winkfield said in an exclusive interview with CNN's ""The Lead"" on Monday. ""I just want her to have more time. There are so many stories of people waking up in her situation."" Doctors say people don't wake up from Jahi's situation and that in her arguments, Winkfield has pointed to cases in which the patient had brain activity. ""Children's is currently merely preserving Ms. McMath's body from the natural post-mortem course of events. There is no legal, ethical or moral requirement that it continue to do so or that the family consent in the decision to stop doing so,"" the hospital's filing said. ""We have the deepest sympathy for Jahi's mother, who wishes her daughter was alive; but the ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that Jahi will ever come back to life,"" Dr. David Durand, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, said in a statement Monday. Winkfield told CNN on Monday that she'd seen recent improvements in her daughter's condition. A hospital monitor suggests her daughter is trying to breathe on her own, she said. ""They told me without your brain, you can't take your own breath,"" Winkfield said. ""Well, she's trying, so that means something's working."" Hospital says they're investigating . Durand said Monday that hospital officials are looking into the matter and are ""committed to learning what led to this catastrophic outcome."" ""We are sorry that Jahi McMath suffered tragic complications from her complex surgery,"" he said. ""Our hearts go out to the grieving family and community about this sad situation."" In its court filing Tuesday, the hospital also fought against a request by Winkfield to bring in Dr. Paul Byrne as an expert to study the case. Byrne, a neonatologist and pediatrician, wrote on the website RenewAmerica.com that he believes ""Jahi is not truly dead."" The political site pushes its view of the Constitution. He is ""a crusader with an ideology-based bias,"" and is ""neither a neurologist nor a California physician,"" the hospital argued. When routine surgeries go wrong .

"(CNN) -- A child sex abuse suspect from Oregon has been captured after being on the run for 15 years, police said. Daniel Clement Chafe was arrested Wednesday in Bozeman, Montana, according to a statement by the Oregon State Police. Chafe faces six counts of rape, five counts of sexual abuse and seven counts of sodomy, according to the police statement. Initially, the investigation centered on crimes against two teenage girls, but later, additional victims were identified, police said. Chafe disappeared in September 1998 after failing to appear in a Douglas County courtroom to face trial, police said. Ten days before his scheduled court appearance, Chafe reportedly went on a fishing trip with a friend in Washington state, according to the police statement. That friend told authorities Chafe fell from the fishing boat on the Snake River. After a search failed to find him, investigators considered him a fugitive. Police believe he faked his own death. Chafe was featured on several television shows, including ""America's Most Wanted,"" and was in consideration for the FBI's Top Ten fugitive list. Chafe was allegedly recruiting minor females between ages 14 and 16 to form what he called the ""Cobalt Clan,"" according to the FBI's most wanted poster. His reported goal was to produce a number of children over which he could rule, according to the FBI. The break came when an Oregon detective's research indicated Chafe was living in Montana under an alias. Further investigation confirmed where Chafe was living and working, ultimately leading to his arrest.

"(CNN) -- I have 711 photos stored on my iPhone, but none of them is a ""selfie."" That could disqualify me from commenting on the choice of that neologism, coined in 2002, as the Oxford English Dictionaries ""Word of the Year."" On the other hand, I do own an old two-volume microprint edition of the OED and read it on occasion for pleasure with the use of a magnifying glass. So give me a shot. The editors at Oxford Dictionaries describe ""selfie"" as an informal noun and define it as ""a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website."" They note that frequency of the word has increased in a year by 17,000 percent. Ammon Shea, who spent a famous year reading the monumental OED from beginning to end, alerts me that words selected for such an honor ""arouse a certain skepticism and derision"" among many wordinistas. He notes that this honor is the work of the OxfordDictionaries.com. As for the more famous OED, a press release notes that ""Selfie is not yet in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), but is currently being considered for future inclusion."" Though I've never taken a selfie, I have made cameo appearances in the cell phone photos of others. I enjoy this experience, especially at book fairs, where an eager reader may seek a souvenir photo with the author. The result can be quite endearing and funny, especially when it exaggerates the gauge of my nostrils, making my schnozz look like a double-barreled shotgun. Before the cell phone, the best way to get this effect was to drop a quarter into a photo booth at the mall or the arcade. I wonder if there is an American anywhere who has not been pictured on one of those four-photo strips, usually accompanied by a girlfriend or several drunken classmates. Even in the age of the selfie, these booths have made a comeback, especially at weddings and reunions. At my daughter's wedding, you could slip into the booth with one or more companions, mug for the camera, see yourself on a computer monitor, take a strip home as a memento, and donate a strip to the bride and groom, creating an instant album of happy faces. In that context, a selfie is a good thing, with that diminutive ending, suggesting the creation of a ""little self."" Think of the selfie, then, as a virtual ""mini-me,"" what in ancient biology might have been called a ""homunculus"" -- a tiny pre-formed person that would grow into the big self. Or maybe there's a dark side to this moon. Maybe the connotation of selfie should be selfish: self-absorbed, narcissistic, the center of our own universe, a hall of mirrors in which each reflection is our own. It would fit the times, of course, an era in which selfies decorate the narratives of our social networks. Here I am at my reunion! Look at me with Mickey Mouse!! Check out my new boob job!!! It's me, my selfie, and I. In the past, it took some kind of human connection, or tricky photography, to capture your self-image. ""Excuse me, sir, can you please take our picture?"" It happened to me last week outside the National Theater in Washington. Three young women wanted to pose in front of a poster of musical theater star Idina Menzel. So the Word-of-the-Year brainiacs probably got it right. I can't think of any other word that so captures our confusing and contradictory culture, so technologically forward looking and so personally self-obsessed.

"(CNN) -- It is one of the iconic modern cinema scenes: Mena Suvari, as Angela in Oscar-winning ""American Beauty,"" stretches her arms wide as she basks in a sea of floating rose petals during one of Lester's (Kevin Spacey) frequent fantasies. But when Senegalese photographer Omar Victor Diop set out to recreate the provocative sequence for his latest project, finding a bed of red roses proved difficult. Undeterred, Diop found the solution by using a plant wall inside the hotel where the shoot was taking place. ""The creative process of this series itself is very similar to the way African contemporary creation often takes place,"" says Diop. ""We often have to tweak concepts and styles from around the world and adapt them to our context, while preserving their original feel."" That series is ""Onomolliwood,"" a dazzling collection of images in which Diop and Antoine Tempe, a Senegal-based French-American photographer, revisited several Hollywood classics to give an African take on some of cinema's most iconic moments. The two artists merged their passion for aesthetics and performance art to offer a collection of striking images infused with flowing swirls of color, vivacious textures and dynamic characters. ""I wanted to imagine what these movies would look like if they were conceived and shot in Africa,"" explains Diop. Read this: Artists' road trip across Africa . Completely self-taught, the 33-year-old is a newcomer to Senegal's creative scene. He started experimenting with cameras on the streets of Dakar in 2010, at a time when he was still working in corporate communications for a multinational. But much to his surprise, Diop's first conceptual project, the futuristic ""Fashion 2112,"" was selected the following year to be showcased at Bamako Encounters, Africa's premier photo exhibition. After that, Diop decided to fully pursue his passion for photography. He quit his job last year and quickly started building an eclectic body of work that spreads from conceptual art to fashion photography and portraits. CNN's African Voices spoke to Diop about revisiting cinema classics and the transition from the corporate world to art. CNN: ""The Matrix,"" ""American Beauty"" and ""Frida"" are just some of the famous films featured in the Onomolliwood series. What was the inspiration behind the project? Omar Victor Diop: I worked on this project with French-born American photographer Antoine Tempe after an invitation by the Onomo Hotel Group. We thought that actually using cinema as a general theme would be a way for our respective creative universes to meet because cinema involves fashion and aesthetics, but it also involves an important performance dimension. We started working with the movies we liked, the movies that had influenced us. I remember watching in the 1980s the same movies as the young people of Paris and New York and maybe Bangkok. At the end of the day we're all the same young people regardless of where you were born and where you were raised and somehow I wanted to show this also through the choice of movies in the series. CNN: Is part of your artistic goal to show the modern side of Dakar and Senegal? OVD: Yes, and it's not even about the new Africa, it's just that because of globalization and the internet the modernity of Africa has sort of accelerated. But even back in the 1980s, when I was just a kid, I can tell you that Dakar was very modernized and international. Another advantage we had was that we were open to not only the Western world but the entire world -- we had African cultural content, Asian content, Chinese or Indian movies. It's just a shame that all of this, especially the urban life of the 1980s, is not documented. Read this: Photos show Congo in new light . So when I think about creating a new series I always make sure that not only the current Africa but also the one I grew up is somehow portrayed. I believe it's the responsibility of a photographer to not only conceptualize but also come up with some work that can be used as a reference in the future as a history document. CNN: How is it working as an artist in Dakar today? OVD: It's very exciting being part of the creative scene in Dakar right now. I think the period we are living in is a breakthrough, in the sense that there is a sustained and growing interest for ""another Africa."" Also, African artists are now aware that they can communicate to the world, and speak about and for themselves. It's terrific when you realize that you can actually write your own history as you live your passion. CNN: What kind of themes fascinate you? OVD: I am very interested in movement; movement of the human body but also of the fabrics, outfits and styles that are used to embellish the body. Even in my fashion photography I always make sure that there is a movement that is captured, and that tells a story. I'm also interested in the aesthetics of the 1970s and the 1980s, especially in Africa, and I always try to recreate that with the use of colors and styling references. And I'm also interested in personalities; that's why I've started a series of portraits called ""The Studio of Vanities."" The reason behind it was that I wanted to somehow pay homage and also document the youngest generation of Dakar's cultural entrepreneurs -- I'm convinced that many of these people are going to be very successful and are going to bring a lot of great things to the cultural sector in the next few years. CNN: How was the transition from the corporate world to becoming artist? OVD: I quit my job a year ago; it was a quite bold decision that scared many people around me because being an artist was not considered as a valid option. I come from a family where my mum is a lawyer and my dad is a chartered accountant -- both of them having very senior jobs throughout their careers -- and I attended top schools that were very advanced and quite expensive. With the money my family invested in me, of course you can imagine my mum being quite devastated, but I now have their full support.","Senegalese photographer revisits cinema classics to give an Africa twist .

"(CNN) -- A suicide car bomber killed four people and injured 27 others in a neighborhood in southern Beirut on Tuesday, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. Black plumes of smoke rose from Haret Hreik, which is known as a Hezbollah stronghold. Ambulances rushed to the scene, NNA reported. The neighborhood is part of Hezbollah's high-security area known as ""security square,"" and many of the Shiite Islamist group's leaders live there. Troops have formed a security perimeter around the area and deployed investigators to the blast site, the Lebanese army said in a prepared statement. The vehicle used in the attack was stolen, the army said. Cryptic claim . A cryptic message claiming responsibility for the attack appeared on Twitter from a user with the name ""al-Nusra Front in Lebanon."" It claimed to be affiliated with the Syrian al Qaeda affiliate with the same name. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the Twitter user or the claim. Al Nusra Front in Syria has not commented on the attack. The message did not contain details that are typical of claims of responsibility by well-established terrorist groups. Previous bombing . In early January, four people died in Haret Hreik, and 77 more were injured, when a car bomb exploded, NNA reported. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a Sunni Islamist militant group, claimed responsibility for that attack, calling it the ""first small payment"" in a bigger push against the Lebanon-based Shiite militia Hezbollah. ISIS, which is an affiliate of the al Qaeda terrorist organization, is one of the rebel groups fighting to overthrow autocratic Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah -- also considered a terrorist organization by the United States -- is fighting beside al-Assad's troops, who are trying to quash the rebellion in Syria.","27 people also injured when a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb .

Welcome to the age of novelty Twitter accounts, where animals, inanimate objects and other nonhuman entities speak their mind regularly: A pigeon with a foul mouth and a fouler demeanor. San Francisco's famous fog. Even the universe. On the social-media platform, users can express themselves creatively and get laughs by giving voice to those things that can't speak for themselves. Novelty nonhuman accounts have been a Twitter staple since Sockington, a Boston-area housecat, joined the service in March 2007 on his way to 1.4 million followers. But they've been in the news again recently after one user created @olympicseat, a tongue-in-cheek response to the curiously vacant seats at Olympic venues in London. In the span of a few days, it has amassed more than 21,000 followers. Another Olympics-related feed celebrates the star-spangled towel that American gymnast Danell Leyva drapes over himself between events. It has more than 12,000 followers -- not bad, considering the average Twitter user has 126. Most of the people in this group of noteworthy Twitterers say their primary motivation for tweeting is to have fun. For others, it's a chance to make their mark in the crowded world of the Web. However, all agree that more thought goes into their 140-character musings than meets the eye. Cat Food Breath . When the woman behind pet-centric account @CatFoodBreath began her novelty Twitter account in August 2010, she wasn't planning on sticking around. ""I figured the best way to test the waters was with a pseudonym,"" said the Burlington, Vermont, resident who asked that her name not be published to preserve the anonymity of her Twitter persona. ""I wouldn't offend friends and colleagues if I didn't follow them, and I could make a polite exit from Twitter when I was done poking around."" Two years and almost 19,000 followers later, she is still at it. In the beginning, though, she and many other novelty account successes admit they didn't really know what ""it"" was. ""At first, I didn't know this account was about a cat, [but] as I explored the Twitterverse, I soon realized I had a character that people related to,"" she said. Real or not, Cat Food Breath is definitely a character. The cat (its gender is ambiguous) writes odes to the couch, gives its owner commands with Garfield-like acerbity and complains about the family dog -- lovingly called ""Labradum."" The San Francisco Fog . Other anonymous Twitter celebs began their accounts to educate and bring (hilarious) awareness to unappreciated things that can't speak for themselves, like the San Francisco fog that brings a chill to summers in that city. ""I love everything about the fog,"" said the man who created @KarlTheFog in August 2010. ""I think the way it sneaks over the hills is beautiful, mysterious and even a little romantic. I love how it stops at certain points above the city, creating a wall of clouds. And having moved here from a city where it was 100-plus degrees in the summer, I was mostly excited to not be dripping in sweat for three consecutive months."" The man, who also requested anonymity, was inspired by @BPGlobalPR, a popular parody response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Through the lens of ""Karl the Fog,"" he reports on the public's feelings toward the fog and acts like a PR rep for the maligned form of weather -- with a witty bent. Karl already has more than 5,000 followers. Giving ""Karl"" an identity has brought out emphatic and sometimes cursory responses -- especially when the fog blocked Fourth of July fireworks -- but the Twitterverse has been receptive overall, he said. ""[I get] lots of weather puns and haikus. My favorite tweets are when people take pictures of Karl and post them on Twitter or Instagram,"" the man said. ""Seeing so many people pick up on it and tag Karl in their pictures has been overwhelmingly cool."" The Orange Cone . Like Karl the Fog, @TheOrangeCone loves it when followers interact with him online. The Orange Cone was originally a MySpace account but came to Twitter after its creator discovered the witty tweets of Bronx Zoo's Cobra, last year's famously escaped snake, and motorsports satirist @nascarcasm. Today the Orange Cone keeps a following of more than 20,000 users up to date on NASCAR happenings. And his followers respond in droves. ""People notice cones in their everyday life and send pictures to me by the hundreds,"" said the man behind the Cone, who asked that his name not be used. ""I find that hilarious -- people stopping what they are doing in the real world to take a picture of an orange cone. I love it."" He added, ""Whenever the cone is hit during the course of a NASCAR race, my feed blows up."" When driver Kasey Kahne hit the cone during a February practice in Daytona, the Twitterverse came to Orange Cone's aid. ""Kasey made a Twitter apology and I added about 1,200 followers in the next hour,"" he said. ""It was insane."" Staying in character . For some, the prospect of interacting ""for real"" with followers is off the table. ""I am a bit like Banksy. Nobody knows who I am,"" said the man behind the foul-tempered @PigeonJon bird character, referring to the anonymous Britain-based artist. ""If possible, I'd like to keep it this way?"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Apart from that statement, Jon never broke character. Instead, he offered clues to his personality. ""I like Biscuits. I do not like Velcro,"" he wrote. The person behind the wildly popular @BronxZoosCobra, which chronicles the ""exploits"" of a real-life snake that briefly escaped its enclosure at the New York City zoo, also declined to break character in an e-mail exchange with CNN. The account has more than 200,000 followers. The strangest thing tweeted at the snake, its creator said, was a request for an endorsement from a high school student running for student government. ""I endorsed him,"" she wrote CNN. ""He lost. Snake bigotry at its best."" Online alter egos . Many novelty Twitterers with large followings are baffled by their popularity, which has led them to think about the relationship between the Internet and the real world. ""I have a feeling, and I could be wrong, that the people that follow The Orange Cone find it to be more 'real' than some of the drivers out on the track,"" its creator said. ""They can reach out and in most cases get a response. And the fact that no one knows who it is -- which means it could be anyone -- just adds to the mystery and the enjoyment."" Added the man behind KarlTheFog, ""I think people in the Bay Area like Karl because the fog was already a character in their lives. In a world that's becoming increasingly personalized, you can surround yourself with a cast of friends on the Internet that match your exact interests and sense of humor."" Being Karl has challenged him to think about sports, pop culture, and politics in ridiculous ways, he said. ""It forces me to be disciplined by sticking to a theme. Since my job isn't creative by nature, it gives me the chance to be as witty as I want."" Other Twitter users say that embodying nonhuman entities gives them the chance to create alter egos. ""The Cone gets to say and do the things I think we all wish we could do,"" its creator said. The man behind @WeirdHorse, a decidedly oddball stream of musings about, well, horse life, thinks he knows why his 137,000 followers appreciate his quirky humor. ""It's a breath of fresh air because it's not malicious,"" he said. ""It's not forced out by a brand with an agenda or political motive and it's whimsical, throw-away and easy to digest. People respond well to that sort of thing."" Whimsical, yes. But let's be honest: @WeirdHorse may have one little agenda. ""The recent demand for Weird Horse T-shirts and mugs from my site ... has been another perk,"" he said. What's your favorite nonhuman Twitter account? Sound off in the comments.

"(CNN) -- Louisville, Kentucky, police say a woman gave birth in the bathroom of the Kohl's clothing store where she worked, then left the newborn girl in a trash can where another worker later found the child dead. Jessica Price, 29, is charged with murder, abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence in the August 8 death of the baby. ""We believe the baby was born alive and would be alive today if she had provided basic care for the baby,"" Louisville police Lt. Todd Kessinger said, according to CNN affiliate WLKY-TV. According to Kessinger, Price went into the bathroom during her shift, then left for two hours, WLKY reported. When she came back to work, police were already on the scene after being summoned by store officials. ""The baby was discovered by another Kohl's worker. He went into the bathroom to change the trash bags and found the baby inside,"" WLKY quoted Kessinger as saying. Price, who remained jailed Friday pending an August 26 court appearance, told investigators she had concealed the pregnancy and gave birth at the store, Kessenger said, according to WLKY. What authorities didn't say is why. Kentucky has a state law allowing parents of newborns to give up unwanted babies at hospital emergency rooms, police stations and fire stations, according to CNN affiliate WHAS-TV.","Louisville woman charged with murder after newborn found in workplace trash can .

"(CNN) -- European champions Bayern Munich opened their Bundesliga title defense with a comfortable 3-1 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Allianz Arena Friday. It was very much business as usual for Bayern in their first league match under new coach Pep Guardiola once Arjen Robben had given them an early lead. Just like in May's Champions League final win over arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund, it was Franck Ribery who set up Robben for the first goal, the Dutchman chipping goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. The 12th minute strike was the first of the German campaign and was quickly followed by a Mario Mandzukic goal. Tony Kroos hit the woodwork as Bayern looked to move out of sight, but Brazilian defender Dante's own goal gave the visitors a lifeline just before the break. Bayern were awarded two penalties in quick succession in the second half, both for handball against Alvaro Dominguez . Ter Stegen kept out Thomas Muller's first effort to keep his side a single goal adrift, but when a second spot kick was awarded almost straight away, he could not repeat the trick from David Alaba's 69th minute effort. Bayern won the title by a record 25 points last season on the way to a treble as they added the Champions League and German Cup in Jupp Heynckes' final season in charge. Fomer Barcelona boss Guardiola took over in the summer and his first competitive match saw defeat to Dortmund in the German Super Cup, but a German Cup victory and three points in their league opener have followed. In France, the Ligue 1 campaign also began with the champions Paris St Germain in action at Montpellier. They trailed to a 10th minute goal from French midfielder Remy Cabella, but Maxwell earned them a point with the equalizer on the hour mark. Under new manager Laurent Blanc after the departure of Carlo Ancelotti to Real Madrid and with icon David Beckham retired, PSG still kept new signing Edinson Cavani on the bench from the start in the Stade de la Mosson. Cabella scored with a fierce shot after robbing PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to give the home side the early advantage. Ibrahimovic nearly made amends but his effort was parried away by Geoffrey Jourdren in the home goal. Brazilian Maxwell grabbed a share of the points as he netted after an Ibrahimovic assist. Montpellier's Moroccan defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari was red carded with 18 minutes left but the home side held out. ""We expected a better result,"" Blanc told AFP. ""But we created too little for my taste and made too many mistakes which allowed Montpellier to score."" Big spending Monaco open their campaign Saturday at Bordeaux, a former club of Blanc, who led them to the title in 2009.","Bayern Munich win season opener in Bundesliga title defense .

"(CNN) -- It is one of the most remarkable images of the 20th Century -- and no one is watching. As the thoroughbreds stampede around the bend at Britain's most prestigious horse race, a lone woman darts onto the track. In a shocking instant she is mowed to the ground by one of the animals galloping at more than 55 kilometers per hour, her hat rolling away as she is trampled beneath the pounding hooves. Yet take a closer look at the famous 1913 photo of suffragette Emily Davison sprawled on the Epsom Derby race track, and you'll see the majority of spectators are not straining to see the tragic scene -- but the winning horse crossing the finishing line. This Saturday marks 100 years since the feminist gave her life in a grisly -- and mysterious -- protest for women's right to vote, throwing herself in front of the King's horse during the most high-profile sporting event on the planet. ""Emily Davison's actions were of huge significance,"" Melissa Benn, British journalist and daughter of former Labour MP Tony Benn, told CNN. ""She cared enough about a principle - that women should have equal political rights - to sacrifice her health, her reputation with the establishment, her comfort, her safety and ultimately her life."" Feminism's forgotten hero? But a century after her horrifying death, how many people would be able to name one of the women credited with helping bring about the vote for British females? While 1950s U.S. civil rights protester Rosa Parks made history for her refusal to give up her bus seat, and Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi famously endured house arrest throughout the 1990s, the name ""Emily Davison"" has failed to gain such international recognition. ""Very few women - or men - would be able to name her,"" said Benn. ""A lot of it was due to the lack of widespread, mainstream media at the time -- limited photography, film, newspaper coverage. News was filtered through very few, limited sources -- and all of those were in the hands of powerful men."" Despite the huge coverage -- film technology was in its early days but the remarkable incident was captured on three newsreel cameras -- many newspaper front pages instead led on the winning horse. ""The big story in the papers the next day was the winning horse Craganour having the title taken off him for alleged rough riding,"" Michael Tanner, horse racing historian and author of the 'Suffragette Derby,' told CNN. ""The press treated Davison as a mad, middle-aged crank who had tried to destroy a pleasant day of sport for the masses."" Four days after she dashed beneath the pounding hooves, Davison died in hospital from her horrific injuries. The 40-year-old passed away amid public condemnation, with the Queen Mother reportedly sending her apologies to the jockey that the race had been interrupted by a ""brutal lunatic woman."" It's unclear whether Davison intended to commit suicide at the Epsom Derby. She was carrying a return train ticket and a banner, with some historians now suggesting she instead wanted to attach the banner to the royal racehorse Anmer. A militant campaigner . Born in London in 1872, Davison studied literature at Royal Holloway College before working as a teacher in an era when a woman's place was as a dedicated wife and mother in the home. At 32 she joined the Women's Social and Political Union -- known as the Suffragettes -- a campaign group for women's right to vote, who carried out militant protests such as chaining themselves to railings and prison hunger strikes. On the night of the 1911 census, Davison hid in a broom cupboard in the House of Commons so that when asked to fill out the form, the address of a woman without the vote would, ironically, be Parliament. In 1999, Melissa Benn's Labour MP father, Tony Benn, fitted a brass plate to the crypt door to commemorate the audacious protest. ""What's interesting is how Davison's tactics so suit a later age -- which is more dramatic and media-savvy,"" said Melissa. ""There was certainly controversy about the suffragettes' methods -- many thought they were publicity-seeking and destructive and too elitist -- and there was tremendous dispute within the movement about their tactics."" Davison was arrested nine times for her demonstrations and even in prison was a force to be reckoned with -- throwing herself down an iron staircase and going on hunger strikes. White funeral . While Davison's fatal Epsom Derby protest divided opinion, her coffin procession through the streets of London -- including a haunting sea of suffragettes dressed in white -- had the appearance of a ""state funeral,"" said Tanner. ""It was arguably bigger than Margret Thatcher's funeral,"" he added. ""The suffragettes held her up as a heroine. In death, she became a martyr."" Five years after Davison's death, in 1918, women aged over 30 won the vote in Britain. Ten years later the age was reduced to 21 -- equal with men. ""Her legacy today is an enfranchised female population: a growing number of women in mainstream politics; the first woman Prime Minister; a much more equal society,"" said Benn. ""But we still have a long way to go. Four fifths of Parliament are men -- it is a very masculine place."" Tanner however, argues that the outbreak of World War One the following year did more to help the women's movement than Davison's deadly protest. ""It was more of a result of the female contribution to the war effort, that the first movements were made to giving some concessions to women,"" he said. One thing is certain, 100 years ago Davison paid the ultimate sacrifice in her for equality -- with a fearlessness that still resonates today.","100 year anniversary of Suffragette Emily Davison's death at Epsom Derby .

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. stealth drone that crashed in Iran last week was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission which involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan, two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN Tuesday. A senior U.S. official with direct access to the assessment about what happened to the drone said it was tasked to fly over western Afghanistan and look for insurgent activity, with no directive to either fly into Iran or spy on Iran from Afghan airspace. A U.S. satellite quickly pinpointed the downed drone, which apparently sustained significant damage, the senior official said. ""The Iranians have a pile of rubble and are trying to figure what they have and what to do with it,"" the senior U.S. official said. The drone crashed solely because its guidance system failed, the official said. Officials confirmed to CNN it was an RQ-170 drone that was lost. Another U.S. official confirmed that when the drone crashed, the United States briefly considered all potential options for retrieving the aircraft or bombing the wreckage, but those ideas were quickly discarded as impractical. The officials have direct knowledge of the events, but spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence matters. CIA officials have declined to comment. Indications of the intelligence community's involvement in the drone incident emerged over the weekend, when NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan issued a statement saying, ""The UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) to which the Iranians are referring may be a U.S. unarmed reconnaissance aircraft that had been flying a mission over western Afghanistan late last week. The operators of the UAV lost control of the aircraft and had been working to determine its status."" Several coalition officials said at the time they had no direct knowledge of the incident and they were essentially ordered to put out this statement. It's significant that the statement only says ""operators"" of the UAV, without saying which part of the military or U.S. government might have been operating it, one coalition official said. U.S. officials are discounting the Iranian claim that they shot the drone down. The United States continues to say the crew of the UAV lost flight control and the drone then entered Iranian airspace. American officials over the years have been adamant that U.S. assets do not fly over Iranian air space. The RQ-170 Sentinel is a stealth drone developed by Lockheed Martin for the Air Force to help provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Iranian media reported that the RQ-170 was slightly damaged and in the hands of Iranian forces. ""Armed forces with a dominant control over the country's borders managed to identify and down the invading plane,"" reported Iran's official news agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency. An unnamed Iranian military official called it a ""clear example of aggression"" and added that Iran is ""fully ready to counter any aggression,"" the report said. In July, Iran's military made a similar claim, saying it downed a U.S. ""spy drone"" flying near its Fordo nuclear enrichment plant in Qom province. But Iran backtracked on the statement a few days later, saying the incident was actually part of a training exercise.","NEW: Guidance system failed, U.S. official said .

"Paris (CNN) -- French police arrested dozens of Greenpeace activists Tuesday who had forced their way into a nuclear power plant. During the early morning break-in, the activists hung anti-nuclear banners from the Fessenheim plant, France's oldest in operation and a flashpoint for anti-nuclear campaigners who say it is unsafe and should have been closed long ago. ""Today, militants of various nationalities, coming from all over Europe, protested and occupied Fessenheim, the oldest French nuclear center,"" Greenpeace said on its website. EDF, which operates the plant in eastern France, said 56 people had been detained. Local authorities said police remained on site as a precautionary measure. ""No activist entered inside the buildings. These events had no impact on the safety of facilities, which are operating normally,"" local authorities said in a written statement. Greenpeace wants Fessenheim, which has been in operation since 1977, to be closed immediately. The activists hung a banner from the roof of the plant that said ""stop risking Europe"" and called on French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to commit to generating energy from alternative sources. Hollande has pledged to close the plant by the end of 2016. CNN's Elaine Ly, Sandrine Amiel, Boriana Milanova and Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report .","Environmental activists hang banner at nuclear plant .

"(CNN) -- The Illinois Senate approved the use of marijuana for medical purposes on Friday, sending the measure to the governor's desk. The move by Illinois lawmakers came the same day that Ohio's attorney general certified a petition for a proposed amendment that would allow marijuana be used for industrial, medical and therapeutic purposes. If approved, Illinois and Ohio would join 19 states and the District of Columbia that have some variation of a medical marijuana law. Under the approved law in Illinois, a four-year trial would establish 60 dispensing centers across the state and allow doctors to prescribe 2.5 ounces of marijuana to a patient every two weeks. To be prescribed medical marijuana, patients would need to have one of 42 conditions, including cancer and HIV, according to the legislation. Patients also would undergo background checks. Gov. Pat Quinn has not indicated whether he will sign the bill. Meanwhile, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine on Friday certified a petition for a proposed amendment allowing for medical marijuana, the first step in an attempt by the Ohio Rights Group to put the issue to a statewide vote in 2014. ""Without passing upon the advisability of the approval or rejection of the measure to be referred, I hereby certify that the summary is a fair and truthful statement of the proposed constitutional amendment,"" DeWine said in a letter to the Ohio Ballot Board.

"(CNN) -- He began his career as a bus driver in Caracas, and then rose through the ranks to become a member of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's inner circle. Now Vice President Nicolas Maduro is the country's interim leader. Chavez died Tuesday after a long battle with cancer. He had been Venezuela's president since 1999. Venezuela will hold elections in 30 days and Maduro is assuming the presidency during the interim period, Foreign Minister Elias Jaua told state-run VTV on Tuesday. U.S. reaction to Chavez's death: from mourning to celebration . Shortly before his last trip to Cuba for cancer surgery, Chavez tapped Maduro as his replacement ""if something were to happen that would incapacitate me"" and called for voters to support him. ""My firm opinion, as clear as the full moon -- irrevocable, absolute, total -- is ... that you elect Nicolas Maduro as president,"" Chavez said in early December, waving a copy of the Venezuelan Constitution as he spoke. ""I ask this of you from my heart. He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot."" That televised address marked the first time the Venezuelan president had specified a successor since he announced he had cancer in June 2011. Maduro, 50, has long been a high-profile face in Chavez's administration. Serving as both the country's vice president and foreign minister, he often was seen in the front row of Chavez's press conferences and traveled to Cuba many times alongside Chavez as he underwent cancer treatment. U.S. open to 'more constructive relationship' with Venezuela . ""He is without a doubt one of the ministers who is closest to Chavez,"" political analyst German Campos told CNN en EspaÃ±ol after Chavez tapped Maduro as vice president in October. As foreign minister, Maduro was the country's top diplomat as ties grew with Cuba and tensions rose with the United States. In recent years, he has been an outspoken critic of U.S. policies toward Venezuela. When the Treasury Department added four Venezuelan officials to its drug kingpin list in 2011, Maduro accused the U.S. agency of acting as ""a sort of world police agency"" that has falsely named ""decent citizens of our country ... as drug traffickers."" ""A country like that has no moral authority to judge generals and political officials in Venezuela,"" he said. ""We reject it and we believe that the drug trafficking mafias are there, in a sick society like the United States."" After security screeners detained him at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2006, Maduro called the U.S. government ""racist"" and ""Nazi"" and said the United States does not appreciate Latin American countries. But Maduro doesn't always take an extreme tack, said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts. Hugo Chavez's death draws sympathy, anger . ""On the one hand, he has been behind some of the most radical, crazy foreign policy decisions of the Chavez administration. Support for Libya, you name it, all the radical decisions, he has been behind them,"" Corrales said. ""But he also has been behind some of the most pragmatic and conciliatory decisions, including the turnaround in relations with Colombia."" That's a marked contrast with the inflammatory Chavez, who rarely turned to compromise, Corrales said. Before his role representing Venezuela abroad, Maduro honed his political skills at home. He became a union leader while working for the Caracas metro system. After Chavez came to power in 1999, Maduro helped draft a new constitution. He served as a congressman until 2006, when he was tapped as foreign minister. As Maduro temporarily assumes the presidency, analysts have said it's difficult to tell whether anyone else from Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela will have what it takes to win at the polls. They note that Chavez's political strength was largely fueled by his ability to personally connect with throngs of dedicated followers -- dubbed ""Chavistas"" for their devotion to the president. And that personal connection with his supporters is ""what's held things together in Venezuela,"" according to Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank. Opinion: After Chavez, a power vacuum . Polls have indicated that several possible successors from within the party's ranks haven't generated the same kind of enthusiasm among Chavez's supporters. A February 2012 poll by the Datanalisis firm showed Maduro with 9.8% support among militant members of Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela. But that was before Chavez's remarks supporting Maduro, which were seen as likely to bolster support for the vice president within the government and among fervent Chavistas, Corrales said. ""When popular presidents make an endorsement, that always has an effect,"" Corrales said. When he named Maduro as vice president, Chavez noted his extensive experience on ""different battlefronts."" ""The bourgeoisie make fun of Nicolas Maduro because he was a bus driver,"" Chavez said, ""and look where he's going now."" Chavez leaves a revolutionary legacy .","Analyst: Maduro was behind radical foreign policy decisions, also compromises .
