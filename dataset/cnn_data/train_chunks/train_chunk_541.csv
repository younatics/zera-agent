The NHS has made an urgent appeal for O Negative blood donors after the early norovirus outbreak and the festive period caused a drop in donations. The National Blood Service (NBS) said it had increased stocks of the blood type before Christmas but high demand meant it was running low. More than one million people are believed to have been affected by the vomiting bug outbreak, which led several hospitals to close their doors before Christmas in a bid to contain its spread. An urgent appeal has been made for donors as stocks of O Negative blood are in low supply . An NBS spokesman said: 'Blood stocks can often dip around holiday time as people get distracted and can’t always attend their sessions. 'In addition, the recent outbreak of norovirus has led to a dramatic increase in the number of people correctly cancelling their appointments. 'Non-attendance by O Negative donors increased by 50 per cent just before New Year.' Donors with O Negative blood make up around seven per cent of the population and are known as the 'universal donor' as their blood can safely be given to patients with a different blood group. This can prove vital in an emergency situation where there may not be time for an immediate blood group testing to be carried out. About 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over Christmas according to the latest figures, with the number of confirmed cases 72 per cent higher than this time last year. The dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the country. 1.1 million people are said to have been affected by Norovirus (shown here under a microscope) During the two weeks up to December 30, there were 29 hospital outbreaks reported, compared with 70 in the previous fortnight, bringing the total for the season to 590. A total of 3,877 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus have now been recorded in England and Wales - up on the 2,255 of last year. But the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said that for every reported case, an estimated 288 were not flagged up, meaning about 1.12 million people could have contracted the illness this season. Blood stocks are also needed for patients being treated for diseases like cancer and leukaemia, with anyone aged 17 upward who is in generally good health a potential donor. Jon Latham, assistant director of marketing for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: 'We would like to urge all O negative donors to walk into their most convenient donor session to give blood to help rebuild stock levels. 'We are always grateful to donors who respond to calls such as this and appreciate that in doing so they do give up some of their precious time. 'Waiting times may vary in the next few days as we try to accommodate all donors. 'Demand for blood never stops and O negative donors can help to ensure healthy blood stocks in the upcoming weeks, by giving blood now and in the next few days.'","Stocks of O Negative blood - which can be given to people of different blood groups - are in low supply .

When photo-sharing website Instagram banned the use of hashtags using pro-anorexia keywords last April, it was widely praised. But now British eating disorder charity, Beat, has spoken out to say the site still isn't doing enough. Although users attempting to search keywords such as 'thinspiration' or 'proanorexia' can no longer do so, more than 300,000 images featuring frighteningly thin women or acts of self harm are still available on the site. Disturbing: Images like this mock-up are frequently found on Instagram . Despite removing more than 30,000 . graphic photos, the site's 80 million users can still access 'thinspo' content simply by using 'eating disorder' as the search term. 'It’s worrying that with the powerful medium of social networking and the growing popularity of phone apps such as Instagram, people are able to easily access images that encourage the individual to believe that an eating disorder is a lifestyle choice and to avoid treatment,' a Beat spokesperson told The Telegraph. 'Some sites have acted to remove content that is seen as dangerous and encouraging people to do dangerous things. Eating disorders as a lifestyle choice should be treated in the same way.' Following the site's decision to ban 'thinspo' content, users of Instagram are being encouraged to report pro-anorexia content so the website can remove it. Tragic: Uruguayan sisters Luisel (left) and Eliana Ramos died within months of each other due to complications brought on by anorexia . 'We won’t allow accounts, images, or . hashtags dedicated to glorifying, promoting, or encouraging self-harm,' say the new guidelines. 'Should users come across content of . that nature, we recommend flagging the photo or flagging the user as a . 'terms of service' violation for our support team to review.' Nevertheless, anyone who carries out a quick search of the site today will see that thousands of the disturbing photos are still available, including a shocking image of one user, sicklyskinny's emaciated rib cage. More worryingly still, the image received 64 'likes' from users with monikers such as 'pleaseletmebeskinny' and 'watch_me_be_skinny'. Instagram isn't the only photo-sharing site to have fallen foul of anti-anorexia campaigners. Pinterest and Tumblr have both come under fire for allowing picture boards and messages that feature 'pro ana' content, although the latter has taken steps to prevent 'thinspiration' being posted. Although Instagram hasn’t disabled the search function for all eating disorder-related terms, a content advisory warning plus a link to the National Eating Disorders website appears before users are redirected to the photos. Campaigner: French model and anorexia sufferer, Isabelle Caro, died of the illness in 2010 - months after appearing in this Italian anti-anorexia campaign . However, users are still free to post provocative comments that glorify eating disorders and it's these that Beat wants the site to be more proactive about curbing. 'Beat also believes that individuals should be pointed towards pro recovery sites,' the spokesperson told the Telegraph. 'Providing acceptance and support throughout society [needs to happen] so that these alternative sites are no longer the only refuge a person feels they can seek.'

Thailand's holiday islands will be made a 'gun free zone' within a year following the killing of British tourist Stephen Ashton. The 22-year-old was shot dead at a New Year's Eve beach party on the island of Koh Phangan. The move comes as the Foreign Office updated its travel advice to Brits visiting Thailand warning them that Westerners can be subject to 'vicious, unprovoked attacks by gangs' on the party island. Stephen Ashton, 22, died after being shot at a New Year's Eve party on the Thai holiday island of Koh Phangan . Governor Chatpong Chataraputi said gun . licenses will no longer be issued or renewed as part of raft of tighter . security measures aimed at restoring confidence. Authorities said they will also carry out more searches on people arriving on the island and confiscate any weapons found. The measures will be taken in Koh Samui, and Koh Phangan - known as the Samui archipelago - and other tourist spots said the Governor of Surat Thani Province. But the move is being viewed by many as a knee-jerk reaction to the negative publicity surrounding the death of Stephen Ashton which will have little effect. New travel advice for Thailand on the Foreign Office website says: 'Seven British nationals have been murdered in Thailand since January 2009. 'Western tourists have been victims of vicious, unprovoked attacks by gangs in Koh Phangan. These attacks are particularly common around the time of the Full Moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars in Haad Rin on Koh Phangan. 'On 1 January 2013 a British national was killed in a shooting incident while at a beach party in Haad Rin. Exercise caution when in this area at any time, especially after dark.' Ekkapan Kaewkla, 26, has been charged with killing Mr Ashton and carrying a weapon following the incident on the paradise island of Koh Phangan. Stephen Ashton was shot as he danced with friends at the the Zoom Bar on Haad Rin Beach (file photo) 21.5million tourists visited Thailand last year including 800,000 British visitors . Today, he told a court in the neighbouring larger island of Koh Samui that the shooting was a mistake. 'I was aiming at someone else but the foreigner got in the way', he said. The court heard he already had his finger pressured on the trigger. Ekkapan Kaewkla, 26, (centre), was arrested on the Thai island of Koh Phangan after 22-year-old Briton Stephen Ashton was killed by a stray bullet at a New Year's Eve . Kaewkla was remanded in custody to prison in Koh Samui for 12 days. It is not clear when the full case will be heard. But under Thai law the trial should begin within 84 days. The court has not accepted a plea from him for charges which police said would be manslaughter and illegal possession of a gun. In court and handcuffed, Kaewkla said 'sorry' to the media and other foreigners. Mr Ashton, a former city trader from Purley, south London, was enjoying New Year celebrations when he was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight between rival gangs. Police on Koh Phangan said Mr Ashton was with a group of friends and 300 other tourists celebrating the countdown to 2013 at a pub and restaurant called the Zoom Bar when he was shot by a home-made gun at Haad Rin beach shortly after 4am. Last year, up to 21.5 million tourists visited Thailand, higher than the projected 20.5 million. The government aims for 21 million arrivals this year and hopes to receive up to 22.2 million in 2014. Prakit Chinamourphong, vice president of the Thai Hotels Association, said the 'gun free' campaign should be extended to all resorts in Thailand. He said: 'The country's image is being destroyed because many tourists had been killed, robbed or raped in key tourist destinations like Pattaya, Phuket and Krabi.' 'If the government wants to see continual growth in tourism, then they . should move to protect visitors and end this problem.' Thailand has the highest number of guns per capita of any country in Asia.","Governor promises security measures after death of Stephen Ashton .

A nurse trained to grade five standard of care was so incompetent she couldn't even calculate a patient's heart rate, a disciplinary hearing heard. Juleth McKenzie was hauled in front of the Nursing and Midwifery Council after she gave a dialysis patient a drink of Lucozade instead of a glucose drip. The nurse, who worked at Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, didn't know the difference between milligrams and micrograms and checked a patient's temperature instead of blood pressure - despite having qualified eight years ago. Juleth Deborah Mckenzie was hauled in front of The Nursing and Midwivery Council after she gave a dialysis patient a drink of Lucozade instead of a glucose drip . Eleven allegations of incompetent errors against McKenzie were either admitted or found proved against the nurse. Following an NMC hearing in November last year, at which McKenzie was not present or represented at, her fitness to practise was found impaired by lack of competence. She was handed a 12 month suspension order, according to the findings of the hearing which have now been released. The allegations heard by an NMC conduct and competence panel included giving medication to patients she was not authorised to do so, prioritising getting personal details of a patient over stemming bleeding and assessing a patient with Parkinson's disease as being independent and needing no care or support. She was also accused of attempting to give drugs which had already been given, preparing drugs for oral administration for a patient who was nil by mouth, being unfamiliar with equipment on a resuscitation trolley, making four errors in relation to giving Heparin, giving prescription eye drops when not authorised and giving them to the wrong patient, failing to register patients and putting the wrong hospital number on a patient's wristband and not being aware of the difference between milligrams and micrograms and checking a patient's temperature instead of blood pressure. McKenzie worked at Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and was found to not know the difference between milligrams and micrograms . McKenzie was placed on the Trust's poor performance plan and was diagnosed with dyslexia and poor short-term visual memory . Miss McKenzie's patients on the renal ward and senior colleagues described how she 'places patients at risk every time she put them on dialysis'. While others said she was a very caring person who wanted to deliver good practice, she was 'out of her depth and lacking in ability' and was described as 'getting muddled and panicked'. Patients on the dialysis ward had even gone as far as to ask to not be treated by Miss McKenzie. The panel heard how the job on the renal ward was Miss McKenzie's first substantive post after qualifying in 2005. She was required to complete a new starters programme which most nurses complete within three months, but after six months concerns remained about her ability as a registered nurse. By December 2006, she had been placed on the Trust's poor performance plan and was diagnosed with dyslexia and poor short-term visual memory. McKenzie was redeployed to a less acute area on ward 18 but she continued to make fundamental errors. She became a healthcare assistant but even in this capacity concern was expressed about her competence and she left the Trust on November 30, 2008. The Royal College of Nursing's career framework outlines nine levels of nursing. McKenzie was a level 5 nurse, qualified to 'provide general nursing services to defined groups'. No evidence was given to the panel which gave it any concern that the hospital had acted in appropriately or unsympathetically towards Miss McKenzie. A spokesman for the Foundation Trust, which runs Bradford Royal Infirmary and St Luke's Hospital, said: 'The Trust took appropriate action to safeguard patients and Miss McKenzie managed in accordance with the Trust's capability procedures and was provided with extensive supervision and support.'","Juleth McKenzie didn't know difference between milligrams and micrograms .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:26 EST, 6 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:27 EST, 7 May 2012 . The safety of one of the most popular forms of IVF has been called into question after a study showed it doubled the risk of birth defects. Researchers found that one in ten babies born through ICSI suffered some form of abnormality. This compares with just over one in 20 of those conceived naturally. But what experts don’t know yet is whether the problems are caused by the treatment, or the fact couples having it are at higher risk of defects anyway. Crucial moment: A single sperm is injected directly into an egg in ICSI treatment . ICSI – or intracytoplasmic sperm injection – is used to treat male infertility. It involves injecting a sperm directly into an egg with a fine glass needle. More than 23,000 procedures were performed last year and it represents just over half of all IVF treatments . It can help couples who were previously unable to conceive because the man’s sperm count was low or they were of too poor quality to swim up to the egg. In this latest study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the University of Adelaide in Australia looked at more than 300,000 births. They found that babies born via ICSI were 57 per cent more likely to suffer some form of abnormality. Questions and answers on IVF . These ranged from serious defects of the heart and digestive system to relatively minor abnormalities such as club feet that could be fixed with surgery. Overall 9.9 per cent of babies born through ICSI had a defect compared with 5.8 per cent of those born naturally. By contrast, standard IVF – where semen containing thousands of sperm is placed in a dish with eggs – was found to be no more risky than natural conception, once the couple’s age and other factors had been accounted for. Experts are unsure whether it is the treatment causing the defects or the poor quality sperm of the men. Lead author Professor Michael Davies, from the University of Adelaide, said: ‘We know from the study that standard IVF is safe. But we also now know that with ICSI, the risk is sky high.’ He pointed out that the technique involved implanting faulty sperm into an egg – in nature these would be weeded out. Dr Allan Pacey, fertility expert at the University of Sheffield and chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: ‘An important point to make is that we know that babies conceived naturally to couples previously diagnosed with infertility are also  at slightly higher risk, which suggests that it may be something to do with the “infertility” rather than the “technology” used to conceive them. ‘It should be stressed that the vast majority of babies born  are healthy and the actual risks of any problems being detected are small.’ And Professor Peter Illingworth, of the University of Sydney, said: ‘It may well be that the sort of families who have to use ICSI have extreme sperm damage, and this may be the explanation as to why there is a higher rate of congenital abnormalities.’ Only two years ago the inventor of ICSI, André van Steirteghem, warned it was being overused. Professor Steirteghem – who invented it in Belgium in 1991 – told a conference that it should only be used as a last resort as it may cause problems in children. Since the news of this study broke a number of women have contacted the Mail to say they have used the technique and had perfectly healthy babies. Campaigners urged couples to speak to their doctors if they were concerned. Clare Lewis-Jones, of leading patient charity, Infertility Network UK, said: ‘IVF and ICSI bring joy to tens of thousands of people every year – last year there were around 60,000 cycles of IVF in the UK and without this many couples would never experience the joy of having a child of their own. ‘If patients are concerned by this research, I would recommend they speak directly to their clinician who will be able to discuss their individual situation.’ CASE STUDY . Katy and David Shiers used ICSI to have their daughter Grace after spending four years trying to conceive naturally. Mrs Shiers, 27, had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, which can lead to problems in becoming pregnant. Her 26-year-old husband had arthritis and his treatment could have affected his own fertility. After one round of IVF failed, the couple, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, were offered ICSI by the Wessex Fertility clinic in Southampton. Research plea: David and Katy Shiers with daughter Grace as a baby . Grace, now three, developed a brain cyst and kidney problems and was born at only 26 weeks. Mrs Shiers, who looks after Grace full-time, said: ‘When Grace was in the neonatal intensive care ward, I would say about 80 per cent of the other babies there had been conceived using fertility treatment. ‘At least two were definitely from ICSI. There may well be something in that. ‘I obviously don’t know whether Grace’s problems are related to ICSI. But I would have been happier if someone had spelled out the risks. I don’t remember that happening at the time. ‘When you’re so desperate to have a family, as we were, someone could tell you it would be born with three heads and you wouldn’t care. ‘If someone said, “There is a low risk your child could be disabled”, I’d see that as a high chance the baby would be fine. ‘Having said that, I would 100 per cent back any move to issue parents doing this with more warnings about what the problems could be to avoid the shock we had. ‘There needs to be so much more research.’","Survey shows injections used by 20,000 British couples a year reveals one in ten babies born with abnormalities .

Ordeal: Laurie Eberhardt, 67, was shot in the wrist by a stray bullet as she celebrated New Year's Eve . A grandmother has been hit by a falling bullet while watching New Year's Eve fireworks from a balcony of a Florida yacht club. Laurie Eberhardt, 67, was watching the display after an evening of dinner and dancing with her husband and friends at  St. Petersburg Yacht Club when she felt a searing pain in her wrist shortly after midnight. A bullet had entered her right wrist and travelled up her arm before exiting halfway up her forearm. Police believe it came from a rifle that someone fired in the air to celebrate New Year. 'She looked down and saw the entry hole . and the bleeding and said, ""I've been shot!""' her husband Henry Eberhardt, 73, told the Tampa Bay Times. Her friends struggled to comprehend exactly what she had said. 'It's not something you're going to hear people say all the time,' Mr Eberhardt added. 'It's just excruciating,' his wife told WTSP of the experience. 'It's almost like fire going into my arm and my wrist. I've never felt anything so painful and so scary.' One of their friends, a retired physician, helped her get seated and apply pressure to the wound while others called 911. She was taken to Bayfront Medical Center, . where doctors removed a large-caliber bullet from her wrist, and she was released three hours later. Scene: The Eberhardts were on a balcony at St Petersburg yacht club when she was struck by the bullet . Yet she said she is still reeling from the terrifying experience. 'I was extremely lucky that the . bullet, which fell from the sky as downtown St. Petersburg's celebration . took place, did not cause a more serious injury or even my death,' Mrs . Eberhardt said in a statement. 'This has been one of the most horrifying experiences of my life.' An investigation into the shooting is ongoing, police said. While police do not know where the bullet came from, they could match . it to the gun if evidence leads them to the weapon, police said. Fears: Laurie, pictured second right with her husband Henry, right, said she was lucky she wasn't killed . Safe: Mrs Eberhardt, pictured with her grandchildren, called the pain from the wound 'excruciating' Hit: Diego Duran, 12 . More people are injured or killed each year by falling bullets than many would believe. From 1985 to 1992, 118 victims of gunshot wounds in the Los Angeles area alone were thought to have been struck by them. These included people hit by bullets while going about their everyday business. The chance of being killed by a falling bullet is much higher than a typical shooting - because those unlucky enough to be hit by falling shells are more likely to be struck on the head. Doctors say a spent bullet falls back to Earth with a speed of between 90 and 180 metres per second. A bullet travelling at less than 60 metres per second can cause a fatal skull injury. Last year, Diego Duran (pictured) was shot in the head while celebrating NYE outside his Florida home, but survived. It came weeks after Rachel Yoder, a teenage Amish girl, died in a 'freak accident' in Ohio after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile away. Authorities have noted more injuries caused by gunshots into the air in recent years. 'People think of it as harmless, . because they're point up in the air,' St Petersburg police spokesman . Mike Puetz said. 'But it's been shown time and time again; this is just . one of those things that can have very, very, negative results. 'It's obviously in the public mind now . about this type of issue. But we still run into the situation where, . unfortunately, some members of the public are not getting the message.' The shooting comes a year after 12-year-old Diego Duran was hit in the head by a bullet while watching New Year's fireworks outside his family's home in Ruskin, Florida. The boy's mother saw him fall to the ground, bleeding from his eyes and nose. He was rushed to hospital and staff found a bullet had entered the top of his head and had become lodged in his cheek. Diego survived the ordeal and his family has since formed the nonprofit group Bullet Free Sky to raise awareness of the dangers of celebratory gunfire. It came after a 15-year-old Amish . girl, Rachel Yoder, was shot dead while riding her horse and cart back . from a Christmas party after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile . away. At first it was thought she died as a result of falling from her buggy after her brother found her in a pool of blood. But when she got to the hospital they found a bullet lodged in her head.

A boy of five who had to have 13 milk teeth removed after suffering severe toothache is to receive a £9,000 payout from his dentist. Cameron Jackson had the decayed teeth – including his entire top row – taken out when he was three, leaving him only seven teeth until his adult set grows. His mother took legal action against his dentist, who failed to spot the decay after Cameron’s toothache grew worse. Cameron Jackson, pictured with his mum Wendy, had to have 13 teeth removed after suffering toothache at the age of three . They have now reached an out-of-court settlement and Cameron will receive the money when he is 18. Dr Raymond Matloa, the dentist at the . Fountain Street Medical Practice in Morley, Leeds, has not admitted . liability for the loss of the boy’s teeth. It is not known why Cameron’s teeth deteriorated, but his mother, Wendy Jackson, insists he was not eating any sweets. ‘I first realised something was wrong . when Cameron was unable to eat solid food at about 18 months,’ she said. ‘He didn’t eat solid food at all and wouldn’t even touch sweets. He . just drank milk.’ Removed: Cameron was just three years old when he had 13 of his milk teeth taken out, leaving him with seven for the next few years . Mrs Jackson, from Bradford, West . Yorkshire, said she grew increasingly concerned. ‘His dentist kept . saying his teeth were fine but even I could see they were yellow, not . white like milk teeth should be,’ she said. ‘The dentist advised us to brush them . more but when we did his teeth literally crumbled and ended up looking . like little pegs. Cameron would scream and his gums would bleed like . crazy. He woke up every night crying.’ Mrs Jackson, 31, whose two other . children, aged ten and two, have normal teeth with no fillings, gave . Cameron pain relief every evening. ‘The dentist said he was eating too . many sweets, which I knew wasn’t right because Cameron never touched any . solid food, never mind sweets,’ she said. Settlement: Cameron will receive the £9,000 when he reaches his 18th birthday, by which time he will also have all of his teeth back . She took Cameron to her GP but was . told he was fine, she said. In December 2010, Dr Matloa referred him to .

"Wenger reveals he snubbed Ba for Giroud last summer . Arsenal are ramping up efforts to bring in Holtby . Gunners boss says Michu was never on club's radar . By . Neil Ashton . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 3 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:27 EST, 4 January 2013 . As time ticks on in the January transfer window, Arsene Wenger offered a fascinating insight into modern-day recruitment methods on Thursday. Stressing that the job was tougher than when he arrived at Arsenal in September 1996, he admitted that the pressure is always on ‘to find the next Lionel Messi’. Wenger’s exceptional record in the transfer market, especially in his early years as Arsenal’s manager, is up there with the very best. Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Emmanuel Petit, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, Edu, Lauren and Kolo Toure were among his finest acquisitions. One-off: Don't expect a Lionel Messi clone at Arsenal any time soon . Mastermind: Wenger's scouting network uncovered the likes of Patrick Vieira . When they were winning trophies he was the supreme talent-spotter, well ahead of the rest in England. Wenger said: ‘People want to see the next Lionel Messi - they don’t want to see a promising guy. The name of the player gives people hope, but when they haven’t heard of them people are already sceptical. ‘It’s much more difficult for us now. The competition is higher. We are trying to diversify a bit more because we are limited in England. A new market that is very interesting is Japan - it’s very competitive. ‘The country where we were really competitive in the past was France, but they produce less top players than they did, say, 15 years ago. ‘The emerging countries look to be Germany and Spain - they have taken over from France and they have many good, young players.’ One of them, Lewis Holtby, plays in Germany for Schalke 04 and Wenger admitted on Thursday that he is interested in signing him. On the radar: German international midfielder Lewis Holtby . Holtby, 22, has made it clear that he will not be signing a new contract at the Veltins-Arena and will be leaving at the end of the season on a free transfer. Wenger added: ‘We have looked at him, yes,’ but that is as far as he would be drawn on the Germany midfielder. He also admitted that Chelsea’s latest recruit, Demba Ba, was a target last summer, but he opted instead for Montpellier forward Olivier Giroud. Wenger said: ‘It was Giroud or Demba Ba in the summer — they are very similar players. I was a bit cautious about the noises on Ba’s knee injury, but someone told me the problem he has is manageable and can be prevented.’ Wenger has other targets in January, but Arsenal are being out-manoeuvred by Manchester United in the chase for Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha. In terms of trophy-winning potential, Arsenal cannot compete with United and they are aware that Zaha is right at the top of Sir Alex Ferguson’s wishlist. Second favourites: Arsenal are behind United in the running for Zaha . With Theo Walcott expected to sign a new contract with Arsenal in the coming weeks, it may be that Wenger’s interest in the Championship’s best young player fades. Instead he will turn to the Continent again, reminding his scouts that the demand at Arsenal is to sign only the best talent. Wenger conceded on Thursday that although he was aware of Michu before he signed for Swansea in the summer, he didn’t realise quite what a threat he would prove in the Premier League. Over the Ba; Wenger declined the chance to sign the Newcastle striker last summer and instead chose Olivier Giroud . On Sunday the Gunners will come across him again when they travel to the Liberty Stadium for their FA Cup third-round tie against Swansea. Wenger added: ‘Honestly, Michu was not on our radar. You needed to have really deep knowledge of the market in Spain to do that. Michael Laudrup did because he has the connections. ‘We keep our scouts alert, but when you are a big club like Arsenal your scouts are a little bit more cautious about players. ‘Naturally they are less likely to look at players with smaller clubs. But what Michu is doing is not accidental. He is a really good player.’","Wenger reveals he snubbed Ba for Giroud last summer .

The job is believed to be for up to three years and virtually guarantees Malala will remain in the UK. Ziauddin Yousufzai, pictured here with Malala and her two younger brothers Atal Khan (far right) and Khushal Khan (centre). Reports say the Pakistani government have given him a job in Birmingham, where Malala is undergoing treatment . Malala was targeted by the Taliban in Pakistan for her work campaigning for women's rights and freedom of access to education in the country. In October last year she was shot in the head in an assassination attempt as she sat on the school bus. She was taken to hospital in Pakistan and later flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.The Taliban have vowed to target her again. Malala, from the town of Mingora in the Swat district of Pakistan, was hit just above her left eye by a bullet which travelled along her jaw and grazed the edge of her brain. While recovering in hospital in the UK in October, she was visited by Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari.

Brave: Malala recovering in Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The Taliban have vowed to target her again . In November, her father issued a statement thanking well-wishers for their support and the gifts they had sent his daughter. Speaking at the time, he said: 'She wants me to tell everyone how grateful she is and is amazed that men, women and children from across the world are interested in her well-being. 'We deeply feel the heart-touching good wishes of the people across the world of all castes, colour and creed. 'I am awfully thankful to all the peace-loving well-wishers who strongly condemn the assassination attempt on Malala, who pray for her health and support the grand cause of peace, education, freedom of thought and freedom of expression.' The attack on Malala sparked vigils and protests supporting her throughout the world . He described the decision to fly his daughter to hospital in Britain as a 'miracle' and vowed that she would 'rise again'. The cost of Malala's ongoing medical care is being met by the Pakistan government, while the United Arab Emirates provided the air ambulance which transported her to the UK.

She was baptised by the name - Blaer in her own language - but the country does not allow babies to be called anything that is not on a government-approved list. A handful of other states, including Germany and Denmark, also have this rule. Icelanders are generally comfortable with a firm state role, and abide by the Personal Names Register, a list of 1,712 male names and 1,853 female names. Identity crisis: Blaer Bjarkardottir, 15, left, was given her name by her mother, Bjork Eidsdottir - but they were later told by the priest who baptised Blaer that it had been a mistake . All fit Icelandic grammar and pronunciation rules and officials claim they will protect children from embarrassment. Parents can take from the list or apply to a committee with alternative ideas. Blaer Bjarkardottir's mother, Bjork Eidsdottir, said she learned her daughter's name was not on the register only after the priest who baptised the child later informed her he had mistakenly allowed it. 'I had no idea that the name wasn't on the list, the famous list of names that you can choose from,' said Mrs Eidsdottir, adding she knew a Blaer whose name was accepted in 1973. Rock 'n' roll: The name Elvis was recently permitted because it fits the guidelines - but choices such as Cara, Carolina and Christa were rejected because the letter 'c' is not in Iceland's 32-letter alphabet . This time, the panel turned it down on the grounds that the word Blaer takes a masculine article, despite the fact that it was used for a female character in a novel by Iceland's revered Nobel Prize-winning author Halldor Laxness. Given names are even more significant in tiny Iceland than in many other countries - everyone is listed in the phone book by their first names, while surnames are based on a parent's given name. Even the president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, is addressed simply as Olafur. As a consequence of the ruling, Blaer has no official name and is only identified as 'Stulka' - or 'girl' - on all her official documents. This has led to years of frustration as she has had to explain the story at the bank, when renewing her passport and when dealing with the country's bureaucracy. Her mother is hoping that will change with her suit, the first time someone has challenged a names committee decision in court. Although the law has become more relaxed in recent years - with the name Elvis permitted as fitting the guidelines - choices such as Cara, Carolina, Cesil, and Christa have been rejected outright because the letter 'c' is not part of Iceland's 32-letter alphabet. 'The law is pretty straightforward so in many cases it's clearly going to be a yes or a no,' said Agusta Thorbergsdottir, the head of the panel of three appointed by the government to a four-year term. Other cases are more subjective. 'What one person finds beautiful, another person may find ugly,' she acknowledged, pointing to 'Satania' as one unacceptable case because it was deemed too close to 'Satan.' The board also has veto power over people who want to change their names later in life - rejecting, for instance, middle names like Zeppelin and X. 1. Elvis (Sweden) 2. Superman (Sweden) 3. 4Real (New Zealand . 4. Carolina (Iceland) 5. Tom (Portugal) 6. Friday (Italy) 7. Bridge (Norway) 8. @ (China) 9. Anus (Denmark) 10. Devil (Japan) 1. Elvis (Iceland) 2.

Monkey (Australia) When the artist Birgir Orn Thoroddsen applied to have his name legally changed to Curver, which he had used in one form or another since age 15, he said he knew full well the committee would reject his application. 'I was inspired by Prince who changed his name to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince and Puff Daddy who changed his to P. Diddy and then Diddy with seemingly little thought or criticism,' he said. 'I applied to the committee, but of course I got the ""no"" that I expected.' On his 30th birthday, he bought a full-page advertisement that read, 'From February 1, 2006, I hereby change my name to Curver Thoroddsen. I ask the nation, my friends and colleagues to respect my decision.' He added: 'I can understand a clause to protect children from being named something like ""Dog poo"", but it is strange that an adult cannot change his name to what he truly wants. Mrs Eidsdottir said she is prepared to take the case all the way to the country's Supreme Court if a court doesn't overturn the commission decision on January 25. 'So many strange names have been allowed, which makes this even more frustrating because Blaer is a perfectly Icelandic name,' said Mrs Eidsdottir. 'It seems like a basic human right to be able to name your child what you want, especially if it doesn't harm your child in any way. 'And my daughter loves her name.'","Blaer is officially known as 'Girl' - which can cause trouble at the bank .

John Sheardown, a former Canadian diplomat who sheltered American citizens in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, has died aged 88. The cool-headed Mr Sheardown played a pivotal role in the so-called Canadian Caper when CIA operatives posed as members of an Irish film production company to rescue US citizens on the run following the Iranian revolution. The audacious plan was celebrated in last year's film Argo directed by Ben Affleck, however Mr Sheardown did not feature as a character. Passing: John Sheardown, a former Canadian diplomat who sheltered six America fugitives following the Iranian revolution in 1979 had died aged 88 . Yet so important was his role in the real-life events that his omission from the movie led to accusations that the filmmakers had 'rewritten history'. After a mob stormed the U.S. Embassy building in Tehran they took 52 Americans hostage in retaliation for Western support for the recently deposed shah. However six Americans managed to evade capture. All six were taken in by Sheardown at his home in the suburbs north of Tehran. Two then stayed at the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor while the other four remained with the Sheardowns. Flashpoint: Supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini on the streets of Tehran celebrating following the Iranian revolution 1979 . Ben Affleck stars as CIA operative Tony Mendez in the 2012 film Argo, which told the story of the six Americans' escape . Describing the tense situation that lasted for an agonising 72 days, Mr Sheardown said: 'We were under surveillance. 'We had tanks at one end of the street and a fellow that walked up and down. They were always suspicious.' Kathleen Stafford, one of the Americans described Mr Sheardown as 'a lifesaver'. Sheardown's omission from the film led to accusations that the makers had 'rewritten history' To . avoid tipping off the Iranian authorities to the Americans' presence, . the Sheardowns would buy food from several different stores to disguise . the amount that was being consumed. The six fugitives were eventually driven from Sheardown’s home to the airport by an Iranian employee in a Canadian Embassy van. They boarded a Swissair flight and were flown to safety on a plane called 'AARGAU'. Talking to the Washington Post, historian Robert Wright described Mr. Sheardown as exuding 'the sort of quiet but unyielding resolve that made him a natural leader in a crisis.' Sheardown was born in Windsor and served as a tail gunner in during the Second World War. He broke both legs bailing out of a crippled Halifax bomber over Britain, but somehow managed to crawled to a pub and order a drink. He recovered and was soon back flying missions over Germany. Sheardown featured in the 1981 Canadian film, 'Escape from Iran,' According to his wife, Zena Sheardown, he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and died on Dec 30 at a hospital in Ottawa. The Iranian hostage crisis was one of America’s darkest hours, in November 1979, Iranian anti-American protesters had shocked the world by storming Tehran’s U.S. embassy and taking 52 Americans hostage. They were to be held for the next 444 days. But a maverick CIA agent persuaded a desperate U.S. government that the best way of spiriting six trapped diplomats out of the most dangerous place on Earth was to turn the golden rule of espionage operations — Don’t Attract Attention — on its head. The six — consular chief Bob Anders, agricultural attaché Lee Schatz, and two young couples, Mark and Cora Lijek, and Joe and Kathy Stafford — were split between the homes of the Canadian deputy chief of mission, John Sheardown, and ambassador Ken Taylor. Iran's current president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is pictured holding the arm of a blindfolded American hostage at the United States embassy in 1979 . A month after the embassy take-over, CIA agent Tony Mendez, 38, a veteran of the Vietnam War hatched a bizarre plan in which he would reinvent himself as  Kevin Costa Hawkins, an Irish sci-fi film production manager leading a pre-production team into Iran on a location-scouting mission. Mendez flew to Los Angeles to enlist John Chambers, the make-up artist who had created Mr Spock’s ears in Star Trek and who won an Oscar for the simian masks he made for 1968’s Planet Of The Apes. Chambers brought in a special effects colleague, Bob Sidell. The trio took over offices recently vacated by makers of the thriller The China Syndrome and, in four days, set up their own company. Mischievously calling it Studio Six Productions, they designed business cards for the six trapped diplomats, and invented CVs of former film credits for each of them. Mendez commissioned a film poster which appeared as a full-page advert in Hollywood trade papers Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. They even threw a small launch party. Soon, the studio was being inundated with scripts, including one from Steven Spielberg. Hollywood’s finest were taken in — but would the Iranians be so easily convinced? On January 25, 1980, after the mission had received the personal approval of President Carter, Mendez flew to Iran. Alert to the possibility officials might call to check the story, he left his colleagues manning the phones in LA. He arrived in Tehran on an early morning flight, knowing the terminal would be quiet, and wasted little time meeting the Canadian ambassador, Ken Taylor, who handed him the six passports his government had made for the Americans. Mendez, meanwhile, forged the necessary Iranian visas, using the ambassador’s Scotch to moisten his ink pad. That evening, Mendez met the six and outlined his plan, assigning them roles in the film crew. ‘Being all fairly young, we didn’t really think about the danger we were in,’ Lee Schatz, now 64, tells me. ‘Frankly, we were more worried what would happen to our Canadian hosts if we were caught.’ Did they think the plan totally ludicrous? ‘No,’ says Lee, ‘because Mendez told us to be convincing in these situations, you have to like the idea of who you’re going to be. You have to have some fun. And as Mendez had wryly told us: ""Everyone wants to be from Hollywood.”’ Over the next two days, Mendez spent hour after hour drilling his charges, testing them endlessly on their cover stories and getting them used to their new identities. In the early hours of January 28, they all piled into a van to drive to the airport, suitably disguised. Most had attempted to look as ‘movie industry’ as possible, with oversized sunglasses, eccentric hairstyles and lapels so wide they almost didn’t need a plane. Bob Anders, the conservative consular chief, had gone the whole hog, dressing in a blue silk shirt two sizes too small and unbuttoned to reveal a hairy chest and gold medallion. He completed the act with a  blow-dried bouffant hairdo and a walk that Mendez remembers as ‘ridiculously mincing’. At the airport, the six entered the terminal nervously with Mendez. As Revolutionary Guards wandered through the queues harassing other travellers, the group checked in smoothly with Swissair and got through customs. Mendez recalls the six were really embracing their roles by this point. ‘We were trying to look like we were having a good time. We wanted to be the Hollywood people who didn’t get it — who were out celebrating at the worst time in history. It was part of the cover story.’ Suddenly, disaster loomed. Lee Schatz joined the non-smoking queue for immigration out of habit, while the others stood in the smoking queue. Separated, he found himself being quizzed by an immigration officer who peered suspiciously at his passport photo and demanded to know if it was really him. Apparently unconvinced, the officer went into a backroom with the passport. The group froze, but mercifully he returned bringing only a cup of tea. He shrugged at the passport and stamped it. They were almost home and dry. As the plane — coincidentally named Aargau — left Iranian airspace, bound for Zurich, Mendez gripped the bag he had thankfully never had to open: the one full of Argo posters, relevant Hollywood magazines and even the film storyboards that he might have needed to convince suspicious officials.","John Sheardown played a pivotal role in the escape of six US fugitives .

Vodafone is one of the major networks that has raised monthly charges on fixed-price contracts in the past year . Watchdogs are to stop mobile phone firms making £90million a year by imposing sneak price rises on supposedly fixed-fee contracts. Under plans unveiled by Ofcom, customers faced with unexpected increases in their monthly bill will be able to cancel their contracts without penalty. The new escape clause will be available to those with fixed-price home broadband and landline deals too. The cost-of-living squeeze has made deals with a set monthly fee extremely attractive because – in theory – they make it easier for customers to manage their money. But smallprint in the contracts has allowed telecom companies to get away with pushing through controversial price rises. Ofcom also says the networks should change their advertising to ensure new customers are given a clear warning that the monthly charge could go up. Some 10.5million customers on fixed-price contracts have suffered rises in the past year. At the moment, those who cancel their contract as a result are hit with penalties of £200 to £300. These would be swept away under Ofcom’s radical shake-up, which is expected to come into effect in the autumn. Most of the major networks – Vodafone, Three and Orange and T-Mobile, which are now known as EE – have raised monthly charges on supposedly fixed-price contracts in the past year. In most cases the increase is less than £2 a month per customer, but this has generated tens of millions in extra income for the industry. It means that customers buying the latest handsets on expensive long-term contracts end up paying more than they expected. The mobile networks are unlikely to accept the changes without a fight. Customers who reject a price rise and decide to leave a contract will probably have to hand back their handset. The networks may also retaliate by raising the monthly charge for new contracts from the current typical level of £25 to £30 for 24 months. Ofcom will announce a final decision on its plans in the summer, and the new regime will come into effect in September. Claudio . Pollack, of Ofcom, said: ‘Many consumers have complained to us that . they are not made aware of the potential for price rises in what they . believe to be fixed contracts. ‘Ofcom is consulting on rules that we propose would give consumers a fair deal in relation to mid-contract price rises.’ Some . 38,000 people signed up to a ‘Fixed Means Fixed’ campaign run by . consumer group Which? calling for Ofcom to outlaw the price rise . rip-off.

Found: Convicted killer Phillip Westwater, 44, who went missing from St Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle has been found by police and returned to the hospital . A convicted killer who went on the run after escaping from a secure psychiatric hospital was found by police after spending an afternoon drinking at a local gay bar, it emerged today. Phillip Westwater, who was dubbed the Black Dog Strangler, was arrested at The Bank in Newcastle late on Wednesday night after fellow revellers recognised his distinctive tattoos from a photograph. The married killer had spent 12 hours on the run, and was seen at the gay bar drinking with regulars while watching a drag queen perform. Westwater had earlier duped guards at the St Nicholas Hospital after pretending that he needed to use the toilet and escaping, leaving his hospital clothes piled in a heap. A force spokesman said: 'The missing man has been located safe and well in the Newcastle area. Officers will be taking him back to the secure unit at St Nicholas's Hospital. 'A call was made by a member of the public who contacted police after recognising a photo of Phillip.' Staff at The Bank said Westwater could have spent all afternoon in the bar, adding that he did not seem to stand out despite being 'a bit vacant'. Penny Arcade, the drag artist who was performing at the time, described the moment the killer was taken away by police: 'He had been in there all night - he was chatting to one of the regulars who was buying him drinks. 'He was just sat drinking a pint, nothing unusual, which was why it was so unexpected. 'Ten or 12 policemen came in and went up to the smoking terrace. There was no scuffle, he was just led away. 'It was all over within about five minutes. As they took him out of the bar he came right past the DJ booth, but he didn't have much of an expression - he just looked as if he had resigned himself to the fact he was going to be taken back.' 'One of the group he was with saw the picture the police had put out on Facebook and recognised his tattoos,' Penny added. 'He called the police. 'There was quite a crowd outside because people had seen the police vans and there was a buzz for a while, everyone was talking about it.' Drinking: The murderer apparently spent most of the afternoon in The Bank gay bar . Performer: Drag artist Penny Arcade was on stage at the time Westwater was arrested . Westwater, who also used the alias Philip Whiteman, was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act in 1989 following a pub . fight in which he left a drinker paralysed after slashing him across the throat. He then strangled fellow patient Derek Williams at Ashworth . Hospital, Liverpool, with his dressing gown cord after becoming convinced that the his victim had turned him into a dog. The incident led to Westwater, originally from Newcastle, being given the nickname Black Dog Strangler. A manager of the company which owns The Bank said Westwater could have been caught earlier if the photograph had been available. 'Although he looked a little different, his distinctive tattoos gave him away,' Cris Howe said. 'He had been drinking in the bar most of the day, but as his photo wasn't released till late at night no one knew who they were looking for. I can't believe that it wasn't put out more quickly.' At his trial Westwater admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, with the judge saying: 'You are clearly very dangerous.' Northumbria Police had warned members of the public not to approach Westwater. Westwater . left the clothes he had been wearing in the hospital, which is considered a . medium security unit. The . killer, who is described as white, six feet tall, of slim build with . brown/grey hair, escaped from the hospital at around 10am on Wednesday. Officers . said they had concerns for Westwater's welfare as he is diabetic. He . has a pump fitted and police said he has enough insulin to last three . days. He has previously been detained at high security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, joining high profile detainees such as Ian Brady. Escape: St Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle, where convicted killer Phillip Westwater escaped on Wednesday after pretending that he needed to use the toilet . Westwater has also been detained at Rampton Secure Hospital, Nottinghamshire. His life in detention has not . been without incident. He married fellow patient Susan Scott at high . security hospital Broadmoor but they divorced in 2000. Westwater then began a secret romance with a nursing assistant Claire Dudley who worked on his ward at Rampton high security hospital in Nottinghamshire. The pair reportedly wed at a social club in the hospital in November 2008. Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said the right to marry was enshrined in the 1988 Human Rights Act. A hospital spokeswoman denied the couple was allowed to consummate their marriage while he was being treated there.","Phillip Westwater was found at The Bank gay bar in Newcastle .

Pervert: Gavin Clark, 41, was jailed for 12 months and put on the sex offenders' register for 10 years for three charges of possessing indecent images of children . A primary school caretaker who had 1,749 pornographic pictures of children on his computer had been secretly living in a store cupboard at the school for weeks. Gavin Clark, 41, was jailed for 12 months and put on the sex offenders' register for 10 years yesterday after he admitted three charges of possessing indecent images of children. Clark, of no fixed address, had been staying in a cupboard at Eaton Primary School, Norwich, - which has around 360 children - after his marriage collapsed. His computer equipment, along with other personal items including a bed, was discovered in the cupboard after he had gone off work sick. Police found the indecent images on his computer after being alerted by worried staff. Kevin Eastwick, prosecuting, said the pictures were found on Clark's laptop along with a memory stick and memory card. Mr Eastwick told Norwich Crown Court that 491 images were in the two most serious categories and many showed children under 13. Clark told police he had found them on a memory card he came across near the school and had transferred the images by mistake onto his laptop. Ian James, defending, said: 'There was no previous indication of a propensity towards this sort of behaviour.' Mr James said Clark, who has been sacked, moved out of his home after his marriage broke down and went to live at his school. He said: 'He was effectively living for some time in a cupboard in a school where he worked at the time. 'That fact explains the presence of the material in that particular location.' Mr James added: 'This has been an extremely salutary lesson for him. He feels very concerned about the way he will be seen by right-minded members of the public. 'He has mentioned to me how sad it is that by behaving in this way he had deprived himself of the work he enjoyed very much. He will no longer be able to work in the sort of environment that he had worked in previously. 'This was a product of the circumstances of a break-up in his personal life. He is unlikely to behave in this way again.' Pupils: Eaton Primary School, Norwich, where Gavin Clark lived in a cupboard and worked as a caretaker . Jailing him, Judge Mark Lucraft said he accepted that Clark had not made or distributed any indecent images. The judge told Clark: 'It seems the reasons for your behaviour are very difficult to discern.' In a statement issued by Norfolk County Council following the case, Steve Portas, headteacher at Eaton Primary School, said: 'Safeguarding children is always our first priority. 'To hear that a former member of our staff has acted in this way is deeply upsetting and we are pleased that Clark has been brought to justice. 'Our school takes the safety and welfare of its pupils extremely seriously and deals with any allegations quickly and robustly. 'We acted as soon as these allegations came to light by referring the matter to the police and Norfolk County Council and have assisted them fully with their investigations.' 'Abusing his position of trust, he has stored this material within an environment where young children were present. 'His calculating approach to the crime using the cupboard demonstrates how he thought he could evade the police and prosecution.' - Det Con Pippa Hinds, of Norfolk Police . Mr Portas added: 'Clark, who had undergone all the appropriate checks before he took up his post, was suspended as soon as these allegations came to light. 'He no longer works at the school. 'Our school community works very hard and wants to do well. 'We can now move on from what has been an extremely difficult time for everybody.' Speaking after Clark was jailed, Detective Constable Pippa Hinds, who led the investigation, said he had 'abused the position of trust he had been given by using the premises'. DC Hinds, of Norfolk Police, said: 'The fact that he used a store cupboard at the school to store his offensive material aggravates this offence further. 'Abusing his position of trust, he has stored this material within an environment where young children were present. 'His calculating approach to the crime using the cupboard demonstrates how he thought he could evade the police and prosecution. 'His sentencing should underline to others who are considering similar actions that the Constabulary will deal with any such offences pro-actively and robustly.'","Gavin Clark jailed for a year and put on sex offenders' register .

Police are hunting for vandals who wrecked more than a dozen graves at a city cemetery over the New Year. The thugs did thousands of pounds of damage at Earlham Cemetery in Norwich, which had been left unlocked so that members of the public could visit and mourn their relatives over the festive period. One man was devastated to discover that three memorials to members of his family had been smashed up - and said the attack had brought him 'heartache and grief'. A total of 17 headstones - including that of a nine-year-old child - were targeted at the cemetery and the neighbouring crematorium. Devastation: Joseph and Elizabeth Smith with the desecrated graves of three family members . The city council had asked the contractor which manages the site to keep it open over Christmas and the New Year so it was accessible to the families of those buried there. But at some time between Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning, a group of yobs started pulling headstones down and kicking them to break them up. Joseph Smith drove from Cambridge to Norwich after a cousin told him that three of their family graves had been attacked. Shattered stones, a broken angel's head and a smashed figure of Jesus now lay where flowers and figurines once stood in memory of his father, grandfather and uncle. 'I don't know what we are going to do,' the 56-year-old said. 'The damage is several thousand pounds.' Three marble statues of angels, between 4ft and 6ft tall, were pushed over and broken at the Smith family plot. Hunt: Police are now searching for the vandals who targeted 17 graves at Earlham Cemetery in Norwich . 'What enjoyment can you get out of doing something like that?', Mr Smith added. 'They just cause heartache and grief for the family.' Mr Smith's father and grandfather, both also called Joseph, were buried in the plot in 1984 and 1968. His grandmother Violet was added to his grandfather's plot in 1991 and his uncle Levi, whose grave cost £17,000, was laid to rest in 2008. Mr Smith's wife Elizabeth, 55, said: 'They've been up all these years and you don't expect anything to happen.' A Norwich City Council spokesman said: 'We find it very sad that a minority of people took it upon themselves to vandalise some of the memorials and show such careless disregard for all that cemeteries stand for and we sympathise with the families involved. Previous incident: This cemetery in Birmingham was wrecked in 2011 at a cost of more than £100,000 . Destroyed: Jason Griffiths went on a bizarre spree ripping up gravestones to the devastation of families . 'We asked our contractor to leave the . cemetery gates open over the New Year period so that people could pay . their respects at any time. 'But by their very nature, cemeteries . are not created to be fortresses. Instead, they are designed to be . accessible, dignified and peaceful places for anyone who has lost a . loved one and wants to pay their respects.' A stonemason was set to visit the cemetery today to start repairing the damage. The contractor said that it would pay the costs of restoring the memorials. Paul Sanford, of Norfolk Police, branded the yobs 'heartless', saying: 'We take these types of offences extremely seriously and in each case will make every effort to find those responsible. 'We need the public's help in order to do this and I would urge anyone who may have witnessed people acting suspiciously in the area to come forward.' The attack is reminiscent of a rampage in 2011 which saw Jason Griffiths wreak £100,000 worth of damage at a cemetery in Birmingham.","Norwich graveyard had been left open over New Year for family visits .

A sexy blackjack dealer who helped bring down married Congressman Anthony Weiner when she revealed they had a nine-month 'sexting' relationship has apologised on his Facebook page for exposing him, it emerged today. Las Vegas croupier Lisa Weiss left a message below a picture of Weiner with his wife Huma Abedin and young child saying she was sorry for causing his family family pain. Weiner had been married for less than a month when he started flirting heavily with the casino worker in August 2010 in a relationship that saw him send her more than 220 sexy texts and Facebook messages. 'Sorry for any pain I caused you': Las Vegas Croupier Lisa Weiss (left) has apologised to ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner (right) for exposing his lewd sex messages in a scandal that forced him from office in 2011 . Regret: Miss Weiss left a message below a picture of Weiner with his wife Huma Abedin and young child saying she was sorry for causing his family family pain . In June 2011, Miss Weiss, 42, agreed to go public and become the first woman named of six who the Republican admitted to sending lewd messages and photos in a scandal that forced him from office. Writing on his Facebook page, Miss Weiss said: 'So great to see you back! Your wife and son are beautiful! 'Please let me apologize again for any pain I caused your (sic) or the beautiful Huma... it was unintentional... I still think you are our liberal hero and we need you back in politics!!' A picture of the Facebook page was posted on www.buzzfeed.com today. In an explosive interview with RadarOnline that contributed to Weiner's downfall, Miss Weiss revealed a sexually charged Facebook conversation in which he discussed his 'package' with the croupier, who invited him to Las Vegas for a sexual encounter. Weiner started by saying: 'Ridiculous bulge in my shorts now. wanna see?' Explicit: In an explosive interview that contributed to Weiner's downfall, Miss Weiss revealed this lewd Facebook conversation in which he makes grotesque references to his genitals . Disgraced: Weiner resigned on June 16, 2011, after pressure from his own party . To which, she replied: 'Yea! can u send a pic?' He then said he would 'take a quick pic,' before adding: 'It wont go away. and now im taking pics of it. making me harder still.' At one point Weiner even asked whether his social networking pen pal gave 'good' oral sex. On March 16, he wrote: 'You give good head? She responded:'I’ve been told really good...and i love doing it.' Weiner replied: 'wow a jewish girl who sucks (bleep)! this thing is ready to do damage.' Miss Weiss, a former Democratic Party . worker, said she had attempted to contact Weiner in the wake of the . infamous 'crotch shot' picture on Twitter. The scandal broke after Weiner sent a link with a photo of his crotch to a 21-year-old college student in Washington state, but it inadvertently appeared briefly on his public Twitter profile. Accusations: Other women, including porn star Ginger Lynn (pictured), later emerged to say they had exchanged sexual messages with Weiner . He initially denied that he had sent the message and said his account had been hacked. However, five days later, when more pictures and a second woman emerged, he admitted to sending inappropriate messages to women before and after his marriage to Ms Abedin, who was pregnant when the scandal broke. Miss Weiss said at the time: 'I wanted him to know that I had no intention of coming forward and our past was going to be kept hush hush. 'But he was a dog and didn’t return my messages. I discovered that Anthony is a bad man.' Other women, including porn star Ginger Lynn, emerged to say they had exchanged sexual messages with Weiner. On June 16, 2011, after pressure from his own party, Weiner resigned from Congress. Last month, Weiner returned to Twitter for the first time since the scandal when he sent a message just hours after Barack Obama's re-election was confirmed. The former U.S. representative from New York sent out a link to a video appeal on behalf of the Rockaways, the coastal region of Queens which is part of his old congressional district. The YouTube clip features footage of the devastation wrought on the area by Superstorm Sandy. While the timing was obviously determined above all by Sandy, the fact that it came at the very start of the new political cycle may be no coincidence. The next big election in New York will be next autumn's race for mayor of New York City - a position which Weiner was widely expected to seek before his resignation.","Lisa Weiss writes: 'Great to see you back!

When he was pulled over by officers, he allegedly handed over the driver’s license of Brendan Smith, a teammate and fellow Red Wings prospect. Police allege that Sheahan was using the 23-year-old Smith's ID so that he could drink alcohol. The arresting officer wrote in the police report: 'Riley is only 20 and I asked him if he had Branden’s (sic) ID so he could get in the bars. He shook his head yes and stated ""yea.""' MLive.com reported that Sheahan . pleaded not guilty to the charges of DUI and providing false information . to a police officer on November 6. His next court date is slated for . December 13.

Parishioners must write to their MP and urge them to block the Government's plans to allow gay marriages, says the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales. The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols has also expressed his fears that the 'the true nature of marriage' will be lost on schoolchildren if the legislation is voted in. He says worshippers must write soon and 'clearly, calmly and forcefully' lay out their concerns about the plans, according to the Daily Telegraph. Protest: The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols wants Catholics to write to their MPs expressing their concerns about gay marriage plans . He said: 'At this time, we look to our Members of Parliament to defend, not change, the bond of man and woman in marriage as the essential element of the vision of the family. 'I urge everyone who cares about upholding the meaning of marriage in civil law to make their views known to their Members of Parliament, clearly, calmly and forcefully. 'Please do so as soon as possible.' It is the first time he has written directly to parishioners asking them to lobby MPs. His warnings are the latest attack from a senior member of the Catholic Church on David Cameron's plans to allow gay couples to marry in churches. Yesterday the Archbishop of Birmingham Bernard Longley released a letter stating: 'Government policy cannot foresee the full consequences, for the children involved or for wider society, of being brought up by two mothers without a father’s influence or by two fathers without a mother’s influence. 'We first learn about diversity and acquire a respect for difference through the complementarity of our parents.' He describes the 'complementary love of father and mother' as a 'precious gift that we should wish for every child'. Criticism: Catholics must act to try and change the minds of politicians throughout the UK . Archbishop Longley added: 'We know that many single parents courageously and generously look after their children and often struggle to give them a fine up-bringing. 'If it had not been for the . understanding of St Joseph, our Lady herself might have had to face the . difficulties of being a single parent. 'Even . so, the experience of growing up with our father and mother to teach . and guide, to console and love us unconditionally is an invaluable . blessing in life.' The attacks from leading Catholics come despite the fact polls show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay couples to marry. Civil partnerships - which come with most, but not all, of the legal safeguards of marriage - were introduced seven years ago. They allow gay couples to celebrate their unions in civil settings, but not in religious buildings, but the Government now wants to allow them to call their unions marriage and have the ceremony in civil and religious locations.","Archbishop of Westminster says change would send wrong message .

A man left completely deaf in one ear after an attack of mumps has become the first person in the UK to have a breakthrough treatment to restore his hearing. Alastair White woke up one morning in 2006 to find he had lost all hearing in his left ear. Hearing loss is a well-known side effect of mumps and is usually temporary. But doctors told him that he had lost his hearing permanently - and there was nothing that could be done to help him. Refusing to give up hope, he asked for a referral to Manchester Royal Infirmary. There, doctors tested him and explained he could be suitable for a new hi-tech implant which is placed under the skin. Mr White, 28, an engineer from Manchester,  became the first person in Britain to receive the 'bionic ear' in a 90-minute procedure at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. He had full hearing back just hours later. The device picks up sound from the deaf side and passes it through to the ear that is still functioning. Performed as a day case procedure, for the first time in the world the device was activated on the same day it was implanted. Mr White said: 'When I lost my hearing in one ear it was a big shock. Nobody expects to go to bed and wake up deaf. 'I had mumps and I just thought that my glands were swollen. But they didn't go down and it was the worst thing ever to be told that my hearing wasn't coming back. 'I struggled to hear at parties and in loud environments for six years, so this operation is life-changing. 'When it was switched on at the hospital and I could hear even quiet voices, it was just an incredible feeling. The device picks up sound from the deaf side and passes it through to the ear that is still functioning . Mr White became the first person in Britain to receive the 'bionic ear' in a 90-minute procedure at the Manchester Royal Infimiary . 'It's also great to have it in time for Christmas and I feel really proud to be the first in Britain to have it. I'm really grateful to the doctors and can't thank them enough.' The device, called the Bonebridge implant, has two components: an implant under the skin behind the ear and an audio processor which receives the sound waves. The device, called the Bonebridge implant, has two components: an implant under the skin behind the ear and an audio processor which receives the sound waves . Sound signals pass through the skin and audio processor and are conducted by the implant to the bone and the inner ear - allowing users to hear properly. Other less sophisticated hearing implants are available, but they are not as sensitive and not as likely to work effectively, the manufacturer claims. Mr White does martial arts and other devices would not be suitable as they are not completely hidden under the skin - meaning he would not be able to take part in sport. Ear surgeon Kevin Green, who carried out the procedure, said that Mr White was the first patient in the world to have the implant switched on so quickly - within an hour of the operation. He said: 'The device is new to the UK. Alastair had completely lost his hearing in his left ear and really struggled to hear when it was noisy - that's very hard to cope with. He had a really good response to it and we are very pleased. Hopefully the procedure will now help lots of other people, too.' Dr Ingeborg Hochmair, managing director of MED-EL, the firm behind the technology, said: 'The Bonebridge will improve patients' lives considerably, because the protective function of the skin is preserved after the operation.'","Alastair White lost the hearing in his left ear after suffering mumps .

He and his wife Samantha were until today entitled to nearly £2,500 a year for their daughters Nancy and Florence and son Arthur. Mrs Cameron, who once earned around £400,000 with the luxury stationers Smythson, has since drastically cut back her hours. Chancellor George Osborne, who earns £134,565, yesterday announced he had cancelled the payments he has received since his son Luke, 11 and daughter Liberty, 9, were born. He and his author wife Frances, who are worth around £4million, were until yesterday entitled to £1,752 per year. But the Chancellor said those households losing out are among the best off 15 per cent of the country, and it is fair they go without so the rest of claimants can carry on benefiting. ‘By spending less on welfare, we’re making further progress to that brighter future I want for my children and yours’, he wrote. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, father of three young children, told Sky News yesterday he had ‘just filled in the form’ to opt out, and that those losing the income had to accept they were ‘in a somewhat better position than other people.’ He said: ‘I am one of the people who has been affected. I wouldn’t go as far as sharing the conversation between me and my wife, but I am sharing the pain and the truth is we need to be all in this together so we can get this deficit under control.’ Cabinet ministers have all been told to opt out of the benefit.

Alexander who she is accused of killing months after he split up . with her. Her trial started yesterday and if convicted she could become fourth woman on America's death row. Alexander, . a 30-year-old Mormon motivational speaker, was found stabbed 27 times, . with his throat slit and with a bullet in his head at his home in Mesa, . Arizona days after the savage attack. 'This . is not a case of whodunit. The person who did this killing sits in . court today and it is the defendant Jodi Ann Arias,' prosecutor Juan . Martinez told the Arizona courtroom on Wednesday. Arias, . a photographer who had dated Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, . has been in jail since her arrest. She has pleaded not-guilty to first . degree murder. Her day in court: Jodi Arias has changed the timeline of events repeatedly but has most recently admitted that she did kill her ex-boyfriend but allegedly did so in self defense . Accused: Jodi Arias, 32, faces the death penalty after allegedly murdering her ex-boyfriend, right . But investigators and Alexander's . friends maintain that Arias became bitterly jealous and 'obsessed' with . him after the break up, and even stalked him in the months leading up to . his death. The prosecution is arguing that Arias . killed her ex-boyfriend after finding out that he had moved on and . planned to take his new girlfriend on a trip to Mexico. 'This love, well she rewarded that . love for Travis Victor Alexander by sticking a knife in his chest. And . he was a good man, well she slit his throat as a reward for being a good . man,' Mr Martinez said. The defense is painting an entirely . different picture of Alexander, saying that his relationship with Arias . was abusive and she killed him in self defense. 'Obsessed': The couple only dated for five months before breaking up over jealous issues, she said . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . 'Had Jodi not been forced to defend . herself, none of us would be here. In that one minute, had Jodi not . chosen to defend herself she would not be here,' defense attorney . Jennifer Willmott said. The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails. They started dating . in . February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be . baptised into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias . telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame. In jail: Arias claimed she had nothing to do with the murder but later said it was out of self defense . In December 2007, Alexander . began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she . slashed the tyres on his car twice. In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked . into his Facebook account and told her to stay away. Yet on June 4, she visited his home and they had sex before he was murdered. She later told police that they had maintained a secret sexual relationship despite breaking up, ABC reported. 'There's nothing about her that I see in . marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to . his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks . into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.' At first she denied being at his . house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in . Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex. The water-logged camera, which belonged to . Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted. Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture . showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding . while on the floor. The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on . Alexander's bed at 1.40pm. On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'. Troubled: Alexander's friends said she stalked him in the months before his death and slashed his tires . Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing . Wounds show that Alexander attempted . to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture . wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek. Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found . in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic. After initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her ex-boyfriend. 'I witnessed Travis being attacked by . two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I . don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.' Scene: A grab shows Alexander's home in Mesa surrounded by police tape after his body was found . Deceit: Police found a camera in Alexander's washing machine, pictured, that contained pictures of him having sex with Arias on the day of the killing. There were also pictures of his dead body . She later changed her story once . again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after . he became angry when she dropped his camera. She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship. 'It makes me sick because I know her . true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into . this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.' As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation. She asked to represent herself but . when she submitted letters to the court that she claimed Alexander had . written - saying he was a pedophile - they were found to be forgeries, and she told a judge she was in 'over her head'. In court: Arias has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder but prosecutors want the death penalty . Her defense team was reinstated but in December 2011, her attorney, Victoria Washington, was granted a motion to withdraw from the case. Jennifer Willmott, a death penalty-qualified defense attorney, had now been assigned to represent Arias. In Janauary 2012, a judge denied a motion asking for the death penalty to be rejected.

A bionic OAP is back to his karate black belt best at the grand age of 68 despite just recovering from cancer and having two replacements hips. Bernard Taylor, is back to full health  kicking, punching and karate chopping his way through the gym despite his former ailments which included prostate cancer. Nicknamed The Bull by his karate mates, he attends Colne Valley Black Belt Academy in his home town of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. 'It's brilliant,' he said. 'I had one hip done, then I had treatment for the prostate, then I had the other hip replaced. 'Now I'm back fighting, kicking and running around like a lunatic. 'The younger lads can't believe it. 'I can still do everything - but the super power kicks maybe aren't quite as hard and the flying kicks aren't as high as they once were. 'Doctors have told me I need to take it easy but I just love teaching the kids. I've probably got 250 pupils.' The married father-of-two puts his rapid recovery down to his karate and general fitness levels. But more than that it's his positive mental attitude that ensured any health problems never dragged him down. Recovery: Bernard Taylor, nicknamed The Bull by his karate mates, is back to full health kicking, punching and karate chopping his way through the gym . 'I was never worried once,' said Bernard. 'I took it all in my stride and just got on with it. 'When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer I just said 'right, what do we need to do?' 'Karate is about positive thinking and it instils discipline.' Mr Taylor only took up karate when he took his children Leanne and Scott along for lessons. Back to health: Mr Taylor is by far the elder statesman at Colne Valley Black Belt Academy in his home town of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire . Shortly afterwards discovering his hip problem he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Leanne secretly filled in the forms for her dad and he ended up joining too at the age of 42. Mr Taylor, who had been sporty in his younger days, never looked back and quickly rose through the ranks, achieving his black belt aged 47. Three years later he won the Martial Arts Illustrated magazine's British Championship. It was about four years ago that Bernard started feeling pain in his hips. True to form he battled through the pain barrier, thinking it was a pulled muscle. Eventually his wife persuaded him to go to the doctor's and arthritic spurs were found on his hip joints, which could only be solved by replacements. Shortly afterwards discovering his hip problem he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Mr Taylor said: 'For me it was 'okey dokey, let's get on with it'. I wasn't too bothered. It was my family who felt it most.' Mr Taylor then had surgery on his right hip before embarking on treatment for his prostate. He decided against an operation to remove the prostate and opted for three months of hormone therapy followed by radiotherapy. Mr Taylor had to wait up to six months for the radiotherapy to leave his system before he could have the left hip done. He went into hospital in August 2011 and again his rate of recovery amazed medical staff. 'Now I'm back on top form,' he said. One of the students brought a lump to my throat the other week when he made some comments on Facebook about this 68-year-old guy running up and down like a young 'un. He said I must be a bionic man.' Mr Taylorsaid he wanted all men over 45 to get themselves checked for prostate cancer. 'It's a simple blood test and all men should do it,' he said. 'I had no symptoms and only found out by accident. 'An early diagnosis can save your life.'","Shortly afterwards discovering his hip problem he was diagnosed with prostate cancer .

All brave Lily Willis will be hoping for in 2013 is the chance to walk on her own two feet. The nine-year-old from Great Lumley, County Durham, has taken her first steps since having metal bones fitted in her right leg which grow. Doctors had to take drastic action after they discovered a tumour called osteosarcoma in her leg after she came home from school limping. Her entire knee, tibia and part of her femur had to be removed and rebuilt with stainless steel adjustable bones. The operation took 14-hours to complete and Lily had to undergo a gruelling course of chemotherapy afterwards. As she grows, a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow . doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh as required. She has now been told she has beaten the cancer and has also managed to walk again for the first time.

"By . Sarah Johnson . PUBLISHED: . 16:30 EST, 25 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:46 EST, 25 November 2012 . One fisherman landed the catch of his life after he reeled in an enormous bluefin tuna that weighed a whopping 1,000lbs. Marc Towers, 30, wrestled with the huge fish for two hours before he pulled it to the surface of the water off the coast of Canso in Nova Scotia. It was worth the effort and the wait as the fish is expected to sell for £20,000 in Japan and make 20,000 pieces of sushi. What a catch! Marc Towers (left) and Neil Cooke caught this enormous 1000lb blue fin tuna on a fishing trip off Nova Scotia . Neil Cooke, who was on the fishing . trip with Mr Towers, said: ‘We didn’t realise how big it was until it . was about 15feet away from the surface. ‘It took Marc two hours to pull in, and we had started to see the shape of it when the skipper said “This could be a big fish”. ‘All of a sudden it broke the surface and everyone said “It’s a monster!”’ The fish was so huge that the crew was unable to haul it onto the boat and had to tie a rope around it to . drag it four miles back to the dock. Mr Cooke, 37, added: ‘The deck hand . made a lasso and tied it around the end of the fish and we dragged it . through the water back to the dock.’ When the boat arrived back at the . dock, the fish was lifted by a crane from the water and onto a forklift . truck which carried the giant fish over to a set a scales. Mr Cooke, owner of Bournemouth Fishing Lodge in Dorset said: ‘We saw 1,000lb come up on screen which was brilliant.’ The crew transferred the fish to a . fridge and they are planning on selling it in Japan where Atlantic bluefin tuna  - Thunnus thynnus in Latin – is frequently made into . sushi. The pair, who go on fishing trips together, decided to visit Nova Scotia with the aim of catching a bluefin tuna. They went during the commercial season when fish that are usually set free after being caught are taken back to the dock and sold. The record for a Bluefin tuna is held by Ken Fraser who caught a 1,496-pound specimen off the coast of Nova Scotia in 1979. Large and fast: The torpedo-shaped, streamlined body of an Atlantic bluefin tuna is built for speed and endurance . The Atlantic bluefin tuna is one of the largest and fastest fish in the world. On average, it measures 6.5feet in length and weighs 550lbs, although much larger specimens are not uncommon. Its torpedo-shaped, streamlined body is built for speed and endurance. In appearance, they are metallic blue on top and silver-white on the bottom which helps camouflage them from above and below. They are warm-blooded and can survive in cold waters off Newfoundland and Iceland as well as the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea. They migrate and some have been tracked swimming from North American to European waters several times a year. Bluefin meat is considered a delicacy and overfishing has driven their numbers to critically low levels. It has been eaten by humans for centuries and today the Japanese eat 80 per cent of the Atlantic and Pacific bluefins caught. The species is one of the most sought-after by sushi lovers and can sell for up to £16 per piece in high-end Tokyo sushi restaurants. In the 1970s, demand and prices for large bluefins soared and commercial fishing operations found new ways to catch them. As a result, stocks have plummeted and international conservation efforts have led to curbs on commercial takes. In November 2010, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas voted to cut the bluefin fishing quota in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean by about 4 per cent, from 13,500 to 12,900 metric tons annually.","Marc Towers, 30, wrestled with fish for two hours off coast of Nova Scotia .

Grasping her mother’s hand tightly as she waited to go into yet another hospital appointment, it dawned on opera star Camilla Kerslake how alien the situation felt. Of course, the clinical white walls and smell of disinfectant were unfamiliar but it was the role she was playing that suddenly struck her as so very odd. ‘My mum has always been my rock, the first person I could turn to when I felt wobbly or vulnerable,’ says Camilla, 24. ‘Now I was the one reassuring and providing support, while at the same time being quite terrified myself.’ Camilla’s feelings were entirely justified because this wasn’t a routine check-up. It was one of innumerable visits her mother had to make to the Royal Marsden Hospital, West London, to monitor the cancer in her right breast. Supporting act: Camilla Kerslake helped her mother Deborah through breast cancer . Deborah, 51, a psychotherapist, was . diagnosed in June last year. It has been a difficult time but Camilla, . her partner – England rugby player Chris Robshaw – and her family . believe they have come out of the ordeal closer and stronger. When . Deborah was first given the devastating news, Camilla’s diary was . crammed with tours, dates and public events. She had just completed a . whirlwind 18 months in which she’d been nominated for a classical Brit, . sang for the Queen, had a bestselling debut album and performed at . Twickenham and Wembley in front of thousands. Forthcoming appearances were due to earn her more than £250,000, fulfilling her dream of becoming a major music star. ‘It . was a simple choice – I just dropped everything,’ says Camilla. ‘My . agent said I was mad. We were supposed to be finalising a date I’d been . asked to do, performing at the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia’s wedding, . and there was an insane amount of money at stake. ‘But . my priority was Mum. I want to be successful, but what is fame and . money if you don’t have the people you love most in the world?’ Singing for strength: Before her mother's diagnosis, Camilla, seen singing at Twickenham Stadium, was set to make a quarter of a million pounds in planned performances, but she gave it all up . Indeed Camilla, who shot to fame three years ago after being discovered by Take That’s Gary Barlow, and her mother are incredibly close. The singer, who suffered with severe stage fright, credits Deborah for getting her into the spotlight at the beginning of her career after giving her hypnosis. ‘People ask me if I am proud of my daughter because of what she has achieved in the music business but what makes me really proud is what a lovely girl she is,’ says Deborah. ‘All she has ever wanted is a singing career and she was happy to throw it all away for me. I told her not to, her father told her not to but she refused to listen.’ The mother and daughter are speaking just before Camilla performs in front of a small, exclusive audience at The Grosvenor House Apartments by Jumeirah Living overlooking London’s Hyde Park. It is the second time she has performed here – she turned on their Christmas lights earlier this month – and both times, all money raised has gone to breast cancer charities. Looking back at the diagnosis, Camilla could see that her mother’s health had deteriorated but did not think it was anything serious. ‘She had felt tired for the past year, but being fully immersed in her career we all thought she just needed a holiday. There was no history of breast cancer in the family – she hadn’t developed any lumps – so it never occurred to any of us, least of all her.’ Team work: Camilla says the support from her partner, England and Harlequins rugby captain Chris Robshaw helped her through the tough times . Deborah, 51, a psychotherapist, was . diagnosed in June last year.

I want to be successful, but what is fame and . money if you don’t have the people you love most in the world?’ ‘I had to help in any way I could. It’s not just about going to the doctor’s, it’s about being there, helping, lifting spirits. There are just three of us in my family and we’ve helped each other through tough times. ‘Being so ill meant Mum couldn’t work. My dad works in IT and it was really important that he kept his job. Then there was me. My job is singing. I do what I do because my parents have always supported me. I just felt this was going to be the most important thing I could do.’ Perhaps one unexpected positive to have come out of the dreadful experience, says Camilla, is that it brought her closer to Chris, 26. ‘Family is hugely important to him – he lost his dad to a heart attack when he was five and he is extremely close to his mum. I’d spend every day with my mum and then when Dad returned from work I’d go home to Chris. He picked me up off the floor so many times.’ In October 2011, Deborah had a full mastectomy and reconstruction of the right breast. It took nine hours to remove and rebuild the area using tissue taken from her stomach. ‘That was awful,’ says Camilla. ‘Before that, I think everything had seemed unreal. But suddenly, it was really happening. ‘Dad and I waved goodbye to Mum as she was wheeled through the doors into theatre. As they swung shut, I broke down. I thought that might be it. I can’t think of that moment now without crying.’ The operation was successful, although there were minor complications with the reconstruction that required a follow-up procedure this February. And because the cancer had not spread to the lymph nodes, Deborah did not require additional therapy to treat the condition. ‘Last Christmas was difficult because, . although it was confirmed that the cancer was contained and that she . would not require chemotherapy, Mum was still in an awful lot of pain,’ says Camilla. ‘She just didn’t look like her usual strong self.’ But . 12 months on, there is now every reason to celebrate what the New Year . has to offer. Deborah was given the all-clear in July and now feels . almost entirely back to her normal self. ‘I . was incredibly lucky that my cancer treatment and recovery have been . relatively straightforward,’ she says. ‘I have discovered a strength I . never knew I had and I haven’t had to deal with the trauma of losing a . breast because the day that I lost one, I regained one – it even has a . nipple! I think that was a real psychological help.’ Mentor: Camilla was discovered by Gary Barlow in 2009 at the age of 21 . Nodding her head, Camilla agrees: ‘I look at Mum now and see how much better she is. I appreciate how much more wonderful and beautiful she is than before. This past year has changed me as a person. I feel about ten years older.’ Camilla has other reasons to be excited about the year ahead. She has signed a deal for a third album and there has been renewed interest in her career since singing with Andrea Bocelli last month. ‘I hadn’t done any big concerts for a while but I received a last-minute call asking if I could sing with Andrea. The girl he was due to perform with had fallen ill and they needed a replacement. This time I asked Mum to help me and she rushed across town with a ballgown. Within hours I was singing with him on stage. It was all so fast, I forgot to be terrified. ‘It was a magical moment and Andrea has now invited me to support him next year. I really didn’t expect this huge interest all over again. I feel as if I have a second chance in my career.’ And while Camilla is optimistic about her prospects, she admits she does have concerns about her breasts after seeing her mother go through such an ordeal. She has made an appointment to be tested for the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes, the presence of which indicates a person is at high risk of developing breast cancer. ‘I’ve decided if I do have the genes, I will do what needs to be done,’ says Camilla. ‘I will be sad because I want children and to breast-feed. But it’s about carrying on with life, not vanity, and if it happens, I know I have the best people around me.’","Classical singer Camilla Kerslake's mother Deborah was diagnosed with breast cancer last year .

The former foreign secretary has earned £125,000 for 15 days’ work since becoming a director of the football club in February 2011. That’s the equivalent of nearly £42,000 a week, or more than  £2.1million a year. David Miliband earns the equivalent of £42,000 a week from Sunderland FC since becoming a director of football last year . This pro-rata figure is higher than defender Titus Bramble’s £30,000- a-week deal and even surpasses that of France international Saha. In total, the South Shields Labour MP has registered nearly £1million of outside earnings since the 2010 Labour election. After losing the Labour leadership to his younger brother Ed, Mr Miliband went on to make £985,315 from the public speaking circuit and his work as an adviser. The figure, drawn from the register of MPs’ interests, includes hospitality, travel and gifts. But critics have questioned Mr Miliband’s focus since losing the leadership contest. They say he has become a ghost-like figure at Westminster, attending fewer than half the votes in the Commons chamber and speaking in just 11 debates in one year. Wages: David Miliband pro rata salary is more than Sunderland striker Louis Saha, left, and defender Titus Bramble, right . Mr Miliband has found time to attend international summits and embark on speaking engagements. He has made nearly £65,000 from the United Arab Emirates ministry of foreign affairs, and nearly £83,000 from the London Speaker Bureau. Energy Investment firm VantagePoint Capital Partners has paid Mr Miliband close to £117,000 for consultancy work. The money is on top of his MP’s salary of £65,000. Mr Miliband’s earnings dwarf those of his constituents, who averaged just £19,281 last year. Sunderland FC appointed Mr  Miliband last February, despite the senior MP being a life-long supporter of Arsenal. The club, which made a £6.2 million loss last year, is at risk of relegation after poor performances.Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps questioned whether Mr Miliband provided value for money. He said: ‘With a fee like that you’d expect to see David Miliband on the pitch! Per appearance, he’s on a par with players like Saha. Sunderland should red card this behaviour.’ A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ‘Outside earnings are submitted to the register of members’ interests which is rightly available to the  public to view.’","Former foreign secretary earns equivalent of £42,000 a week .

John Redwood says David Cameron is misleading the country by claiming to have slashed the deficit . David Cameron is ‘misleading’ the public by bragging about having slashed the nation’s budget deficit, a former Conservative Cabinet minister said yesterday. John Redwood said the boast – repeated in the PM’s New Year message – risked fooling people into thinking that the nation’s debt was coming under control at a time when borrowing is still running at more than £100billion a year, because many voters did not know the difference between the debt and the deficit. It came as business leaders warned the economy was in danger of reaching a ‘point of no return’ unless ministers slashed red tape and fast-tracked infrastructure projects to boost growth. And Labour warned that the Government . was on course to miss the target set by former chancellor Alistair . Darling to halve the deficit – the amount by which the Government’s . expenditure exceeds its revenue – by next year. Mr . Redwood, who was an economic adviser to Mr Cameron in opposition, has . persistently called for deeper cuts to both taxes and spending in order . to boost the economy. Ministers now routinely trot out the statistic that they have cut the huge deficit left by Labour by a quarter. While . this is accurate, Mr Redwood said it could ‘mislead’ people into . thinking the national debt is falling, when it is still rising fast. ‘Polling shows that many think there have been big spending cuts in the UK and that the debt is now falling,’ he said. ‘The truth is all too different. The UK is still running a deficit of over £100billion a year. ‘Current public spending has been increased by this Government. That means that the UK state is still adding to our debts by more than £100billion again this year, or by nearly £1,700 for every man, woman and child in the country. ‘Meanwhile total state debt exceeds £1,000billion, excluding the state banks’ debts, Private Finance Initiatives, Public Private Partnerships and various pension items. David Cameron repeated his claim that the Government is tackling the country's deficit in his New Year's message . 'That’s nearly £17,000 per person of debt already racked up. All these debts have to be repaid one day. ‘This generation is building up debt to live beyond our means, in the hope that our children will come along and be able to pay it back, or be able to refinance it at sensible interest rates.’ Yesterday, John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said dramatic ‘once-in-a-century’ measures were needed to head off the threat of terminal decline, adding: ‘Support those businesses that are looking to venture into new markets by improving access to finance and reducing red tape, and focus on the businessmen and women of the future. Otherwise it could be a case of too little, much too late.’ A Treasury spokesman insisted the economic programme was ‘on the right track’, with more than a million jobs created since 2010. He added the Chancellor had outlined a growth package, including tax cuts for 24million basic-rate payers.","John Redwood says national debt is still rising fast .

A fortune teller who tries to predict the future using asparagus today unveiled her top tips for 2013 - including another Royal wedding and yet more wet weather. Mystic Jemima Packington, 57, is the world's only Asparamancer and claims to see the future by tossing the spears into the air and interpreting how they land. She has made dozens of accurate predictions in recent years, including the demise of Gordon Brown, the credit crunch, and Kate Middleton's pregnancy - but there have been a few duds along the way too. Scroll down for video . Future tips: Mystic Jemima Packington predicts the future using asparagus . Asparamancer: Jemima Packington, tosses the spears into the air and makes her predictions based on how they fall - like ancient rune castors . For example, last year she said an animal will win an Oscar, which is impossible because animals are ineligible, and the asparagus crop will fare better - which it didn't. Today, she made her predictions for 2013 which include Greece leaving the euro and another tsunami for the Far East. Jemima, who is originally from Pershore, Worcestershire, but now lives in Bath, Somerset, said: 'It might sound silly to some people but my readings are very accurate. 'I have been doing readings using asparagus since I was eight years old. 'My great aunt read tea leaves and I have inherited her gift.' Jemima only uses fresh Worcestershire asparagus grown in the Vale of Evesham - the UK's main supplier of the vegetable. Jemima Packington has made dozens of accurate predictions in recent years, including the demise of Gordon Brown, the credit crunch, and Kate Middleton's pregnancy . Last year she correctly predicted the . Royal pregnancy for Kate and William, Olympic success for Britain and a . dismal performance for the England football team at Euro 2012 . She picks a handful of tips, tosses them into the air and 'reads' the shapes they form when they land. One . of Jemima's most remarkable predictions was that Gordon Brown would not . only be ousted but also leave politics completely after his election . defeat in 2010. She said: 'I was asked to do a reading about Gordon Brown just before the general election. 'I cast the spears and they were all pointing down and several spear tips had lost their spores which indicates tears. Jemima Packington has predicted more weather misery for the UK with 'huge extremes'. Pictured here is flooding in York last year . Jemima correctly predicted last year that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would get pregnant . 'My reading of this was that he would lose the election in 2010 and would then leave politics altogether. 'I was the first person to predict this and people said I was mad at the time but it came true. 'I have a very good success rate, but because it's an interpretation you can sometimes be slightly off the mark.' Last year she correctly predicted the . Royal pregnancy for Kate and William, Olympic success for Britain and a . dismal performance for the England football team at Euro 2012. Jemima said: 'When they first announced the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy there was talk of it being twins. 'This has not been confirmed yet, though which is what I originally saw in the spears. 'We will have massive extremes in weather but on a plus side we will have a better crop of asparagus in 2013. 'Sometimes what comes to you can seem incredibly off the wall. Yet sometimes you are certain. It is a bit grim for 2013. 'I can't remember how many were correct last year but it was around six out of the 10. When a spear breaks it is the equivalent of the death card in Tarot readings. 'It is not necessarily a bad thing because it indicates a parting of ways.' - There will be a Royal pregnancy. CORRECT - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced they are expecting last month. - A change of leadership for one of the UK’s main political parties. WRONG - all three leaders of the main political parties remained in place. - The Euro will collapse. WRONG - it certainly hasn't happened yet. - A high-profile British figure will die. CORRECT - several high-profile Brits died, but that happens every year. - Olympic success for Britain. CORRECT - spot on. Great Britain won 29 golds and came third on the medal table. - A dismal performance for the England football team at Euro 2012. CORRECT - couldn't be more right. England were knocked out in the quarter-final stage. - A devolution referendum being granted to Scotland. CORRECT - an agreement has been made to hold a referendum in 2014. - Laws introduced to prevent phone hacking following the Leveson inquiry into Press ethics. WRONG - it hasn't happened yet. - An animal scooping an Oscar. WRONG - animals are excluded from being able to be nominated for Oscars, despite calls for the dog in hit Hollywood film The Artist to be nominated. - The asparagus crop will fare better this year. WRONG - in the UK the asparagus crop was delayed by bad weather. - Greece will leave the EU and Spain and Portugal will consider leaving too. PROBABLE . - Germany will suffer unexpected problems. PROBABLE . - Angela Merkel will be challenged. CERTAINTY - 2013 is general election year in Germany and five to six parties will compete for seats. - A high-profile couple will announce they are splitting up - much to the shock of everyone.

But there are fears the plans could lead to a two-tier system for motorists – and even cause more accidents.

Massive investment in the nation's transport system is at the heart of a strategy to be unveiled by the Coalition leaders today. A source said: 'Speeding up the transport network will cut costs and save time for business in the long term.'

Caution: Justice Minister Jeremy Wright says reform is needed after it emerged that record numbers of career criminals are getting off with warnings from police . More than 26,000 repeat offenders were given a caution or verbal warning instead of being taken before the court, figures from the Ministry of Justice have revealed. The figures, for the year up to June 2012, include up to 4,500 criminals with more than 15 previous offences on their criminal record. This means 4.9 per cent of all adult offenders escaped with a caution, the highest proportion on record and more than twice the 2.2 per cent recorded a decade ago, reported the Daily Telegraph. A total of 91,475 adult offenders were given a reprimand, warning or caution for a new crime and of those, 26,346 had three or more previous convictions or cautions. Nearly 4,500 were guilty of 15 or more previous offences. Dee Edwards, of the R and K Foundation, a crime victims' group, branded the figures 'horrendous' and called the criminal justice system a 'joke'. She said: 'Rehabilitation is clearly not working and yet we still give them nothing more than a smack on the wrist. 'We are letting people go off the rails and even the law is not taking responsibility for them.' The Magistrates’ Association recently made a statement warning that police were giving out cautions and fines in situations where criminals should be taken to court. Justice secretary Chris Grayling today said he was 'extremely concerned' by the figures. He said: 'I am extremely concerned by these figures and am already looking into how police cautions are being used. 'We shouldn't remove the right for police officers to exercise discretion but the public are right to expect that people who commit serious crimes will be brought before a court where very tough sentences are available.' The high use of out-of-court disposal such as a cautions, warnings or penalty notices for disorder was previously criticised in a joint report by the Inspectorate of Constabulary and Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate. And think-tank the Policy Exchange last year warned serious offenders are escaping justice because of an erratic and inappropriate use of cautions and penalty notices. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'Criminals who commit serious crimes should always be prosecuted and brought before a court where very tough sentences are available. 'Reoffending has been shamefully high for too long and the public expect better. We can't keep having people going around and round the system. 'That is why we are reforming the criminal justice system so offenders are properly punished and the root causes of their behaviour addressed.' But Conservative MP Nick de Bois, a member of the Commons Justice Select Committee, said: 'These serial offenders see the justice system as just an inconvenience in their career in crime.' Hardened: A total of 4,483 criminals with 15 or more previous offences were given warnings or cautions by officers.

New look: Mama June has had her hair colored blonde and straightened for the new Holladay Special episodes of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. She also appears to have had a fake tan . Ten years younger: The new look (left) takes years off June, 33, who previously wore her greying curls pulled back off her face (right) One imagines that the makeover was inspired by the family's newfound fame - June is now photographed wherever she goes. There may be a story behind it though. When asked for more information about June's new look, a TLC spokesman would only say that 'viewers will have to tune in to the episode to find out.' The preview clip of the first Holladay Special, which airs on Sunday night, sees the mother-of-four reveal her fear of mayonnaise. Though she visibly shudders at the mention of the condiment, June admits that she will eat potato salad or tuna salad, as long as she has not witnessed it being prepared. Causing trouble: Honey Boo Boo, aka Alana, attempts to help her mother conquer her fear of mayonnaise . Freaking out: Mama's distress is visible as her girls goad her with exclamations of, 'Look, it's so yummy!' 'If I watch somebody make it, I can't [eat] it,' she says. 'The reason why is . because when I was growing up, the babysitter I had [would make] mayonnaise . sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack... I can't talk . about it, this is making my flesh crawl!' 'I think it's stupid that you're scared of mayonnaise, Mama, I mean . seriously, it's mayonnaise ... It's . like ketchup but white' In a bid to help their mother conquer her fear, the four girls decide to take action, by attempting to explain how ridiculous she is being. 16-year-old Jessica, also known to the family as 'Chubbs', says: 'I think it's stupid that you're scared of mayonnaise, Mama, I mean . seriously, it's mayonnaise, it's white and it's mayonnaise. C'mon, that's . like ketchup but it's just white.' When asked why she doesn't eat . mayonnaise, Jessica says that it is because she is a vegetarian, . sparking ridicule from the whole family. Phobia: Mama June will shudders at the mere mention of mayonnaise (left), and second-youngest daughter Pumpkin, 13, does an uncanny impression (right) Mama asks: 'When did you become a damn vegetarian?' Lauryn, aka 'Pumpkin', 13, adds: 'Marannaise does not have meat in it.' The pair then embark on a bizarre argument, that doesn't involve Jessica at all, in which they both seem to be making the same case. It ends with Pumpkin insisting that 'you could just make a marannaise sammich', causing Mama to shudder, and Pumpkin to then do an uncanny imitation. With the family discussion ending in failure, seven-year-old Alana, Jessica and eldest sister Anna 'Chickadee', 17, decide to present Mama with a large bowl of mayonnaise. Getting in the Holladay spirit: The family show off their Halloween costumes . Running wild: This Sunday's episode sees Alana get hopelessly lost in a corn maze . 'Coming from the kitchen with the mayonnaise to the dining room, you could feel the tension in there,' Jessica reveals. The bright stuff: Alana hollows a pumpkin . As the girls goad their mother with exclamations of, 'Look, it's so yummy!' and 'It jiggles, it's pretty!' June gets increasingly distressed. 'My anxiety levels is up like beyond out the roof,' she says. 'I mean like my chest is real tight, my throat feels like its gonna close up... Y'all gotta get that outta there, c'mon now...  I'm gonna go into full panic ******* attack... Y'all gotta get it outta here FOR REAL!' She failed to find much sympathy from Alana, who recalls afterwards: 'Mama was turning white, just like mayonnaise.' The first episode in the Holladay Specials sees the family prepare for Halloween. According to a precis of the episode from TLC, a pumpkin carving incident ends with Uncle Poodle stuck inside a one of the gourds and the family gets hopelessly lost in a corn maze.

It's often said that simplicity is a lost art and it seems this artist has taken the motto to heart. Self-taught French artist Pierre Emmanuel Godet has attempted to make his work as basic as possible by painstakingly drawing famous faces from across the decades with just one single continuous line. He only requires a pen and paper, as well as a lot of planning, to complete his masterpieces. Famous faces: Self-taught French artist Pierre Emmanuel Godet creates portraits of stars such as Marilyn Monroe, left, and Elvis Presley, right, with just one single line . Walking the line: Artist Godet has drawn mini sketches of objects within the portraits - including these ones of Bono and Spok - that give information about the person . And Godet has managed to create lifelike sketches of stars including Marilyn Monroe, Bono and Michael Jackson using his simple technique. The end result is similar to drawings produced on Etch-A-Sketches - the popular drawing toy invented in the 1960s - but without the red plastic toy frame. But upon closer inspection, observers can spot pictures and objects drawn within the portrait that give information about the person he is trying to depict. On his blog, Godet says he used to work in Research Engineering but had always been more interested in art so decided to pursue becoming a professional artist. Film fan: Godet has also featured well-known characters from comic books and films - such as The Joker, left, and Batman, right - in his single line portrait collection . Guess who: From the master of music Michael Jackson, left, to the master filmmaker Tim Burton, right, Godet has all genres covered . Godet’s first attempts were chalk drawings on the streets of Dublin, Ireland, but as he got better he transposed them on canvas, with Indian ink. In the beginning he created simple shapes, like animals and symbols, but as he became more experience he moved on to more elaborate works, like celebrity portraits. Godet started his collection of celebrity art back in 2010 and has since produced portraits of some the world's greatest film stars, movie characters and singers. He started this unique series in 2010, while exploring the idea of making art with very few materials. Each of these amazing renditions is unique and contains objects, shapes and stories related to the person they’re depicting. Godet started on his collection of portraits including Mozart, left, and Andy Warhol, right, in 2010 and has now drawn famous faces from across the arts .",Self-taught French artist Pierre Emmanuel Godet has gone back to basics by drawing his portraits with a single line .

Drivers who peer across motorway lanes to observe the aftermath of crashes are to be thwarted in a bid to prevent traffic jams. The Government has bought more than 3,000 special crash site screens to stop drivers 'rubbernecking’ when passing motorway accidents. The new partitions will be put up to deter drivers who slow down to look at crashes on the opposite carriageway and therefore slow down the traffic behind. Partition: 3,000 screens, measuring 2.1m by 2m, have been purchased by the Government to prevent motorists from slowing down to stare at motorway accident scenes, therefore causing traffic jams . The screens have cost the Government £2.3 million - with each set priced at £22,000. The Highways Agency will have access to 105 sets of 30 screens, forming part of the Department for Transport’s ‘CLEAR’ initiative. The scheme aims to improve accident clear-up times, with ministers promising that the screens will help ‘keep the motorways flowing’. The CLEAR scheme – an acronym that stands for Collision, Lead, Evaluate, Act and Reopen - was launched last year to help ensure motorways and roads reopen quickly following major accidents. As part of this scheme, 105 sets of incident screens will be made available for use by the Highways Agency next year. Each set can be loaded onto purpose-built trailers that can screen up to 75 metres if used end-to-end. The individual screens measure 2.1m by 2m high. The Government estimates that the scheme will save the UK economy ‘tens of millions of pounds' every year. Congestion: It is hoped the screens will ease congestion following accidents on motorways. The screens cost £2.3 million . A DfT spokesman said: ’The planned roll out of incident screens shields collisions and prevents rubber necking. Time savings associated with screens alone can be up to several hundred thousand pounds per incident.' A well as the screens, the DfT has helped fund funded 38 3-D laser scanners that allow police forces to capture evidence quickly following collisions by mapping out where vehicles and wreckage lies in the road after a smash. Other initiatives include the launch of a new hands-free smart phone app that notifies users of incidents and congestion. The Government hopes the measures will reduce the estimated £750m cost to the economy that caused by traffic incidents on England's roads every year. Roads minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘This will be another great advantage to hopefully clearing up collisions but also getting the roads moving rather more quickly afterwards. Cost: It is estimated that traffic incidents on England's roads cost the economy £750 million every year . ‘People will recognise these screens, recognise that something's happening behind it, but actually realise it won't impact on their motorway - there's nothing to see, and we want to keep the motorways flowing.’ Assistant Chief Constable Sean White, who takes the lead on collision investigations for the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), said: ‘This equipment allows police to manage critical events in a more efficient way and present the most accurate and detailed evidence to criminal, civil and coroners' courts.’ RAC Foundation director, Stephen Glaister, said the use of the screens should be welcomed, noting: ’Incident screens reduce disruption to traffic following an incident and  assist the emergency services. ‘Ensuring that motorists not involved in an incident complete their journeys safely and on time is important. The economy relies on an efficient road network. Traffic jams following incidents increase frustration and the risk of low speed collisions.’","Government purchased 3,000 screens measuring two metres in height .

Car insurance for young drivers could rise to more than £3,000 a year because of changes to how compensation is paid to crash victims. Insurers are set to increase prices by up to 15 per cent a year – and could impose a similar rise next year, experts warned yesterday. Hardest hit will be drivers under the age of 22, who are statistically most likely to be involved in a serious crash. They already pay an average £2,537 a year, according to the AA. But the two rises will push this to more than £3,300. In the driving seat: The cost of car insurance is expected to rise by 15 per cent a year, with those under 22 to be the hardest hit . Other motorists could have between £40 and £120 added to premiums. The average driver currently pays £1,219 a year. Parents who insure teenagers under their own policies face paying on the upper side of this bracket because insurers may view them as riskier. The rises will be a double blow to young female drivers who have already seen the price of their insurance jump by an average £300 a year because of European gender equality rules introduced in December. The latest increases are because insurers are passing on to drivers the extra costs from sweeping changes in the way compensation settlements  are paid to serious accident victims. In the past two years courts have increasingly awarded annual payouts to people who have suffered serious injuries such as brain damage or paralysis in car accidents. Judges have opted for regular payments because victims who received lump sums have been left struggling to pay for care when their cash ran out. Another advantage of annual instalments is that they can increase with inflation or if the victim’s condition deteriorates. The insurance industry claims such awards mean they end up paying more to run their businesses and have to hand on the rising costs to drivers. Malcolm Tarling, from the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘It is little surprise motor premiums are rising because insurers have been hit with a mixture of extraordinary  conditions such as increased cases of fraud and whiplash claims. When these costs come under control, the cost to  drivers will fall.’ Karl Murphy, of insurance broker Towers Watson, said: ‘Motorists could . see the increases coming into force from this January and we could see . similar rises in future if this trend in settlements continues. ‘It will be a blow for young drivers and a double-whammy for young . female motorists who have been already hit by the gender directive.’ Stephen Glaister, director of motorists’ organisation, the RAC . Foundation said:‘Millions of people rely on their cars to get to work . but high insurance costs already are knocking motorists for six. Hikes . in premiums and the new gender rules could make driving all but a dream . for thousands of young women.’","Insurers set to raise prices by up to 15 per cent a year warn experts .

For those of you who enjoy getting sweaty and steamy on the floor mat during strenuous hot Bikram yoga classes, there's a new kid in town. Hot Pilates offers similarly bendy-bodied fun in a toasty chamber heated to 35 degrees Celsius, but this time classes are less focused on practicing calmly meditative Downward Dog poses, and more intent on developing core strength and muscle tone, and banishing chronic aches and pains. Celebrities including Madonna, Jennifer Aniston, Miranda Kerr, Claire Danes and even David Beckham are devoted Pilates fans, and the hot version has even more health benefits than the classic chilled sort. Feel the burn: Like Bikram yoga, hot Pilates is practiced in a room heated to 35 degrees Celsius . Pilate practitioners: Actress Jennifer Aniston, left, and singer Madonna, right, both use Pilates to keep themselves in shape . Where yoga - which originated in India about 5,000 - focuses on strength, . flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental well-being, Pilates - created by German-born Joseph Pilates in the early 1900s - is an exercise system that focuses on stretching and strengthening the whole body to improve balance, muscle-strength, flexibility and posture. The practice was initially adopted by professional dancers in the US as an effective form of recovery after injury, but is now practiced around the world. And now more and more centres across the UK are introducing hot Pilates, an exercise class already proving to be the hottest trend of 2013. Crank up the heat: Benefits of doing Pilates in a hot room include detoxification and boosting the immune system . The main health benefits of hot Pilates are: . •    Detoxification: sweating on a regular basis allows the body to release toxins and waste from within, providing room for vital nutrients and hydration. Be prepared to sweat in your hot Pilates class! •    Healthy connective tissue: Pilates opens the body’s connective tissue. Hot Pilates enhances this process, allowing the body to stretch more fully, lubricate and renew, resulting in greater flexibility and energy . •    Boosts immunity: viruses cannot survive in high temperatures, so increasing the body’s core temperature fights infections, which are pushed out through the sweat.  Practicing hot Pilates also increases the body’s production of white blood cells, which fight infection. •    Weight Loss: stretching deeper builds more muscle, which burns more fat. Hot Pilates can result in weight loss. Diet also improves as the body craves healthier food when practicing regularly .

A businessman who stole tens of thousands of pounds to fund his extravagant lifestyle has been jailed for 20 months. Keith Sivills, 55, admitted to creating false documents for CB Construction (Cleveland) Ltd in a £168,000 tax dodge which took place over three years up to 2010. Teesside Crown Court heard how he siphoned off £100,000 plus from the business for his own purposes. The 55-year-old, who is also a racehorse owner and football club president, was branded ‘greedy’ by a judge as he was jailed. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told . Sivills: ‘You acted out of greed and have lost your good name and . standing in the community, and let everyone down.’ Sivill’s barrister, Richard Fisher, told the court that the 55-year-old was a successful director and was not trying to keep an ailing company afloat. He described the crimes, which saw him providing false trading accounts and VAT returns, as ‘a serious error of judgement on his part'. He also admitted they were carried out through greed because Sivills ‘had a certain lifestyle’. Mr Fisher described the tax evasion as ‘madness’ and said the businessman, from Easington, near Saltburn, east . Cleveland, had behaved in a selfless way in other aspects of his life. He said Sivills had worked with local charities and sports clubs, and had helped people - including those who had been in prison to find employment. Sivills is the president of Evo-Stik . Northern Premier League football club, Whitby Town, and has owned a . number of national hunt racehorses in the past. A judge at Teeside Crown Court (pictured) branded Siphills 'greedy' and said he had 'lost his good name' He admitted making false statements on accounts between 2007 and 2010, and on VAT returns between 2008 and 2009, when he appeared in court in November last year. The court heard that he created false invoices to pocket money for himself, and wrote out company cheques for cash, as well as submitting false tax returns. The swindle resulted in a loss to HM Revenue and Customs of £168,000 but at an earlier hearing, it was revealed that Sivills has repaid more than that amount which he cheated from public funds.","Keith Sivills admitted to providing false documents for CB Construction Ltd .

With its penny arcades, pleasure beach and purveyors of cockles and whelks, the classic English seaside resort of Southend may seem slightly outdated to some. And thanks to cheap flights and mini-breaks abroad, the Essex town no longer has the same appeal as a holiday destination compared to its 1960s' heyday. Despite this, Southend has now become a hub for thousands of commuters - and over the past year, house prices in the area have skyrocketed faster than anywhere else in Britain. Experts have ascribed the extraordinary property boom to its well-known grammar schools, as well as seafront attractions such as the world's longest pier, Adventure Island theme park and dozens of green spaces. Average house prices in the town, which is 45 minutes from central London, rose by 14.8 per cent over 2012, according to research published today. House prices in Southend have skyrocketed faster than anywhere else in Britain. This map shows the largest rises and falls in house prices across the UK over the course of 2012 . Good free schools: The 'grammar school effect' in Southend-on-sea, Essex, is a result of many middle-class parents no longer being able to afford private school fees . The resort saw the steepest . rise in selling prices of major UK towns and cities over the last 12 . month, with homes now going for an average of £198,418, according to . research by Halifax. The town’s popularity is thought to have been boosted by its secondary schools, eight of which award some or all of their places according to ability in entrance tests. Other UK towns which boast grammar schools and feature in the top 10 for house prices rises this year include Rochester, Dartford, Gillingham in Kent and nearby Bromley. Robert McCartney, chairman of the National Grammar Schools Association, said applications to sit the 11-plus schools were increasing in many areas, particularly among families who are no longer able to stretch to private school fees. ‘With the credit crunch, a number of middle-class families who could, with a bit of a push, have afforded an independent school are now looking for an equally good education at a much reduced cost’, he said. ‘There is also no doubt that people are continuing to flee from poor comprehensive schools.’ Southend’s grammars were a ‘big attraction’ for families seeking high-performing schools within commuting distance to London, he said. Experts have ascribed the extraordinary property boom n Southend to its well-known grammar schools, as well as seafront attractions such as the world's longest pier, Adventure Island theme park and dozens of green spaces . Face lift: The new Lift Tower is one of several fairly recent additions to the town's landscape . In demand: Property prices in 'grammar school town' Southend-on-sea has risen by nearly 15 per cent . The town has four fully selective schools - two for boys and two for girls - and a further four which are partially selective, offering a proportion of their places on merit. Mr McCartney added: ‘Some people are prepared to move from anywhere in the country to an area where their children can go to a grammar school. In three quarters of the UK there are no grammar schools. ‘Whether it is a grammar or a good comprehensive, all the evidence of the recent past is that people are buying houses in areas where they will be near good schools.’ Some 164 grammar schools remain in England, spread across 36 out of 150 local education authorities. They are most plentiful in Kent, Buckinghamshire, Essex, Lincolnshire, Birmingham and parts of Surrey but large swathes of the country have none. Mr McCartney said many areas which had held onto their grammars were places of relative wealth, where families were prepared to pay a hefty premium on property prices to be in the locality of top-performing schools. But demand for places far outstrips supply, he said. Southend 14.8% (£198,418) Basingstoke 14.7% (£220,320) Rochester 13.3% (£184,908) St Albans 13% (£371,131) Dartford 13% (£209,557) Lowestoft 12.7% (£145,844) Durham 12.6% (£133,878) Gillingham 12.4% (£171,106) Uxbridge 11.7% (£309,891) Bromley 11.5% (£286,482) Craigavon -18.4% (£91,530) Wishaw -12.5% (£87,410) Chorley -9.4% (£125,156) Carlisle -9.3% (£123,100) Wirral -9.3% (£160,375) Hamilton -8.9% (£96,478) Ayr -8.2% (£116,352) Inverness -7.9% (£157,679) Bury -7.4% (£121,433) Grays -7.3% (£178,864) Today’s table of house price gains and falls shows that three areas which are among the top five performers have grammars - Southend, Rochester and Dartford. Basingstoke, in Hampshire recorded the second biggest rise in house prices with a 14.7 per cent gain by the end of 2012. Most of the worst performing areas were located outside southern England. The Northern Ireland town of Craigavon, in County Armagh, saw the biggest slump in prices, with a 18.4 per cent drop, while Wishaw, in North Lanarkshire, Scotland recorded a 12.5 per cent fall. Chorley, Carlisle and the Wirral, all in northern England, made up the rest of the bottom five. Nine of the 10 towns which saw the biggest declines in prices are outside the south of England, reflecting the continued regional divide in the property market. Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis said: ‘Nationally, conditions in the housing market have been largely unchanged over the past 12 months with little overall movement in either house prices or sales for the second consecutive year. This picture, however, conceals considerable local differences.’ He said he expected continuing broad stability in house prices nationally in 2013, with the north/south divide likely to persist next year. ‘House prices are expected to be strongest in London and the South East as this part of the country performs best in economic terms,’ he added.","Property prices in Southend-on-sea, Essex up by nearly 15 per cent .

In a Facebook exchange Friday, Trina Scott Edwards told The Associated Press she's currently filming for 'The Governor's Wife,' which will showcase the 34-year-old wife of the octogenarian former governor. According to A&E, the series will follow Trina Edwards as she tries to fit into the former governor's upscale world while trying to get along with step-daughters almost twice her age and corral her teenage sons. Four-time ex-Governor Edwin Edwards married Trina Grimes Scott in New Orleans in July 2011 .

The series will include Edwin Edwards' daughters: Anna, a 62-year-old, four-time divorcee, and Victoria, whom A&E described in a news release as 'a hardened 60-year-old ex-showgirl.' Trina has sons from a previous marriage, Logan, 15 and Trevor, 13. Episodes will include school projects and Trina making a run for president of the local homeowner's association.

Poignant images of Sandra Tigica’s 1997 meeting with the Princess of Wales were beamed around the globe, highlighting the appalling problems in Angola, which had the world’s highest rate of death and disability caused by landmines. Sandra’s left leg had been blown off by a landmine three years earlier as she fled from fighting in her country’s civil war. Raising Awareness: Princess Diana strokes landmine victim Sandra Tigica's face in 1997, left, and right, Sandra recreates the iconic image with her daughter Eufrazina, eight . Diana, who died in a Paris car crash later that year, was in  the Angolan capital, Luanda, to publicise her support for the Red Cross campaign for an end to the use of landmines. Now Sandra is a married mother of three – and dreams that one day Prince William’s wife will carry on his mother’s good work. She said: ‘Princess Diana helped our country. It is a much safer place thanks to her. I would like to meet “Princess Kate”. I have heard that she is doing a lot of charity work and I think she must continue what Princess Diana started. She should come to Angola.’ Sandra, who watched Kate’s wedding to Prince William on the internet and was delighted by news of her pregnancy, added: ‘I cried a lot, for many hours, when Diana died. Diana's visit to Angola highlighted the country's appalling problems with landmines which had the highest rate of death and disability at the time . ‘She brought hope to Angola. With the humanitarian support from foreign countries, the mines are disappearing little by little. But since she’s been gone, people have started to forget.’ According to the latest figures, 89 casualties from mine or explosive remnants of war devices were reported in Angola in 2011 – at least six of which were children. Total casualty estimates over the years range from 23,000 to 80,000. It was on January 14, 1997, that Sandra chatted to Diana as they sat on a dusty wall at the Neves Bendinha Orthopaedic Workshop on the outskirts of Luanda. Sandra recalled: ‘She stroked my face and told me lots of nice things including how she was looking forward to improving conditions in my country.’ Sandra got a prosthetic leg, but she shuns her current one – choosing instead to use crutches. ‘The legs made here are too heavy and I can’t move properly,’ she said. She earns £130 a month writing letters for the local government, while her husband is in the military. They live in a 20ft x 40ft hut with a corrugated iron roof in Angola’s rural Lunda Sul province with their three children, aged four, six and eight, and Sandra’s 13-year-old sister. Inside, the photograph of Sandra and Diana takes pride of place on a wall. It is also used in schoolbooks in Angola, and Sandra is recognised wherever she goes because of it. She is looking forward to seeing the meeting recreated in the forthcoming film about Diana’s final years, starring Naomi Watts. ‘I can’t believe I will feature in a big film – I will be played by an actress!’ Sandra said. ‘I don’t have a TV so cannot watch it. But I would like to come to the UK and see it.’","Iconic image of victim Sandra Tigica recreated with eight-year old daughter .

One of the workers at the zoo said he saw colleagues slaughter the animals and was surprised when they were used to feed staff.

A body recovered from the sea off north Wales 30 years ago will be exhumed this month in the hope it can be identified and returned to his family. The exhumation, from an unmarked grave on Anglesey near Menai Bridge, is part of an attempt by police forces around Britain to put names to more than 1,100 bodies found since the 1950s. It follows the launch of a website that posts pictures of unidentified dead bodies for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones. A body found in the sea off north Wales is to be exhumed from a cemetery near the Menai Bridge (pictured) Found: The family of Michael Sutherland were able to hold a memorial service for him late last year, 23 years after his body washed up on a north Norfolk beach . In November, the Missing Persons Bureau revealed it was launching a new website dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals. It features pictures of bodies, but any images deemed to be distressing are marked with a warning and require confirmation before viewing. They include a photograph of the arm . of one body found collapsed in Islington, north London in 2007, easily . recognisable by the distinctive tattoos of panther and red Indian on his . right forearm. Another case is that of an infant known as the . Burythorpe baby, a boy of around 34 weeks' gestation who was found . wrapped in plastic bags at Burythorpe Bridge in North Yorkshire in . January 2001. Forensic tests established he had died two years earlier, but despite extensive inquiries his parents have not been traced. Many of the bodies have washed up on beaches, unrecognisable as a . result of being exposed to the elements, or have been discovered on . railway lines. Unidentified: The man on the left died after he . was hit by a train in Hertfordshire in 1995. This man, right, was found . lying in a makeshift tent adjacent to the A1 in Bedfordshire in 1997. Both have never been identified . Tragic: Pictures of unidentified dead bodies will be posted online for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones. This picture shows the tattoos on the arm of a man found collapsed in a north London street in 2007 . Unidentified: This computer-generated image is of a man found floating in the River Lea, near Newham, while the man on the left was found washed up on a riverbank on the River Avon . Some . 250 people die on the UK's railways every year, most as a result of . suicide, according to British Transport police, and a significant number . of these bodies are never identified. There are hopes that in the coming weeks the man buried in Anglesey . will join that list after contact was made with the family of a missing . Norwegian seaman. The evidence was strong enough for the . north-west Wales coroner to sign an exhumation certificate, and later . this month the operation, involving police and forensic experts, will . take place. Detective constable Don Kenyon, who is running the . investigation, said it was a 'rare and sometimes sensitive process'. 'The . circumstances surrounding this man's death are not suspicious – we are . merely attempting to identify him for his family's sake,' he said. 'That . process will involve carefully obtaining DNA samples and comparing them . against the DNA from individuals we have identified as possible family . members.' Search: The bureau has launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals. This shoe belonged to a man who was found in 2003 in the sea, near St. Margaret's Island, Wales . The site: The bureau has now launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals . Help needed: This clothing belonged to an oriental man found in the River Thames near HMS Belfast in 1989 . Trying to find matches for the corpses against the list of the . missing is also very time-consuming. By law, local councils must cremate or bury unidentified corpses, to . avoid the risk of disease. This makes identification far more . difficult: cremation destroys DNA, while to exhume a buried body, . police must seek the approval of a coroner before any further . investigation can be carried out. The graves . are often marked with wooden plaques stating 'unknown male' or 'unknown . female'. The Missing Persons Bureau published a . report on the number of missing persons and unidentified bodies in . Britain based on figures provided by forces across the country on the . number of missing person incidents reported in 2010/11. In Norfolk, the family of Michael Sutherland were able . to hold a memorial service for him late last year, 23 years after his . body washed up on a north Norfolk beach. When an investigation failed to . identify him, villagers in Weybourne held a funeral service and buried . him in the churchyard. But detectives took a fresh look at the . case as part of their review of unidentified bodies in Norfolk and . Suffolk, and exhumed the body to retrieve a DNA profile. Crosschecked . against the missing persons database, the profile matched that of . Michael Sutherland. His sister Ann Stockton, from Cleethorpes, . travelled to Norfolk last November with other members of the family for a . long-delayed dedication. The bureau are a total of 1,029 cases of men and women who remain unidentified and 105 babies. Just six per cent of those involve . living people, most of whom have been found without identification and . suffer from a form of memory loss or dementia. The vast majority of cases - 83 per . cent - the bureau is desperate to solve involve dead bodies while there . are still more than 100 unidentified body parts (11 per cent) sitting in . police morgues across Britain waiting to be identified. with a small . number of body parts (11 per cent) and unidentified alive people (6 per cent) also still . awaiting identification. Joe Apps, from the Bureau, told The . Guardian: 'For us it is about asking how we can be in such a developed . society and yet have such a large collection of unidentified people, . when it is actually quite difficult to disappear nowadays. 'So how is it we haven't been able to . recognise these people? There will be a family that is missing someone . and it is right they know where their loved ones are.' Members of the public are now able to search the cases and provide information online. Any relevant details will then be passed to the police or the coroner in charge of the case. The bureau was unable to give any details of individual cases - other that the ones highlighted here - but a spokesperson said the website had already been significantly slowed due to the amount of traffic it has already received. The UK Missing Persons Bureau continually work with police forces and the public to try to put a name to these individuals, to enable them to be put at rest and to provide closure for their family and friends. The Bureau is also running a special project, called Operation Kharon, providing resources to assist police forces to identify their outstanding unidentified people, bodies and body part cases. Similar websites have been set up in certain states in the U.S, and by police in Belgium and Switzerland. The Missing Persons Bureau is part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

New development: The building was imploded to make room for an upscale apartment complex . Implosion: Observers snapped photos and shot video as the structure came down in a big cloud of dust . The hotel’s demolition comes at a time when the city wants to make its downtown area more residential, KTRK in Houston reported. The developers, The Finger Companies, said they considered preserving the hotel, but the structural elements would not have worked for the modern residential units they are planning to build. The Ben Milam was once used to serve train travelers who arrived from Union Station across the street. It was constructed around 1926, right before the Great Depression hit, by Houston attorneys John Crooker and R. Clarence Fulbright. The building's architect was James Ruskin Bailey, who also designed Houston's Public National Bank Building. Watch the historic Ben Milam Hotel being demolished . Historic structure: The Ben Milam was built in the late 1920s right before the Great depression hit . Cooling off visitors: In 1932 the Ben Milam became the first hotel in Houston to be fully air conditioned . Crooker and Fulbright named their hotel after the Kentucky-born soldier Benjamin Milan, who fought during the Texas Revolution and was killed in action in 1835. In 1932 the Ben Milan became the first hotel in Houston to be fully air conditioned. The hotel closed for business in the 1970s. The Houston-based D.H .Griffin demolition crew reportedly used 350 pounds of explosives to take down the 10-story building at 12.30pm on Sunday afternoon. No longer open for business: A look inside the hotel before it was destroyed . Old walls: The hotel had been gradually deteriorating since it closed down in the 1970s . Dust: The residual cloud of dust lasted longer than the building's collapse . Time to go: Observers left the scene before the dust blew their way . Imploding a structure like the Ben Milam can cost as much as $200,000, Larry Grisham, senior vice president of the demolition firm JTB Services, told the Houston Chronicle. Preparing the demolition and clearing the property can more than double that price, he said. The last structure in Houston to be imploded by dynamite was the Montagu Hotel, which was demolished in 2008.

They don’t want their name to be part of the name. The shop is it is 49 per cent owned by Tesco, the country¿s biggest and richest retailer with the financial muscle to take on the likes of Starbucks and Costa . Harris + Hoole is named after coffee-loving characters in the Diary of Samuel Pepys . ‘They know it doesn’t match with the artisan values they are trying to make money out of. It is cheating. It’s lying.’ Andrew Simms, the author of Tescopoly, which charted the supermarket’s rise, doubted it would take a hands-off approach. ‘I find it unimaginable that Tesco won’t exert a strong influence,’ he said. ‘Historically, Tesco’s interest has always been about maximising profit and return to shareholders.’ Nick Tolley said: ‘If you Google it, you’ll find it. Go to our web page, it’s not hidden. ‘Putting it any more prominently would not reflect who we are as a business.’","The chain describes itself on its website as ‘a .

Rural champion: Andrew Motion, former poet laureate, said that the environment is 'foremost in people's minds' No countryside view will be free from pylons or warehouses if planning reforms go ahead, the former poet laureate warned yesterday. Andrew Motion accused the Coalition of putting at risk Britain’s ‘great collaborative masterpiece’ – its countryside. ‘The environment is foremost in people’s minds, not just because disasters like the recent flooding and ash dieback disease increase our consciousness of what is at risk, but because we’re hearing government pronouncements that betray a wider pattern of neglect for the landscape,’ he wrote in an article published in The Lady. ‘By a thousand cuts, we will be left with a countryside so fragmented that it will be impossible to find a view unimpeded by pylons or warehouses.’ Sir Andrew, who is president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, pointed to a recent poll by his campaign group that showed more than 80 per  cent of the population wanted the natural environment protected at  all costs. Yet, he added: ‘We are seeing the Coalition contradicting David Cameron’s ambition to lead the greenest government ever.’ Chancellor George Osborne also came under fire for saying protection of the green belt and the countryside was ‘red tape’. Research by the CPRE has identified plans for 80,000 homes on green belt land. Planning minister Nick Boles caused fury in November by saying the Government needs to concrete over an area of greenfield land twice the size of Greater London. But he was backed by Mr Cameron last month, who said large areas of the countryside will have to be built on to solve a ‘massive’ housing crisis. Concern: Sir Andrew, who is president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, pointed to a recent poll by his campaign group that showed more than 80 per cent of the population wanted the natural environment protected at all costs . The Prime Minister said it was not a target to develop 3 per cent more of Britain’s land – the figure outlined by Mr Boles – but he made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear for homes to be built. And he said the Government would continue to push for the planning system to be speeded up to allow development. Sir Andrew said the planning system had historically prevented ‘needless urban sprawl while regenerating our cities’ and pointed to the Olympic Park as a good example of using brownfield sites. He said: ‘Nick Boles seems determined to abandon this proven strategy, calling for developers to build on an area of open countryside two-and-a-half times the size of Greater London. Warning: Mr Motion said that cuts would lead to the countryside becoming so 'fragmented' that it would be impossible to find 'a view unimpeded by pylons or warehouses' ‘The Prime Minister seems content to let Osborne and Boles demolish sound planning principles, despite that his political hero, Harold Macmillan, was one of planning’s greatest advocates. ‘Macmillan’s personal manifesto of 1938, The Middle Way, imagined an England where growth was promoted, up to a point.’ Sir Andrew added: ‘Whatever happened to Cameron’s Big Society? The definition, at last, turns out to be, “Your voice counts, as long as you agree with the secretary of state”. ‘Even that great icon of England, the village green, is under threat from the growth-at-all-costs culture.’","Poet accused Coalition of risking 'Britain's great collaborative masterpiece'

Detectives investigating the disappearance of a mother-of-two have found a body in a car after she went missing in the early hours after attending a New Year's Eve family party. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of her murder after Janelle Duncan-Bailey went missing in the early hours of January 2. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers attended Mayfield Crescent, Thornton Heath this afternoon following intelligence received. The body of a woman was found in a vehicle parked there. Janelle Duncan-Bailey, 25, of Thornton Heath was last seen between 5am and 5.30am on Wednesday, January 2 . 'While formal identification awaits, we . are confident the deceased is Janelle Duncan-Bailey, 25, of Thornton . Heath, Croydon. Next of kin have been informed. 'A post mortem will be scheduled in due course.' Ms Duncan-Bailey, of Thornton Heath, Croydon, was last seen between 5am and 5.30am on January 2. She had made arrangements to leave her two children with a friend in Bromley whilst she attended a family function. She left her friend's address at around 4am on 2 January to return to Thornton Heath. Her friend believed Janelle would collect the two-year-old and seven-year-old boys later that morning. However, her friend reported Janelle missing at 4.22am on January 2 when she had failed to collect the children. The mother was last seen walking down Limpsfield Avenue, in Thornton Heath before she disappeared . At around 4.30am Janelle had visited her former partner's home in Thornton Heath on January 2. Police were called following a report of a domestic incident and Janelle agreed to leave the address with police. It is believed she asked to be taken to another friend's address in Thornton Heath. She was last seen walking towards flats in Limpsfield Avenue, and was wearing a distinctive short-sleeved leopard-skin print dress - she was also not wearing any shoes at the time. Detective Chief Inspector Charles King of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command leads the investigation and is appealing for witnesses who may have seen Janelle. He said: 'I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the Limpsfield Avenue area between 05.00hrs and 06.00hrs to make contact with us. 'Lots of people would have been out and about at that time of the morning, either on their way to work or walking dogs - they may have noticed a woman dressed so distinctively. 'Did you see a black woman around that time wearing a leopard-skin print dress and no shoes? If so, we want to hear from you.' Last night, a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody. Janelle has never been missing before and her disappearance is totally out of character. She is described as a black woman, 5' 5"" in height, of medium build and with shoulder length black hair which could possibly be enhanced with hair extensions. Police are urging anyone who knows of Janelle's whereabouts or has information that may assist the police investigation to contact officers.

A jury cleared Mr Ellerbeck murder and convicted him instead of manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent . Just four years after he killed his wife in a jealous rage, a millionaire banker is out of jail and back living with their two children at the family home where he strangled her. Neil Ellerbeck, 49, has moved into the smart suburban house where he took his wife Kate's life after she asked for a divorce. Mr Ellerbeck, who earned £170,000 as HSBC's global chief of investment, feared losing his two children, £650,000 home and £1.3million fortune in the break-up. He lashed out after bugging her phone calls and reading her texts, discovering she had been having an affair with her son's tennis coach as well as having 'close friendships' with a childhood sweetheart and a chef at the Ritz. She received 43 separate injuries in the attack in November 2008, around 18 of which were on her face. After his furious assault, Ellerbeck collected their ten-year-old daughter from a school entrance exam. He later insisted his 46-year-old wife had been alive when he left her. During his Old Bailey trial three years ago, it emerged he had been having an affair himself during the troubled 14-year marriage. He was acquitted of murder but jailed for eight years for manslaughter after a jury accepted he did not intend to kill his wife. Time spent in custody awaiting trial and his good behaviour means he served a total of four years behind bars. Neil Ellerbeck, pictured is seen unloading boxes of what looks like flat pack furniture from his car and in to the house . Banker Neil Ellerbeck and wife Kate are photographed at a party. Mr Ellerbeck was jailed in 2009 after being found guilty of her manslaughter . He moved back into the family home in Enfield, North London, after his release last month. He has been seen moving flat-pack furniture into the property, now believed to be worth around £800,000, which he shares with his son, 17, and daughter, 14. Yesterday, he said: 'It's early days. I'm just trying to get settled back with the children. 'It's too early to say whether we will stay here. 'We might move on but I don't know yet.' Some of his neighbours were shocked to hear he had returned to the family home. 'One, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's quite scary. I can't believe he's back living with the children. 'When you hear about what he did, Its pretty worrying to know he is living here.' Before the killing, Mr Ellerbeck, described by police as a jealous and possessive man, was having a long relationship with a former colleague. But then he spied on his wife and found out she had been having an affair with tennis coach Pat McAdam. Banker Neil Ellerbeck pictured handcuffed and being taken into custody from the Old Bailey in London at the start of his trial . The court was told he had bugged her phone calls and kept 127 hours of recordings. Mrs Ellerbeck's sister, estate agent Sue Reed, and Mr McAdam, both objected to Mr Ellerbeck moving back to Enfield. A close friend of Mrs Reed said: 'Sue still has great affection for Mrs Ellerbeck's children. She looked after them for the best part of a year when Neil was arrested and remanded in custody. Sue wants to remain on good terms and would never speak out about what happened. 'But she is horrified that Neil has moved back to the home where he killed Kate and shows no signs of wanting to move. 'More baffling to her is why Neil would want to move back to the house where his wife died in a violent struggle with him and want to carry on raising the children there as if nothing had happened. It is cold and bizarre.' The home where Kate Ellerbeck died to which her husband has returned after serving three years in jail . Mr Ellerbeck who was found guilty of manslaughter, killed his unfaithful wife during a violent row . Mr McAdam, 50, last night hit out at the legal system that has allowed Mr Ellerbeck to begin rebuilding his life after just four years behind bars, adding: 'He destroyed Kate's life, left two children without a mother and caused untold anguish to Kate's sister, family and myself. 'Yet when I asked victim liaison questions about his release, I kept being told the probation service was trying to make his life as ""normal as possible"" now that he is out. I had hoped he would not be allowed back to the home where Kate died.' Mr McAdam has been campaigning to change the law to make it harder for  people sentenced for serious crimes to be released early. He said: 'Because he's served half of his sentence, he has no need to wear an electronic tag, or report regularly to police, all apparently because of  this desire to let him lead a normal life. 'I will never be able to lead  a normal life  again and nor will other people involved in  this case who knew and  loved Kate.'","Neil Ellerbeck, has moved into the smart suburban house where he took his wife Kate's life after she asked for a divorce .

The British government accused Argentina of ‘intiimidating’ British cruise liners near the Falkland Islands, it emerged yesterday. Six such incidents, where protestors or industrial action by militant unions have disrupted cruise liners bound for the Falklands, have occurred in the past two months. Foreign office minister Hugo Swire blamed militants from Argentina for the threats, and condemned their actions saying they should allow passenger liners to travel safely to the islands. Rising tensions: Argentina has been accused of 'intimidating' British cruise liners headed for the Falkland Islands . It is understood that last month, the British Government ‘formally summoned’ the Argentine Ambassador Alicia Castro to protest against the incidents involving thousands of passengers since mid-November. A fresh wave of fresh protests by Argentine nationalists was launched yesterday at two cruise liners docked in Buenos Aires after visits to islands, known in Spanish as Las Malvinas. Protesters accused the Star Princess and the Seabourn Sojourn of stopping at provinces across the region, including the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego, in violation of a provincial law. The controversial ‘Gaucho Rivero’ law which is active in five provinces, prohibits British ships involved in the ‘exploitation of natural resources’ around the Falklands from docking. More disruption: A protestor sets fire to a British flag at the Buenos Aires cruise terminal . Mr Swire, the Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs minister, said in the response to the information from a parliamentary question: ‘We condemn unequivocally any efforts to intimidate companies from pursuing their lawful business. ‘The British government deeply regrets that elements in Argentina have recently taken action aimed at disrupting cruise ships that visit the Falklands.’ The Foreign Office last night said there had been around six incidents in recent weeks. They include officials refusing permission entry Argentine ports or delaying ships, masked militants attacking and ransacking offices of shipping companies and scheduled cruise itineraries either altered, or abandoned, to appease locals. Tensions escalated between Britain and Argentina this week after Cristina Kirchner, Argentina’s president, published an open letter to David Cameron again calling for the region to be returned to her Government’s control. The FCO has accused Argentina of trying to strangle the islands’ economy, which earns £10million from cruise ship tourism which employs around a quarter of the working population.","Ships bound .

For Nike it was an innocent name designed to chime with the often boozy St Patrick’s Day celebrations. To others, however, it was a historical affront reviving bitter memories of a British unit sent to Ireland to suppress revolt in the 1920s. Nike has launched its new £70 ‘beer-themed’ trainer ‘The Black and Tan’ just in time for St Patrick’s Day on Saturday. Controversial: Nike has provoked outrage by launching a new Black and Tan line of trainers for St Patrick's Day . But the U.S sportswear firm has been . accused of ‘huge insensitivity’ because the Black and Tans was the . nickname given to the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, which . became notorious for a brutal crackdown during the independence war. One outraged Irish American claimed it was the equivalent of calling a shoe ‘the Al Qaeda’. The trainer is officially called the . Nike SB Dunk Low, but has been nicknamed The Black and Tan for its . colourings. An advertisement for the shoe says: ‘Tis the season for . Irish beer and why not celebrate with Nike. ‘The Black and Tan sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a stout on top a pale ale in a pint glass.’ Others Irish Americans criticised Nike for being ‘oblivious’ to the historical connotation. Ciaran Staunton, president of the . U.S.-based Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, asked: ‘Is there no one . at Nike able to Google Black and Tan?’ Yesterday, Nike apologised for . the name. Oblivious: Nike has been asked why it did not Google the phrase before using it for a new product . Scandalous: It was the equivalent of calling a shoe 'the Al Qaeda', one leading Irish American said . The Black and Tans (right) were an ad hoc paramilitary units, of British World War I veterans, employed by the Royal Irish Constabulary. They . were created after the First World War by Winston Churchill, faced with . a increasing tide of violence from the IRA which had launched a . campaign to drive Britain out of Ireland. Although established to target the . Irish Republican Army, they became notorious through their . numerous attacks on the Irish civilian population. They were ordered, as Temporary Constables from 1920 to 1921, to suppress revolution in Ireland. The Catholic cardinal of the day called them 'a horde of savages, some of them simply brigands, burglars and thieves'. The unit's nickname arose from the colour of the improvised khaki uniforms initially worn by its members. Black and Tan is also the name given to a popular drink made by mixing stout and pale ale - usually Guinness and Harp or Bass. A spokesman said: ‘It is not the official name of the shoe. It . has been unofficially named by some using the phrase and we recognise . it can be viewed as inappropriate and insensitive. We apologise and no . offence was intended.’ Six years ago ice cream firm Ben . & Jerry’s caused a furore when it launched a Black and Tan flavour. The product was quickly withdrawn. Given the nickname of the Black and . Tans for their improvised uniforms, its members used uncompromising . measures to enforce British 'Home Rule' in Ireland - and were deeply . unpopular as a result. In . an advert for the trainer, officially called the Nike SB Dunk Low, but . dubbed the 'Black and Tan' for its colourings, it is stated: 'Tis the . season for Irish beer and why not celebrate with Nike. 'The . Black and Tan sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a . Stout (Guinness) on top a Pale Ale (Harp) in a pint glass.' And online shoe store kicksonfire said: . 'Beer drinkers can rejoice soon as their favourite pastime is slated to . have an official piece of footwear endorsed by Nike SB. 'The . Nike SB Dunk Low ‘Black & Tan’ is set to hit shelves in roughly 10 . days and if the last photo set we showed you wasn’t enough these should . definitely hit the spot. 'The leather trimmed sneakers feature a . gradient suede portion that goes from black to tan and is highlighted by . a creamy swoosh. 'The insoles also give a shout to the . stout by featuring an image of a pint glass. These may ultimately be . pretty hard to find as they are a quick strike release but don’t let . them pass without a fight.' Outrage: The new shoe has, critics say, evoked memories of the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force (right) who became notorious for a brutal crackdown on ordinary Irish men and women during the War of Independence . Crackdown: British police, known as Black and Tans for their mix-and-match military outfits of dark wool and khaki, hold a suspected Sinn Fein member at gunpoint and search him for weapons . Nike, however, said the name was not . its . officially given one, but had been given it by 'some' - even though it . appears on many retailer websites as Nike SB Dunk Low 'Black and Tan'. A spokeswoman said: 'It . is not the official name of the shoe. It has been unofficially named by . some using the phrase and we recognise it can be viewed as inappropriate . and insensitive. 'We apologise and no offence was intended.' The Nike SB Dunk High Guinness, which it was launched alongside, has a higher ankle support and is black, white and brown. Athough only deployed from 1920 to 1922, nationalist Ireland still associates the Black and Tans with murder, brutality, massacre and indiscipline in the years leading to southern Ireland's independence.

Merry: St Patrick's Day is celebrated by the Irish all over the world, especially in New York where there are parades and various other events . He said, in June 1920: 'If a police barracks is burned or if the barracks already occupied is not suitable, then the best house in the locality is to be commandeered, the occupants thrown into the gutter. Let them die there - the more the merrier. 'Should the order (Hands Up) not be immediately obeyed, shoot and shoot with effect.

'You may make mistakes occasionally and innocent persons may be shot, but that cannot be helped, and you are bound to get the right parties some time.

Police are to be issued with equipment that will enable them to test instantly whether a driver is under the influence of drugs. The kit will analyse a mouth swab for traces of cannabis, meaning officers will not need to wait for a doctor to do a blood test on a suspect. Initially the equipment will be available only in police stations, but the Home Office hopes to introduce a roadside kit. Instant results: A new kit will allow police to test drivers for being under the influence of cannabis - similar to the breathalyser already used to test alcohol levels . A test for other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and crystal meth, is also being developed. At least 49 deaths and 640 accidents were caused by drivers using both illegal and medicinal drugs in 2011. The true figure is thought to be much higher, however, because of the difficulty in detecting whether a motorist has used drugs. Driving under the influence of drugs is not an offence unless police can prove the driver’s judgment was impaired. But David Cameron has vowed to make drug-driving a crime. On the spot test: The kit analyses a mouth swab for traces of the drug (stock image) Legislation is expected to be brought in making it an automatic offence to have levels of certain drugs in the bloodstream. Offenders will face up to six months in jail and a fine of up to £5,000 as well as an automatic driving ban of at least 12 months. The new test – developed by the Hertfordshire-based firm Draeger – will instantly tell police if it detects THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. A positive saliva test would mean officers could ask a suspect for a blood sample without first seeking medical approval. This would be needed as evidence to support a prosecution can come only from a blood specimen.","New kit analyses a mouth swab for traces of cannabis giving instance results .

Protesters in Argentina burned British flags in the street after a tabloid placed an advert in a Buenos Aires newspaper telling them 'Hands off the Falklands'. A letter written by The Sun was published in Argentina's main English language newspaper the Buenos Aires Herald in response to demands from President Cristina Fernandez to open talks over sovereignty of the islands. It prompted angry scenes in the south American capital as demonstrators burned copies of the newspaper and British flags. A demonstrator sets fire to a copy of The Sun's editorial and a British flag . The Sun letter to President Cristina Fernandez said the Falkland Islands will remain 'resolutely British' The seven-paragraph editorial stated that Argentine claims to the Falkland Islands are 'unfounded' and that they will remain 'resolutely British'. 'British sovereignty over the . Falkland Islands dates back to 1765, before the Republic of Argentina . even existed,' the Sun said. 'In the name of our millions of readers,' the Sun said, 'HANDS OFF!' Tensions have been steadily increasing between Britain and Argentina in recent months following the 30-year anniversary of the 10-week conflict in 1982. The Falkland Islands are part of Britain's self-governing overseas territories and are known in Argentina as Las Malvinas.. The editorial appeared in Argentina's main English language newspaper the Buenos Aires Herald . In an open letter to Prime Minister . David Cameron, published in British newspapers on Thursday, President . Fernandez accused Britain of breaching United Nations resolutions . calling for a negotiated solution. Cameron rejects negotiations, saying the approximately 3,000 people of the Falkland Islands have chosen to be British. Number 10 made it clear Britain would respond with force if threats to the islands emerged. A source said: ‘This is not a military situation but there is no doubt that we can defend the islands. The people of the Falkland Islands should be just left alone.’ Falkland Islanders also issued their own open letter addressed to the Argentinean president. A group labelling themselves Falklands United said: ‘We look forward to our referendum in March and failure on your part to accept the outcome will prove to the world that there is only one colonial power in the region.’ The letter added: ‘We have never been prouder of our association with the United Kingdom and our unique relationship. Any decision to change that would be OUR and not YOUR choice.’ Britain has four warships, four RAF fighter-bombers and a 1,000-strong garrison on the Falklands, which are still claimed by Argentina despite their crushing defeat in the 1982 war which cost 255 British lives. Mr Cameron insisted the islanders should be granted the right to self-determination under the UN. He said: ‘They’re holding a referendum this year and I hope the president of Argentina will listen to that referendum and recognise it is for the Falkland Islanders to choose their future.’ Tensions between Britain and Argentina have been steadily increasing since the 30th anniversary of the Falklands war . The British government has also accused . Argentina of ‘intiimidating’ British cruise liners near the Falkland . Islands, it emerged yesterday. Six . such incidents, where protestors or industrial action by militant . unions have disrupted cruise liners bound for the Falklands, have . occurred in the past two months. 'Stirring up trouble over the Falklands creates a convenient sideshow for Argentina's tin-pot leaders as they battle problems at home,' the Sun said in its editorial.

A man who drunkenly threw his terrified pet dog off the end of a 15ft high pier has been warned he could face jail. Paul Sanders scooped up his howling collie called Shep and threw him over the edge and into the sea without checking the depth of the water. As witnesses screamed in protest he told them: 'This is how you get your dog to swim.' Fortunately Shep was not hurt in the fall but Sanders, 47, of Torquay, admitted to magistrates that he had failed to protect the dog from pain, suffering or injury on a sunny May afternoon. Paul Sanders drunkenly hurled his collie off a wall at Babbacombe in Torquay . Sanders was seen by witnesses drunkenly staggering about in his Speedo trunks on Babbacombe pier and shouting at his two dogs, a collie and a spaniel. One witness said she saw him walk over, scoop Shep up in his arms and throw him over the edge without looking at the depth of the water. She said: 'He picked up the collie dog which appeared to be struggling against the top level of the wall and just threw the dog off into the sea below. 'It happened so fast I just screamed. 'I thought he was just losing the plot. I thought the dog was dead but it suddenly surfaced. 'It was constantly howling and trying to get up the steps.' She said the tide was low and the dogs were clearly scared. Fortunately, the terrified dog survived after being checked into the sea in Babbacombe Bay, Devon . A second witness on the pier said an agitated and intoxicated Sanders swore at her about her own dogs a few moments before the incident. She said after he put Shep on a ledge 'The dog frantically resisted and seemed to sense something was not quite right.' She pleaded with Sanders: 'Don’t do that, don’t be silly.' But he ignored her and did not appear to look over the edge. The dog appeared distressed and disorientated when it surfaced and ‘didn’t seem for a brief moment to know where to swim’. When she remonstrated with Sanders he just snapped back: 'They’re my dogs I can do what I want. If you’ve got a problem report me.' The two women did report him and Sanders was arrested soon afterwards. He denied being drunk and in court said he was deeply sorry for his actions. The court was shown letters of support from Sanders’ GP and a local pet shop saying how much he cared for his animals. Susanna Whale, defending, said a vet had seen both the dogs and confirmed they were not injured. 'He is a man who loves his animals,' she said. 'They are his life. This is one incident and he acted wrongly.' She said he feared his dogs would be taken away but promised that if he had them back nothing like this would happen again. Torbay magistrates asked for reports from the probation service. Chairman of the bench John Kiddey said: 'We consider this a very, very serious offence. We are not ruling out custody.' He said the offence was made worse by the fact Sanders was drunk and it has been in front of children and people ‘who were clearly terrified’. 'When you pushed that dog over the edge you didn’t know if there were rocks there or not.' Sanders was granted unconditional bail until next month.

Afterwards, Miss McQuillan, who describes herself on her Twitter page as 'Winner, Most Awesome Person of the Year, 25 years running', took to the site to defend the trousers, saying: 'I'm sitting under a table! No one even sees my legs!' When quizzed as to whether they were actually pants, she said they were, 'just tight and stretchy and bedazzled'. Bemused: Laura McQuillan (pictured) was ordered out of court for her trousers, but said she could not see what the fuss was all about . She added: 'I don't know why people are acting like they've never seen sequinned pants before.' According to a FAQ section of the New Zealand's Ministry of Justice website, there is 'no strict dress code bur smart casual dress is preferred'.

It is based on the play he wrote of the same name which has already toured the US to critical and commercial success. Commissioning Perry is part of an attempt by Winfrey to remake OWN after it failed to take off and lost her a reported $330m. In one interview she even admitted that she might have to shut down her beloved O Magazine because she is ‘bleeding money’. Whilst The Haves and the Have Nots is an upstairs downstairs drama like Downton, which has just begun its third season on PBS, there are a number of differences. Downtown is set in England in the . early 20th Century, whilst The Haves is set in the modern day and is . about a black family in the US. According to the play’s website it is a ‘powerful story of love and honor told with honesty and brutal truth’. The Chicago Tribune has described it as ‘another romp through the melodrama of African-American life’. Blazing a trail: The Downtown Abbey series has been a huge hit for PBS. Now Oprah Winfrey is looking to a similar show to boost her struggling network . It said: ‘The proverbial Joneses are . preoccupied with their superficial priorities, until they have to take a . look at life on the other side of the tracks. Powerhouse songs and . slapstick comedy round out things.’ The other shows OWN will work on will be another Perry project called Love Thy Neighbour, a sitcom set in a diner, and a documentary called Blackboard Wars about a struggling school in New Orleans. Raising Whitney will be a about a comedian bringing up a baby whilst Dogfellas is the working title for a show about a retired gangster who becomes a dog groomer. Golden Sisters will be about three pensioners who run a hair salon. Erik Logan, president of OWN, told the Wall St Journal: ‘It's exciting for us. It's our first step into scripted programming.’ OWN launched in January 2011 but has been such a struggle that Winfrey has said in hindsight she might not have bothered at all. Helping hand: Oprah has turned to Tyler Perry (left) to produce the new show, called The Haves and Have Nots . After its blockbuster opening week which saw one million people tune in, ratings tumbled and sank to 300,000 in prime time and 150,000 in the day. Oprah was forced to lay off 150 members of staff and personally decided to cancel Rosie O’Donnell’s nightly talk show, The Rosie Show, because of poor viewing figures. Chief executive Christina Norman and another senior boss stepped down and Oprah herself was forced to assume overall control. In an interview in August 2011 Oprah admitted OWN was ‘not where I want it to be’ and that it had to get better. She also begged audiences to wait before making their minds up and asked for a grace period - of three whole years. Things appear to have been finally turning around more recently and average audiences increased to 328,000 in December last year, a rise of 28 per cent on the year before. That however is well below rivals like Bravo which regularly gets 900,000 viewers or Lifetime which draws in one million. Adding to her woes, Winfrey, 58, recently revealed that she had a breast cancer scare in front of a group of 5,000 devotees at O Magazine’s annual conference in Los Angeles.","Oprah admits her network is 'bleeding money' and that with hindsight she might not have bothered with the project at all .

She was discovered at 4.30pm trapped across her waist by the heavy metal gate at the entrance to communal gardens outside the family’s apartment. A neighbour used his security key fob to open the gate and free Karolina. Karolina had suffered massive internal injuries and died later in hospital with her parents at her bedside.

"Wayne Robinson dropped from 31st to 13st after making a 'conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations' like parents evening . Weight crept on after he lost his mother to bowel cancer . Decided to slim down for the sake of his children . Averaged half a stone weight loss per week . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 07:36 EST, 4 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:58 EST, 4 January 2013 . A man who was once too ashamed to be seen in public has found a new lease of life after losing an incredible 18st. Wayne Robinson, 37, from Carlisle, embarked upon a strict diet nine months ago after deciding he had had enough of missing out on life because of his size. As a last resort before considering gastric band surgery, 31st Wayne decided instead to overhaul his diet and lifestyle. Less than a year later, he has lost more than half his bodyweight - and says he has never felt better. The drastic weight loss has literally saved family man Wayne’s life. Now Wayne enjoys a very active lifestyle and is a great role model for his three sons. 'People often think there should have been one life changing moment that made me decide once and for all to lose weight but there really wasn’t', explains 37-year old Wayne from Carlisle. Big loser: Wayne Robinson has lost nearly 18 stone in just nine months after embarking on a rigorous weight loss programme when he feared he wouldn't live to see his children grow up . Rather he feels that it was a combination of a number of factors that prompted him to do something about his weight. 'I’d had no major health scare to speak of, although at the size I was I generally tended to avoid the embarrassment of visiting the doctors. But I truly believe I was in denial for many years, because with a BMI over double what it should be at 59 it wasn’t a case of if I fell ill, it was when.' 'I was a ticking timebomb health wise, but still that wasn’t enough to make me lose weight. What really made me decide to do it were my boys and the thought of them growing up without a Dad. 'I vividly remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy for someone with a BMI of 40 was 20 years less than someone with a healthy BMI around 25. That made me realise that I was living on borrowed time.' Wayne lost his mother in his mid 20s to bowel cancer and he says he didn’t want that for his boys. He wanted to be around to see them grow up, get married and have children of their own so decided to take action. Motivated: Wayne decided to embark on a strict diet after he became too embarrassed to attend his children's parents evening for fear of them getting bullied because of his size . Wayne turned to the LighterLife Weight Loss Management programme, attending counsellor Paula Carruthers’ classes in Carlisle. When he started at the beginning of February 2012, he weighed 30st 13lbs. The programme saw him replace ordinary eating with four specially formulated food packs per day, alongside weekly counselling sessions to assess the psychological issues behind overeating and ensure a permanent lifestyle change. Wayne is now gradually reintroducing food in a controlled manner combined with counselling and has shrunk to 13st 4lbs, taking his weight loss to 17st 9lbs. His BMI currently resides at 25.4. 'The change has been unbelievable. It's not just physical: inside I am a completely different person' Wayne said. 'My life had come to the point where I was making a conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations, from having to ask for a seat belt extender on planes to never attending parents’ evening at my sons’ school so they wouldn’t get bullied about my size. Happy: Wayne has been enjoying spending time with his children and being able to be involved in all the holiday activities like going on a rollercoaster . 'Don’t get me wrong - I was no shrinking violet and was a very sociable guy, I just avoided certain everyday situations. 'If I am honest, it was more than just the everyday situations; I was even avoiding extremely serious appointments. 'For example, my mum died of bowel cancer at the age of 45, so when I reached 35 I was supposed to go for a routine screening to make sure it could be caught early if I was unlucky enough to have it as well. 'I’d received the letter from the hospital but I was so worried that the hospital wouldn’t be able to do it because of the size of me that I didn’t go. 'Even though I knew one of major reasons that mum died was because it wasn’t detected earlier, the embarrassment and fear kept me away. 'I never want to feel like that again.' Wayne puts his weight gain down to a combination of factors, one being that from the age of 16 he did a job where he sat behind a desk most of the day. By the time he married wife Samantha at the age of 23 he was already tipping the scales at 20 stone and by the time his mother died four years later, he was nearly 26 stone. And for Wayne, it wasn't just food, it was alcohol to blame too. 'While I’ve never had a problem with drink, I could easily get through 10 or 12 pints of beer on a night out. 'I now realise that it was more to do with how comfortable I felt in social situations rather than a need to drink. I would drink to rid myself of those social inhibitions that told me people were looking at me due to my size.' But since embarking on his rigorous diet, Wayne hasn't looked back. He said: 'Over the last 10 months I have literally been the miraculous shrinking man. My weight loss has far exceeded all my expectations; in 40 weeks I have averaged half a stone weight loss per week, which is incredible.' Wayne is now able to enjoy time with his sons, William aged 14, Harry who is 11 and four year old Finley, on trips and family holidays. 'For once in my life I could run around with the boys all day, going on rollercoasters without the fear of being too big for the seat. 'When we got back Harry said to me that it was the best family holiday he’d ever had. I know it wasn’t the nicest place we’ve ever stayed, but I agree with him. 'I put it down to the fact that I could join in with everything they did. I have a real zest for life now and the look of excitement on my sons’ faces will stay with me forever.' 'The world is my oyster now and after losing all this weight I feel euphoric and like I can do anything that I put my mind to.'","Wayne Robinson dropped from 31st to 13st after making a 'conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations' like parents evening .

It may need a bit of fine tuning - but the X Factor USA has helped Simon Cowell's TV company make astonishing profits of £32.6 million ($52.4), it has been revealed. The 53-year-old music mogul's TV production business, Simco, was boosted by 138 per cent last year, mainly due to the launch of the Fox TV talent show. Cowell's company also reported that total turnover almost doubled to  £54.6m ($87.89m) in the year to 31 March 2012. Rich: The launch of the X Factor USA has helped Simon Cowell - seen here a the X Factor final in December - boost his fortunes . Turnover in the US grew from £3.2m ($5.1m) to £22.9 million ($36.8m)-  and went from accounting for just over 11 per cent of Simco's total turnover to almost 42 per cent. Simco, the TV business that produces Cowell's TV formats including The X Factor, the Got Talent franchise as well as UK gameshow Red or Black?, reported that pre-tax profits rocketed from £13.7m ($22m) to £32.6m ($52.4m) year-on-year in the 12 months to 31 March 2012. The company, which includes 'music sales' in a description of its activities in the latest financial filing at Companies House in London, said that the biggest contributor to the increase in profits came from the launch of The X Factor USA., according to The Guardian. Who's got the X Factor: Cowell will have to replace L.A. Reid on the judging panel this year . Cowell - who according to Forbes made $90 million last year alone - is currently on his annual winter break in the Caribbean, where he has been joined by former fiancé Mezhgan Hussainy and ex-girlfriends Sinitta and Jackie St Clair. The X Factor USA will return for a third season later this year. But the multi-millionaire is already making plans for the next season after the two-hour finale last month in which Tate Stevens was crowned X Factor champion pulled in 9.6 million viewers. During its second season, the X Factor USA averaged a 3.9 rating among adults 18-49 and an average of 10.6 million total viewers throughout the season. And the X Factor continues to make a wide impact on the music and social media landscape, breaking hit acts from One Direction to Cher Lloyd, Leona Lewis, Rebecca Ferguson, Olly Murs, and Little Mix. Cowell also plans to sign runners-up Carly Rose Sonenclar and Fifth Harmony, according to reports. And although there has been speculation over Britney Spears’ future as a judge she is not to be ruled out, as the blonde star has already made it clear she would be happy to return. However, he will definitely have to find a replacement for L.A. Reid who announced his departure before the series finale. It is thought that Demi Lovato will return.

Americans paused on Friday to remember the lives lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School one week ago, when a 20-year-old gunman shot dead 20 children and 6 adults in a tragedy that has overwhelmed the nation. As the quiet community of Newtown, Connecticut has laid to rest the innocent victims this week, the nation has struggled to know how best to support the town during this numbing time of grief. The families who lost their precious children and family members don't need shelter or clothing like victims in natural disasters but are instead grappling with the darkness of sorrow and loss after the unthinkable acts on December 14. In response, a movement called 26 Acts of Kindness has been launched by NBC correspondent Ann Curry to overcome evil with kindness and young and old have jumped on the bandwagon to do good deeds in honor of the victims who died last week. Scroll down for video. Sweets from the sweet: These little ones packed treats to give to the cashier as they went Christmas shopping .

Good deeds: One Nebraska woman, Shauna Groenewold, said she would donate money in each victims' name (left). Two boys (right) in San Francisco showed off the muffins they were giving to their neighbors . After the events of December 14, Ann Curry was among those who wondered what they could do to help. She posed the question on her Facebook and Twitter accounts last weekend and proposed that if an act of kindness could be conducted for each life lost - then good could soon eclipse the wrong don. She was inspired by the example of New York Giants player Victor Cruz, who reached out to the family of Jake Pinto, the 6-year-old Sandy Hook victim who was a big fan of the NFL player. Touched by Cruz's generosity, Curry challenged her fans to follow suit and reach out to someone in their community. At first, the newscaster issued the . challenge to honor the 20 children who were killed in the tragedy, . starting the hashtag #20Acts, but it soon grew to honor all 26 victims . who were killed at the school and has since turned into #26Acts. Challenge: Wearing green, the school color of Sandy Hook Elementary School, Ann Curry made a YouTube video to challenge her fans to take action for good in remembrance of the lives lost on Dec. 14 . Each one, reach one: Ann Curry sent a message to her 1.3 million Twitter followers, challenging them to make a difference . What started as a gentle suggestion has turned into a movement that has convicted people across the country and across the globe to turn the tragedy into an occasion to offer kindness to others. One mother of a first grader, Elizabeth Glass, from Annapolis Maryland, decided to offer free coffee to Newtown residents. She called Newtown General Store and spoke to the store owner Pete Leone to make the offer, citing Curry's movement as her inspiration. Leone told NBC News that he even had a call from someone in Afghanistan, offering to do what they could to comfort the grieving community. Heartfelt: Kristie McManus encouraged her little girl to give a gift in remembrance of children her age whose lives were tragically lost . Inspiring: Bridgette Gallagher made snowflakes (left) and Angelica Santos collected mittens and scarfs to distribute to homeless people in need of some warmth in the winter . 'Tis the season: The young Rotarians of Delray Beach, Florida, collected toys to bring to the local elementary school to help comfort the young students . 'What's really remarkable to me is how many people responded. They are the ones who carried the ball. They are the ones who chose what to do,' Curry wrote in a heartfelt blog posting about the effort, that was also inspired by a trip she took to Darfur a few years ago. 'I know the truth: if you do good, you feel good,' she wrote, adding, 'Right now, this country wants to heal. I think the only thing comforting in the face of a tragedy like this is to do something good with it if you can. Be a part of that wave.' Others have decided to make their mark in their own neighborhoods, offices, schools and communities. Two employees at the Corona Cafe in Austin, Texas wrote the name of the Sandy Hook victims on 26 coffee cups - offering 26 free drinks for customers with each drink honoring one named victim.

One mother in San Francisco, Denise Maduli-Williams proudly tweeted a photo of her two children taking muffins to their neighbors as part of the 26 Acts cause. Scores of others are purchasing toys, markers and books for needy children, bringing mittens to the homeless and taking time to volunteer to help others. The tragedy continues to overwhelm the country and the wave of kind acts has brought comfort to many who are just unsure of how to cope. Officials accustomed to responding to natural disasters and other tragedies have said that the scene in Newtown is unlike anything they have experienced before. Since the families of the victims lost their loves ones at the hand of a gunman, there has been a feeling of despair at the inability to understand what could have possibly caused such evil.

Salvation Army national spokesperson Major Ron Busroe told the MailOnline that they had volunteers in the area on December 14 offering food to first responders but now they are focused on offering emotional and spiritual support. Uniformed personnel from the organization have attended every funeral that has been held for the Newtown victims and officers have been on hand to offer a listening ear to those who want to talk about what they have experienced and are feeling. 'The Salvation Army uniform is recognized and in times of terrible hurt, people are looking for a way to be comforted. When they see and recognize the uniform, they know that there are people who are there to comfort,' he said. Groups of churches across the country decided to make prayer shawls and those have been distributed to churches in the town, 'as a tangible reminder that there are people standing and praying' for the community, Major Busroe said.","Ann Curry started the effort on social media after the tragedy on Dec. 14 .

'To be honest, I only did a few games at City but I was a bigger England fan - beating up the Swedes was good fun. 'I was the quiet one that suddenly flipped. It was always fisticuffs. If you can't fight with your fists there's no point fighting. 'This was only at the weekends, during the week I was a family man. I do feel remorse now but I can't change what happened, I can only look forward and build a better life. 'I still have an England tattoo on my arm that says Loud and Proud and I have no plans to get rid of it. It's not very girly but it's part of me.'

January Blues are clearly unheard of in South Africa's Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, judging by the look of this hyena. The series of images show the wild animal breaking out into what appears to be manic laughter. The butt of the joke is, however, anyone 's guess. Photographer Bridgena Barnard who captured the hilarious sight said: 'The hyena with his Motley pattern coat entertained us like no other. A clown deluxe. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tell it again: Grinning hyena looks more than pleased to kick off 2013 . 'Every time the camera clicked he juggled and gave a new pose, moving around and entertaining the photographer with absolute delight. 'Like a truly talented 'Kings Fool', he left this laugh for last - seeming to grin from ear to ear. 'He did not wait for the encore, just disappeared in the grass like a soft breeze.' Hyenas make a variety of vocalisations, including howling screams, wailing calls, and the well-known 'laughter' used to alert other clan members up to three miles away of a food source. Researchers found that the pitch of the hyena's laughter reveals its age. Variation in the frequency of notes indicates whether an animal is . dominant or subordinate. Younger hyenas tend to have high-pitched 'giggles' while the dominant females of the group make a narrower range of sounds. The cackles are usually produced when hyenas are squabbling over . food. But the scientists say they may also be a sign of frustration or . used to summon help. Having a wild time: Looks like the hyena is in unstoppable belly laugh mode . Scientists believe the cackles reveal much about the hyena. The pitch can reveal its age, and variation of notes indicates whether an animal is . dominant or subordinate. This may allow them to establish feeding rights and organise their feeding activities. The laugh may also help hyenas fend off lions who muscle in on their kills. A solitary hyena has no chance when confronted by a lion, . whereas a hyena group often can 'mob' one or two lions and get their . food back. The other explanation, of course, is that they are just high on life . 'The hyena's laugh gives receivers cues to assess the social rank . of the emitting individual,' said Dr Frederic Theunissen, who led the . study at the University of California. 'This may allow hyenas to establish feeding rights and organise their food gathering activities.' He said the laugh could also help hyenas fend off lions who often muscle in on their kills. 'A solitary hyena has no chance when confronted by a lion, . whereas a hyena group often can 'mob' one or two lions and get their . food back,' he said. 'Giggles could therefore allow the recruitment of allies.' When a member of the same hyena clan hears the call, it can identify the laugh and decide whether to answer or ignore it. Hyenas, which usually move about on their own, live in groups of up to 80 led by a single female. They are extremely noisy and their whoops, cries and cackles can be heard up to three miles away at night. Although known as scavengers, they are actually efficient hunters, tracking down wildebeest, zebra, buffalo and gazelles. A single hyena can devour up to 30lb of meat a day and a group can demolish a zebra in half an hour. They can clamp their jaws with a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch - strong enough to crack the bones of a giraffe. Creasing up: And the laughter continues. No January blues for this one .

Clemson University student Nathan Weaver set out to determine how to help turtles cross the road. He ended up getting a glimpse into the dark souls of some humans. Weaver put a realistic rubber turtle in the middle of a lane on a busy road near the South Carolina campus. Then he got out of the way and watched over the next hour as seven drivers swerved and deliberately ran over the animal. Several more apparently tried to hit it but missed. Cruel intentions: Clemson University student Nathan Weaver holds a fake turtle he placed in a busy road to see how many drivers would intentionally swerve to hit it . 'I've heard of people and from friends . who knew people that ran over turtles. But to see it out here like this . was a bit shocking,' said Weaver, a 22-year-old senior in Clemson's . School of Agricultural, Forest and Environmental Sciences. To seasoned researchers, the practice wasn't surprising. The number of box turtles is in slow decline, and one big reason is that many wind up as roadkill while crossing the asphalt, a slow-and-steady trip that can take several minutes. Sometimes humans feel a need to prove they are the dominant species on this planet by taking a two-ton metal vehicle and squishing a defenseless creature under the tires, said Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychology professor. 'They aren't thinking, really. It is not something people think about. It just seems fun at the time,' Herzog said. 'It is the dark side of human nature.' Waiting: As the orange-shelled turtle rests in a road near the South Carolina campus, Nathan Weaver, right, talks with his professor, Rob Baldwin, left, as they wait to see if any cars will hit it . Herzog asked a class of about 110 . students getting ready to take a final whether they had intentionally . run over a turtle, or been in a car with someone who did. Thirty-four . students raised their hands, about two-thirds of them male, said Herzog, . author of a book about humans' relationships with animals, called 'Some . We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat.' Weaver, who became interested in animals and conservation through the Boy Scouts and TV's 'Crocodile Hunter' Steve Irwin, wants to figure out the best way to get turtles safely across the road and keep the population from dwindling further. Among the possible solutions: turtle underpasses or an education campaign aimed at teenagers on why drivers shouldn't mow turtles down. The first time Weaver went out to collect data on turtles, he chose a spot down the road from a big apartment complex that caters to students. He counted 267 vehicles that passed by, seven of them intentionally hitting his rubber reptile. He went back out about a week later, choosing a road in a more residential area. He followed the same procedure, putting the fake turtle in the middle of the lane, facing the far side of the road, as if it was early in its journey across. The second of the 50 cars to pass by that day swerved over the center line, its right tires pulverizing the plastic shell. 'Wow! That didn't take long,' said Weaver. Shattered: The shattered plastic shell rests beside the rubber turtle after seven drivers swerved and deliberately ran over the animal in the first half hour. Several others tried and missed . Other cars during the hour missed the turtle. But right after his observation period was up, before Weaver could retrieve the model, another car moved to the right to hit the animal as he stood less than 20 feet away. 'One hit in 50 cars is pretty significant when you consider it might take a turtle 10 minutes to cross the road,' Weaver said. Running over turtles even has a place in Southern lore. In South Carolina author Pat Conroy's semi-autobiographical novel 'The Great Santini,' a fighter-pilot father squishes turtles during a late-night drive when he thinks his wife and kids are asleep. His wife confronts him, saying: 'It takes a mighty brave man to run over turtles.' The father denies it at first, then claims he hits them because they are a road hazard. 'It's my only sport when I'm traveling,' he says. 'My only hobby.' Killed off: An Ornate Box Turtle is seen in a yard in Oklahoma while their population is said to be steadily dwindling with turtles taking seven or eight years to become mature enough to reproduce . That hobby has been costly to turtles. It takes a turtle seven or eight years to become mature enough to reproduce, and in that time, it might make several trips across the road to get from one pond to another, looking for food or a place to lay eggs. A female turtle that lives 50 years might lay over 100 eggs, but just two or three are likely to survive to reproduce, said Weaver's professor, Rob Baldwin. Snakes also get run over deliberately. Baldwin wishes that weren't the case, but he understands, considering the widespread fear and loathing of snakes. But why anyone would want to run over turtles is a mystery to the professor. 'They seem so helpless and cute,' he said. 'I want to stop and help them. My kids want to stop and help them. My wife will stop and help turtles no matter how much traffic there is on the road. I can't understand the idea why you would swerve to hit something so helpless as a turtle.'","Placing a rubber turtle in a busy intersection the Clemson University student witnessed seven drivers deliberately hit it in the first half hour .

Famed for their grumpy, solitary lifestyles, socialising has never been known as a priority for rhinos. But new footage shot in Africa has revealed how the black variety of the animal enjoy regular night-time liaisons involving kisses, cuddles and a level of social interaction previously unknown in the species. Thanks to the latest high definition night vision cameras, scientists are now able to observe the animals in the dark for the first time, and have observed a boisterous personality trait that rarely appears during the daytime. Affection: Two black rhinos were caught on camera greeting and sharing an intimate moment in the darkness of the desert . Partying?: The gatherings revealed a level of social interaction previously unseen in black rhinos, who are normally grumpy in the daytime . In footage captured for Sir David Attenborough’s latest BBC wildlife series, Africa, 50 animals were revealed to be gathering in groups of up to 16 each night. Paul Brehem, who was the scientific . adviser for the film crew, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'For us to see this happening at night . is extraordinary. It seems to be happening every night and we could see . different individuals coming and going each night. 'This hasn’t really been . documented or seen before. We thought the extent of their social . interaction was individual males wandering around and searching out . females to mate with.' Ready for action: A black rhino arrives early at a secret watering hole, to join a midnight gathering of sometimes 15 or so other rhinos . The documentary revealed romance was not dead to the breed, with the animals coming together to rub noses, play together and communicate using a range of sounds including high pitched squeaks for calves, and loud bellows by the older . adults. In a sophisticated attempt to win the attention of a female, a young male picked up a pair of antelope horns with his own horns and . gave them to her. But the solicitation ends badly when the female snubs his advances by pretending to go to sleep. Mr Brehem added: 'What is so touching is that there . is a whole side to them that we were not aware of and had not been able . to record before.' Previously the crews could only use the light of the moon to observe the rhinos at night, but the cover of darkness meant the goings-on of their social engagements stayed secret. There are two types of African rhinoceros – black and white, the latter being more common and more sociable during the day. The shot had to be delayed for a year while a camera that could work with almost no light was being developed. It enabled the crew to observe that the eyes of the rhinos were wide open. The exact location of filming will not be revealed due to the threat of poachers. On tape: A black rhino at a secret location in the Kalahari, where new technology was used to observe the creatures at night . The sequence is part of a landmark new series profiling Africa as never before caught on film. Other scenes show eagles catching giant bats on the wing, lizards stalking their prey on the backs of lions, antelope-hunting monkeys and a nail-biting giraffe fight.

Both Reinhart, 42, and Eric Nourse, 41, who had gone to seek help, perished on the steep slopes of the mountain. Greg Nourse alone survived. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Greg Nourse, right, was the only man to survive the cruel weather of Aconcagua in Argentina after their friend fell ill; his twin brother Eric, left, died after going off to look for help . Loss: David Reinhart, a 42-year-old real estate executive from Portland, Oregon, began suffering symptoms of altitude sickness; Eric Nourse went to find help first, and was later followed by his brother Greg . According to Spanish-language news reports, the three alpinists were planning on scaling the summit of Aconcagua, which stands at 22,841 feet above sea level. The route they chose ran along a glacier, and is considered to be one of the most dangerous passages to the summit, Argentinian news outlets reported. As they were ascending last Friday, Reinhart developed altitude sickness that required immediate medical attention. The team used a satellite radio to call for help on Saturday. There are conflicting reports as to who remained with Reinhart and who first went to seek help. Matt Felton, who worked with Reinhart at a commercial real-estate company in Portland, Oregon, told the Oregonian that it was Eric who went to find help. Felton said: ‘(Reinhart)was doing something he really loved. He was doing it with his best friend.’His brother Greg remained with Reinhart to keep him warm on the frigid glacier. Greg then left to go find help. An Argentinian rescue squad found Eric Nourse in critical condition. He later died from pulmonary edema, where fluid fills the lungs, despite workers administering CPR to him. The condition is a common result of serious altitude sickness. Ascent: The three men were climbing Mount Aconcagua in Argentina, the tallest mountain in the Americas . According to the Oregonian, the Reinhart family later chartered a private plane to find Reinhart’s body. The rescue team found Greg Nourse alive but in need of medical care. He was admitted to a hospital in Mendoza. An Argentinian spokesperson told Spanish news agency Telam that Reinhart was ‘found dead in the rocky area called second band, at about 6,600 meters above sea level.’ Reinhart’s brother, Craig Reinhart, told the Oregonian by phone that his brother and their friends loved to travel the world and often would go on expeditions without guides. ‘They loved the outdoors, they loved each other and their families,’ he said from Argentina. He flew down to the South American country to arrange for his brother and Eric Nourse’s bodies to be sent back to the U.S. On their Facebook pages, each of the men is pictured camping, hiking, and going on other outdoor pursuits. They had been on expeditions in the Alps and had once scaled Mt McKinley. Reinhart is survived by his wife Char, as well as three brothers. Eric Nourse’s marital status is unclear.

Honeymooners: British actress Kate Winslet and her new husband Ned RocknRoll have already been embroiled in a battle with locals over plans for new gates at her 15th century . No doubt she hoped that moving to the countryside would provide her with a peaceful start to her third marriage. But Kate Winslet has already found herself embroiled in a battle with locals over her plans for a set of new wooden gates at her 15th century home in a sleepy hamlet. The 37-year-old actress has lost the fight following objections to her proposals to install the 2metre-high gates (just over 6ft 6in) at the £1.95million property she moved into just weeks ago. Miss Winslet, who has been honey-mooning at the house, has now been forced to withdraw her application to the parish council. It is understood she wanted the imposing gates to protect her privacy, but she was accused of trying to impose ‘suburban’ values on the home she shares with husband Ned RocknRoll. Several of her neighbours attended a meeting in the village hall at which they expressed their concern that the design of the gates was out of character. The hamlet – so rural that it does not even have street lights – has become one of Britain’s most exclusive areas because of its picturesque scenery. One neighbour said of the plans: ‘People are very protective of the village. They are not the sort to gawp. Some have said that if she wanted that much privacy she shouldn’t have bought a house like that.’ Another added: ‘It’s very different from New York and Hollywood here. I’m sure everyone there has these great big gates and I think it’s probably what Kate has been used to, but there’s no need to come here and do that. ‘I don’t know what to think, quite honestly. The gates were totally out of character. We are in an area of outstanding national beauty and they just weren’t in keeping with the surrounding area. ‘If you put gates up, you are just drawing attention to something. If you live  normally, no one is going to think a thing.’ Titanic star Miss Winslet, who previously lived in New York, has returned from America permanently to make a home with Mr RocknRoll, Sir Richard Branson’s nephew, who changed his surname by deed poll from Abel Smith. Kate's gate: The current gate on Kate Winslet's 15th century home in a quiet countryside hamlet . The property is just a few miles from the home Mr RocknRoll shared with his  ex-wife Eliza Pearson, the daughter of  Viscount Cowdray. Miss Winslet has a 12-year-old daughter Mia from her marriage to director Jim Threapleton and a son Joe, nine, from her marriage to director Sam Mendes. One reason she is said to have moved  to the area is because of the standard of local schools. The parish council said of the plans: ‘These gates and adjoining fencing are considered to be a prominent, visually intrusive and incongruous feature more suited to a suburban or urban area than this rural setting.’ The council added that while Miss  Winslet’s house is not a listed building, it ‘should be regarded as a heritage asset’. It went on: ‘The hamlet lies in a very sensitive, tranquil, unspoilt and rural location. Security: The 2m high gates that Kate Winslet has applied for planning permission to erect outside her home . ‘Any development should be  compatible with its location and reflect local style and vernacular design. 'The parish council object to the proposed high oak solid gates.’ Neighbours were unsure whether the actress would re-apply with a new design for the gates, although one said: ‘I hope they don’t try again.’ Miss Winslet married last month in America in a romantic and private ceremony attended by only a handful of family and friends. It is thought to have taken place at a resort in the Catskill mountains in a heated barn with a rather hippyish country-chic vibe. The ceremony is understood to have been brief and very simple, with the venue filled with wild  flowers in jam jars and pretty coloured lanterns. In November the actress received a CBE from the Queen at Buckingham Palace for services to drama. She won a best actress Oscar for her performance in the 2008 film The Reader.","Actress Kate Winslet is embroiled in a row with neighbours over a gate .

Bubbly: Nisha Jane Webley, pictured, was always dancing according to friends and was currently studying health and social care at college . The teenager, who lived in Wellington in Shropshire, flew out to spend time with her uncle, the Rev Michael Daniels Senior, in Fairfield, Texas, last month. But on December 27, just 11 days after she arrived, she was found with a gun shot wound to the head. The teenager was rushed to the nearby East Texas Medical Center but later died. Police say that they are still investigating but believe that her injuries were self inflicted. Miss Webley's mother Beverley Still, 49, and sister Navlet, 21 are said to have flown to the U.S to be with their family. Distraught: Nisha, pictured was said to be devastated at a recent split with her boyfriend when she died . Neighbours at her Shropshire home described Miss Webley as a 'lovely outgoing girl' and 'happy-go-lucky'. A family friend added that she was 'so distraught' about the recent split with her boyfriend. Friend Thomas Markus, 20, who went to Telford College with Nisha, said: 'She was such a fun girl and was always dancing. I think she wanted to dance professionally but she was doing health and social care at college with us. 'I can't get over what has happened. 'She split up with her boyfriend at the same time as her best friend Paige broke up with hers. I'm not sure what happened between them but I know they were very close and she was very much in love. 'Her father is American and works in the USA but I think Beverley was just a full-time mum. 'She was really looking forward to that holiday and before she went there was no indication that anything like this could happen. 'She always came across as a bubbly girl, full of personality.' Miss Webley changed her relationship status on Facebook just over two weeks ago and updated her profile picture just hours before she died. Her uncle Glenn Still, 43, said that it is likely to cost the family £3,200 to fly Miss Webley's body back to the UK.

A woman who suffered a stroke at the age of just 29 has battled back to full health in just 13 months - to become a new wife, a new mother and head of her own business. Jenny Hollowood-Smith, 29, fell ill at home just a week after a traumatic labour with son Corey. During the attack she temporarily lost the vision in her right eye and doctors feared she might be severely disabled or die. Powerful woman: Jenny Hollowood-Smith suffered a small stroke after giving birth to her son Corey but now thinks it was the best thing that has happened to her and has since set up her own bridal shop . But after her stroke Jenny who worked as a manager for BAE systems in Preston, Lancs used the attack to re-evaluate her life. Soon afterwards in a quirk of fate she was offered voluntary redundancy from the military defence company and she grabbed the money to help set up herself as a wedding planner. She then married Corey’s father Graham, 29, a sales manager, in a fairytale wedding to cap her 'crazy year'. Jenny, from Leyland, Lancs whose bridal boutique shop is called Personal Touch Bridal said: 'I just realised how short life is and how you just have to make the most out of every single day. 'It’s been like a whirlwind since it happened and getting married was just the perfect way to put my wedding planning skills to the test before opening my own shop. Family life: After giving birth to her son Corey she went on to leave her job with BAE Systems and follow her dreams of opening her bridal boutique . Achieved it all: Jenny not only gave birth, she also married Graham Smith and opened her own business venture . 'The day was just everything I had ever dreamed of. 'At the time of the stroke it was terrifying as I lost vision in my right eye and had a tingling feeling down my arms and legs and I may have been left severely disabled or even worse not be around to see my son grow up. 'I was taken to hospital and then I went for an MRI scan which all came back positive and there were no signs of lasting damage. 'After this scare I took the approach that I needed to concentrate on making the most of things in life and have no regrets. 'So when BAE Systems offered voluntary redundancy I believed this was my opportunity to break out and do something I would love. Her own: Personal Touch Bridal Boutique is Jenny's pride and joy . Her dream: Jenny says helping women plan their weddings is fantastic . 'The redundancy money alone would not support my venture so I pulled together a business plan and went to the bank for support. 'Having been told that banks were not lending I decided to still go ahead and try to obtain funding and amazingly they said yes. 'I’d already helped to plan my brother’s before and then I got the perfect chance to really let loose on my own. “I literally did everything, making my own favours and planning everything down to the last detail, I just loved it. 'It’s such a wonderful job to be able to help someone plan their special day or help them find the perfect dress, it’s a magical time and to be a part of that is incredible.' Turning point: Jenny saw her stroke as the turning point in her life and within two months of making her own big day a success Jenny had secured her bank loan . Jenny had a traumatic labour, in August last year, where she suffered an infection after doctors failed to spot half of her water’s hadn’t broken. But after being back at home for just a week Jenny decided she needed to get out of the house and was busy getting ready to go to a neighbours for dinner when she realised she couldn’t see half of her face in the mirror and had tingling sensations in her arms and legs. Panicked Jenny was rushed to the hospital by husband Graham where after hours and numerous tests Jenny was devastated to be told she had suffered a mini-stroke, which could have easily killed her or left her severely disabled. But Jenny saw her stroke as the turning point in her life and within two months of making her own big day a success Jenny had secured her bank loan, found the perfect location for a shop, spoken to up and coming wedding dress designers and launched her store. Fantastic: Her pregnancy was fantastic with just a few days morning sickness . Jenny said: 'I was in a high pressured job, when I found out I was pregnant and I just thought what was I going to do. My pregnancy was fantastic, I had a couple of bad days where I was sick but it was fine. 'It’s every woman’s nightmare when something starts to go wrong during labour and it was just horrific. I thought I’d got through it all by the time I was back at home and then the stroke struck. 'At first I thought it was the light playing tricks on my eyes in the mirror but then I picked something up to read and half of it wasn’t there. The girl with it all: Jenny has achieved all of her dreams since her mini stroke . 'I knew something was wrong then and we rushed to the hospital, where they said they thought it was a mini-stroke. I was so scared I was sobbing my heart out and my mum was like you’ll be okay and Graham was petrified. 'The tests came back fine, there was no trace of anything my heart was fine, my brain was fine. It was really daunting getting my own shop but it was the best thing I ever did. 'To help brides with their big day is just unbelievable - it’s lovely to have a little part of that.'","Jenny Hollowood-Smith suffered mini stroke after traumatic labour with baby boy .

A Utah city has changed the name of Morning Glory Road after a local business argued the term 'morning glory' - which is slang for a male erection - would deflate its image. Xactware Solutions Inc., which is planning to relocate to the road in Lehi, made a request to change the name to Morning Vista Road last month, claiming it was less offensive. Council members in Lehi, about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City, voted unanimously in favor of the change. Embarrassing: Lehi city council has changed the name of Morning Glory Road, pictured, after a local business argued it would dent its image . According to minutes from the meeting, Xactware Solutions Inc., which provides software for the insurance industry, insisted the new name would fit better with its 'international corporate image.' 'Morning glory' is the name of a flower and part of the title of a popular 1990s song from British rock band Oasis. But the term is sometimes used to describe male arousal. Councilman Johnny Revill, who moved to approve the resolution at the December 11 meeting, told the Salt Lake Tribune that he didn't know about the term's slang meaning previously but was happy to appease Xactware officials. 'That name has a negative meaning for some reason,' Revill said. 'When you use the word, there is a different meaning that can be taken from that.' Distracting: Xactware Solutions Inc., which is expanding its business from Orem to Traverse Mountain in Lehi, made a request to change the name of the road to Morning Vista Road last month . Councilor Mark Johnson told the Daily Herald that he only knows of the noxious weed called Morning Glory that is difficult to control, but he also voted in favor of the resolution. Johnson said Lehi doesn't like to change street names, but it does in some cases to 'honor people or organizations.' The street name was a red flag for Xactware officials when they began considering moving their company's headquarters from Orem to Lehi's Traverse Mountain, said Jonathan Gardner, commercial venture project director for the planned community. The company was worried that the sexual connotation of morning glory would become too prominent in the minds of prospective clients, Gardner said. Just a name: Some believe changing the name of the street, pictured, is an overreaction . Morning Glory is far from an R-rated word in most of America. It is the name of a 2010 Hollywood film starring Rachel McAdams as an upbeat television producer trying to revive a struggling morning show. That movie is rated PG-13. In the popular 1960s TV show 'Bewitched,' the family lived at 1164 Morning Glory Circle. Morning Glory is also the name of a small community near El Paso, Texas. Xactware went 'a little overboard,' in requesting the street name change, said Lehi resident Emily Scanlon. She said she has never thought of the sexual connotation in her four years driving past the road. Lehi, with a population of about 48,000 people, is named after a prophet in the Book of Mormon and is the former home of the Brown family that stars in the reality TV series, 'Sister Wives.' Kody Brown moved his wives and 16 children from Lehi to the Las Vegas area in January 2011 after Utah authorities began a bigamy investigation.",Lehi council members changed the street to Morning Vista Road last month after a local business complained the name didn't fit with its image .

Tory MP Philip Davies, pictured, received a subscription and an £870 trip from companies with links to the betting trade . A Tory MP did not refer to subscriptions and benefits from companies with links to the betting trade during a recent investigation into the betting industry. Philip Davies, a member of the culture, media and sport select committee, declared the donations on his Register of Members' Financial Interests but did not refer to them during a year-long investigation into the betting industry - saying in one case that he should have mentioned it but did not due to an inadvertent oversight and in the other case that he did not have to as the other the firm was not directly linked to bookmakers. Mr Davies, who worked in a bookmakers in his late teens, championed the industry viewpoint during the year-long investigation. Last March, the 40-year-old was taken to the Cheltenham festival, a trip worth £870, by Ladbrokes, according to The Guardian. But when he questioned Ladbrokes chief executive Richard Glynn at a select committee session six months later, he did not mention it. The influential committee member has reportedly been given an annual 'subscription' worth £4,680 from Peninsula Business Services, run by a founder of BetFred. Peter Done founded the company with his brother and the bookmakers has 1,000 shops in Britain. Mr Done is currently a shareholder in BetFred's holding company. Mr Davies insisted he had received no personal benefit from the subscription, and had listed it on his Register of Members' Financial Interest. He said the company offered £9,000-worth of subscriptions for a service that relates to employment tribunals and that he was not aware of any connection with Peter Done. He would only declare it in parliament if he was talking about matters relating to employment tribunals. Mr Davies said: 'I did not think I had interests to declare' in relation to his decision not to refer to this during the inquiry. The parliamentary code of conduct states that where members have a financial interest 'directly affected by a particular inquiry' or a 'personal interest . [that] may reflect upon the work of the committee' then the MP should . consider stepping aside from proceedings. If MPs decide not to, the code . says 'a member should make a declaration of interest at an early stage . in any inquiry to which that interest particularly relates. 'If the . interest is especially relevant to one witness or group of witnesses . appearing before the committee, the interest should be declared again at . the appropriate session of evidence.' Last March Davies was reportedly taken to the Cheltenham festival, a trip worth £870, by Ladbrokes . When Mr Davies was asked about his subscription from Peninsula, he said the link to a bookmakers was 'just a coincidence'. It came after 'a constituent got in contact asking for advice on vexatious claims from employees'. During a year-long investigation into the betting industry, Mr Davies supported the trade and visited, along with other committee members, casino resorts in Australia and Macao. Last July, MPs called on the Government to relax rules restricting gambling venues and machines. The culture, media and sport select committee said councils should be able to allow more gambling machines in betting shops and casinos. The MPs also said the Gambling Commission should charge operators lower fees. When campaigners said changing the rules would lead to problem gambling, Mr Davies called the viewpoint nonsensical in the Commons. A decision with regards to the number of gambling machines is due to be reached in January by ministers. An earlier version of this article suggested that Mr Davies had not declared the subscription or the trip in his Register of Members' Financial Interests. We are happy to clarify that, while they were not referred to during the inquiry, they were declared on the Register.","Ladbrokes took him on '£870 trip to Cheltenham'

Ironic arrest: Donald Blood III, 55, told police he mistook the 'Wilson House's' front lawn for a parking lot when he drove on to the grassy patch a little after 7:30 p.m. Christmas Eve . At least, he won't have to go far for help. A New England man faces a drunken driving rap after an unfortunate -  but undeniably ironic - incident in which he parked on the lawn of Bill Wilson's childhood Vermont home on Christmas Eve. Time Magazine once honored Wilson as one of the 100 most-important people of the 20th century for co-founding Alcoholics Anonymous, or AA. 'The Wilson House,' as Wilson's childhood home in East Dorset, Vermont, is called, now serves as a 'sanctuary' for recovering alcoholics and still reportedly hosts numerous AA meetings each week, according to the Wilson House website. Donald Blood III, 55, of Marlboro, Mass., told police he mistook the 'Wilson House's' lawn for a parking lot when he drove on to the patch a little after 7:30 p.m. Monday evening, Vermont State Police said. Built in 1852, the 14-room country hotel was renovated in 1987 and added in 1995 to the National Register of Historic Places. The hotel is reportedly the largest building in East Dorset, Vermont. The 'Wilson House' once served as Wilson's parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. Modern-day sanctuary: The 'Wilson House' once reportedly served as Wilson's parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. It now serves as a sanctuary' for recovering alcoholics . Visionary: Bill W., or Bill Wilson, is buried - along with his his wife - a short distance from his one-time home that Blood mistook for a parking lot . But now reportedly acts as 'a living memorial to Bill W., as well as a place of sanctuary where people can come to give thanks to God for their new lives,' as the home's website says. Calls placed to the home Thursday went unanswered, although a recorded message revealed AA meetings occurred there as recently as Christmas Day, or the morning after Blood was cited for drunken driving.

A homeless senior citizen snoozing at a Los Angeles bus stop early Thursday is in critical condition after a man fiendishly doused her with an alcoholic beverage and then inexplicably lit her defenseless body ablaze. Authorities soon-thereafter collared the 20-something-year-old assailant who apparently acted without provocation - and whose name had not yet been released Thursday afternoon pending his formal booking. 'It was like when you pour gasoline on something -- like an explosion,' Erickson Ipina told NBC in Los Angeles of this latest bit of violence concering the 67-year-old woman set ablaze on Thursday. The scene of the crime: A 67-year-old vagrant was sleeping about 1 a.m. Thursday morning at an L.A. bus stop when then vicious and senseless attack occurred . Fiend: Police collared a as-yet-unnamed 20-something-year-old suspect shortly after the attack took place Thursday . It is the second such incident to occur in Los Angeles in the last two weeks, in which a public vagrant was set aflame while sleeping after someone poured alcohol on their defenceless body. A 55-year-old man reportedly remains in serious condition after being burned alive last week around the same time of day - 12:45 a.m. - as he slept in a sleeping bag outside a doughnut shop in southern Los Angeles County. No one has yet been arrested in connection with that worrisome attack that concluded when passers-by heard the man's pain-filled screams and alerted the local fire department. That man was reportedly a familiar sight in the Norwalk nabe in which the attack occured, having passed his nights for years in the same area. Similarly, Ipina added he often saw the homeless lady involved in Thursday's incident strolling the very same Van Nuys neighborhood in which the heartless attack occurred about 1 a.m. outside a Walgreens drugstore. Ghastly evidence: Soot colors the sidewalk where someone set a 67-year-old homeless woman on fire after pouring a bottle of alcohol on her body . Like an explosion: A Good Samaritan witness to the attack gave chase after the assailant - and even continued his pursuit after being threatened with a knife . Fighting for her life: The victim remains hospitalized in critical condition after the attack, and officials will soon reportedly transfer her to a local burn unit . Police told The Los Angeles Times witnesses saw the attacker exit the establishment, located at the intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard and Sherman Way, and pour a bottle-borne accelerant on the woman and then flick a lit match on to her sleeping form. Ipina, for his part, gave chase following the ghastly crime, and continued his pursuit even after the assailant brandished a knife. 'He told me, 'Stop following me, or I will cut you. I kept following him and then the police came.' 'He told me, 'Stop following me, or I will cut you,' Ipina told NBC. 'I kept following him and then the police came.' The Times reports Los Angeles is no stranger to such attacks, as homeless man John McGraham was killed in 2008 after a man similarly set him on fire in the Mid-Wilshire district of the city. That assailant, who reportedly said he was fed up with that neighborhood's homelessness problem, was later convicted of first-degree murder, torture and arson. The 67-year-old victim was was hospitalized in critical condition, and will likely be transported to a Sherman Oaks burn center for treatment, police reportedly said.","Cops collared 20-something assailant soon after the attack .

Fateful stretch: Five siblings - all under nine - were killed, along with an adult, when the vehicle their father was driving swerved off County Road 107 (pictured) in eastern Mississippi just after midnight Saturday . A tribe in mourning: A member of the North American Choctaw tribe - to which the six dead belong - dances during a three-day visit to Peru in 2003 . The vehicle plummeted down an embankment and into a typically shallow creek that was swollen from recent rain storms. Authorities identified the five children - all siblings - as well as the lone adult who perished, as part of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, one of three federally-recognized Choctaw tribes. The tribe resides in the Pearl River community east of the Mississippi city of Philadelphia, where it operates a large casino complex. Dewayne John, the children's father as well as the Durango's driver, remains hospitalized with hypothermia and water inhalation, while the condition of the children's mother, Deanna Jim, was unknown.

She was America's oldest citizen at the time she passed . Age never deterred Mamie Rearden. The 114-year-old Edgefield, South Carolina woman, who was the oldest living American when she died Wednesday at a Georgia hospital, got her driver's license at the tender age of 65, or nearly 40 years ago, and rejoined the workforce at 70. When she died, Rearden was more than a year younger than the world's oldest person, 115-year-old Jiroemon Kimura, who is still going strong in Japan. 'She lived a full, beautiful and inspirational life,' reportedly reads her obituary, published in a South Carolina newspaper. Rearden, who relatives say broke her hip in a fall three weeks ago, became the oldest American after Dina Manfredini, 115, of Iowa died last month. Robert Young of the Gerontology Research Group said Rearden's September 1898 birth was recorded in the 1900 U.S. Census. Rearden counts 10 surviving children, as well as nine grandchildren, 10 great grandchildren, one great-great grandchild, six step grandchildren, a host of step great grandchildren and too many nieces, nephews, and friends to count. In addition to her six surviving sons and four surviving daughters, Rearden also had one son, John Wilson, who died before her.

At age 70, Rearden reportedly returned to the workforce as a case worker with the South Carolina office of Economic Opportunity, a position that required her to drive around the county to check on under-privileged citizens. According to her obituary, Rearden and her husband, 'instilled in their children at a very early age the importance of having Godly, righteous, moral and ethical values. They were all taught the importance of integrity and getting a good education.' In 2008, Rearden was honored by the South Carolina State Senate and the South Carolina House of Representatives. She enjoyed reading, knitting, crocheting, and sewing, according to her obituary, as well as 'cooking for her family, and the many friends who visited almost on a weekly basis.'","Mamie Rearden was born in 1898, the same year as the Spanish-American War .

Nabbed!: Kenneth Conley, 38, broke out of a federal jail in downtown Chicago on Dec. 18 with his cellmate . The second convicted bank robber who absconded from a federal jail in downtown Chicago last month was collared Friday donning a disguise making him up to look like an elderly man. However, even elaborately disguised, Kenneth Conley, 38, apparently didn't get very far in the time since he hightailed it from the Metropolitan Correctional Center Dec. 18. The bank robber was nabbed around 4pm in southwest suburban Palos Hills — at a location The Chicago Sun Times reports is less than 100 yards from where he once lived a decade ago. When caught, Conley was masquerading as an old man in a costume complete with sunglasses, a beret, an overcoat, the aforementioned cane, Palos Hills Deputy Police Chief James Boi told The Sun-Times. Meanwhile, the escape accomplice with whom Conley fled - Jose Bank - was bagged Dec. 20 in Lincoln Park, a Chicago suburb where he too once lived. Man of Many Faces: When he robbed a bank in 2011, Conley wore a suit and tie...and a gun tucked into his pants' waistband . It's possible the larcenous Conley swiped a page from Bank in going about town in a costume. The Sun-Times reports Bank had been popularly dubbed 'The Second-Hand Bandit' during his profligate run, a moniker he earned from the thrift store disguises he donned during his heists. Conley's arrest came through the assistance of both a tipster - as well as a Palos Hills homeowner who reportedly popped Conley in the kisser while he attempted to flee from police. The capture is reportedly rooted in a tip from two maintenance workers concerning an apparent drifter snoozing in the basement of a Palos Hills condo building undergoing renovation. Two responding officers, in short order, discovered the elusive Conley, who after giving them a phony pseudonym  again tried to escape by scuffling with both lawmen and punching one. But he didn't get very far. Jailbreak: Conley was nabbed in a Chicago suburb only about 20 miles from the federal lock-up he escaped on Dec. 18 . A Daring Escape: Conley and Joseph ""Jose"" Banks, busted a hole in their cell and then climbed 20 stories to the ground using a rope fashioned from bed sheets . Conley tried to bust into the wrong man's home about 3.40pm - or one in which reportedly resides a hulking 6-foot, 7-inch, 33-year-old high school teacher who would only identify himself as 'Dan.' Dan told The Sun Times he lives with his four young children, one of whom he was playing with when Conley half-way opened his screen door and tried slip inside - and away from police. 'I was like ‘I don’t think you’re getting in here at all,’ Dan told the paper, before adding that he first hammered Conley in the shoulder - and then punched square in the face, causing the beleaguered bank robber to stumble backwards on to a grassy yard - and into the custody of police. Busted: Joseph Banks, who is also a convicted bank robber, was nabbed Dec. 20, or two days after the escape in the Chicago suburb of Lincoln . 'Where he met his end was here,' Dan reportedly said. 'He didn’t get permission to enter my place. He got taken out of here in a bad way.' Police report that they later found a BB gun in Conley's pocket but no ID or money. He was taken to Palos Community Hospital for a checkup alongside the two officers who both suffered minor injuries in the arrest. Conley and his cellmate, Banks, escaped their lockup by apparently smashing a hole in their narrow cell window and climbing down 20 stories using a rope fashioned from bed sheets. Conley pleaded guilty in October to robbing a Homewood Bank in 2011 of nearly $4,000. He wore a coat and tie during the robbery and had a gun stuffed in his waistband. Although he is yet to be sentenced on that charge, he faces up to 20 years in prison on the bank robbery wrap. Shackled in chains and pushed in a wheelchair by U.S. marshals, Conley was hauled back into federal court on Saturday. A largely silent Conley wore a medical brace on a badly swollen left foot, apparently injured during his capture. When Conley did speak during it was simply to acknowledge he understood he could face an additional five years behind bars if convicted in the escape. 'Yes, your honor,' the 38-year-old former strip club worker said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times .","The master of disguise was masquerading as an old man in sunglasses, overcoat, beret and a cane .

A devastated couple are suing a top NHS hospital for £300,000 after doctors failed to identify that their unborn child was severely disabled. The case is highly controversial because the couple claim they would have made the heartbreaking decision to abort the pregnancy if they had known their daughter would be so profoundly disabled. But instead, the child will now require a lifetime of round-the-clock care after two separate specialists at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital failed to spot the significant problems during routine ante-natal scans. The parents are now suing the John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, for £300,000 after scans missed their baby's disabilities . The little girl is described in documents filed at the High Court as having ‘extremely severe disabilities’ with several crucial bones missing. Because she is still very young, the full extent of her disabilities ‘is not yet known’. The documents say: ‘It is the Claimant’s case that, had foetal abnormalities been detected during the course of foetal ultrasound scanning, as they ought to have been, then the First Claimant together with the Second Claimant would or should have been offered to terminate the pregnancy.’ Abortions carried out because of a risk of the child being born disabled – known as ground E abortions – can take place at any time during pregnancy. About 2,300 abortions were carried out for this reason in the UK last year, most for chromosomal conditions such as Down’s syndrome. All pregnant women are offered two ultrasound scans at between 11 and 14 weeks to date the pregnancy and again between 18 and 23 weeks to detect any abnormalities. Both can pick up severe disabilities at an early stage. Some campaigners argue that a child can still live a relatively full life despite substantial disability. Josephine Quintavalle, from Campaign for Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘Being born disabled is not necessarily incompatible with life.’ A spokeswoman for the Family Planning Service said parents had a right to be fully informed. ‘If there are foetal abnormalities, women can choose to have an abortion. It’s a fundamental decision about family life.’ The couple were concerned during the pregnancy after the mother unwittingly had surgery under general anaesthetic, but an ultrasound at the hospital found no cause for concern . The couple, who are in their 40s and have two older children, needed counselling about the child’s disabilities. The little girl’s condition was particularly devastating because the couple had raised concerns during the pregnancy that their unborn baby may have suffered deformities. The mother unwittingly had surgery under general anaesthetic before realising she was pregnant, which is not recommended because of potential risks to the child. But they were reassured after an ultrasound at the John Radcliffe found no cause for concern. A second scan, supposed to detect any abnormalities, including missing bones, also failed to pick up any problems. The sonographer wrote in the notes that there was ‘no evidence of a foetal abnormality’. A hospital consultant later wrote in the woman’s medical records: ‘I have explained that we would normally expect a defect of the type affecting XX to have been detected at the anomaly scan stage and that our  failure to do so is very disappointing to all concerned. I have apologised to them for the failure.’ The court documents say: ‘Damages are claimed for their own personal injury, loss and expense that they have each suffered, and by both Claimants for the additional cost of raising XX attributable to her disabilities.’ A spokeswoman for the hospital said she was unable to comment.","Parents claim they would have aborted pregnancy if disabilities were known .

On the day of the hit and run, Sabah and Rayhan were helping their family prepare for Eid al-Fitr to mark the end of Ramadan and were sent to a nearby shop with their cousin to buy some vegetables.

Sabah was hailed a ‘hero’ by her relatives after it emerged that she was thought to have taken the brunt of the impact in a bid to shield her beloved brother from the force of the smash on August 18. But family members faced a wait for news after the incident - and their mother, housewife Tazeem Noor, 32 and father, IT analyst Mohammed Saleem, 37, maintained a tearful vigil for their children.

Romney had presaged that the Democratic incumbent would - in fact- be the candidate to cull that particular percentage, when he told a cabal of fat cat donors that nearly half of America would never vote for him - or his policies. 'And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax' That 47 per cent of the American electorate, he said, represent those, 'who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.

Close shave: Obama, for his part, notched 51.03 per cent of the popular vote in the 2012 U.S. presidential election . 'I recognize that among those that pay . no tax, approximately 47 percent of Americans, I’m not likely to be . highly successful with the message of lowering taxes.

Master of evasion: Makers of a new Discovery channel documentary said that of all 19 living presidential chiefs of staff, Rahm Emanuel was the 'most challenging' Makers of the upcoming Discovery network documentary on presidential chiefs of staff have a perfect participation record, but not all the subjects were equally eager to share tales from the White House. All 19 living men who had that job gave interviews for The Presidents' Gatekeepers, the four-hour documentary that is expected to air this summer, but Barack Obama's famously pugnacious former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was a reluctant subject. Filmmakers Jules and Gedeon Naudet both agreed that Emanuel, who is the current mayor of Chicago, was the 'most challenging' to deal with. Most of the participants, including Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who served as chief of staff under Bill Clinton, spent three-four hours being interviewed for the film, but Emanuel compressed the long interview into a 15-minute chat, and even then he had objections, according to executive producer Chris Whipple. Looking at some filming equipment, he reportedly told the producers, ‘What the bleep is this? It looks like Guantanamo,’ Whipple told USA Today. Witness to history: Although he stayed for about 15 minutes, Emanuel told the creators of the film about his first stressful day in the White House .

According to the team behind the documentary, Emanuel, who gained notoriety for his aggressive attitude and ability to bend members of Congress to his will, proved to be an expert at evading questions, but also showed himself a masterful storyteller. Whipple told The Hollywood Reporter that Emanuel described for them his first day on the job, when he had to march straight into the situation room to deal with a terrorist threat on the south lawn of the White House while juggling an economic crisis and a failing auto industry. The makers of the documentary said Saturday that their well-regarded previous documentary on the September 11 terrorist attack in New York was a calling card that probably helped them convince some former chiefs to get on board. They shot about 70 hours of interviews that have been cut down to four hours that will be aired in two parts. Stellar reputation: Producers Gedeon Naduet, . left, and Jules Naduet, say that their well-received film about . September 11 likely helped them convince all 19 living chiefs of staff . to sit down for interviews . Their longest interview was with former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was President Gerald Ford's chief of staff in the 1970s. Cheney said that a chief is more powerful than a vice president – a position that he held under President George W. Bush. The film sheds light on White House officials whose job is to stay in the shadow of the president and make sure that the complex political mechanism runs smoothly. The documentary also offers a new behind-the-scenes perspective on key historical events. During the interview, Jimmy Carter's chief of staff Jack Watson talked about the Iran hostage crisis, while Lyndon Johnson's chief of staff Bill Watson revealed that his boss narrowly averted World War III during the 1967 six-day war in Israel. ‘It was a chance for once to have their side of the story told,’ Naudet said. The creators of the documentary hope to interview President Obama, George W.

The five accused 9/11 conspirators are prohibited from bringing up torture at their trial after a military judge's order forcing secrecy over their experiences at CIA prisons. The protective order safeguarding classified information in the case was signed on December 6 by the judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, and unsealed on Wednesday. It is not limited to documents formally labeled 'Top Secret' by the CIA or produced by the government, but also prohibits disclosure of the defendants own 'observations and experiences' in the secret CIA detention, rendition and interrogation program. Terror trial: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, left and military judge Army Colonel James Pohl, are pictured in a court sketch at a pre-trial hearing in October . The five defendants in the 9/11 case, . including the alleged mastermind of the hijacker plot, Khalid Sheikh . Mohammed, have all said that they were tortured during the time in top secret CIA prisons. The CIA has acknowledged it subjected Mohammed to . the simulated drowning technique of waterboarding 183 times. The men face . charges that could lead to their execution. Judge: Pohl signed a protective order that bars torture from being brought up during the trial of the alleged 9/11 conspirators . All five were held in secret CIA . prisons from the time of their capture in 2002 and 2003 until they were . sent to Guantanamo in 2006. Pohl is the chief judge overseeing the war crimes tribunals established by the United States to try foreign captives on terrorism-related charges at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba. Pohl's order prohibits public disclosure of any information that would reveal where the defendants were held; the names, identities and physical descriptions of anyone involved in their capture, transfer, detention or interrogation; and details about the interrogation techniques used on them. Prosecutors had asked for the order and said it was needed to prevent disclosure of information that could cause grave harm to the security of the United States and its allies. Defense lawyers and civil liberties advocates called it an attempt to conceal torture and censor the defendants' own memories. The ACLU is now arguing that the U.S. government is overstepping its bounds with the decision. Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s national security project, told the Christian Science Monitor: 'We are profoundly disappointed by the military judge's decision, which doesn’t even address the serious First Amendment issues at stake here.' Shamsi added: 'The government wanted to ensure that the American public would never hear the defendants’ accounts of illegal CIA torture, rendition, and detention. 'The military judge has gone along with that shameful plan.' Torture claims: The five defendants in the 9/11 case, including the alleged mastermind of the hijacker plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, pictured, have all said that they were tortured during the time in top secret CIA prisons . The ruling comes as the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence weighs whether to release a 6,000-plus-page report analyzing the CIA detention and interrogation program that was launched after the 9/11 attacks. The report is expected to shed light on whether torture produced information that led to the discovery of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts.

A skydiver who died after his parachute failed to open during a jump has been named as 56-year-old David Ball. Mr Ball, from Edinburgh, Scotland, was killed instantly when he hit the ground  at Strathallan Airfield near the town of Auchterarder in Perthshire yesterday. The highly experienced skydiver, who had carried out up to 100 previous jumps, got into trouble when his first parachute malfunctioned during the 3,000ft jump and he failed to deploy his reserve in time to prevent him plummeting to his death. Skydiver David Ball, 56, from Edinburgh, plummeted to his death when his parachute failed to open during a 3,000ft fall . Skydive Strathallan manager Kieron Brady declined to comment today and all jumping at the centre was suspended pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation. Mr Ball had travelled from the central belt to jump at the weekend, but was known to club members as a semi-regular visitor to the Strathallan operation. A source said: 'He had been to . Strathallan plenty of times and was a fairly experienced guy. He would . probably have already completed between 50 and 100 jumps. Married Mr Ball was a keen and experienced skydiver, having taken part in up to 100 previous falls . 'It's a terrible tragedy and everyone's thoughts go out to his family. He had a wife and he had been at Strathallan with a couple of teenage sons in the past. 'It's not entirely clear what happened during the jump and the British Parachute Association make it clear that members should not talk about accidents, so there's nothing more I can say.' The victim is understood to have been . one of several skydivers who carried out solo jumps on Saturday from a . height of around 3 - 4,000 feet. Mr Ball on a previous jump. An investigation is continuing into exactly what went wrong. It is believed poor weather which forced the dive to be undertaken from a lower height may have played a part . Sources at the skydiving club where Mr Ball met his death have been left devastated by the incident . Cloudy weather meant it was unsafe for the launch plane to go on higher before letting the skydivers jump. The minimum safe height is around 2,500 feet, while ideal conditions can see parachutists jump from 15,000 feet. There have been a number of incidents involving skydivers at the airfield in recent years, some of them fatal. In February last year an 18-year old man had to be airlifted to hospital after his parachute failed to deploy during a jump. In August 2011 a 29-year old woman survived after her parachute failed to open and she suffered a broken ankle. A 39-year old man died at the airfield in 2004 after becoming detached from his equipment during a group jump. Investigators are looking at the possibility that the relatively low launch height may have played a key role in the tragedy. The low height meant the first parachute would have deployed immediately upon leaving the aircraft. It is understood that Mr Ball believed he had a problem with his initial parachute shortly after it opened and he took steps to discard it during his descent. However, the reserve parachute had not been pulled and investigators are probing whether the victim was too close to the ground by that stage for it to open and slow his fall efficiently. A police spokesman said: 'Tayside Police can confirm that the identity of the person who tragically died in a parachute incident at Strathallan Airfield on January 5, 2012, is David Ball, 56, from the Barnton area of Edinburgh. 'Enquiries are continuing today with the assistance from representatives of the British Parachute Association. As with all sudden deaths, a full report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.'

Sharon Shoesmith has said she is on benefits and is unemployable after being blamed for the Baby P case . THE social services chief whose team failed to save the life of Baby P has revealed that she is on the dole and unemployable. Sharon Shoesmith lost her job  as Haringey council’s director of children’s services in the fallout  over care given to Peter Connelly, who died aged 17 months after suffering horrific abuse despite being seen by social workers and doctors 60 times. She has waged a long battle to be cleared of any personal responsibility for the child’s death in 2007. And now she has revealed how criticism over her handling of the affair saw her consider suicide, and how she is so scared of revenge attacks she rarely ventures out. Mrs Shoesmith, 59, also suggests  that too many ‘at-risk’ children are taken into care – and that they  would be better left with their parents, despite concerns. Evidently still angry at her treatment, she suggests that inquiries into failures by social services should not be conducted in the public glare. She claims it was only social workers who faced disciplinary action over the case, apparently ignoring the fact that two doctors were investigated. Mrs Shoesmith was sacked from her highly-paid job in 2008 amid mounting public uproar over the death of baby Peter in August 2007 at the hands of his mother Tracey Connelly, 31, her sadistic paedophile boyfriend Steve Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, 40. The senior social worker launched an appeal claiming unfair dismissal and eventually won. Despite reports she was due £1million in compensation, she says she has not yet received the payment, and that she faces huge legal bills. Speaking to Public Servant magazine, Mrs Shoesmith said: ‘What I didn’t know before, but I have learned over the past four years, is that you don’t recover from this – it stays with you. Your entire past is just wiped away and your future is utterly gone. Baby Peter died in August 2007 at the hands of his mother Tracey Connelly, her lover Steven Barker and their lodger, Barker's brother Jason Owen . ‘There was a sense of, “If we hit her hard enough, she will never stand up again”, and I nearly didn’t. It is  very hard to understand what that feels like. ‘People I used to know ask me what I’m doing now, and they’re shocked when I say “Nothing”. ‘They can’t quite grasp that my life hasn’t moved on at all in the past four years – that I can’t find any work and I’m living on benefits. ‘I used to have a £130,000-a-year job running my own department and was a national reference point for Ofsted for special educational needs, but no organisation will take the risk of employing me because of who I am.’ Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly, left, and her boyfriend Steven Barker, right, were jailed, along with Barker's brother Jason Owen for the death of the 17-month-old . Reports blaming her for Peter’s death drove her to consider suicide, and even to question whether she had murdered him herself, before seeking counselling. ‘I was certainly no softy, but being held directly responsible for the brutal murder of a child was something that I found impossible to live with,’ said Mrs Shoesmith. ‘I remember turning to my two grown-up daughters in tears and asking them, “Did I murder him?” I was in such a state that I actually believed I had killed him.’ She added that four years after her sacking she is still scared of being recognised and abused in public, and claimed police warned her she could be pushed in front of a Tube train. Mrs Shoesmith maintains that social workers do a good job and should not be vilified because of the ‘very small number of children who are murdered’. ‘We are so desperately fearful of getting it wrong that we cannot calibrate our own success,’ she said. ‘We have to get back to supporting social workers to use their professional skills to make reasoned judgments. ‘Then the crucial next bit, where no one wants to go, is that we have to accept mistakes happen. ‘The big dilemma for local government is that no one knows what to do with child homicide and whether social workers should be held responsible. It will happen and we cannot prevent it.’ After implying that inquiries  into social services failings should not be conducted in the public eye, and claiming that only social workers faced disciplinary action over baby Peter’s death, she suggested more ‘at-risk’ children should be left at home. ‘There is political pressure to take more children into care earlier to prevent them being harmed,’ she said. ‘But if the figure rises, is that a success or a failure?’","Former social services chief avoids public places four years after sacking .

New York City police officer Juan Pichardo smiled broadly as he was wheeled out of a Bronx hospital Saturday, less than 48 hours after he was shot while trying to stop a robbery. Pichardo, 34, took a bullet in the leg at his family's car dealership Thursday night after two armed men walked inside and demanded cash. The nine-year NYPD veteran, who was off-duty at the time and did not have his service weapon, wrestled one of the gunmen and was shot in the thigh. The other suspect escaped. Hero's welcome: About 100 NYPD officers cheered as Juan Pichardo, 34, left a Bronx hospital after being shot in the leg thwarting a robbery . Despite his injury, Pichardo and a co-worker were able to subdue the alleged perpetrator until police arrived. His suspected accomplice was arrested a short time later along with two others, NY1 reported. On Saturday, some 100 of Pichardo's uniform-clad colleagues cheered outside Jacobi Medical Center and applauded his bravery as bagpipes blared in the background. 'I'm feeling good,' Pichardo told the New York Daily News as he got out of the wheelchair and hopped to a waiting SUV to return home to his wife and three children. Three of the four suspects in the Pichardo shooting — Jeffrey Okine, 22; Marquis Daniels, 23; and Tyquez Harrell, 22 — were arraigned Friday on charges of attempted murder, assault and robbery. The fourth suspect, Rayshaun Jones, 25, was still awaiting arraignment on the same charges. First step: Pichardo, a nine-year veteran, was released from Jacobi Medical Center 48 hours after the shooting . Whisked away: The 34-year-old hopped to a waiting SUV to take him home to his wife and three kids . The incident that left Pichardo wounded happened Thursday evening when he was helping out at his family's car dealership on Boston Road. According to police, at around 6.30pm, two men walked into the store and pretended to be interested in one of the vehicle. A short time later, one of the suspects, Jeffrey Okine, pulled out a Bryco .380 handgun and demanded cash. Although Pichardo was unarmed at the time, he confronted the gunman and wrestled him to the ground, getting shot in the process. The 34-year-old cop and a co-worker managed to hold down the shooter and wait for officers to arrive. Meanwhile, his alleged accomplice fled in a white Impala with Oregon license plates that carried two other men. Crime scene: The shooting happened inside a car dealership on Boston Road in the Bronx owned by Pichardo's family after two gunmen attempted to rob the business . Weapon: The Bryco .380 handgun that was used in the shooting was stolen from North Carolina last month . According to police, Pichardo had recognized Okine as a member of a stickup crew in the Bronx. His Bryco firearm had been reported stolen from North Carolina in December, CBS New York reported. In an unrelated incident, two other NYPD officers in plainclothes were shot about an hour later at the Fort Hamilton Parkway subway stop in Brooklyn about an N train by an armed man, identified as 37-year-old Peter Jourdan. Officer Michael Levay, 27, was shot in his lower back from a 9mm Taurus handgun, but was protected by his bulletproof vest. He was able to return fire and killed the gunman, who landed with his feet on the platform and his body on the train.. His partner, officer Lukasz Kozicki, 32, sustained injuries to his thighs and groin. A passenger in the subway car suffered a graze wound in the leg, he said. Both injured cops were released Friday afternoon from Lutheran Medical Center. Officer Lukasz Kozicki, who was shot on the subway . Officer Michael Levay, who shot the subway gunman .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:49 EST, 22 July 2011 . An inventor who appeared on TV's Dragons' Den turned to crime - by inventing 43 different fake identities. Smooth-talking Andrew Cunningham, 46, pretended to be a James Bond stuntman, a grieving father and a lord among dozens of phoney IDs. A court today heard how he fooled 159 different doctors to swindle the NHS out of more than 22,000 drugs. On television: Andrew Cunningham hoped for fame and fortune when he appeared on the Dragons' Den TV show in 2008, pictured . Prosecutor Jason Howells said: 'Cunningham made 159 visits to doctors across the country using 43 false identities. 'He would make up elaborate stories to explain why he was in the area often claiming he was a stuntman on a new James Bond movie. 'He'd sometimes say he was an ex-Marine working away from home as a weapons and ballistic advisor for the film industry. Andrew Cunningham, 46, pretended to be a James Bond stuntman among dozens of phoney IDs . 'Other times he claimed his son had just died in Afghanistan and he was back in the area to attend the funeral.' The court heard Cunningham even changed his passport to use the name Lord Andrew McDonald Cunningham. Cunningham hoped for fame and fortune when he appeared on the Dragons' Den TV show in 2008 - pitching his idea to put special personal designs and logos to hard hats for the building industry. But Dragons Theo Paphitis and Duncan Ballatyne didn't fall for his invention - and refused to hand over their cash. The business gurus rejected his invention saying 'anyone creative' could customise their hard hat with stickers or stencilling. Cunningham's dream of being a wealthy businessman was finally scuppered when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court for his fraud. The court heard Cunningham became addicted to prescription painkillers - and drove his green Jaguar sports car to GP surgeries over 100 miles apart. Sallie Cheung, a NHS counter fraud specialist, said: 'The lies where so audacious that people just didn't think to question them.' In November 2009 Cunningham, using the name of Mitchell Bradley, presented himself at a Gloucestershire surgery asking for codeine phosphate. Dragons James Caan, Duncan Bannatyne, Theo Paphitis, Deborah Meaden and Peter Jones were not impressed by Cunningham's pitch . He received a prescription but a suspicious doctor rang the hotel where he said he was staying. The hotel had no record of him - so the surgery contacted NHS investigators. They spoke to other doctors in the area and found many of them had been visited by a mystery man matching Cunningham's description. Leighton Hughes, defence, said: 'The degree of invention in Cunningham's stories may look like cunning and manipulation but it's just that he is a very intelligent man. 'For example he made a lot of money developing an invention and after he appeared on Dragons' Den he sold his patent for the invention in the USA.' But the court heard a lot of the cash went on hotel rooms as he travelled as far as Hereford, Somerset and Swansea to trick GPs he was staying overnight. Cunningham, of Rhiwbina, Cardiff, admitted making false approaches to NHS staff. He was given a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £4,000 in compensation and costs. Lee Sheridan, the officer in charge of the investigation, said: 'This should serve as a message to those who think misusing NHS resources and time is acceptable. 'Counter fraud teams across the country are working closely together and sharing information, so we will catch you.'","Andrew Cunningham swindled more than 22,000 drugs out of the NHS .

Midsomer may have excluded black faces because 'it wouldn't be an English village with them’, but it seems that Oxford can accept a little more cultural diversity in its fictional crime fighters. Prime-time ITV drama Lewis is bucking the trend for white-dominated leading roles in detective series with the introduction of a new character to be played by African actor Babou Ceesay. Ceesay will play DC Alex Gray, who will be introduced to viewers this month, bringing a little more colour into the cast of the popular Oxford-set ITV programme. Star of stage and screen: Babou Ceesay as Colonel Mburame in the play Bang Bang Bang. He will play Lewis's new sidekick in the eponymous ITV crime drama . It comes two years after the producer of Midsomer Murders was suspended for saying he did not cast black and Asian people in the series because he wanted to keep his programme 'the last bastion of Englishness'. Gambian-born Ceesay, most recently seen in BBC4 sitcom Getting On, said he didn't believe his casting was a deliberate effort to bring more racial parity to the series. 'I don't think my role in Lewis is . political,' he told the Observer. 'I don't think they were ""going black"" for the part, as the industry phrase goes.' And . there has been no attempt to tie his race into the narrative of the . drama, the 34-year-old said, adding: 'The statement is that I am there . and I am black. 'There is no need for them to say anything else.' Leading man: Kevin Whately as Lewis. Ceesay said he did not believe his casting was a deliberate attempt to bring better racial parity to the series . ITV crime series have long been dominated by white characters, an unspoken prejudice made explicit two years ago when Brian True-May, producer of Midsomer Murders, said he wanted to keep ethnic minorities out of his programme. 'We are a cosmopolitan society in this country, but if you watch Midsomer you wouldn’t think so,' Mr True-May said in early 2011. 'I’ve never been picked up on that, but quite honestly I wouldn’t want to change it. 'We just don’t have ethnic minorities involved, because it wouldn’t be the English village then. It just wouldn’t work. 'Suddenly we might be in Slough. 'We’re the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way.' Mr True-May was suspended, later announcing he was stepping down as executive producer. His replacement, Jo Wright, brought in Asian cast members Ace Bhatti and Soraya Radford to help the show 'represent its audience'. Ceesay, who grew up in Africa, admitted that his race had affected the kinds of roles he was offered as he began his acting career in the UK. But he said he had a 'slightly different view' of the problems faced by ethnic minority actors in the UK as black British actor David Harewood, star of Homeland, who said he had to go to the U.S. to land a major role. 'I do agree with him that the size of the industry out there makes a difference,' Ceesay said. 'But it is more competitive there, too. 'He was in a very big series, but I know several good black actors who are struggling out there.'","Casting comes after controversy over roles for ethnic minorities in ITV crime dramas .

A dental assistant fired because her boss thought she was too attractive wants the Iowa Supreme Court to reconsider its decision rejecting her discrimination lawsuit. Melissa Nelson's attorney asked the all-male court Friday to withdraw its Dec. 21 ruling, which she called a 'significant blow to gender equality.' The court ruled that Nelson's firing by Fort Dodge dentist James Knight might've been unfair but wasn't illegal. Fired: Melissa Nelson was so attractive, Iowa dentist James Knight fired her out of fear she'd make him want to stray from his marriage . Hello ladies: Despite Nelson being 21 years younger than him, married, and 'not interested in a relationship,' Knight believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her . The court - and specifically Justice . Edward Mansfield, who penned the decision - ruled firings of . employees who are an 'irresistible attraction' to bosses do not violate . the Iowa Civil Rights Act because they're motivated by feelings and emotion, not . gender. Nelson's filing says the court erred because her gender played a role in her termination. Knight said he fired Nelson because he'd grown too close to her and worried he'd try to start an affair. The court ruled 7-0 bosses can sack . employees they see as an 'irresistible attraction,' even if they have . not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong. Talking with CNN recently, Nelson said of the decision, 'I don't think this is fair. I don't think this is right.' An attorney for Knight said the decision, the first of its kind in Iowa, is a victory for family values because Knight fired Nelson in the interest of saving his marriage, not because she was a woman. But Nelson's attorney said Iowa's all-male high court, one of only a handful in the nation, failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace. Nelson insisted she was never interested in Knight romantically, regardless of his own feelings. 'Absolutely not,' she said. 'I'm happily married.' Content: Happily married with children Nelson said she saw Knight as a father figure and had 'absolutely' no interest in him romantically . Since Knight fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week. While her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he couldn't look at her without being aroused, Nelson said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices. Asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive, Nelson laughed at the question. 'I'm just an ordinary girl,' she said. 'Just an ordinary mom.' Her attorney, Paige Fiedler, said, 'These judges sent a message to Iowa women that they don't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that Iowa women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses' sexual desires. If they get out of hand, then the women can be legally fired for it.' Nelson, 32, worked for Knight for 10 years, and he considered her a stellar worker. But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion. He also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying, 'that's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' 'That's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' Knight and Nelson — both married with children — started exchanging text messages, mostly about personal matters, such as their families. Knight's wife, who also worked in the dental office, discovered the messages and demanded Nelson be fired. The Knights consulted their pastor, who agreed that terminating Nelson was appropriate. Knight fired Nelson and gave her one month's severance. He later told Nelson's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her. Family man: Knight's wife, who also works in the dental office, demanded Nelson be fired when she discovered text messages . Ordinary mom: Nelson has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path . Nelson was stunned because she viewed . the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested . in starting a relationship, Fiedler said. Nelson filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, arguing Knight wouldn't have terminated her if she was male. She did not allege sexual harassment because Knight's conduct may not have risen to that level and didn't particularly offend her, Fiedler said. However, it has been revealed Knight sent Nelson raunchy text messages about six months before her dismissal asking how often she 'experiences orgasms.' 'The motives . behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so . to preserve his marriage. Knight argued Nelson was fired not because of her gender, but because her continued employment threatened his marriage. A district judge agreed, dismissing the case before trial, and the high court upheld that ruling. Mansfield noted that Knight had an all-female workforce and Nelson was replaced by a woman. He said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner's family. One such case from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a business owner's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage. In that case, the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct. Jurisprudence: Justice Edward Mansfield penned the Iowa Supreme Court's decision on Knight's dismissal of Melissa Nelson . Mansfield said allowing Nelson's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender. Knight's attorney, Stuart Cochrane, said the court got it right. The decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination; in this case, by allowing Knight to honor his wife's wishes to fire Nelson, he said. Knight is a very religious and moral individual, and he sincerely believed that firing Nelson would be best for all parties, he said. 'While there was really no fault on the part of Mrs. Nelson, it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman,' he said. 'The motives behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so to preserve his marriage. 'I don't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all. In my view, this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law.'","A lawyer for Melissa Nelson on Friday asked the Iowa Supreme Court to void its Dec. 21 ruling .

Influential conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer has praised Republican House Speaker John Boehner for preventing a ‘rape of the Treasury’ by blocking a larger relief bill for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Bohener and the GOP leadership have been criticized by New York-area Republicans for failing to pass a $60 billion bill to the floor, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie calling it ‘disgusting.’ Instead, the House passed a much smaller bill dealing solely with flood insurance on Friday, with a larger bill set to follow. Fox News' commentator Charles Krauthammer praised John Boehner, claiming he had prevented a 'rape of the Treasury' More than two months after Superstorm Sandy struck, the House and Senate Friday approved $9.7 billion to pay flood insurance claims. The vote came days after Republicans erupted over House Speaker John Boehner's decision to delay the vote . Speaking on Fox News’ Special Report on Friday, Krauthammer claimed that Boehner had done the right thing. ‘I think what Boehner did in postponing the vote until today was absolutely right,’ he said. ‘That was a rape of the Treasury. $60 billion, including a ton of pork. The part that was essential that passed today was to replenish the flood insurance. That's right, and the rest ought to be debated in regular order.’ More than two months after Superstorm Sandy struck, the House and Senate Friday approved $9.7 billion to pay flood insurance claims for the many home and business owners flooded out by the storm. Friday morning, the House voted 354 - 67 for the bill, just days after Republicans erupted over House Speaker John Boehner's decision to delay a vote earlier in the week; all of the no votes were cast by Republicans. The Senate was passed the bill Friday afternoon. 'It's the right step,' said Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., a member of the House Appropriations Committee. The bill gives more borrowing . authority to the National Flood Insurance Program to pay about 115,000 . pending Sandy-related claims as well as about 5,000 claims unrelated to . Sandy.

National Flood Insurance Program would run out of money next week if . Congress didn't provide additional borrowing authority to pay out . claims. Congress created the FEMA-run program in 1968 because few . private insurers cover flood damage. The flood insurance measure is the . first phase of a proposed Sandy aid package. Boehner agreed to Friday's . vote after the controversy over delaying House action on a broader Sandy . aid package.

The frustration, however, continued on both sides of the . aisle on Friday, as lawmakers said the flood insurance infusion would . do little to help the bulk of those suffering more than two months after . the devastating October 29 storm. FEMA's disaster relief fund still has about $4.3billion, enough to . pay for recovery efforts into early spring, according to officials. The . unspent FEMA money can only be used for emergency services. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, . District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Hampshire, . Delaware, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are receiving . federal FEMA aid. Sandy was blamed for at least 120 . deaths and battered coastline areas from North Carolina to Maine. New .

The storm damaged or destroyed more . than 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey. In New York, 305,000 . housing units were damaged or destroyed and more than 265,000 businesses . were affected. 'It . took only 10 days after Katrina for President Bush to sign $60 billion . in Katrina aid,' said New Jersey Democratic Representative Bill . Pascrell, referring to the 2005 hurricane that devastated the Gulf . Coast. 'How dare you come to this floor and make people think everything . is OK.' Senate action on that measure is expected the following week; financially strapped local governments are awaiting the money. Northeast lawmakers say the money is . urgently needed for storm victims awaiting claim checks from the late . October storm, which was one of the worst ever to strike the Northeast, . ravaging the coast from North Carolina to Maine, with the most severe . flooding occurring in Atlantic City, N.J., New York City and Long Island . and along the Connecticut coastline. 'People are waiting to be paid,' said . Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., whose district includes Atlantic City and . many other coastal communities hard hit by the storm. 'They're sleeping . in rented rooms on cots somewhere, and they're not happy. They want to . get their lives back on track, and it's cold outside. They see no . prospect of relief.' As with past natural disasters, the . Sandy aid proposals do not provide for offsetting spending cuts. Some . tea party House Republicans and other fiscal conservatives favor cutting . other federal programs to pay for some or all disaster costs. The supports for the boardwalk that was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy can still be seen on the beach in the Rockaways . The Club For Growth, a conservative . group, on Friday urged lawmakers to oppose the bill, saying that . Congress should only approve Sandy aid in installments to make sure the . money is wisely spent and that any new Sandy aid should be offset with . spending cuts elsewhere. 'Congress should not allow the . federal government to be involved in the flood insurance industry in the . first place, let alone expand the national flood insurance program's . authority,' the group said in a statement. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., a fiscal . conservative who voted against the flood bill, said he was among those . with concerns about the budget deficit. 'We have to talk seriously about . offsets,' Huelskamp said. 'We can't take $60 billion off budget, that's . my problem with it.' Boats and docks damaged by Hurricane Sandy are seen on Staten Island, New York . The current debate over Sandy aid . comes barely a year after Congress and the White House set up a new . system to budget help for victims of hurricanes, tornadoes and floods . before they occur. The new disaster funding scheme permits aid money to . be added to the budget in line with amounts budgeted in recent years. The idea was to avoid battling and uncertainty over disaster funding. Damage from Sandy, however, was so extensive that it's swamping the $12 billion disaster aid budget cap for the current year. A halloween decoration with 'FEMA' written on it is displayed in Queens, New York. FEMA is being criticised for taking to long to fill flood claims . Boehner, of Ohio, had promised a .

Bill Edwards, 21, has spoken of the 'four months of hell' he suffered after being accused of attempted murder . A farmer accused of attempted murder after catching an intruder red-handed spoke of his outrage last night after the thief walked free with a £100 fine. Unemployed criminal David Taylor was captured when Bill Edwards confronted him on his isolated woodland property. Mr Edwards, 21, fired his shotgun at a van driven by Taylor as the thief accelerated towards his mother, Louisa Smith, 50. Taylor was caught after a high-speed chase but it was the farmer who endured a horrendous ordeal at the hands of police who arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder. Last night Mr Edwards labelled the experience ‘four months of hell’ and attacked the ‘pathetic’ punishment handed out to the intruder. The former public schoolboy said: ‘It’s completely changed my view of the police. They treated me like a criminal. The police have acted like bullies who have turned someone who was very supportive of their work into someone who wants nothing more to do with them. They can’t protect the public but don’t allow the public to protect themselves.’ Speaking about the sentence, he added: ‘It is hard to find words to describe how ridiculous the sentence is. I’m absolutely disgusted. ‘We have had four months of being treated like criminals only to see the real criminal let off with a measly fine which will be paid for by the taxpayer since he is on state benefits.’ Mr Edwards and his mother feared for their lives during the confrontation on their land on the outskirts of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, last August. It reignited the controversy over how householders can protect their families after a Leicestershire couple were told they would not be prosecuted for shooting at burglars. Mr Edwards said his family has lost thousands of pounds through theft and damage caused in a number of raids on their land. They caught Taylor and an accomplice loading stolen metal cables into the back of his Ford Transit after spotting that outbuildings had been tampered with. The thieves jumped into the van and drove it towards the pair as they desperately dialled 999 for help. Mr Edwards fired his shotgun, which was loaded with lightweight rabbit shot, several times, hitting the van’s windscreen and bodywork. No one was hurt. Police eventually caught Taylor when Mr Edwards gave chase and gave a running commentary on his mobile phone. But the crook was only charged with metal theft. Mr Edwards' shotgun was loaded with lightweight rabbit shot when he fired it at the van . He was accused of attempted murder after firing his shotgun at a van driven by thief David Taylor as he and his mother feared for their lives . Meanwhile Mr Edwards and his mother . were arrested, held overnight in cells and left on bail for four months. Mrs Smith was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm with . intent. It is believed . police have a recording of the 999 call in which the shots can be heard . as Mrs Smith shouts: ‘He is trying to kill us, shoot his tyres.’ But . even now the farmer has not had his shotgun and other weapons returned . to him which he uses to control pests on his land and as a hobby.

Taylor left court grinning and sneered ‘lucky you’ at Mr Edwards after finding out the attempted murder allegation had been dropped. Moments earlier his solicitor Ian Brickman said the thief ‘is in many ways the victim in this’ and was left so ‘traumatised’ he cannot work. Outside court, Bill’s father Garry Edwards, 67, said the case has been a ‘complete nightmare’. He said: ‘They were victims of a deadly attack and yet some of the police officers treated them as criminals.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said no further action will be taken against Mr Edwards or his mother.","Bill Edwards, 21 was accused of attempted murder after catching thief .

A Second World War fighter pilot and charity fundraiser had his house burgled days after he was awarded a British Empire Medal in the New Year’s Honours List. Graham Furley, 91, was asleep at his home in Stroud, Gloucestershire, when thieves broke in between midnight and 7am on New Year’s Day. The offender or offenders forced their way through a side window before searching the house, even opening the drawers next to the bed where he slept. Hero: Graham Furley (pictured) was burgled days after he was awarded a British Empire Medal . Mr Furley's daughter, Jane Oldmeadow, 60, who also lives in Stroud, said: ‘I think he’s feeling a bit sort of shell shocked about it all. ‘Your home should be your castle, it should be a place that you are safe and the fact that a stranger can be standing by your bedside, helping themselves to anything they like at night, is not really something you want to be thinking about. ‘He’s quite a strong character, so he’s quite cross about it - the fact that they’ve been in and taken his bits and pieces that matter to him.’ Among the items taken was a commemorative spitfire watch, which was a present from his daughter and son-in-law honouring his years as a wartime RAF pilot. Mr Furley was awarded a British Empire Medal (pictured) for his charity work . Describing the break-in, Mrs Oldmeadow said: ‘It was New Year’s Eve and my father had gone up to bed about 11.15pm. ‘He got disturbed at one point, got up, checked around, and heard what he thinks were fireworks being let off near-by, then went back to bed. ‘In the morning, he discovered that he had been broken into and a lower window had been forced in and people had been through the house, going through various bits and pieces and had gone up into his bedroom and gone through his bedroom while he was in bed. ‘They took his wallet and his phone, and some watches and then let themselves out.’ Mrs Oldmeadow said she was appealing to the people of Stroud for help catching those responsible. She added: ‘If publicising it helps to catch these people and stop it happening to other people, then that’s really the most important thing at this stage.’ ‘If somewhere somebody will say ‘That really isn’t on’, and if they do know someone that has turned up with something, they just might give it up.’ Mr Furley has worked for over 40 years to raise funds for charity as a member of Stroud Rotary Club and as part of the Stroud Hospitals League of Friends. His daughter said he was probably best known for his part in the club’s Christmas collection, which sees him assemble Santa’s float and tow it along behind his white VW Beetle to raise money for charity. ‘I suppose 90 per cent of his time is spent doing things for other people,’ Mrs Oldmeadow said. ‘He does a lot of work for Stroud Hospital, he spent all the Christmas period out with a float and grotto that he creates collecting money for good local charities. Break-in: Thieves forced their way into his house through a side window (file picture) ‘I think a lot of people have felt it was something he should have been recognised for, and fortunately on this occasion it came right for him.’ She added that her father had been ‘flattered’ if somewhat ‘mystified’ to find out he had received the honour. Police Sergeant Jo Fletcher, of Gloucestershire Police, said: ‘This gentleman is one of the country’s heroes, having courageously served as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. ‘This remarkable man literally put his life on the line to protect the nation and ensure freedom for future generations and then continued in his civilian life by devoting himself to charity work. ‘For someone to break into his house is a despicable act and whoever has done this should be ashamed of themselves. ‘We are calling on anyone who knows anything about this burglary to come forward and help us catch those responsible.’ Other items taken included two watches with multi-dials and brown straps, a brown leather wallet, a number of debit and credit cards and a black Apple iPhone.","Graham Furley was asleep when thieves broke in to his home in Stroud .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:13 EST, 3 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:13 EST, 3 January 2013 . Controversy surrounding a New York newspaper's decision to publish the names and addresses of local gun permit holders continued at fever pitch yesterday as a threatening envelope of white powder arrived in the newsroom's mail. Sparking initial fears of an anthrax attack, the surprise package came after The Journal News had reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper's headquarters in West Nyack. One employee who handled the envelope was checked for contamination before the intimidating missive was deemed to be harmless. Scare: An envelope of white powder is a latest threat targeted at New York paper The News Journal after it published a list of gun permit owners in the area (STOCK PHOTO) While staffers continued their work yesterday evening, the threat was not taken lightly at the paper. News Journal chief, Janet Hasson, told The New York Times that 'the safety of my staff is my top priority.' The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of . pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just . north of New York City in an interactive map on its website. The Rockland County Times reported on Tuesday that Journal News editor Caryn A. McBride hired gun-toting security guards to patrol the paper's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days. The paper hired the increased security from RGA Investigations & Security, a firm based in New City that provides services like protection and security guard certification, according to the Times. The news came just days after the Journal News announced plans to publish an expanded list of  even more permit-holding locals. Targeted: The Journal News published the names and addresses of people in the area with legal gun licenses on December 23rd . Along with an article entitled 'The . gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your . neighborhood,' the Journal News map was compiled in response to the December 14 . shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, . editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said. The next batch of names will be . permit holders in suburban Putnam County, New York, where the county . clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information. Some 44,000 people are licensed to . own pistols in the three counties, the newspaper said. Owners of rifles . and shotguns do not need permits, the newspaper said. The publication prompted outrage, particularly on social media sites, among gun owners. 'Do you fools realize that you also . made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns . in them to protect themselves?' Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, . posted on the newspaper's web site. 'What a bunch of liberal boobs you . all are.' Republican state Senator Greg Ball of . Patterson, New York, said he planned to introduce legislation to keep . permit information private except to prosecutors and police. Naming names: The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just north of New York City in an interactive map on its website . A similar bill that he introduced earlier as an Assemblyman failed in the state Assembly. 'The asinine editors at the Journal . News have once again gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet . letter on law abiding firearm owners throughout the region,' Ball wrote . on his Senate web site. The newspaper's editor and vice . president of news, CynDee Royle, earlier in the week defended the . decision to list the permit holders. 'We knew publication of the database . would be controversial, but we felt sharing as much information as we . could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of . the Newtown shootings,' she said. Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online. Howard Good, a journalism professor . at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' response childish and petulant. Calling for change: The paper said that they decided to do so because in the wake of the Newtown shooting, many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood, and across the country there were protests (pictured) 'It doesn't move the issue of gun . control to the level of intelligent public discussion,' he said. 'Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a . contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.' Good said the information about permit holders was public and, if presented in context, served a legitimate interest. But media critic Al Tompkins of the . Florida-based Poynter Institute wrote online this week that the . newspaper's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit . holders' loss of privacy. 'If journalists could show flaws in . the gun permitting system, that would be newsworthy,' he said. 'Or, for . example, if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political . connections, then journalists could better justify the privacy . invasion.' Tompkins said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears. 'The net effect of the abuse of public . records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening . records, which would be the biggest mistake of all,' he said.","The Journal News published names and addresses of gun permit owners on December 23 .

George Osborne's plan to claw back child benefit through the tax system is due to kick in from Monday . Hundreds of thousands more families could end up losing some or all of their child benefit, it emerged yesterday. Financial experts say they would join the ranks of the more than a million who will lose an average of £1,300 this year. With the benefit starting to be means-tested from Monday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies issued a withering verdict on the ‘incoherence’ of the policy. It said that while 85 per cent of families would continue to receive the benefit following this year’s reforms, more and more families will lose it in the years ahead as wages rise but the threshold for losing the benefit remains at the same level. ‘The number who will lose at least some child benefit will just increase indefinitely as you go further and further into the future,’ said Robert Joyce, of the IFS. The Government says it has no plans to change the threshold at which child benefit is lost from the current £60,000. The IFS estimated that 820,000 families in which one partner earns more than £60,000 will lose all their child benefit this year, while a further 320,000 families in which the highest earner is paid between £50,000 and £60,000 will see some of their payments cut. The Institute for Fiscal Studies released this graph which shows how the marginal tax rate faced by parents earning between £50,000 and £60,000 could top 65 per cent for anyone with three children in 2013-14 . It said the average loss is £1,300 a . year. Its report warned that larger families will face crippling . marginal tax rates – the effective tax rate on every extra pound of . income, taking into account both extra tax paid and withdrawn benefits. This is because for every £100 earned between £50,000 and £60,0000, 1 . per cent of child benefit will be cut. The marginal tax rate between £50,000 and £60,000 will increase by about . 11 percentage points for the first child, to 51 per cent, and a further . seven points for each subsequent child, the IFS said. So, for example, while about 320,000 people will lose more than 50p  in every extra pound they earn between £50,000 and £60,000, about 40,000 of them – those with three or more children – will find that their marginal tax rate jumps to at least 65 per cent. David Gauke said he is 'pleased' with how things were going despite the confusion . Families with four children with one . earner on between £50,000 and £60,000 will face an extraordinary . marginal tax rate of 71.5 per cent. Experts say this will create huge . incentives for people in this income band to reduce their taxable income . – for example, by contributing more to a private pension or working . less. Mr Joyce said the reforms,  which were watered down by the Chancellor following protests from Conservative MPs, will create ‘a series of administrative complexities, including the need for up to 500,000 more individuals to fill in self-assessment forms’. He added that the ‘biggest concern’ is the incoherence the change will create in the welfare system. Families will have to get to grips with the different ways child benefit and child tax credits – soon to be the child addition within the universal credit – are assessed, Mr Joyce said. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Withdrawing child benefit on the basis of the combined family income would require intrusive means-testing of all eight million households getting child benefit. ‘The way we are doing it is simpler for the vast majority of families.’","Changes to cut child benefit for families with someone earning more than £50,000 start on Monday .

The former nursing student accused of killing seven people in a gun rampage at a Christian College in Oakland last April has been deemed by a judge today to be mentally unfit to stand trial for his crimes. The ruling by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Carrie Panetta came after two doctors who evaluated One Goh, 44, determined that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. However, Panetta did leave the door open for a criminal trial for Goh after stating that if he is judged to have regained his mental competency he will stand trial for seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder following his April 2nd shooting spree at Oikos University. One Goh appears in an Alameda County Superior courtroom in Oakland, Calif. A judge ruled on Monday, January 7th that Goh, is not mentally fit for trial . The shootings were the deadliest at an American college since 2007, when a Virginia Tech University student killed 32 people and wounded 25. A public defender representing defendant One Goh said a psychiatrist has determined that Goh suffers from paranoid schizophrenia that dates back several years. Alameda County Assistant Public Defender David Klaus has said the condition causes Goh to distrust people, including those trying to help him. Klaus has said he and his co-counsel have had trouble talking with Goh because of his mental state. Authorities have said Goh, a former Oikos student, planned the killing spree at the school that caters to Korean immigrants after becoming angry with school officials over a tuition dispute. He previously decided to drop out of the school's nursing program. Goh, a Korean national is currently being held in custody without bail and is also facing 10 so called special-circumstance allegations, including committing murder during a carjacking. Police in Oakland said that Goh fled the campus after the April 2nd shootings after stealing a car that belonged to one of the victims. Vendetta: One Goh (pictured left) reportedly . shot seven dead at Oikos University in California after going to the . school looking for administrator Ellen Cervellon (right) He was arrested in Alameda after he confessed to a supermarker security guard that he had just shot several people. Police said that one theory they are examining for the shooting is that he wanted a refund of his tuition and may have targeted an administrator who was not present on the day of the shooting. Ellen Cervellon said alleged shooter One Goh, 43, dropped out of the nursing program at Oikos University in November but had returned to the Oakland campus several times to demand a full tuition refund from her. Ms Cervellon said Goh was furious when she told him that the school could not refund all his money because he had been enrolled for nearly half of the program. Distraught: A young woman holds her head in her hands at a memorial service following the college shooting in Oakland, Calfornia where seven people were killed . When Goh was told the woman was not on at the college, he began shooting indiscriminately in classrooms. He killed six students and a school receptionist while wounding three others. The coroner's office named the . victims as Judith Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia Sim, 21, of Hayward . and 33-year-old Sonam Chodon of El Cerrito. Grace Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris . Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro and male victim Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, . of San Francisco, also died. School secretary Katleen Ping, 24, was also shot dead at the Oakland school.

Ms Cervellon said: 'In talking to several of the students and faculty who were there, I think he was looking for me. 'I have that weight on my shoulders and I don't know what to do with it. 'Every single one of those students were going to be an excellent, excellent nurse. They're in my heart and they always will be.' Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told . reporters at the time that Goh was angry after being expelled from the . school, but Ms Cervellon said he was never expelled and decided to leave . on his own. Support: A gunman fired indiscriminately on the campus on the morning of April 2nd as students attended classes . Victim: Grace Eunhae Kim, 23, was killed in the shooting at the Christian college in Oakland, California . She said: 'He was never forced out, he showed no behavioral problems, and he was never asked to leave the program. 'He decided on his own to leave the program.' Prosecutors charged Goh with seven counts of murder the day after the massacre at the college. The 43-year-old was also charged with three counts of attempted murder. He also faced a special circumstance allegation of multiple murders that could make him eligible for the death penalty. Lost mother: Kathleen Ping, 24, was killed in the school shooting. She leaves her four-year-old son Kayzzer . Goh surrendered to authorities an hour after the attack at Oikos University that left seven dead and three others wounded.

Once it has paid off its fines it will 'cease to operate as a bank.' Wegelin becomes the first foreign bank to plead guilty to tax evasion in the U.S and must pay $57.8m (£36m) in fines to the US authorities. After that it will close . The bank, established in 1741, confessed to allowing more than 100 American citizens hide $1.2bn from the Internal Revenue Service for nearly a decade. America's recent crackdown on tax evaders and offshore accounts discouraged Swiss banks from taking on U.S. customers. But Wegelin, based in the Swiss town of St Gallen did not follow suit. US Attorney Preet Bharara told the BBC: 'The bank wilfully and aggressively . jumped in to fill a void that was left when other Swiss banks abandoned . the practice due to pressure from US law enforcement. 'It is a watershed moment in our efforts to hold to . account both the individuals and the banks - wherever they may be in the . world - who are engaging in unlawful conduct that deprives the US . Treasury of billions of dollars of tax revenue.' The . crackdown started around 2007 with an investigation of UBS AG, . Switzerland's largest bank.

In this particular case UBS and US prosecutors settled on a . deferred prosecution agreement, with the fine being paid in exchange for . the charges being dropped against the bank. The crackdown continued, however and incorporated the entire Swiss . banking industry. Dozens of U.S. clients and at least two dozen Swiss bankers have been charged, in moves that have strained U.S.- Swiss relations. Wegelin's chiefs admitted to the New York court that they . knew what they were doing it was wrong, but thought they could avoid prosecution because their actions were deemed legal in Switzerland. Potentially it has severe implications for other Swiss banks such as Credit Suisse, who are also under investigation.

Becker, who was headmaster at the Brooks School for more than 20 years, allegedly had an affair with one of his students in 2004 . A former New England prep school head allegedly engaged in an improper relationship with a student while serving as headmaster; the alleged relationship may have in turn been revealed by an escort. An unnamed New York escort’s ‘disturbing emails’ to the Brooks School outside of Boston apparently sparked the initial investigation into Lawrence W. Becker, who was the headmaster of the prestigious prepatory school for more than two decades. Becker, 71, allegedly hired the male escort in the fall of 2011. According to the New York Post’s Page Six, the male escort sent a series of ‘disturbing’ emails to the Brooks School last summer. The Boston Globe reports that while Becker initially denied knowing the man sending threatening emails, he eventually admitted to knowing him. John R. Packard, the current head of the school, as well as William N. Booth, the current board president, sent a letter to the community late last week alerting alumni and parents that Becker’s conduct was ‘an abuse of his position.’ The two men asked in the letter if anyone had ‘personal knowledge that calls into question Mr Becker’s conduct.’ Prestigious: The Brooks School, located in North Andover, Massachusetts, was founded in 1926 and charges $49,365 for tuition with boarding .

Along with three other cake artists, Annabel showed off her skills and managed to pull off the Christmas dinner which went on display at Imperial on 13 December. Incredibly, Annabel only turned her hand to cake art two years ago when she married her American husband Thom and needed a cake to celebrate the big day. The two-tier white chocolate mud cake was a huge hit with her guests, and Annabel soon found herself with orders coming in from family and friends.

'When I look back at how it all turned out, I'm really pleased and it's actually better than I imagined.' Can we eat it? Visitors to the exhibition in London were initially shy about scoffing Annabel's art, but eventually everyone got stuck in . The idea behind the sweet dinner was that visitors to the exhibition would eat it - but in typically British fashion, people were too polite to touch the art, much less take great bites out of it. Annabel said: 'We took the dinner along to the exhibition for people to eat but to begin with everybody was a bit shy about trying tucking in. 'Once the first person tried a bit though, everybody else joined in and it was gone within 30 minutes.'

Worrying: Britain could be hit with a major outbreak of flu after doctors reported a massive increase in cases of the potentially deadly virus . Britain could be hit with a major outbreak of flu after doctors reported a massive increase in cases of the potentially deadly virus. Health experts have revealed that the number of people visiting their GPs has increased by almost 50 per cent in two weeks. This comes as the UK is still recovering from the worst norovirus outbreak in years - with 1.1million people struck down by the winter vomiting bug. Yesterday, the Health Protection Agency revealed that consultation rates in England rose from 23 per 100,000 in mid December to 33 per 100,000 in the week ending December 30. Meanwhile, 2.1 per cent of the calls received by NHS Direct concerned flu compared to 1.6 per cent the previous week. However, it is feared the situation could be far worse because many GP surgeries were closed over the festive period. Professor John Watson, head of the respiratory disease department at the HPA said: . 'The latest data should be interpreted with caution due to GP practices being closed on the bank holidays which may have impacted on GP consultation rates. 'It is vital that those who are most ‘at risk’ from flu make sure they receive their vaccination as this is the most effective way of preventing them from becoming ill with the virus. These ‘at risk’ groups include people with weakened immune systems, those with underlying conditions such as liver, lung or renal diseases, heart problems or diabetes, as well as the over 65s and pregnant women.' Experts warned this week that around 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over Christmas - and cases will continue to rise . Figures showed the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year. The dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the . illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the . country. Illness: Health experts have revealed that the number of people visiting their GPs has increased by almost 50 per cent in two weeks. This image shows a number of influenza virus particles . A total of 3,877 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus have now been . recorded in England and Wales - up on the 2,255 of last year. But the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said that for every reported . case, an estimated 288 were not flagged up, meaning around 1.12 million . people could now have contracted the illness this season. Flu symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, a cough with a sore throat, and aching muscles and joints. If you are otherwise healthy and are suffering from flu, you should stay at home, rest, drink plenty of fluids and take pain relievers such as paracetamol. Children under 16 should not take any medication containing aspirin.","Number of people visiting their GP has risen by 50 per cent in two weeks .

Thousands of people at risk of losing their sight from a diabetes-related condition could benefit from a new drug approved for NHS use. The rationing body Nice has finally given the go ahead for Lucentis after the makers dropped the price. The drug treats diabetic macular oedema (DMO), which affects around 50,000 Britons causing problems with reading, driving and recognising faces. Lucentis treats diabetic macular oedema (DMO), which affects around 50,000 Britons eyesight causing problems with reading, driving and recognising faces . This offers fresh hope for people with a serious and common complication of diabetes. Currently laser treatment is used to stabilise the condition which if left untreated causes 30 per cent of patients to go blind. Clinical trials show Lucentis, given as an injection in the eye, is the first treatment that can help reverse vision loss for some patients. But the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) last year said the drug was not ‘a good use of NHS resources’ at £750 for each monthly injection. Four UK charities failed in their appeal to stop the proposed ban, but Nice re-visited the decision after makers Novartis cut the price by an undisclosed amount. Nice tried to ban Lucentis before, when it was initially licensed for another cause of blindness called wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, in 2007. It would have meant patients had to go blind in one eye first but Nice was forced into a U-turn after thousands of protests. Lucentis is one of the most costly drugs for the NHS, which spent £130 million on the treatment in 2010, although patient access scheme for AMD patients capped the cost at £10,400 for 14 injections or more. Complication: DMO, which affects around 50,000 Britons is related to diabetes . However, consultant ophthalmologist Ben Burton, from the James Paget University Hospital, Great Yarmouth, said the drug was one of the great breakthroughs in eye disease. He said ‘This has the impact of insulin, penicillin or steroids in our field. It prevents loss of vision and means older people at risk retain the ability to drive a car, and live independent lives. ‘Up until now, most patients could only receive laser treatment on the NHS, which usually just stops their vision worsening but does not necessarily improve it.’ The drug is more effective than laser treatment, although that will still be used for some patients, he added. Steve Winyard, head of policy and campaigns at the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), one of the charities which appealed against the proposed ban, said at least 5,000 new diabetic patients a year could be eligible for the drug, which has a better chance of saving their sight than existing treatment.

A little girl who was minutes from death after contracting the killer brain bug meningitis has made a remarkable recovery. A priest was called in to give Amelia Lancaster the last rites and had just started to pray when her body began to stabilise and she pulled through. The infection cut off the blood supply to her limbs, leaving them black. Doctors managed to save her legs but were forced to amputate part of her right hand. Amelia Lancaster shows off her new right hand, with her sister Sophie and parents Simon and Melinda . Doctors said Amelia (pictured in hospital) was only minutes from death before turning the corner . Now, the brave three-year-old has made a full recovery after months of hospital treatment - and has learned to walk again and even catch a ball. Her mother Melinda, 26, said: 'That day, Amelia developed a raging temperature and was screwing her eyes up any time she was near light. 'A doctor found a spot the size of a pin-prick on her tummy that wouldn't disappear under pressure. Then a rash appeared all over her body. It all happened so fast. 'She was taken to intensive care and put on a drip but she didn't react. I was absolutely terrified and felt so helpless. 'Doctors told us she didn't have long left so we called a priest and just as he was giving Amelia the blessing, her heart rate dropped. 'Before that day, I'd never been much of a believer in miracles but now I do because my daughter really is a miracle.' Amelia, from Bordon, Hampshire, was just ten months old when she fell ill and had just taken her first steps. Melinda and husband Simon, 24, a vehicle mechanic with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, were initially told it could be chickenpox after calling NHS Direct. But when the little girl was violently sick, they rushed her to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where they were living at the time. Amelia (left) and sister Sophie in hospital after her last operation to straighten her arm . Amelia is learning to use her new prosthetic hand (pictured left). Her parents hope to raise funds to buy her one with more flexibility . There, a doctor did the test for meningitis by rolling a glass over her skin and took a blood test. Melinda, a full time mum, said: 'By now, Amelia was struggling to breathe and her heart rate was sky-high. 'Simon was cradling her in his arms and suddenly said: ""I didn't realise Amelia had a birthmark there."" I knew she didn't and when I opened up her nappy, I saw hundreds of spots. 'The rash quickly spread. That's when I knew it must be meningitis.' Moments later, the test results confirmed everyone's worst fears - Amelia had the most dangerous form of the bug, bacterial meningitis as well as septicaemia. She was immediately rushed to intensive care and put on a life support machine, while doctors battled to save her. Amelia plays catch with her father Simon. Her parents say she is very determined . Melinda said: 'My poor baby was swollen and covered head-to-toe in the rash. It didn't look anything like her. I just sat there and sobbed. 'Then a doctor told us she probably wouldn't make it through the night and asked if we'd had her christened. We already had so I asked the priest to give her the last rites. 'I couldn't believe what happened next - and neither could the doctors.' Amelia after her last operation: Her parents said they were very grateful to the doctors who have treated her . Amelia's heart rate began to drop and by the next day, her body had stabilised. But now she faced an operation to cut open the skin and let the fluid that had built up drain away.Not only had the blood supply to her limbs been cut off but the muscles had died and her bones and ligaments had become infected. The fingers and thumb on Amelia's right hand never recovered and they had to be removed. Melinda said: 'She's had to learn to adapt to life without her fingers but she doesn't let anything stand in her way. 'It took her a year to walk again. She's a very determined little girl. 'She's got a prosthetic hand but it's just a basic one. She recently had an operation to straighten her arm which has meant she can now use it a lot better. 'Watching her play catch with her one-year-old sister, Sophie is something I never thought I'd see. We're so proud of her and what she's achieved. 'Simon and I are so grateful to the hospital and doctors who treated her. They worked extremely quickly and because they were so tuned in to what was happening they did manage to save her legs with the fasciotomy surgery. 'If it weren't for their amazing care and knowledge we wouldn't have her here today with us.' Amelia will need more operations in the future to straighten her legs and help her walk for longer distances. The warning signs of meningitis and what you should do if you suspect it . Now, her parents are supporting Meningitis Research Foundation and its campaign to raise awareness of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia. Melinda and Simon are also trying to raise money to buy Amelia a fully functioning hand to allow her to be more independent because the NHS won't pay for one until she is older. Chris Head, Chief Executive of Meningitis Research Foundation said: 'Meningitis and septicaemia affects around 3,600 people in the UK and Ireland annually. 'They are deadly diseases that can strike anyone without warning, killing one in ten, and leaving a quarter of survivors with life altering after-effects ranging from deafness and brain damage to loss of limbs.'For more information about meningitis symptoms, visit www.meningitis.org .","Amelia began to recover from meningitis as she was receiving last rites .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 03:15 EST, 13 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:48 EST, 13 December 2012 . Protestors have taken to the streets of Argentina after three judges cleared 13 people accused of kidnapping a woman and forcing her into prostitution amid claims of corruption. Political leaders have called for the judges to be impeached following yesterday's ruling in the case of missing Maria de los Angeles 'Marita' Veron. The outcome is a setback for Argentina's efforts to combat sex trafficking, which began largely as a result of Susana Trimarco's one-woman, decade-long quest to find her missing daughter. Trimarco's search exposed an underworld of organized crime figures who operate brothels with protection from authorities across Argentina. 'Setback': Susana Trimarco holds a picture of her missing daughter Marita Veron at her home in Argentina . Security Minister Nilda Garre called the verdict 'a tremendous slap in the face for the prospect of justice'. 'It's not only a reversal for this particular case of the kidnapping and disappearance of Marita Veron, that made society feel deeply the drama of this kind of 21st century slavery, covered up for decades by the customs of a network of machista culture,' she said. It also 'renders invisible the suffering of the victims of human-trafficking networks and sexual exploitation, who gave such courageous testimony during the trial, and consecrates judicial impunity for these crimes', Garre said. Other officials also rallied around Veron's mother, denouncing the verdicts and praising government efforts to save women from prostitution. 'Today, more than ever, we stand united with Susana and her family in their quest to find Marita and we honor the courageous work she has done to defend the victims and the survivors of human trafficking in Argentina and all over the world,' U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Ana Duque-Higgins said. President Cristina Fernandez personally called Trimarco to express her surprise and outrage. 'I thought I would find her destroyed, but I found her more together than ever, more committed to keep fighting,' Fernandez said. 'I told her, ""Susana you can always count on me,"" and she told me ""President, don't worry, I'm going to keep fighting"".' Fernandez also said that while she can't prove it, she's sure that judicial corruption influenced the verdicts, showing the need to reform how judges are picked and allowed to remain in their jobs. Political rivals have called this campaign an attack on judicial independence. Justice: Marita Veron's mother Susana is seen leading a march towards the courthouse in San Miguel de Tucuman on the first day of the trial of the alleged kidnappers back in February . Trimarco's lawyers said the verdict shows that impunity still reigns, and they said they would pursue appeals. 'The reality is that the police are not investigating Marita's disappearance. It's Susana Trimarco who is investigating and it's been this way from the beginning,' attorney Carlos Garmendia told The Associated Press. 'The Marita case is emblematic. As a result, much was learned about trafficking networks, how they move (people), how they operate,' he said. When Veron disappeared a decade ago, sexual exploitation and human trafficking got much less attention around the world, let alone in northwestern Argentina, where she was allegedly kept as a sex slave by an organized crime ring with close ties to authorities in the provinces of Tucuman and La Rioja. Fighting: Ms Trimarco has vowed to keep fighting for justice for her daughter . Much of the case was built years later, as Trimarco's efforts produced witnesses who said they suffered alongside Veron in the brothels. One said she saw Veron being beaten; another said she saw her being held captive to provide sex to VIP clients. Andrea D., one of these women, testified that she had seen Veron with her hair dyed blonde wearing blue-tinted contacts at a brothel in La Rioja. She said she had been kidnapped at gunpoint and forced into prostitution by the same organized crime ring, and testified that some of the accused said Marita had been sold off to brothels in Spain. Defence lawyers dismissed the women's testimony as the lies of unreliable witnesses, and the lack of any physical evidence linking the defendants to Veron proved decisive, the judges said in a brief explanation from the bench. A fuller written justification for their verdicts is expected to be made public in several weeks. 'It's obvious that this process made mistakes,' Garmendia acknowledged. 'Above all, this ruling is a message that the trafficking business will continue as usual.' Simultaneous demonstrations were held in Buenos Aires on Wednesday night to protest the verdicts. One led by governing party politicians outside the main federal justice building was peaceful. Another, involving hooded youths outside the Tucuman provincial government's tourism promotion office, quickly got out of hand with protesters smashing windows, throwing rocks and setting fire to two garbage bins they tried to push inside the building. Reinforcements arrived and riot police pushed back the protesters, regaining control of the situation. Trimarco called on her supporters to keep the peace, even as she expressed her anger at a news conference Wednesday, accusing the judges of taking bribes. The lead trial judge, Alberto Piedrabuena, didn't respond to the bribery allegations, but he countered in a local radio interview that the evidence failed to resolve reasonable doubts or overcome the principle of being innocent until proven guilty. Memories: Marita Veron (left) poses with her daughter Micaela (centre) and her mother Susana (right) in 2002 . Prostitution remains legal in Argentina, but managing brothels and trafficking in people have been federal crimes since 2008, under a law Congress passed after lobbying by Trimarco. Garre credited her ministry's enforcement of this law with saving 938 people last year from trafficking - 215 people from the sex trade and 723 from other workplace exploitation. She said more than 800 have been rescued so far this year. Hundreds of women also have been saved by a foundation Trimarco created in her daughter's name in 2008 with seed money from the U.S. State Department's 'Women of Courage' award. The foundation also provides legal help, but its lawyers have found that proving sex slavery is difficult without full support from the same police who often get paid to protect prostitution rings. To date, the foundation has helped 20 former sex-trafficking victims bring cases against their captors, but they have yet to win a single case. Of these, 12 resulted in federal charges, but a handful were bounced back to even more uncertain justice in provincial courts around Argentina. 'They don't investigate. There's a lack of commitment and capability,' said Agustin Araoz Teran, one of the foundation's lawyers, who called the Tuesday night's verdicts 'an act of cowardice'. Teran joined Trimarco's movement after his father, a juvenile court judge in Tucuman, was shot to death in his home in 2004 after investigating local police officers who were allegedly freeing juvenile delinquents so that they could peddle drugs on their (the police's) behalf.","Acquittal of 13 people over disappearance of Maria de los Angeles 'Marita' Veron in Argentina has sparked outrage across the country .

A senior detective close to a phone-hacking probe tried to sell information to the News of the World including claims that former deputy prime minister John Prescott had been 'interfering' with the investigation, jurors were told today. Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, is accused of offering the now-defunct tabloid information about Operation Varec, the investigation into whether Scotland Yard’s inquiry into phone hacking should be reopened. She is accused of one count of misconduct in public office on September 11, 2010, which she denies. On trial: Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn (left) has been accused of trying to sell information to the News of the World about a Met Police phone-hacking probe, including claims that former deputy prime minister John Prescott (right) was 'interfering' with the investigation . At that time, she was working in counter terrorism, managing the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit. Today Southwark Crown Court was told that one of her team had been asked to carry out financial investigations as part of the Scotland Yard probe into phone hacking. It is alleged that she rang the news desk of the tabloid at 7.51am that Saturday morning to offer information in exchange for payment. The court heard that the call was taken by a journalist called Tim Wood, who was then a news editor for the NotW. He said the caller refused to give her name, but introduced herself as a senior police officer. Mr Wood told the jury: 'The one thing that stands out in my mind is the fact that she kept going on about Lord Prescott. 'Her . saying that he was pressing for them to put charges on the News of the . World, and she was saying that she felt it was wrong that he was . interfering in the scandal, so to speak, and she resented that.' Claims: Casburn allegedly also told the news editor of the News of the World that six people were under investigation including former NotW editor Andy Coulson (left) and reporter Sean Hoare (right) He added: 'She was almost justifying her call by saying that it was this interference by Prescott that had upset her.' Mr . Wood sent an email to news editor Ian Edmondson and crime journalist . Lucy Panton after the call to say that a police officer wanted 'to sell . inside information' on the phone-hacking inquiry. Casburn . told him that six people were under investigation including former NotW . editor Andy Coulson and reporter Sean Hoare, Mr Wood said. She also mentioned that 'counter-terrorism assets' were being used in the probe, which was 'highly unusual'. Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron said: . 'The prosecution says she sought to undermine a highly sensitive and . high-profile investigation at the point of its launch. 'The . prosecution say, and it’s a matter for you 12, that the act of . telephoning the News of the World to offer to sell information and the . provision of some information during that call was misconduct, it was . misconduct in public office. 'It . was a gross breach of the trust that the public places in a police . officer not to disclose information on a current investigation in an . unauthorised way, or to offer to do so in the future for payment.' Charged: Casburn, 53, is accused of offering the now-defunct tabloid information about Operation Varec, the investigation into whether Scotland Yard’s inquiry into phone hacking should be reopened . The newspaper did not publish anything and no payment changed hands, the court heard. The . court then heard from Detective Superintendent Christos Kalamatianos . who led the 60-strong National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit. He . said that his relationship with Casburn was 'cordial', but on one or . two occasions she had accused him of failing to support her and the . unit. Later, Casburn sobbed in the dock as a colleague gave evidence against her. The . 53-year-old was seen taking her glasses off so she could dab her eyes . with tissue as she listened to Detective Superintendent Christos . Kalamatianous talk about the terror unit she used to run at Scotland . Yard. Mr Justice Fulford . paused proceedings at Southwark Crown Court after noticing Casburn, who . has been suspended from the force, was 'distressed.' Accused: It is alleged Casburn rang the news desk of the tabloid at its offices in Wapping (above) at 7.51am one Saturday morning to offer information in exchange for payment . Det Supt Kalamatianous said Casburn, who he line managed, said on occasion she felt unsupported by him and the unit, but that they always seemed to resolve matters. Previously the court heard she felt . bullied at work and was going through a divorce and failed adoption . proceedings at the time she made the call on September 11, 2010. He said: 'I believe I was managing her sensitively, I don't know that I was managing her well.' Casburn had no desk for some time, jurors were told, despite more junior officers having them. However Mr Kalamatianos said his relationship with her was not hostile and he supported her application for promotion. Detective Chief Superintendent Dean Haydon, who led Operation Varec in September 2010, told the court how the investigation was set up following allegations linked to phone hacking made in an article in the New York Times. He said he was initially following seven lines of inquiry: the editor of the New York Times and the journalist who wrote the article, and six former journalists, Coulson, Hoare, Sharon Marshall, Brendan Montague, Ross Hall and Paul McMullan. An investigator from Casburn's unit was asked to check financial records for the six to make sure officers had the correct address for each of them. They were also asked to look at whether Mr Hoare received payment for the New York Times article, although this line of inquiry was discontinued. Mr Haydon said the work for the investigator would have been 'minimal' and he would have been 'very surprised' had Casburn raised concerns about resources. When asked in cross-examination whether the counter-terrorism unit was investigating 'active plots' at the time, he said: 'There are always active investigations being led by the command into terrorism-related activity.' He also told jurors that one financial investigator on Operation Varec admitted he had been at a dinner party with a journalist who worked for the Sun, and had discussed phone hacking. The investigator was then removed from the team. Dressed in a navy skirt suit, tights and high heels, Casburn struggled to compose herself in the afternoon of the first day of her trial, which is expected to last four days. Casburn, from Hatfield Peverel, Essex, admits making the phone call, but denies asking for money, and says she had reasonable excuse. She says she was concerned that resources that were supposed to be used to combat terrorism were being allocated to the phone hacking investigation and that much of the information was already public knowledge. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","DCI April Casburn, 53, accused of trying to sell information to tabloid .

A wartime refugee has revealed how he was hired by the British secret service to eavesdrop on Nazi prisoners of war talking to each other in their cells. Jewish Fritz Lustig, 93, has told for the first time how he listened to German prisoners captured by British troops discussing their involvement in the Holocaust and other atrocities during World War II. He was one of hundreds of refugees who fled to the UK from Germany and was hired by British intelligence to spy on prisoners because of they were bilingual. Mr Lustig described how he and other refugees worked shifts to listen in on captives chatting in their cells at three prisoners of war houses around the country. Mr Lustig told the Evening Standard: 'The prisoners never saw us and we never saw them. As soon as we noticed that something important was being discussed we cut a record. The records we kept of atrocities were given a special marking in red. 'We knew these things were happening. I was fortunate because all my closest family had got out of Germany.' The evidence gathered by the refugees was not used in the Nuremberg trials however, because of fears that the methods used might have contravened the Geneva Convention. All those hired had to sign the Official Secrets Act meaning they could not publicly discuss what they were doing or any of the information they heard. Listening post: The spies listened in to conservations between German PoWs held at three country houses - including Trent Park in Enfield . The story of the Nazi eavesdroppers has been unveiled in a new book called The M Room: Secret Listeners Who Bugged The Nazis by Historian Helen Fry. The honorary UCL research fellow trawled through 100,000 documents at the National Archives in Kew to dig out some of the transcripts recorded. She told the newspaper one of the most horrifying pieces of evidence she found was General Dietrich von Choltitz - the former military governor of Paris. He reportedly said: 'The worst job I ever carried out - which however I carried out with great consistency - was the liquidation of the Jews.' He then went on to describe how they were lined up in pit in the woods and shot and children were thrown in. The revelations give a new insight into the tactics used by the British during the Second World War and the thoughts of the German officers who were involved in the Holocaust. Evidence: The German PoWs spoke of their involvement in the Holocaust and atrocities at concentration camps such as Auschwitz, pictured above .","Jewish Fritz Lustig, 93, fled Germany to the UK during World War II .

Caught off the country's northeastern coast, the 222kg (489lb) tuna was sold at the first auction of the year at Tokyo's sprawling Tsukiji fish market, said market official Ryoji Yagi. That means the price for this year's whopper works out at a stunning £2,230 per pound. Scroll down for video . This bluefin tuna sold for a record £1.09million at a Tokyo auction today, nearly three times the previous high set last year . The winning bidder, Kiyoshi Kimura (centre), president of Kiyomura Co., operates the Sushi-Zanmai restaurant chain . The expensive catch is being served to Kimura's customers this evening . The news comes as environmentalists warn that . stocks of the majestic, speedy fish are being depleted worldwide amid . strong demand for sushi. Japanese eat 80 per cent of the bluefin tuna caught worldwide, and much the global catch is shipped there for consumption. The winning bidder, Kiyoshi Kimura, president of Kiyomura Co., which operates the Sushi-Zanmai restaurant chain, said 'the price was a bit high' but that he wanted to 'encourage Japan', according to Kyodo News agency. The massive catch is being served to his customers this evening. Kimura also set the old record of £430,000 for a bluefin tuna at last year's New Year's auction, which tends to attract high bids as a celebratory way to kick off the new year - or get some publicity. But the high prices don't necessarily reflect exceptionally high fish quality. Stocks of all three bluefin species - the Pacific, Southern and Atlantic - have fallen over the past 15 years amid overfishing. The price for this year's whopper works out at a stunning £2,230 per pound - but the high price doesn't necessarily reflect exceptionally high fish quality . Stocks of all three bluefin species - the Pacific, Southern and Atlantic - have fallen over the past 15 years amid overfishing . The bluefin tuna is one of the largest and fastest fish in the world. On average, it measures 6.5ft in length and weighs 550lb, although much larger specimens are not uncommon. Its torpedo-shaped, streamlined body is built for speed and endurance. In appearance, they are metallic blue on top and silver-white on the bottom which helps camouflage them from above and below. Bluefin meat is considered a delicacy and overfishing has driven their numbers to critically low levels. It has been eaten by humans for centuries and today the Japanese eat 80 per cent of the Atlantic and Pacific bluefins caught. On Monday, an intergovernmental group is to release data on Pacific Bluefin stocks that environmentalists believe will likely show an alarming decline. 'Everything we're hearing is that there's no good news for the Pacific Bluefin,' said Amanda Nickson, director of the Washington-based Pew Environmental Group's global tuna conservation campaign. 'We're seeing a very high value fish continue to be overfished.' The population of another species, the Southern Bluefin, which swims in the southern Pacific, has plunged to 3 to 8 per cent of its original levels. Stocks of bluefin caught in the Atlantic and Mediterranean plunged by 60 per cent between 1997 and 2007 due to rampant, often illegal, overfishing and lax quotas. Although there has been some improvement in recent years, experts say the outlook for the species is still fragile. In November, the 48 member nations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, or ICCAT, voted to maintain strict catch limits on the species, although some countries argued for higher limits. The quota will be allowed to rise slightly from 12,900 metric tons a year to 13,500. The fish's tender pink and red meat is prized for sushi and sashimi - and the best slices, known as 'o-toro', can sell for £14 (2,000 yen) per piece at upmarket Japanese sushi bars . Quotas were as high as 32,000 tons in 2006. A total catch limit on the Pacific Bluefin has been imposed only recently in the eastern part of the Pacific near the United States and Mexico, but not by the intergovernmental group that oversees the western Pacific, Nickson said. So-called effort limits in place now - restrictions on the number of vessels and days fishing allowed - are not effective, she added, and fisherman also are targeting juvenile populations and spawning grounds. 'This poor species is being hit from every angle,' she said. VIDEO: Record price for bluefin tuna .",The 222kg (489lb) tuna was sold in auction at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market .

Small firms are being frozen out of the £80billion attempt to kick-start lending, the Bank of England warned yesterday. Despite being the backbone of the economy and a major employer, they are not benefiting from the scheme the Bank is running with the Government. The first major analysis into the ‘Funding for Lending’ initiative does show, however, that it has ‘significantly’ increased funding for large firms and homeowners wanting a mortgage. Warning: The Bank of England has said that small firms are being frozen out of the £80billion attempt to kick start lending . But experts yesterday warned it was ‘worrying’ and ‘disappointing’ that small firms are being excluded when they are key to stopping Britain slipping back into recession. The Daily Mail has consistently highlighted the plight of small businesses struggling to get the money to expand, launching our Make the Banks Lend campaign in July 2010. Under the Funding for Lending scheme, banks and building societies can borrow an unlimited amount of money for as little as 0.25 per cent. But they have to maintain or increase their lending levels. They must use the money to lend to those needing funds, including businesses of all sizes, homeowners or first-time  buyers needing a mortgage. But the Bank’s latest ‘credit conditions’ survey, published yesterday, showed how lenders continue to have a separate rule book for small firms. It said: ‘Overall, credit availability to the corporate sector was reported to have increased significantly [between September and December], the first reported rise in availability for a year. ‘This was reflected in a significant increase in availability for medium-sized firms, an increase in availability for large firms and a slight increase for small firms.’ The problem will continue, the Bank went on to warn. It stated: ‘Looking ahead to January–March 2013, lenders expected a further increase in credit availability to the  corporate sector as a whole. ‘This mainly reflected an increase in credit availability for large and medium-sized firms.’ Chuka Umunna, the Shadow Business Secretary, expressed dismay at the report . To make matters worse, it said, interest rates, fees and commission charged by banks are not falling for small firms although they are for medium and large firms. Chuka Umunna, the Shadow Business Secretary, expressed dismay at the report. ‘We need to ensure that entrepreneurs, those taking risks and creating jobs and growth, receive all the support they need, so that small businesses can grow, take on employees and drive growth,’ he said. ‘It is disappointing the Bank of England’s survey finds that small firms are still paying over the odds to access finance.’ Howard Archer, chief UK economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: ‘It is slightly worrying that it is the smaller companies that appear to be benefiting the least from the improving credit situation.’ Stewart Baird, managing partner of Stone Ventures, which invests in small firms, said: ‘Once again, this data confirms that funds are getting through to bigger businesses but not the smaller firms that need them most.’ Last month, Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, declared he was fed up with ‘the chronic lack of lending by the banks to our small businesses’. He said: ‘This is hurting many successful companies and strangling growth. ‘As I go round the country, I am constantly meeting outstanding small businesses desperate to get credit from high-street banks – and  failing to do so. Something needs to be done.’ As well as the Bank lending scheme, the Government is giving money to ‘peer-to-peer lenders’, such as Funding Circle, which allow people to lend directly to firms. A typical business borrows £60,000 from between 300 and 400 investors, who receive an average interest rate of 9.1 per cent.","Bank of England warns that small businesses not benefiting from scheme .

A dog that had been missing for two weeks after running away from a New York home hit hard by Hurricane Sandy was found just in time. Buster, a Rhodesian Ridgeback and German Shepard mix, was on a list to be euthanized in less than 24 hours when his owner Christine O’Donovan, of Belle Harbor, Queens, spotted his photo online. ‘I looked at the photo and knew it was him,’ said O’Donovan, who saw her dog on the city’s Animal Care & Control’s nightly euthanasia list on December 13 and went with her children to bring Buster back home the next morning. Runaway dog: Buster, a Rhodesian Ridgeback and German Shepard mix, ran away from home while workers were assessing damage brought on by Hurricane Sandy . The young and healthy 63-pound mutt had run away from home two weeks earlier while workers were assessing damage brought on by Sandy, the New York Daily News reported. During those weeks, O’Donovan, 42, and her five kids, ages 2 to 12, had been searching their devastated neighborhood for any signs of their missing dog. Without electricity or an Internet connection due to the storm O’Donovan said she was unable to access the AC&C’s lost and found database or go to the shelter to look for Buster, who she had rescued a few months earlier after finding him tied to a pole on Queens Boulevard. Buster was listed on the AC&C’s website as a stray pit bull mix with a medical condition of ‘kennel cough.’ O’Donovan immediately called the shelter to put Buster’s impending euthanasia on hold using the shelter’s automated telephone system. ‘I hoped and prayed that he would be alive when we got there,’ she said. Sure enough he was. ‘He was so happy to see my kids and they were so happy to see him,’ said O’Donovan. In the nick of time: Buster's owner Christine O'Donovan, of Belle Harbor, Queens, spotted his photo online a day before he was to be put down . 'To be destroyed': Buster, in the upper right corner, was first spotted on a nightly list posted on Facebook by the group Urgent Part 2 among others dogs to be euthanized . The mother of five also left the shelter with a brindle pit bull puppy, named Niko, whose owner was dropping him off when she got there. Niko is up for adoption or foster through the animal rescue group Sasha’s Mission, which has an active Facebook page. Buster was among dozens of other domesticated animals from areas hit by Hurricane Sandy to wind up at animal shelters within recent weeks. More than 50 lost dogs and cats that landed at AC&C shelters in neighborhoods impacted by the storm were sent to an ASPCA Emergency Boarding Facility so that their owners could have a better chance of finding them. AC&C spokesperson Richard Gentles said Buster did not slip through the system. ‘The dog was held for eight days without identification. The mandatory stray hold is 72 hours from intake,’ he told the Daily News.

The President said last night that more reforms are needed in college American football, four years after he called for an eight-team play-off system to be introduced. This was to replace a model where the nation’s top teams were paired off in championship games based on polls and computer models. A four-team single-elimination tournament will begin in 2014, reported the Huffington Post. But after being asked if this went far enough  on ESPN Monday Night Football's half-time show, Obama said: ‘Promises made, promises kept. 'This (a college football play-off system) was something I said needed to get done. And this is the kind of change you can believe in. 'But, I'd like to see it actually go to eight. I'll be honest with you.’ Jay Z, who has held multiple fundraisers for the President, even changed his lyrics to take a jab at the President's Republican rival Mitt Romney, rapping: 'I got 99 problems but Mitt ain't one.'

Northeast lawmakers say the money is . urgently needed for victims of one of the worst storms ever to strike . the region. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had warned that the .

The Club For Growth, a conservative . group, on Friday urged lawmakers to oppose the bill, saying that .

'Congress should not allow the . federal government to be involved in the flood insurance industry in the . first place, let alone expand the national flood insurance program's . authority,' the group said in a statement. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., a fiscal . conservative who voted against the flood bill, said he was among those . with concerns about the budget deficit.

Boats and docks damaged by Hurricane Sandy are seen on Staten Island, New York . The current debate over Sandy aid . comes barely a year after Congress and the White House set up a new . system to budget help for victims of hurricanes, tornadoes and floods . before they occur.

The pair looked exhausted but over the moon on the outing, with British actor Hugh taking charge of pushing the little boy in his buggy. Afternoon stroll: Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy looked exhausted but over the moon as they stepped out in New York with their newborn son Cyrus on Sunday . Wrapped up: The two actors shielded themselves from the cold weather in wintery outfits as they took their son, who is less than a week old, out in Manhattan . Both Claire and Hugh wrapped up warm in chilly Manhattan, with Homeland star Claire keeping her post-baby body hidden beneath an olive green padded coat. She finished off her outfit with a grey hat and scarf, while Hugh opted for a checked scarf to match his khaki jacket. The pair were joined by Mamie Gummer, the actress daughter of Meryl Streep and a close friend of the couple's. Three's a crowd? The pair were joined by Mamie Gummer, the actress daughter of Meryl Streep . It is quite fitting that Mamie, who also lives in Manhattan, was one of the first friends to be seen publicly with new baby Cyrus as she was also there when Claire and Hugh met. The three actors all starred in the film Evening, where Hugh played Mamie's younger brother who had an undying love for Claire's character. A representative for Claire confirmed the 33-year-old actress had given birth to Cyrus last Monday. And Claire told People.com that she and her husband are looking forward to 'getting to know our new Dancy' during the holidays. Claire recently told Anderson Cooper that she and Hugh were ecstatic to be expecting three years after their nuptials. Taking charge: British actor Hugh looked more than proficient with his son's buggy, while Claire was happy to let him lead the way . Had enough walking? Mamie joined Claire as she attempted to hail a taxi after their jaunt . 'There's no way of anticipating what that's going to mean for us but we are very excited,' she said. 'We are going to love this person, I know that.' The actress has plenty to celebrate going into the New Year. In addition to the baby, her Showtime drama Homeland is leading the way with four Golden Globe nominations, including a nod to Danes in the best actress category. Danes plays Carrie Mathison, a driven CIA officer who falls for a war hero suspected of being a terrorist. She's expected to now have a little time off, having recently wrapped production of forthcoming comedy drama As Cool as I Am, co-starring James Marsden.

Research: A study by researchers at Fera and the University of Durham suggests a link between the increase in the number of roe deer in the UK and a change in woodland foliage and bird populations . The thriving population of UK roe deer could be damaging the landscape of British woodland, according to a unique new study. Researchers discovered that areas with the most roe deer had the least shrub layer vegetation cover and fewer birds. The study results add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled to protect the environment. A team from the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) and Durham University found that an increase in the population of roe deer is possibly related to a decline in the diversity and cover of shrubs below the main canopy in forest areas. It is the first UK-based study of its kind on a single species of deer. Ecologists have long warned that the continued growth in numbers of wild deer could pose a long term threat to woodland. When presenting their findings at a recent British Ecological Society meeting in Birmingham, researchers said that they feared that if the population continues to grow it could lead to fewer nesting sites for a variety of species of birds and less food sources for other animals. The study was based on 35 woodland field sites from across England in May and June in 2011 and 2012. Georgina Palmer, co-author of the study, told the BBC: 'Much of the recent literature on impacts of deer on their environment has focused on multi-species systems and, there, authors cannot attribute impacts they find on vegetation to one particular species.' Population: The roe deer distribution in the UK in 1972, left, and in 2007, right, shows the extent to which roe deer populations have grown. The red dots indicate the sites where the study took place . Growing numbers: The roe deer, pictured in Scotland in 2011, is native to the UK and one of six species of deer that roam wild across Britain . 'My study is the first in Britain which both looks solely at the roe deer, and within natural environments, ie without the use of deer enclosures where deer densities are artificially managed.' Not only is the burgeoning population of wild deer a threat to UK woodland. The surge in the number of deer is also a hazard for drivers on our roads: . The roe deer, otherwise known as Capreolus capreolus, is a relatively small reddish and grey-brown deer. It is widespread across western Europe. The species has seen a huge increase in numbers throughout the 20th and into the 21st century. The animal was extinct in much of southern England at the start of the 20th century, but numbers have since repopulated. Roe are mainly woodland deer, but in recent years the rise in numbers has led them to colonising more open areas such as rank heather, scrub and agricultural ground. They are herbivores and graze all types of ground vegetation. They also browse shrub layers in a wood, and the growing shoots and leaves of holly and beech trees. Forestry Commission rangers currently humanely manage roe populations. The latest study follows research from September which revealed that woodland without effective management systems aimed at controlling deer are more likely to be damaged by the animal. Wild deer have been roaming Britain for around 6,000 years and it is estimated that there are currently around two million of them. There are six species present in the UK - roe, red, fallow, muntjac, sika and Chinese water deer - with the roe and red native to the UK, the fallow present in Britain's woodlands since around the 11th century and the Muntjac, Sika and Chinese water deer all introduced in recent centuries. Overrun: The study results will add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled each year in order to protect other wildlife . The muntjac deer for example was introduced to Woburn Safari Park but escaped in 1925 leading to the deer's presence in the wild. Experts from the Deer Initiative, an organisation which has been looking at sustainable management of deer since 1995, recommend that around 20 per cent of the wild deer population in the UK should be culled - that's around 400,000 animals. The British Trust for Ornithology warned in 2011 that bird species such as the nightingale and willow tit were in danger of dying out because of the increasing number of wild deer.

Trapped: Marine Jon Hammer has been stuck in a Mexican jail since August, when he was detained on a weapons charge . A surfing trip to Costa Rica has turned into a nightmare for a Marine veteran, who has been thrown into a Mexican where he is regularly shackled to his bed and subjected to death threats. Now, four months after his arrest, his family in South Florida is still fighting to get him back. Jon Hammar and a friend were on their . way to Costa Rica in August and planned to drive across the Mexican . border near Matamoros in a Winnebago filled with surfboards and camping . gear. Hammar, 27, asked U.S. border agents . what to do with an unloaded shotgun, which his family said belonged to . his great-grandfather. 'They examined it, they weighed it, they said you have to fill out this form,' his father, also named Jon, told The Associated Press in a phone interview Tuesday from his home near Miami. But when the pair crossed the border and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and jailed the men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short. Hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to him. The family's attorney said Mexican law prohibits civilians from carrying certain types of guns, like sawed-off shotguns, which can be more easily concealed. Mexican law prohibits shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches. Scroll down for video . Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico . Mom and dad: Hammar's parents Jon and Olivia Hammar, are now fighting for their son's safe return from Mexico . Family attorney Eddie Varon-Levy said Mexican officials measured the barrel on Hammar's shotgun as 24 inches. It has not been sawed off. Family members said the gun was purchased at Sears and blamed U.S. officials for telling Hammar he could bring it across the border in the first place. Varon-Levy also questioned the way Mexican officials measured the gun, because the measurements can differ depending on where they are taken on the barrel. He said dealing with Mexican authorities has also been difficult. He said Hammar was brought to court a few weeks ago, where officials tried to convince him to plead guilty without a lawyer present. Varon-Levy said he didn't show up because he was told there was a continuance. 'I am fuming,' he said. Trip: Hammar and a friend were on their way to Costa Rica in August and planned to drive across the Mexican border in a Winnebago filled with surfboards and camping gear . Hammar could face 12 years in prison, but Varon-Levy said that's unlikely. He wants to get the charges downgraded, hoping Hammar can plead guilty to a lesser charge of carrying an unregistered weapon, which only carries a fine. Hammar served in Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2007. His mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hammar developed PTSD following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet . when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq. He had just completed . treatment for at a center for veterans in California last year, . before getting caught up in his misadventure in Matamoros. Weapon in question: Hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway . Ricardo Alday, spokesman for the Mexican Embassy, said in a statement: 'Mexican authorities have fully guaranteed his right to Consular assistance; therefore Mr Hammar has been in contact with U.S. Consular officers in Mexico who have regularly visited him.' 'The possession of any weapon restricted for the use of the Army in Mexico is a Federal crime, regardless of whether you declare it or not upon entering the country, and must be automatically prosecuted.' Alday said Harmmar was detained in Tamaulipas 'and as any other detainee facing criminal charges he has the right to defense counsel and a fair trial. 'In addition, his life and integrity are protected by national and international laws.' In danger: Hammar is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters . Meanwhile, Hammar is being held in one of the most dangerous areas in Mexico. Matamoros is the long-time headquarters of the Gulf Cartel, which has been engaged in a bloody struggle with its former security guards, the Zetas, since early 2010 for the lucrative drug routes along the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border. An October 2011 fight among inmates at the prison left 20 dead and 12 injured. At first Hammar was held with the general population, filled mostly with members of drug cartels. Now he is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters, according to his father, he speaks with his son by phone occasionally. 'Sometimes he's got his head on good. We're like just, ""Hang in there. We're doing everything we can.""' Other days, it's like, it's not as good,' Jon Hammar said, sighing heavily and struggling to steady his voice. In August, the family received a frightening middle of the night phone call from the cartel demanding money, said Jon Hammar, a 48-year-old software engineer. '""Lady, this isn't about the police. This is our house. We have your son. We're going to kill him if you don't send us money,""' Hammar said, recounting the phone call. The couple planned to wire the money to an account, but officials at the U.S. consulate intervened and contacted prison officials. His son was moved into a private cell the next day, he said. A spokesman for the State Department said officials have visited Hammar three times, spoken with him by phone and contacted prison officials to stop them from chaining him to the bed. 'The safety and well-being of U.S. citizens is something we take very seriously,' said Peter Velasco. U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday, asking Mexican authorities to release Hammar. Jailed: Hammar was taken into custody right after crossing the border from Brownsivlle, Texas, and is now being held at a prison in Matamoros . U.S. Rep Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, said: 'This is just an outrageous case.' She was contacted by Hammar's mother Olivia, who asked the Republican congresswoman for help. She added: 'If the parents had not told me about it, and his friends had not gotten involved, I would say that it was just not possible for someone to be in so much trouble for doing the right thing.' Ros-Lehtinen also urged the State Department to work incessantly to reunite Hammar with his family and said she's disappointed the agency has not told her what efforts have been made. The Miami Republican said she plans to contact the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol about Hammar's arrest. 'The Hammar family has suffered a great deal since their son's unjust incarceration in August and the details they have provided to my office are gripping and a clear abuse of Jon's human rights,' she said in a statement.

Anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee has been returned to his cell in a Guatemalan detention center after he rushed to a hospital over fears that he had suffered a heart attack. McAfee, 67, said that he was suffering from chest pains overnight but didn't think it was a heart attack. A doctor who looked him over him did not think it was a heart attack either, telling the Associated Press that McAfee's heart rhythm and blood pressure were normal and that he appeared to be suffering only from high stress. Scroll down for video . Heart attack: John McAfee was rushed to the hospital after suffering two minor heart attacks and experiencing chest pain all day . McAfee appeared unresponsive as reporters and photographers followed the stretcher into the emergency room. ABC News reported that as medical personnel moved McAfee to a bed and began to remove his clothes, he abruptly spoke up, saying, 'Please, not in front of the press.' Later on Thursday, however, McAfee was escorted back to his jail cell. The software company founder was denied political asylum in Guatemala and his lawyers said they were making a last-ditch effort to keep him from being flown back to Belize for questioning about the killing of a fellow American expatriate. McAfee was moved from an immigration center to a police-run hospital Thursday afternoon after Guatemalan authorities said McAfee's request for asylum had been rejected. They did not explain why. Shortly after the decision was announced, McAfee issued a plea on his blog for the public to petition Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina to let him stay. Condition unknown: McAfee's lawyer said the former tech mogul had been experiencing chest pain all day . 'Please email the President of . Guatemala and beg him to allow the court system to proceed, to determine . my status in Guatemala, and please support the political asylum that I . am asking for,' the post read. McAfee's lawyer vowed to block Guatemalan efforts to remove the entrepreneur. McAfee was not taken to a hospital and posted on his blog during the morning hours. 'I don't think a heart attack prevents one from using one's blog,' said the lawyer, Telesforo Guerra. McAfee was detained by Guatemalan police on Wednesday for illegally sneaking across the border with his 20-year-old girlfriend to escape authorities in Belize. He has said he fears authorities in Belize will kill him if he returns. Hideout: McAfee pictured Thursday in a migrant shelter, where he is detained in Guatemala City . Bombarded: McAfee's lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, enters a migrant shelter, where Guatemalan authorities say McAfee is being detained today . Still, Guatemala's foreign minister, Harold Caballeros, said McAfee's request for asylum had been rejected. Police in Belize want to quiz McAfee as 'a person of interest' in the killing of fellow American Gregory Faull, with whom he had quarreled. But they say he is not a prime suspect in the probe. McAfee says he has been persecuted by Belize's ruling party because he refused to pay it around $2 million. Belize's prime minister denies this and has described McAfee, who made millions from the Internet anti-virus software that bears his name, as 'bonkers.' McAfee later lost much of his fortune and turned to a life of semi-reclusion by the beach. VIDEO: McAfee rushed to hospital after suffering heart attacks . Transfer: McAfee is transferred in an ambulance to the national Police Hospital in Guatemalan City . Prisoner: McAfee had been held at a Guatemalan immigration detainment shelter following his arrest after sneaking into the country . During an exclusive interview with the AP Thursday morning from inside his private room at the center, McAfee said he was refusing to travel to a hospital because he had been using Chinese herbal medicine since suffering a heart attack in 1993. 'Last night I had a little bit of pain, but I am fine this morning,' he said. 'I don't like Western medicine ... if the people around me are kind and compassionate, that's all that matters in life. The people of Guatemala are very kind people, so I have no complaints.' A couple of hours later, an AP reporter returned to McAfee's room and found him changed into a suit but lying on the floor as he was examined by a doctor. Shortly after, he was taken to the police hospital. Belizean police spokesman Raphael Martinez said officials expected McAfee to be flown back to his country's capital. Police want to question him about the fatal shooting of killing of Gregory Viant Faull, who was shot to death in early November on the Belize island where both men lived. Fugitive: McAfee left Belize with his 20-year-old girlfriend Sam Venegas after weeks of hiding out from authorities . Denied: McAfee was arrested this week by Guatemalan authorities and was later denied asylum there . Guerra wants to lodge an injunction against McAfee's arrest and said he should not be moved from the immigration shelter where he is staying until doctors had cleared his health. They had drawn blood and results are expected later on Thursday. After his arrest, McAfee spent the night in a cottage belonging to the immigration department. He passed much of the night reading his blog www.whoismcafee.com and posting his thoughts on a laptop he said was lent to him by the warden. One person asked him if he felt like committing suicide. 'I enjoy living, and suicide is absurdly redundant,' he wrote. 'The world, from the very beginning, hurls viruses, accidents, hungry animals, defective DNA - and uncountable more - in an attempt to kill us. It always succeeds. Suicide is simply aiding and abetting.' McAfee's earlier posts spoke of his relief at arriving in Guatemala, thinking he had found a way out of his troubles. Murdered: American Gregory Faul, 52, was found dead in his home in Belize last month; he and McAfee were neighbors . Grim task: Police officers carry the body of US citizen Gregory Viant Faull following his murder . Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas said on Wednesday the eccentric tech entrepreneur, who loves guns and young women and has tribal tattoos covering his shoulders, would be expelled to Belize within hours. However, an immigration department official later said immediate deportation had been ruled out. On the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived in Belize for about four years, residents and neighbors say he is eccentric and at times unstable. He was seen to travel with armed bodyguards, sporting a pistol tucked into his belt. The predicament of the former Lockheed systems consultant is a far cry from his heyday in the late 1980s, when he started McAfee Associates. McAfee has no relationship now with the company, which was sold to Intel Corp. McAfee was previously charged in Belize with possession of illegal firearms, and police had raided his property on suspicions that he was running a lab to produce illegal synthetic narcotics. He says he has not taken drugs since 1983. '(Before then) I took drugs constantly, 24 hours of the day. I took them for years and years. I was the worst drug abuser on the planet,' he told Reuters before his arrest. 'Then I finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, and that was the end of it.'

He added: 'I also wanted to pay tribute to the extraordinary contribution made by those of you who belong to our Armed Forces, in all sorts of different parts of the world. 'Nowhere is your fortitude and relentless courage more clearly on display than in Afghanistan, where your resilience, patience and determination to see the job through - usually in impossibly difficult conditions and circumstances - is, quite simply, humbling.'

"By . Sarah Johnson . PUBLISHED: . 13:26 EST, 4 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:57 EST, 4 January 2013 . Most of the new pieces of gold and silver unearthed in the field where the Staffordshire Hoard was found three years ago has been declared treasure trove. The 81 items, which date back to the 7th century, will now be handed to the British Museum’s valuation committee, which will value them, an inquest in Stafford was told. Staffordshire County Council will then be charged with raising the money to buy the new items for the nation. Unearthed: Most of a collection of new items, including this helmet, has been declared treasure trove. Around 90 new pieces of gold and silver were found near where the Staffordshire Hoard was found in 2009 . Eighty-one of the items were declared treasure trove. They include part of a helmet, an eagle and a cross. If the money is raised, the pieces are likely to be displayed in museums alongside the original Staffordshire Hoard, which was found in a field near Lichfield in 2009 by metal detectorist Terry Herbert. Mr Herbert and landowner and local farmer Fred Johnson will divide any proceeds from the sale of the new find in the same way they did with the original hoard. The second haul was discovered by a team from Archaeology Warwickshire. But Mr Herbert and Mr Johnson will benefit because they were were behind the original discovery, the coroner said. The original hoard, which contained 3,900 items, was bought for £3.3 million with the help of public donations and has since been seen by tens of thousands of people. Original find: This strip of gold bearing a Latin biblical inscription was part of the original Staffordshire Hoard found in 2009 by Terry Herbert . The new find is only expected to cost a fraction of that figure. Evidence was given in the coroner’s court by Dr Kevin Leahy, an archaeological finds specialist who catalogued the original hoard and the new items, and principal archaeologist for Staffordshire Stephen Dean. Mr Dean said the new finds were ‘closely related’ to the original contents of the Staffordshire Hoard. He said: ‘It all fits very tightly with the Staffordshire Hoard.' He described how a team of archaeologists returned to the field in November last year and in two phases recovered the pieces from the ground, including gold and silver items, hilt rivets and pommel caps from swords and small fragments of metal discs, made of either copper alloy or base silver. The most interesting finds included an eagle mount - whose use is not known - and a cheek piece from a helmet. If enough money is raised, the new discoveries will go on display in museums with the original Staffordhire Hoard (pictured) Mr Haigh asked Mr Dean why these pieces had not been found with the main hoard three years earlier. He said: ‘It is thought a lot of ploughing has brought material up, but I think we are now in the diminishing returns. ‘In 2009, we uncovered 3,900 items and now this time 90 items - I believe we have now recovered everything in the topsoil.’ Dr Leahy agreed there was little chance of any more finds coming from the field. He was asked to comment on three items which were eventually ruled not be treasure, because they were all found some distance from the Staffordshire Hoard site. Dr Leahy said one of those pieces - a metal fragment with a stylised design - was similar to a piece found at the Sutton Hoo excavation in Suffolk and was of ‘high status’. Dr Leahy said that the finds had ‘roused the public’s interest’ in a period of history which had until recently been considered the Dark Ages. The discovery, circled in red, was made in the same field where the Staffordshire Hoard, the largest collection of Anglo Saxon treasure was recovered in 2009 . He said: ‘This is a period which runs for twice that of the Roman period, and which shows Anglo-Saxons were highly cultured.' Some of the gold in the pieces from the original Staffordshire Hoard could be traced to Istanbul in modern-day Turkey, and the gems to India and Eastern Europe, showing the Anglo-Saxons to be accomplished traders. At the end of the hearing, Mr Haigh ruled 10 of the total of 91 items discovered in phased investigations starting on November 19, 2012, were not to be considered treasure because they were modern ‘waste’ material. These items will all be returned to the owner and finder. Mr Haigh concluded: ‘The Staffordshire Hoard was a magnificent find and I very much hope these items can be saved for the nation and added to the hoard.’ Philip Atkins, Staffordshire County Council leader, said the council together with the owners of the original hoard, Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham City Councils, would now have to look at raising money to buy the new items. He said: ‘I am hopeful the public will step in as they did previously. ‘We did have to raise £3.3 million in 12 weeks last time, and on that occasion the public came forward with nearly £1 million. ‘I think there will be the same hunger this time around.’","Eighty-one pieces dating back to 7th century unearthed at the same site .

"By . Steve Nolan . UPDATED: . 09:01 EST, 28 December 2012 . It was one of the most memorable moments of legendary wildlife presenter Sir David Attenborough's Frozen Planet series. But scenes which apparently showed a polar bear giving birth in the wild saw the BBC accused of fakery by furious viewers after it was revealed that the footage had in fact been shot in a Dutch zoo. And little more than a year on the Corporation seems keen to avoid making a similar mistake again. Sir David will explicitly make it clear to viewers when footage from his forthcoming Africa series has not been filmed in the wild in order to 'maintain trust and credibility', say BBC producers. Wild thing: Sir David Attenborough goes nose to nose with a young rhino in his new BBC2 series Africa. He will explicitly explain to viewers when 'controlled filming' is used after a fakery row . Battle: Ivory flies as two African elephant bulls charge in head-to-head combat in a scene from Sir David Attenborough's new series Afirica . New life: One of the most memorable scenes of the Africa series sees a baby green turtle hatching from an egg . The new BBC2 series, which includes scenes which show how the shoebill bird deliberately lets its youngest chick die by depriving it of food, will see warnings that 'controlled filming' has been used included in Sir David's commentary. Series producer James Honeybourne told the Radio Times: 'Because of the reactions to the polar bears being filmed for Frozen Planet it was appropriate to be more explicit... we feel it is important to maintain trust and credibility with the audience. 'What's important to us is to be able to share great moments of animal nature, and some controlled filming allows us to do that. He added: 'We know that the audience wants to know, and we don't have a problem with it. We're not embarrassed about it, we're absolutely proud of it.' Up close and personal: One episode of the Africa series was shot in the Kalahari desert and shows this family of meerkats basking in the early morning sun, before heading off for breakfast . Stunning: A family of elephants cross the parched plains of Amboseli in the Africa series. This iconic location, in the shadow of Kilmanjaro, was hit hard by three consecutive years of drought, with tragic consequences for its famous elephants . Africa explores some of the lesser-known stories of the continent's wildlife and features the shoebill, which hatches two eggs and deprives the younger one of food and drink. Crews spent four weeks trying to find a shoebill nest and then had to drag canoes full of camera equipment through a swamp for two days to complete the filming. Mr Honeybourne added that the scenes featuring the youngest chick being starved have never been witnessed in such detail before. The scenes that saw the BBC at the centre of the fakery controversy last year from episode five of its £16million Frozen Planet series featured the tiny polar bears mewling and nuzzling for milk from their mother. Popular spot: A bubbling spring creates a precious waterhole in the arid Etosia salt pan drawing animals of every kind from miles around . Newborn: A clutch of Ostrich chicks, just a few days old, rush to keep up with their parents as they cross the desert scrub. The birds will be featured in an episode of Africa . Eight million viewers believed that the scenes were shot by cameramen who had endured sub zero temperatures in an underground cave in the arctic wilderness. The scenes, however, had been shot in a mocked up cave made of plaster and wood and in a zoo enclusure in Holland. It was not the first time that Sir David's shows were the target of fakery accusations. In 1997, in the most memorable scene of Polar Bear, Arctic Warrior, a mother bear was filmed giving birth to and snuggling with her newborn cub. Viewers were led to believe the scene took place in the Arctic. In fact, it was filmed in a zoo in Frankfurt, Germany.

The BBC found itself at the centre of fakery accusations following the episode . Preparing for the new arrivals: The fake nest being built in a Dutch zoo, ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs . Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth . In 2001, Sir David was accused of . using deceptive techniques in Blue Planet when it included a lobster . spawning scene that was filmed in a British aquarium. Viewers were led to believe the scene was taking place off the coast of Nova Scotia. And . in 2008, Sir David was accused of staging a confrontation between . himself and a cobra in a South African desert for the series, Life in . Cold Blood. Sir David's latest series Africa was filmed over four years to produce with crews in the field for 1,500 days gathering footage. They travelled from hidden jungles and icy glaciers to erupting volcanoes to capture their incredible images. Although . some of the scenes may be subject to 'controlled filming' there can be . no doubt that the team that put the series together got up close and . personal with some amazing animals. As . well as the shoebill, Africa also features scenes showing a baby turtle . hatching on a beach on Comoros Islands off the coast of Mozambique. Those scenes took three weeks to shoot.

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 07:32 EST, 24 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:44 EST, 24 December 2012 . Veteran: David Loman, the last British-based surviving member of the International Brigades which fought against General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, has died . The last known UK-based survivor of a 2,500 strong army of Britons who fought with left-wing forces against General Franco's facists in the Spanish Civil War has died. David Lomon, from Slough, Berkshire, who fought with Republican forces in the bloody civil war which waged from 1936 until 1939, died on Friday aged 94. Former brothers-in-arms in the International Brigade have since described him as a 'classic English gentleman'. He fought in the two-month Battle of Teruel which claimed more than 140,000 lives and was a turning point in Franco's eventual victory. Mr Lomon also fought in the Aragon offensive where the Republican side faced the might of Franco's forces which were bolstered by more than 100,000 extra troops supplied by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Although he was captured in March 1938 and lived off starvation rations while enduring brutal beatings, he survived and was freed in exchange for Italian prisoners-of-war held captive in Britain later the same year. Hackney-born Mr Lomon signed up for the secret International Brigades in secret in 1936 after a clash with Oswald Mosley's facist group the Blackshirts at the Battle of Cable Street. After expressing an initial interest at a London office, the Young Communist league member was tested for his suitability for the Brigade in Paris. He then travelled the Pyrenees, avoiding Franco's border guards late at night and entering Spain to join the battle. Volunteers: Just a handful of the 2,500 British men who volunteered for the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. More than 35,000 people from across the globe volunteered to fight General Franco . Command: English volunteer Fred Copeman, who died in 1983, commands the British Battalion of the XV International Brigade in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. This photo is thought to have been taken in 1937. Mr Lomon was among illustrious company, joining trade union leader Jack Jones and writers George orwell and Laurie Lee among more than 35,000 volunteers from across the globe to sign up to fight against Franco's army. When captured by Franco's men, Mr Lomon was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp at San Pedro de Cardenos near Burgos in northern Spain. Conditions there were crowded and filthy and with food and medical facilities woefully inadequate, most of the camp's captives suffered sickness. Mr Lomon made it out alive, but a fifth of those taken prisoner were not so lucky. After he was freed by Franco's forces, Mr Lomon served in the Second World War in the Royal navy. He eventually returned to Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, and worked in the textile trade. His affinity for the International Brigade didn't end though and he attended various ceremonies including the unveiling of a volunteers' memorial on London's South Bank last spring. Proud: Mr Lomon shows a International Brigade flag he was given at the unveiling of a memorial plaque in March 2011. He fought in the Battle of Terruel and the Aragon offensive as part of the force . Jim Jump, secretary of the International Brigade Trust, paid tribute to Mr Lomon in The Independent. He said: 'He had a conventional life when he returned. He was not the type to boast about what he did. 'He was a lovely man; very polite; a classic English gentleman.' The only known British survivor of the International Brigades to outlive Mr Lomon is Stan Hilton who now lives in Australia. The International Brigade was made up of volunteers from 54 countries. Many signed up to fight because they were alarmed at the thought of another European country succumbing to facism. Pleas from the Spanish Government for help from other European countries when the Germans and Italians decided to back the rebel forces fell on death ears - many were afraid that their involvement would lead to a continent-wide conflict and believed that the best way to avoid that was by keeping the Germans and Italians appeased. But with Spain on its own, bystanders from all over the world signed up to help the Republicans, vetted and enrolled in Frace by a Communist group there. The International Brigade took part in a staunch defence of Madrid after the Government fled to Valencia as rebel forces approached. As they fended off one attempt on the city from the Nationalists in 1937, the Republican fighters lost 25,000 men. The Republicans and International Brigade vowed that they would make Madrid the 'tomb of facism.' Most of the British volunteers who, like Mr Lomon, found themselves in prisoner-of-war camps were captured in February 1937 at the battle of Jarama and in march at the battle of Calaceite. General Franco seen watching the front during the Spanish Civil War . The Spanish Civil War was fought between July 17 1936 and April 1 1939 and saw tens of thousands Spanish Republican and Nationalist soldiers, rebels and civilians killed. The war began after a declaration of opposition from a group of generals of the Spanish Republic Armed Forces against the elected Government of the Second Spanish Republic led by Manuel Azana, voted in just five months previously. The coup was supported by military units in Morrocco, Pamplona, Vallidolid and elsewhere, but units from major cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia were opposed leaving the country divided both in terms of military and politics. The rebels led by General Francisco Franco waged a war of attrition against their opponents and gained the support of Nazi Germany and Italy under dictator Benito Mussolini. The UK's official stance was one of non-intervention, but that didn't stop thousands signing up to fight with the Republican International Brigade. Attrocities were committed by both sides during the bloody war which was eventually won by Franco's nationalist rebels. He went on to rule for 36 years and losing Republican supporters were often persecuted thereafter.","David Lomon died at his home in Slough, Berkshire, on Friday .

Baby drama: Mother Ceri Fiddes with partner Daniel Holley and new baby Jude at home in Somerset. Dr Fiddes, a British maths expert, managed to keep a cool head under pressure after the shock of her car being rammed by burglars escaping her home . A top British maths expert who disturbed thieves  as they attempted to break into her home gave birth after her car was repeatedly rammed by one of the burglars while he was trying to escape. Dr Ceri Fiddes, 33, head of maths at the exclusive Millfield School had been sent back to her Somerset home from hospital in the early stages of labour when she had her traumatic encounter with the thieves. The shock of the incident induced full labour and she gave birth to son Jude later the same evening. The teacher, who is also a head of the British team in International Maths Olympiad competitions was with her groundworker partner Dan Holley when they pulled up at their home in the village of Stoney Stratton, near Shepton Mallett, to find a car on their drive. First time mother Ceri had started having contractions on the evening of December 6 but nurses at Frome hospital told her to go home for a couple of hours because the baby wasn't imminent. She said: 'When we got home it was about 10.30pm and there was a car on the drive with its lights switched off - it was very strange. Dan went out to investigate and there was someone in the driver's seat. 'He told Dan he was lost but when Dan asked him a few more questions he put the car in to reverse.I was still sat in our car which was parked across the driveway. 'When I saw the reversing lights go on I just didn't know what was happening because the car couldn't get past ours. Dan was trying to tell the driver his pregnant partner was in the car but he didn't listen. 'He started repeatedly ramming our car - it was horrendous.' The burglar eventually sped off after Dan was able to move his car out of the way. Content: Baby Jude sleeps in his mother's arms blissfully unaware of the drama that surrounded his birth in Stoney Stratton, near Shepton Mallett, Somerset .

He said he heard someone in the garden but . that they had run off. 'But they had broken in to our shed and taken some tools. Thankfully they didn't get in to the house though. 'By this time a police helicopter was flying overhead and the police had arrived with sniffer dogs at the house. 'They said they'd found the burglar's car abandoned not very far away and were hunting them down. They didn't find them though. 'Within five minutes of getting in the house my waters broke and Dan had to rush me back to hospital at Frome. 'I didn't think I was going to make it.

Plans to allow grands prix and motor races to be held on UK roads are being considered by Government ministers. Towns in Cumbria, Cornwall and Kent have all expressed an interest in holding road races with proposals to scrap laws that require race organisers to get special dispensation from Parliament to hold a event being drawn up. Under the proposals, which will be revealed in a formal consultation, plans for road races would only have to be approved by local authorities. Proposals: Scenes like this could be coming to a street near you with the Government considering changing the law to make it easier to hold races and grands prix on UK streets . Current laws require a suspension of the 1988 Road Traffic Act for a race to be held on a public highway. Speed limits would be legally lifted under the plans. Should the move be agreed, towns and cities in the UK could follow the lead of cities such as Valencia and Monte Carlo which famously hold races on the Formula 1 calendar. Towns in west Wales, Cornwall, Kent, Cumbria and the East Midlands are all understood to have expressed an interest in holding events, with Cheltenham hoping to hold an environmentally friendly race. It is thought that races could generate as much as £40million for local economies over five years, according to a study by Sheffield Hallam University and commissioned by the Motor Sports Association. Established: European cities such as Monte Carlo ad Valencia already famously hold glamorous Formula 1 races on their roads . The UK currently holds its annual Formula 1 race at Silverstone but no such events are currently held on the country's roads. The last major road race held in the UK was the Birmingham Superprix more than 20 years ago. Britain has a long association with motor racing with its first major race held in Bexhill-on-Sea in 1902. The town still recognises its association with the sport with signs on its outskirts that herald it as the 'Home of British Motor Racing'. That event was used to promote the town and it is hoped that the new laws would allow areas to attempt to do the same. Former Road Safety Minister Mike Penning told The Daily Telegraph: 'The public should have the flexibility to decide how they use their roads, in the interests of the local community and local businesses.' The Motor Sports Association say that the events would be fully regulated and insured.","Plans are being drawn up to allow races to be held on UK roads .

Dramatic footage of a polar bear tending her newborn cubs in the flagship BBC show Frozen Planet was filmed in a Dutch zoo using fake snow. In one of the most engaging moments of its Winter episode, the tiny bears are shown mewling at their mother and nuzzling her for milk. Eight million viewers were led to believe the scene had been captured by BBC cameramen inside an  underground cave in the brutal sub-zero temperatures of the Arctic wilderness. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE VIDEO . On thin ice: Sir David Attenborough with an anaesthetised polar bear in Svalbard during episode seven of the hit show Frozen Planet . Preparing for the new arrivals: The fake nest being built in a Dutch zoo, ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs . Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth . But the footage, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, and interspersed with real shots of the Arctic, was in fact filmed in a den made of plaster and wood in a wildlife enclosure. The truth behind the fakery is only revealed in a hard-to-find video among 14 other clips accompanying the Winter episode of the series on the BBC website. John Whittingdale MP, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sports committee, said it was ‘hugely disappointing’ viewers were misled. BBC editorial guidelines on wildlife programmes say that when it is impractical or unsafe to film something in the wild ‘it can be editorially and ethically justified to use captive animals’. The guidelines add: ‘But we must never claim that such sequences were shot in the actual location depicted in the film.’ Mr Whittingdale said: ‘Broadcasters should not seek to give viewers a false impression. If this was not filmed in the wild it would have been much better to have made that clear in the commentary. Moving scene: The pair of two-day-old polar bear cubs shown on the documentary. At this age they weighed less than a kilo, but were filmed in a zoo . The polar bear and cub inside the man-made den fashioned out of wood and covered in fake snow . Faked? What the viewers saw on Frozen Planet turned out not to be filmed in the wild, but in a Netherlands zoo . Mixed: The scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild, which may have misled viewers . Panorama: The BBC apologised in June after it was found ‘likely’ that Panorama had faked scenes of boys said to be working in an Indian sweatshop. Blue Peter: BBC fined £50,000 in June 2007 after a young studio guest posed as a caller when the telephone system failed during a 2006 phone-in. Children in Need: A fictitious winner’s details were broadcast during Children in Need on BBC1 Scotland in November 2005 after no calls came through from the public. A Year With The Queen: BBC apologised to the Queen in 2007 after a trailer wrongly implied that she had stormed out of a sitting with photographer Annie Leibovitz. The Liz Kershaw Show: BBC6 Music found to have repeatedly faked competitions where no prizes existed and that callers had been members of the production team or their friends. ‘It is questionable how many people would . visit the website and find the video clip which explained the . circumstances of the filming.’ The den scenes are featured in episode five of the BBC’s £16million Frozen Planet series. At no point are viewers told they were filmed last Christmas in a den underneath a zoo’s polar bear enclosure. The den was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth of the cubs. Only viewers who visited the  Frozen Planet website and found a video by the producer Kathryn Jeffs would have found the truth. She said it would be impractical to . film the carnivores in the wild, adding: ‘The problem for us is that they . give birth in these dens of ice and there’s absolutely no way we can . get our cameras down there.’ The documentary drew in eight million viewers transfixed by moving scenes of a polar cub being born . This is not the first time Sir David Attenborough has been accused of misleading viewers in his wildlife documentaries. In 1997, in the most memorable scene of Polar Bear, Arctic Warrior, a mother bear was filmed giving birth to and snuggling with her newborn cub. Viewers were led to believe the scene took place in the Arctic. In fact, it was filmed in a zoo in Frankfurt, Germany. In 2001, . Sir David was accused of using deceptive techniques in Blue Planet when . it included a lobster spawning scene that was filmed in a British . aquarium. Viewers were led to believe the scene was taking place off the . coast of Nova Scotia. And in 2008, Sir David was accused of . staging a confrontation between himself and a cobra in a South African . desert for the series, Life in Cold Blood. Sir David, 85, also defended the methods used by Frozen Planet. He said: ‘If you had tried to put a camera in the wild in a polar bear den, she would either have killed the cub or the cameraman.’ He added: ‘It’s not falsehood, and we don’t keep it secret either.’ The BBC said the way the scene had been captured was ‘clearly explained’ on the website. It said it had received only five complaints following the revelations. A spokesman added: ‘This particular sequence would be impossible to film in the wild.’ The series website has been extremely popular with our viewers, who regularly look at it for background information and extra clips from Frozen Planet.

Indianapolis Colts coach Chuck Pagano has been diagnosed with leukemia and is expected to be hospitalized six to eight weeks as he undergoes treatment. He will be replaced on an interim basis by offensive coordinator Bruce Arians. Team owner Jim Irsay made the announcement on Monday during a somber and sometimes emotional news conference at the team complex. Seriously ill: Chuck Pagano is being kept in a 'protected' hospital environment where air is filtered and hand-washing is essential . Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, right, general manager Ryan Grigson, center, and interim head coach Bruce Arians at Monday's press conference . 'I think it's unlikely he'll be all in as the head coach the rest of this season,' Irsay said. 'He may be able to come back and be in the press box or something.' The 51-year-old Pagano is in his first season with the Colts (1-2). He was hired in January after serving as the Baltimore Ravens' defensive coordinator. Dr. Larry Cripe, the physician treating the coach at Indiana University's Simon Cancer Center, said Pagano has acute myeloid leukemia, where the bone marrow is producing abnormal white blood cells that interfere with healthy blood cells. Symptoms can include weakness, weight loss and easy bruising or bleeding. Treatments can include chemotherapy, drugs and radiation therapy. Irsay said Pagano's wife pushed him to see the doctor after noticing unusual bruising on the coach's body. The initial phase of treatment usually requires a hospital stay of four to five weeks, though Irsay later acknowledged he expected Pagano to be in the hospital at least six weeks. Coach Pagano only took over at the Colts in January . Cripe said Pagano began the 'arduous' treatment last week and that many adults do recover from the disease. For now, Pagano is being kept in a 'protected' hospital environment . where air is filtered and hand-washing is essential. Pagano was admitted last Wednesday evening; the team had a bye this weekend and players and the assistants, other than Arians, were not told Pagano was ill until Monday morning. 'This is not an easy day for any of us,' Arians said. 'It was not the way I ever dreamed about addressing a group like this. But I know he'll get through it.' General manager Ryan Grigson said he was not yet certain how the rest of the coaching duties would be split up, though he expected all of the assistants to pitch in. The Colts are starting over this year after a dismal 2-14 season that led to a major staff and player overhaul. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, left, announced that head coach Chuck Pagano has been diagnosed leukemia, while Dr. Larry Cripe, right, is the physician who is treating the coach . Irsay dumped much of his front-office staff, including Bill and Chris Polian, and let four-time NFL MVP Peyton Manning depart to the Broncos in free agency, giving the reins of the team to No. 1 draft pick Andrew Luck. The Colts used 15 new starters, including nine on offense, in the season opener at Chicago. Two of the returning starters, Robert Mathis and Dwight Freeney, were playing different positions. Only 10 players remain from Indy's 2009 AFC championship team and only five were there when the Colts won the Super Bowl after the 2006 season. One of the league's most experienced teams over the past decade started this season as the NFL's ninth-youngest. When Grigson and Pagano were hired, they wanted to build the new-look Colts around a more balanced offensive approach and a more aggressive defense. Luck has looked solid, rallying the Colts for a Week 2 win against Minnesota, and both the defense and special teams have improved.","Chuck Pagano was hospitalized last Wednesday with acute myeloid leukemia .

Dashing the dreams of comic fans across the world, four students from the University of Leicester said that while Batman could glide using his cape as he does in the 2005 film ‘Batman Begins’, his landing would almost certainly prove fatal. The superhero is back in cinemas later this month in ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ and they suggested Batman should go shopping before trying a similar attempt to become airborne over Gotham City. ‘If Batman wanted to survive the flight, he would definitely need a bigger cape,’ said David Marshall, 22, one of the students in the final year of their four-year Master of Physics degree. ‘Or if he preferred to keep his style intact he could opt for using active propulsion, such as jets to keep himself aloft.’ Deadly stunts: To pull off the famous stunt, the Caped Crusader would need a much bigger cape, say a group of British physics students from Leicester - or he should invest in jets to slow his descent .

Steroid-tainted stars Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Sammy Sosa were denied entry to baseball's Hall of Fame, with voters failing to elect any candidates for only the second time in four decades. Bonds received just 36.2 per cent of the vote, Clemens 37.6 and Sosa 12.5 in totals announced Wednesday by the Hall and the Baseball Writers' Association of America. They were appearing on the ballot for the first time and have up to 14 more years to make it to Cooperstown. Cloud of steroids: Barry Bonds received just 36.2 per cent of the vote . Top of the list: From left, Craig Biggio, Jack Morris and Mike Piazza were the top three vote-getters in this year's vote . Craig Biggio, 20th on the career list with 3,060 hits, topped the 37 candidates with 68.2 per cent of the 569 ballots, 39 shy of the 75 per cent needed. Among other first-year eligibles, Mike Piazza received 57.8 per cent and Curt Schilling 38.8. Jack Morris led holdovers with 67.7 per cent. He will make his final ballot appearance next year, when fellow pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine along with slugger Frank Thomas are eligible for the first time. It was the eighth time the BBWAA failed to elect any players. There were four fewer votes than last year and five members submitted blank ballots. 'The standards for earning election to the Hall of Fame have been very high ever since the rules were created in 1936,' Hall of Fame President Jeff Idelson said. 'We realize the challenges voters are faced with in this era. Eighth time's a charm? Mark McGwire, who has admitted to steroid use, failed to make the cut for the seventh time . The Hall of Fame has always entrusted the exclusive voting privilege to the baseball writers. We remain pleased with their role in evaluating candidates based on the criteria we provide.' Bonds, baseball's only seven-time Most Valuable Player, is the sport's season and career home run leader. Clemens, the only seven-time Cy Young Award winner, is third in career strikeouts and ninth in wins. 'It is unimaginable that the best player . to ever play the game would not be a unanimous first-ballot selection,' said Jeff Borris of the Beverly Hills Sports Council, Bonds' longtime . agent. Hall of shame: Roger Clemens, the only seven-time Cy Young Award winner, is third in career strikeouts and ninth in wins - but he's not a hall of famer . Pinstripes: New York Yankees superstars Bernie Williams, left, and Don Mattingly, right, were also in the top 20 . The previous two times the writers . didn't elect a candidate were when Yogi Berra topped the 1971 vote by . appearing on 67 per cent of the ballots cast and when Phil Niekro headed . the 1996 ballot at 68 per cent. Both were chosen the following years when they achieved the 75 per cent necessary for election. Odd man out: Former pitcher Aaron Sele picked up just one Hall of Fame vote . 'Next year, I think you'll have a rather large class and this year, for whatever reasons, you had a couple of guys come really close,' Commissioner Bud Selig said at the owners' meetings in Paradise Valley, Arizona. 'This is not to be voted to make sure that somebody gets in every year. It's to be voted on to make sure that they're deserving. I respect the writers as well as the Hall itself. This idea that this somehow diminishes the Hall of baseball is just ridiculous in my opinion.' Three inductees were chosen last month by the 16-member panel considering individuals from the era before integration in 1946: Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert, umpire Hank O'Day and barehanded catcher Deacon White. They will be enshrined during a ceremony in Cooperstown on July 28. Bonds has denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs and was convicted of one count of obstruction of justice for giving an evasive answer in 2003 to a grand jury investigating PEDs. Clemens was acquitted of perjury charges stemming from congressional testimony during which he denied using PEDs. Sosa, who finished with 609 home runs, was among those who tested positive in MLB's 2003 anonymous survey, The New York Times reported in 2009. He told a congressional committee in 2005 that he never took illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Tainted: Sammy Sosa, who finished with 609 home runs, was among those who tested positive in MLB's 2003 anonymous survey . Retired: Fred McGriff, left, and David Wells, right, rounded out the list of considered candidates . The BBWAA election rules say 'voting shall be based upon the player's record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.' An Associated Press survey of 112 eligible voters conducted in late November after the ballot was announced indicated Bonds, Clemens and Sosa would fall well short of 50 per cent. The big three drew even less support than that as the debate raged over who was Hall worthy. BBWAA president Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle said she didn't vote for Bonds, Clemens or Sosa. 'The evidence for steroid use is too strong,' she said. As for Biggio, 'I'm surprised he didn't get in.' MLB.com's Hal Bodley, the former baseball columnist for USA Today, said Biggio and others paid the price for other players using PEDs. Craig Biggio -- 68.2 per cent . Jack Morris -- 67.7 per cent . Jeff Bagwell -- 59.6 per cent . Mike Piazza -- 57.8 per cent . Tim Raines -- 52.2 per cent . Lee Smith -- 47.8 per cent .

Shawn Green -- 0.4 per cent . Aaron Sele -- 0.2 per cent . 'They got caught in the undertow of the steroids thing,' he said. Bodley said this BBWAA vote was a 'loud and clear' message on the steroids issue. He said he couldn't envision himself voting for stars linked to drugs. 'We've a forgiving society, I know that,' he said. 'But I have too great a passion for the sport.' Mark McGwire, 10th on the career home run list, received 16.9 per cent on his seventh try, down from 19.5 last year. He received 23.7 per cent in 2010 - a vote before he admitted using steroids and human growth hormone. Rafael Palmeiro, among just four players with 500 homers and 3,000 hits along with Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Eddie Murray, received 8.8 per cent in his third try, down from 12.6 per cent last year. Palmeiro received a 10-day suspension in 2005 for a positive test for performance-enhancing drugs, claiming it was due to a vitamin vial given to him by teammate Miguel Tejada. The election leaves the Hall without both baseball's career home run leader and its all-time hits king, Pete Rose. There were four write-in votes for Rose, who never appeared on the ballot because of his lifetime ban that followed an investigation of his gambling while manager of the Cincinnati Reds. Morris increased slightly from his 66.7 per cent last year, when Barry Larkin was elected.

A brave little girl who listened to her favourite Pixie Lott pop songs to help distract her from her cancer treatment has received a huge boost after meeting her idol in person. Pixie fan Bella Restuccia, five, has undergone surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy since being diagnosed with a rare form of muscle cancer in 2011, but her condition had continued to deteriorate in spite of the treatment. Now Bella's condition has begun to improve for the first time, and her thrilled family are putting the change down to a surprise visit from the pop starlet that left the four-year-old 'smiling from ear to ear'. Inspirational: Bella Restuccia, who was 'smiling from ear to ear' after meeting her idol Pixie Lott, is responding to treatment for the first time . 'Meeting Pixie has proved as beneficial as any medicine,' said Bella's mother Hailey Restuccia. 'Bella's smile after she met Pixie was amazing, she was smiling from ear to ear and couldn't quite believe what happened or that she was real. 'It's inspired her so much, and it's amazing that she's responding to treatment for the first time,' the 33-year-old said. 'It's the best news we've had for a long time.' Thrilled: Singer Pixie Lott, 22, with Bella, her mother Hailey (holding Bella), and the little girl's godmother, Liza . Bella, who celebrated her fifth birthday last month, was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma after her parents discovered a lump the size of a 20 pence piece on her chest. Courageous: The five-year-old's family say her condition has finally improved after more than a year of gruelling treatment . The diagnosis in 2011 marked the start of a gruelling journey for the youngster, who has since undergone a host of intensive treatment at Oxford's Churchill Hospital. Despite doctors' efforts Bella's condition continued to deteriorate, prompting her mother to contact charity Rays of Sunshine in a desperate effort to find a welcome distraction for her daughter. The charity organised a meeting with 22-year-old pop star Pixie, and the 'amazing' treat seems to have marked a turning point for Bella and her family, after her condition finally began to improve. 'Bella has always been a Pixie fan and would even be listening to and singing along with her songs while she was undergoing scans,' said her mother. 'But having the chance to meet her has proven inspirational to her,' said the jewellery designer, who added that she and Bella's musician father Roberto 'never' contemplated the possibility that her daughter might not get better. 'Bella has always been positive about her illness and she has been so brave,' she said. 'Throughout all of this, I have always remained positive. I have never contemplated the fact that she would not get better despite the failures of her to respond to the various treatments. 'Sometimes it has been a struggle, but now the prognosis seems to be good.' Bella said after her meeting with the singer: 'Pixie is so pretty just like a real princess. It was so fantastic to meet her.' Idol: Pixie Lott signs her autograph for her brave young fan Bella Restuccia . Pixie Lott herself was so moved by her meeting with Bella she agreed to become an ambassador for Rays of Sunshine, which grants wishes for seriously ill children. The pop star even named a necklace from her new 'Rock 'n' Rose' jewellery collection after her brave young fan. 'Bella's twinkly, smiley face made my day, and I only hope I can help the charity to spread more beautiful smiles,' the singer said.","Bella Restuccia, five, was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of muscle cancer, in 2011 .

A lottery winner who spent part of his winnings on a £100,000 Bentley saw his prized possession written off when he tried to drive through a flooded road. Robert Johnson bought the luxury car after landing a £5million jackpot in 2008, and it was his 'pride and joy' until it was destroyed yesterday morning. But the wealthy businessman insisted he was not overly upset by the loss - and revealed he had already bought a brand-new Mercedes to replace it. The 65-year-old management . consultant, from Hereford, was on his way to a meeting when he became . stuck in flood water in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. He . was driving along a country lane on the outskirts of town when the . black Bentley Continental GT was swamped by three feet of water from a . stream which had burst its banks. An . AA rescue truck soon arrived at the scene, but could not remove the car . as Bentleys can only be towed from the front and Mr Johnson's car was . accessible only from the back. Soon . the flood waters rose so high that the AA truck could not reach the car . at all, and Mr Johnson, a grandfather and father of four, was forced to . abandon it altogether. Mr Johnson won £5million on the lottery in 2008, but decided not to go public with his winnings. And speaking today from his modest . home in Ocle Pychard, a hamlet just outside Hereford, he revealed he had . been quick to replace his expensive car. 'I don't know what all the fuss is about, it's just a flooded Bentley,' he said. 'I've gone out and got a new car. Job done.' Scroll down for video . Destroyed: A lottery winner's £100,000 Bentley Continental GT has been written off after getting stranded in flood water in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire . Damage: The flooding came nearly as far as the steering wheel, destroying the car's interior . Home: Mr Johnson's cottage in Ocle Pychard, a hamlet outside Hereford - visible are his new Mercedes, which he bought to replace the Bentley, and a vintage Land Rover fitted out with a vehicle snorkel . Bernard . Robinson, who has been friends with Mr Johnson for three decades, said the pair had been due to meet on Wednesday morning when Mr Johnson drove into the flood. 'Robert . was on his way to see me for a business meeting when he got stuck,' Mr . Robinson said. 'He rang me and said, ""I can't see you today because I've . wrecked my car in the bloody floods."" 'He's . driven down that road, even when it was flooded, hundreds of times . before. He obviously misjudged how deep it was and when he pressed the . accelerator the wheels just span and the car started to float off. 'Apparently water was gushing through the bottom of the car but he managed to open the door and wade to safety.' Misjudgement: Mr Johnson apparently knew the road well and was over-confident about his chances of getting through . Rescue: Another man was seen retrieving the keys to the Bentley after the driver had abandoned it . Confusion: Mr Johnson might have been misled by the fact that he owns another car which has a snorkel . Mr Robinson added that Mr . Johnson had carried on working after his lottery win, as he has three . ex-wives to support - and claimed that despite his wealth, the businessman . was devastated to see his £100,000 car damaged beyond repair. 'He . is gutted, he loved that car,' Mr Robinson said. 'It was his pride and . joy, and writing off a £100,000 car is not going to put you in the best . of moods. 'I've known him 30 years but he's not the friendliest of people - even after his big win. 'Robert also has a 1940 Land Rover with a snorkel, which he probably thought he was driving when he went through the floods.' Warning: Mr Johnson will be wishing he had heeded the nearby sign pointing out the wet conditions . Wildlife: The floods may be bad news for motorists, but they have been a boon for aquatic birds . Neighbours yesterday described Robert as a 'flash Harry' who would quickly recover from the loss of his car. One said: 'Bob is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. A bit of a wheeler dealer but a smashing bloke. 'He has always worked hard and then he got very lucky with his big lottery win.

"By . Dr Ellie Cannon . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 5 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:03 EST, 5 January 2013 . As a doctor – and also a parent – I was deeply concerned by the controversial case of Neon Roberts, the seven-year-old whose mother Sally refused to allow him to have radiotherapy for his brain tumour. The hospital caring for Neon sought legal backing to give him the treatment against her wishes, and last month the High Court ruled that six weeks of radiotherapy should start early this month, followed by 18 months of chemotherapy. Despite compelling evidence that the alternative approaches she found via the internet were unlikely to work, Ms Roberts remains defiant. Yet I strongly believe the correct decision was made. Neon is now more  likely to survive the cancer. Dilemma: Sally Roberts with her cancer-stricken son Neon . The case has highlighted many misconceptions about parental rights, along with the risks and benefits of cancer treatment. Here, I answer the questions I have been asked most . . . Surely the parent’s wishes ought to be paramount?Actually, no. The patient’s rights are paramount. When there is danger to a child, doctors have to act in their best interests. Some argue that doctors ought to have more power in the treatment of conditions such as measles, but unless there is a life-or-death situation you can’t impose health diktats. Ms Roberts was choosing a route that meant her son was more likely to die. Case lost: After an appeal in London's High Court a judge ruled that Sally Roberts is no longer allowed to refuse treatment for Neon . At what point are doctors acting in more than an advisory capacity?Where doctors believe that parental decisions may be not in a child’s best interests, it can be necessary to seek a view from the courts. Doctors believed Neon would die within months without radiotherapy. I see that Ms Roberts was in a desperate position, but she doesn’t seem able to make a rational decision. There is a five-year survival rate of 86 per cent for patients with medulloblastoma – the type of cancer suffered by Neon – who have radiotherapy. Due to the delays in his treatment, Neon now has an estimated 67 per cent chance of survival. Sally Roberts argued that radiotherapy could do more harm than good. Could she be right?All cancer treatment  is backed up by data based on millions of patients. However, there are no absolutes. It’s all about odds. We know the treatment most likely to work, but not whether it will be successful. Actress Hayley Mills recently spoke about her decision to stop chemotherapy after surgery for breast cancer. Should her cancer return, it is more likely to be terminal because chemotherapy helps to prevent the spread of tumours. A recent Oxford University study involving about 100,000 women concluded that having chemotherapy reduces breast cancer mortality by about a third. Doctor's advice: Such as in the case of Neon, it is what is best for the patient which is paramount, not the parent's wish . But what about the damage radiotherapy could cause?There are undoubtedly risks with radiation, including growth problems and infertility. However, given that medics concluded Neon would die without this treatment, the benefits outweigh the risks. Sally Roberts argued that the only evidence she was offered for the efficacy of radiation was a paper from the Forties. Is this true?There is plenty of research backing up use of radiotherapy in this cancer. It is possible Ms Roberts hasn’t seen this. Children in developed countries have been given radiotherapy for more than half a century. If you compare the cancer survival rates of rich and poor countries, our treatments make a clear difference. What about the other medics advising her? Their opinions have been totally dismissed.None was on the specialist register. One spelt medulloblastoma incorrectly. It makes me so angry that these quacks prey on the vulnerable. None of the alternatives is clinically proven in the treatment of this cancer. If Sally Roberts is considered irresponsible, should Neon be taken away from her?No. She is in an appalling position. My heart goes out to her. She is trying to do the best thing. This doesn’t reflect on her everyday parenting. Follow me on Twitter @Dr_Ellie .","Sally Roberts refused to allow her son radiotherapy .

Around 300,000 people in Britain have homes worth £1million or more, a report revealed yesterday. The number of ‘property millionaires’ has ballooned by almost 50,000 over the past year, fuelled by sharp rises in house prices in London and the South East. While house prices are falling in most regions, particularly the North, around 100 property millionaires were created every day in the capital in 2012. Exclusive: Property millionaires are going through the roof and London's exclusive Kensington district has the most, including these in the expensive Victoria Road . Grand: The £30m flat in W8 has five bedrooms and is in a postcode where two out of three homes are worth more than £1million . And in Wales... £2.5m could buy you this five-bed detached house on the celebrated Gower peninsula near Swansea . Property website Zoopla.co.uk said . there were now 300,142 homes which are valued at £1million or more – the . largest number since it started monitoring the numbers five years ago. Many homeowners bought their property . for a fraction of the current value decades ago and now discover to . their delight it is worth a seven-figure sum. But many others are not so lucky. Their home may be worth more than £1million, but they have a super-size . mortgage which means they have little equity in the property. To qualify as a property millionaire, . your home must be worth more than £1million, but it does not matter . whether or not you have a mortgage. The research highlights the gap between the value of homes in different parts of the country . The majority of ‘property . millionaires’ live in London – nearly two-thirds are in the capital. The . South East is the next big winner, with around 62,000. By comparison, there are just 844 in the whole of Wales. A spokesman for Zoopla.co.uk, whose . shareholders include A&N Media, a division of the Daily Mail and . General Trust, said the research highlights the gulf between the value . of homes in different parts of the country. He said: ‘Wealthier buyers are . relatively impervious to the economic problems affecting the rest of the . market – most notably, when it comes to getting a mortgage. Foreign . buyers, in particular, have gravitated towards top-end property in . London over the past few years, which has pushed up demand and prices.’ The research comes as millions are struggling to pay the mortgage on their home. Around a million people are using a payday loan to help to pay their monthly repayments, a report by the housing charity Shelter warns today. At the other end of the spectrum, . around 7.2million families do not have a mortgage and own their home . outright, according to the Office for National Statistics.
